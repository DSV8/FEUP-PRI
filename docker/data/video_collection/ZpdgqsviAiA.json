    "transcript": "I went to this conference I was a presenter I was on the keynote panel but I also did a workshop and they were like you know can you use NASA as a demo for the reconnaissance and I said sure absolutely no problem and um live at the Kennedy Space Center I found hard-coded credentials of a NASA employee basically on GitHub for anybody to see so if we go through here and we start looking you're gonna have to blur this out but everybody's gonna have to believe me if we scroll down a little bit what is that right there David? WOW! So that's okay that's a bearer token for a nasa.gov server um to log into one of their web applications it's in a credential file so you're gonna have to and it's to an FTP there's also an FTP site referenced here that's that's theirs. So for everyone who's watching I've got a big surprise for you Jason's going to give away two places on his course but you've got to find the link in the video I'll give you a hint towards the end of the video so make sure you watch the content and then you can enter to win one of two places on Jason's course. What a brilliant view hopefully you can see a little bit of what I'm enjoying here in the US just finished a conference in Las Vegas but I really preferred this kind of scene what a brilliant view and I really want to thank our Brilliant sponsor of this video brilliant.org they are not only sponsoring my channel to allow me to create more content which you'll hopefully enjoy but they also have an amazing platform I was introduced to Brilliant by one of my team Dawid who has used brilliant to keep himself up to date with his Computer Science knowledge that he learned at University, Brilliant have a fantastic interactive platform rather than just watching videos or reading a book you can learn interactively with Brilliant use the link below to get a 30-day trial and a 20% discount so go to https://brilliant.org/DavidBombal start your journey today I really want to thank them for supporting me by sponsoring this video but also for the long-term relationship with my channel. Hey everyone David Bombal back with Jason. Jason welcome! Hey everyone how you doing. Jason it's fantastic to have you back we had amazing feedback on our previous video just for everyone who hasn't watched that video I've linked it below Jason was showing us how to hack Tesla but Jason you got to tell us about today's video because I'm really looking forward to this you hacked another big company right? Well I mean uh Public Service Company whatever you want to call it but um but yeah so uh about a few months ago um I went to a conference called Hack Space Con which was held at Kennedy Space Center in Florida which was an amazing experience um you know this is where they they shoot off rockets in Florida here in the states and so um I went to this conference I was a presenter I was on the keynote panel but I also did a workshop and last week we looked or you know a couple weeks ago we looked at um reconnaissance when we're looking at an organization and so I was there and some of the I.T leadership for NASA was there as well and so we went there and they were like you know can you use NASA as a as a demo for the reconnaissance and I said sure absolutely no problem um you know because a lot of times my students when I teach the workshops or something like that they're like can you do my company or whatever so of course big mistake but yeah well yeah so uh so went and uh you know started doing you know a lot of the things that we did last week uncovering what websites they had you know finding out their presence on the internet and found a lot of you know a lot of domains that um that were there's a lot of subdomains and so about halfway through I get to the section that we're going to go through today right we're going to try to finish off reconnaissance today and uh one of the sections that I'm going to cover today is looking at GitHub for elite credentials and um live at the Kennedy Space Center I found hard-coded credentials of a NASA employee basically on GitHub for anybody to see so uh live credentials and so I had to stop the workshop and talk to the IT staff uh and and basically submit that through the Bug Bounty and um and they make sure that they could remediate it and get it taken off of um off of GitHub so uh we're gonna talk about you know that that method and a little bit of uh cred hunting today as well so. And how long did that take you uh as soon as I I started the tool it took me literally like you know 30 to 50 seconds somewhere around there well yeah well yeah yeah I mean the thing about the thing about that technique that we're going to talk about today is just you know there's a million developers that work for any company I mean not a million but anywhere from hundreds to thousands depending on the organization they all have GitHub accounts and sometimes they make mistakes and they accidentally commit their um their bash profiles or a piece of source code that shouldn't be public to their public profile and so finding it can be a really effective way as a red teamer to gain initial access is finding creds that have been linked to GitHub. So now when I do these videos a lot of people complain that perhaps you know we're telling stories right you know it's never going to happen again but you were telling me offline something very interesting about what we're going to cover today right? Yeah yeah absolutely so we'll um we'll go through uh we'll go through it in a couple minutes um so let's let's talk about GitHub real quick right so as a red teamer in in my day-to-day job at Buddobot uh you know we're doing Red Team campaigns we're very focused on external to internal so find ending initial access and a lot of times in our space it is fishing that a lot of people rely on but since I have such a a very high skill set with reconnaissance in Bug Bounty I am very used to having to try to get into an organization from the internet not using phishing basically and so a lot of new school red teams are focusing on finding credentials and things like that but um the first thing I do you know we covered last week if I go over my checklist here on the left you know we found Tesla's IP space, we found some of their acquisitions and we found basically a whole bunch of servers that they had in the cloud that they own right and so we're going to start from the end of where we finished off last week we looked for the cloud stuff and we're gonna we're gonna start with GitHub right and so at this point in my reconnaissance in a red team campaign or a bug bounty hunt I am going to still be looking for the last little bit of subdomains for my target So today we're going to switch to nasa.gov if you are interested in helping the public good you can go to bugcrowd and NASA has a vulnerability disclosure program so if you find anything with NASA some of the stuff I found today I'm going to submit through this and they will have it and so um yeah it's a basically a place where if you find a vulnerability for NASA they'll take it in and thank you and um it's not a paid program but it's definitely for the public good right we want NASA to be secure so. But I mean you you kind of alluded to it I'm just going to emphasize it in this video yeah you gonna show us some credentials that you found obviously we're going to blur it out not make it available on YouTube but uh it's not like this only happened once it's happen again. In fact I have several examples but uh we'll get to them right. So um okay so we're still on the finding websites portion of Recon right uh right here in git subdomains and so what I'm going to talk about today is a tool by um a colleague of mine Gwendal uh Gwen and he makes a tool set that basically is a scraper for GitHub now he makes several tools um if I zoom in here he has a data extractor to find subdomains to find endpoint like all this stuff basically all of his tools are written in Go or Python and they'll go out and scrape GitHub to find all this juicy information for us as hackers but the one we're going to use today at first is we're going to use GitHub subdomains and GitHub subdomains will help us find more sites for an organization like NASA so if I go over here to my console, so I've downloaded and installed GitHub subdomains right here right and um it's a really simple script you just give it -d and your target top level domain so nasa.gov is NASA's top level domain and then what you have to do for GitHub sub domains is you also have to give it some of your GitHub tokens so when you sign up for a GitHub account just as a regular user you get an API token and so that's how it does its search it needs an API token and so I have actually eight tokens referenced in this file right here and then it'll use that to search GitHub and then the last part here is I just want it to give all the output to a text file and so when I run this this is the Syntax for the tool here or GitHub subdomains Dash D and then your Target and then your tokens and then it will run and I've done a previous run because it takes quite a bit of time but it'll run with your tokens and it'll begin to go look at GitHub and find anywhere in source code commits on GitHub where nasa.gov has been referenced so you can see here on this domain was referenced here in this repository and so it'll scrape and spider all of GitHub to give us every reference it can find to nasa.gov servers online and so when you're done you end up with a giant list of extra targets to hack right and again that's the point of Recon the more targets I can find the more chance I have of getting into an organization as a red team or as a bug Bounty Hunter so if you go down to here and I just finish I can go to my output file since this has already ran cool so this is going through GitHub and finding everything and then when this is done I need to put an output file so three.nasa.gov and now we should be able to cat3.nasa.gov and then you just get a list of subdomains it found from at nasa.gov and this is all from GitHub so uh so this is you know Finding uh more assets of NASA more websites of theirs um to hack and you can see there's some duplicates here so using shell scripting I would you know cat and unique this and I think when I finished my big run of nasa.gov there was something like 6 000 reference sites on GitHub um so NASA's NASA is a tremendously large organization um lots of web servers out there on the internet so that is discovering domains from from GitHub right and so the tool we used there was uh Gwendal's uh GitHub subdomains which is here and it's written in Go it's uh pretty fast for what it does so it's probably one of the best tools for this type of enumeration. Jason just remind us from the previous video for people who perhaps haven't watched it you say there's a lot of reasons to get subdomains right so if you can just give us like the 60 second overview of why it's important to get subdomains? Yeah so when you're looking at an organization as a red teaming or a red team or in a Bug Bounty hunt the main website is often where many users go and just you know do their thing right but that organization has anywhere between you know ten to hundreds to thousands of other websites right and they're normally referenced by subdomains and so um we use some analogies last time we were on the show but the more websites I can find as an attacker the more opportunity I have to break into a place like NASA or Tesla or something like that right so the bigger they are the easier it is for for me to get in from you know an internet website or some kind of server that they put online and so that's why we spend so much time finding all of these sites because everyone to me represents an opportunity to hack in um and they're you know some of the ones you know their main website probably very secure right they've probably had penetration tests done before it they do a lot of security analysis of the main website but some of these other websites we're finding these subdomains there they've never been assessed for security they're very under secured maybe people don't even remember that they're on the internet sometimes IT staff create servers and they just go up on the internet and they never get decommissioned or something like that so this is a very common thing when it comes to Red teaming and Bug bounty hunting. So if everyone who's watching I mean Jason spent like I think was an hour and half or so the previous video where we covered this in a lot of details so again have a look at that video if you want more detail sorry Jason I didn't want to take you off your flow. No no worries no worries um so that's finding subdomains with GitHub and GitHub is a really powerful tool for us so um we're gonna get to the the juicy part right now so the next thing I do and it's usually because tools like GitHub subdomains take a little bit of a time to run as I start looking at an organization just using GitHub search and so that's what we're going to talk about now I call it Git analysis it's right here and um I have basically created a small little uh script that I'll take my target and give me some search links for the GitHub just user search and so I'll show you what that looks like right now. So if I go over here I can just I have a small shell script here it's called gitdorks and I just feed it my target so today my target is nasa.gov right and I say no here and then it'll spit out all these links and what it's doing is it's just creating some links for me that I can put into my browser and so the first one is um you have to be logged into GitHub and I can grab this link and it'll search for nasa.gov and the word password and the type code on GitHub search and so if I go to my browser I have that here so zoom out a little bit and I am searching for nasa.gov in quotes and passwords so you don't need my script to do this you can just go log into GitHub search all of GitHub for nasa.gov password and and you'll start to see entries of source code that have nasa.gov somewhere in there and the word password right and so you can scroll down through a lot of this and some of it is very default it's not um if you know it's referencing just the word password right it's not it's not a variable or it's not a you know it's not like any sensitive password right but when you start rolling through a lot of this you can start to get some interesting information so the first thing you can get from this process is legit emails of NASA employees right for a red teamer that's really valuable for me to have legit emails to fish these people right so you can see you know we have some people at nasa.gov here we also like I said get more information about websites that they have on the internet and these are not NASA owned projects these are other people writing code to interact with NASA somehow and so you can they you can see that they're interacting with this server at NASA et cetera et cetera. So I've put password in here and this is exactly what I did at uh hack space con and you know I was just while the tools were running I'm going through this looking for maybe any leaks that a user has done right and so right now on the first page I don't really see anything but one of my other searches is nasa.gov passwd and more often than not passwd is used as a reference for a password variable in code right so it's not it's not just verbatim password the word it's not passwd, so if we go through here and we start looking you're gonna have to blur this out but everybody's gonna have to believe me if we scroll down a little bit what is that right there David? Wow. So that's okay that's a bearer token for a nasa.gov server um to log into one of their web applications it's in a credential file so you're going to have to and it's to an FTP there's also an FTP site referenced here that's that's theirs so we're going to blur this out but you'll have to believe me David you can see the password there correct? I can see it right there yeah yeah. So this happens because obviously this developer has um you know committed you know this file they've ever forgotten that it was you know online or they forgot that their GitHub account was public or they didn't remember they put this notation in this code or something like that or hard coded the password they just don't know about it right it just it just happens and so this happens a lot in Bug Bounty hunting. Now GitHub has done and Microsoft who owns GitHub has done a lot of great work to to notify organizations if passwords are hard-coded in their code but uh it works not as well as I think they would like it to because this isn't an employee who's associated to NASA's own GitHub repository this is a personal repository of like you know mine are yours right where they have interacted with NASA somehow and they had credentials and so if I keep growing down here I think there was actually a couple more that I saw let's see here, here's another beartoken same guy another search that I do in that little thing is credentials right nasa.gov and quotes and then credentials up here so here we're using another keyword so nasa.gov uh space credentials remember you've got to have nasa.gov in quotes So it for searches nasa.gov uh and then credentials and so now if we go through these um let's see if we can find anything here you know usually you have to you know really dig and so that's why I do this while my other stuff is running so I have an opportunity to just look through some source code that's been referenced about them online um okay so tell me what this is here? yeah OAUTH token row. Yep so this is a git_oauth_token so git is they apparently have a source code repository and you can see that the oauth token is for artifactory, artifactory houses uh houses artifacts or you know like libraries or pieces of code that you know I'm guessing that NASA uses and for JPL here so you can see their oauth token wow and their artifactory API Key. So this is real stuff that happens in the real world there's a couple things like verbatim these credentials could be used it depends on if this server is an internal or external server now I'm pretty sure that this one is an external server that I'm looking at right now but it's going to be blurred to everybody but as a red teamer I would take these credentials and just verbatim try to log into the servers with them and see if they were live and still working and everything like that now if they weren't working and it was a username and password I still have the user and the username and password that they disclosed in this thing and so in this piece of source code and so I can try that username and password on different sites of theirs if I can find out what services they use like SAS sites or other login portals for NASA because many people reuse the same password everywhere um so as a red teamer I will use this information to go and try to get initial access in another place if it doesn't work verbatim on the server that's referenced in the source code so that was hacking NASA here with you in under what like a couple minutes I think like. Yeah and it's only because I'm asking questions and we're delaying it I mean it's like I can see how you did this in 60 seconds it's insane. It's not it's not a hard concept right it's it's using you know we we did this for a long time with Google right Google Dorking right and um I don't know if anyone's been on the show before who does a lot of Google Dorking but this is now just the new school. I'm just going to say doyou want Jason to come back and do Google Dorking, you should come back and do that Im' sorry I interrupted you. Yeah no worries. I mean this is GitHub Dorking and so thereare some automated tools to do this but I end up doing um a lot of this analysis for source code I usually end up doing it by hand because I just want to be able to look at the code sometimes I click into these files and I really want to read them to understand what they're doing sometimes they're false positive sometimes these servers aren't online and the cred doesn't work anywhere so it's not a big deal sometimes their usernames and passwords for internal systems sometimes developers just put like a dummy password that actually is not like you know a real password to the system but they wanted to put something in the variable to make it look nice so you really have to go through and look at all these things right it's not um it's not just push you know push button receive bacon you know it's uh it's definitely something you have to analyze but yeah. So there's a there's a ton of different things I look for if I go back to my script you know I look for the keyword password, you have package manager, authentication, um references, Docker config files which can contain credentials and these are all the types of things I look for AWS access keys right is uh really important S3 config files which sometimes contain passwords HTP password, gitcredentials, bashrc files, sshd files so all of these type of files I know to contain sometimes credentials and so I will look at my target with these keywords and I will spend a good hour to two you know sometimes three depending on how big my client is looking for these keywords on GitHub for them to to find different stuff so that's what I'm doing while all of my tools that take a long time to run are running basically. Big question is going to be like this script that you've that you see speaking about that you wrote is that available if I take your class or how would I get that script tool yeah it's just something you use internally or? Yeah so my script is public I mean it's just creating these links it's nothing fancy but um it's right here I will send you the just link and um that'd be great people can people can look at the kind of stuff I mean the important part is this part is like what am I using what am I looking for in the search so yeah people can grab that it's it's free all this stuff is in my class my red teaming and Bug Bounty hunting class so if anybody wants to take it and like really dive into you know like the whole process you know that's awesome. Yeah I mean because YouTube we can only do so much right so yeah just tell us about the class again we'll just let's start with just for for a minute or so tell us about this class how many days? um what do you do? Yep so my class is called the Bug Hunters Methodology Live it's my own thing right it's uh 15 years of my experience doing Bug Bounty, external pentests, red teaming all this stuff but um but it's The Bug Hunters Methodology live.com or t tbhmlive.com basically I teach two days over Discord uh live but it's over Discord and I teach a whole bunch of stuff so um I teach all of this reconnaissance stuff that we're covering so introduction to Recon, ReverseWHOIS is uh like all the stuff that we're gonna go over and way more um and then the second day I do Application Hacking and Analysis so I do things like like understanding where to hack a big application I find that like one of my favorite content creators is is Rana, you work with Rana and um she does such an excellent job of um of explaining the vulnerabilities on some of these sites but what I find less people teach in the industry is when you're an actual tester a red teamer or someone who's doing this for a day-to-day job those targets that a lot of people train on you know there's a vulnerability in that page right so so that's a lot easier than when you get in the work world and you're doing this for a living and there's an application with hundreds of forms, a hundred parameters, a hundred pages, uh thousands of different ways to try to hack it and you get lost right and so the second day second day of my class is understanding how to approach an application um so what are the layers of the application where do you look for certain types of vulnerabilities, um what tooling do you use to make this easier for yourself, what question do you ask yourself about the application and so that's what my class is about it's less about like here's SQL injection and here's how you do SQL injection against this form because there's a million classes like that right I I don't need to teach another class like that I'm sure Rana does a way better job than me but my class is about where do you look for SQL injection so um so that's kind of what my class is about. And we've got good news Rod Jason we've managed to twist your arm to come back and actually do the hacking because that was like the number one request from the previous video right? Yeah so we'll do we'll do some of the hacking on uh next episode we'll finish out Recon today and um and that and then you know as always my team is available for contract if you guys are looking for red teaming uh Buddobot.com so my red team is super legit and uh we care a lot about our clients so come check us out. So that's the the course um and so we did GitHub analysis for subdomains and get analysis for credentials um and so now we're gonna we're gonna kind of go uh give you a little peek here so this is this is one of the pages from um my training uh deck and so we're going to talk a little bit for a second about the next phase of finding domains. So we have looked at the cloud, we have looked at what IPspace our target owns, we have looked at GitHub but there's a whole bunch of other sites on the internet that gather information about URLs and so they do it for different reasons so some of them are search engines, right every search engine is grabbing every URL ever there's a whole bunch of infrastructure websites that given from information about websites like the Wayback Machine, Censys, Netcraft like pass the total all these sites there's all of these projects to categorize certificates like crt.sh and certDB and then there's a whole bunch of security sites too. So on the internet there's about somewhere between 60 and 100 of these what we call sources of data that as a hacker we used to have to go and manually go to these sites and try to use some you know like Google hacking Foo or um or GitHub you know like we used there using their search box and try to find everything they knew about our target. So we would ask every single one of these 60 to 100 sites what do you know about nasa.gov which is not time efficient so we basically had like an advent about five or six years ago of some tooling that can do this for us it'll reach out to all these APIs and so um one of the one of the tools to do this that I um that I use heavily is Amass and so Amass and another tool called SubFinder will go out to all of these places and find um find references to our target. So in the slides I use twitch.tv but we'll go we'll go live and I did a run on um on NASA before the show so if I go back to the top here and I will make this big once I get to the top okay so I go here and I have Amass installed, here's the command here for running Amass against NASA so it's just amass enum -d nasa.gov and then I've added a couple of flags here to say I want to know where you found the reference to nasa.gov um and I want it to be verbose right so I ran this it's it's done running but you can see it tells you right away where it's looking for subdomains for nasa.gov and so uh the Sublist3rAPI, the Chaos data set, DNSDumpster, HackerTarget, these are all websites online that you know Yahoo all kinds of stuff right and so it tells me that it's going to look at all these places and then it starts giving me back data so it found a reference to nasa.gov uh URS earthdata.nasa.gov from this website and this website and so it searches the entire collection of these sources to tell me more about NASA's websites so if I go down to the bottom here I want to see if it's still it's still running and I started this well before the show started right and so it takes a little while to run this is one of the things I start right away when I do my Recon because it does take a little while to run and uh yeah it's it's good it's going to give me a whole bunch of more at bats or chances to find stuff for for NASA. So Amass is a giant tool setof Recon tools and it's written by a guy named Jeff Foley it's an amazing tool you can find it on on GitHub at owasp amass and then you can go here and check it out and download it and use it yourself I think one of the things about Amass is it's thorough it's uh it takes a long time to run because it's checking so many sources and it's doing a couple different techniques for finding sites for us. Now if you want to do a quicker run of this same concept there is a second tool written by a group called project discovery which is called SubFinder um so SubFinder is written by project Discovery and uh and they scope their tool a little bit tighter and so it's much faster and so um you can run SubFinder and get output for um for any target in usually like anywhere between you know a minute and five minutes instead of you know I started Amass beforethe show started and it's still going right now um and so in my testing I use both of these tools and then I just cat the output to a single text file and then sort it and unique it and so I will use both sources between the two of them Amass and SubFinder, they're the two best tools for finding subdomains from these sources online and so uh SubFinder looks like uh this so if I go back to the run I did just a couple seconds ago. My question always for you Jason and I mean you I think you'll answer the last time but you can give us the answer again is you know you get lost in the weeds here how the heck do you know what's important and what's just yeah stuff yeah. So the the answer is not as fancy as people really want it to be honestly if I really want to hack NASA or Tesla or any of these big companies right like every single one of these like I said is an opportunity so there's no way to really just like give up on any one of them um so at the end of at the end of running SubFinder it found like 6000 sites right so like how do you get through 6000 sites well there are some strategies so the end part of all of this when I finish running all these tools and everything in my checklist over here right I end up with a whole bunch of lists of subdomains and I basically dump them all into a Redis database on on my Linux box and then I unique them and then I take that and so now it has all these tools output in this database and then I tell it to print out all of the subdomains again and then I use a tool to screenshot them and so the tool we use for screenshotting is down here it's called HTTPX which is another Project Discovery tool so Project Discovery is this amazing group of developers who write security tools open source security tools and they have been contributing to uh the security scene for you know several years now but um they have many different tools and HTTPX is another one, SubFinder is one that have many different tools but they are probably one of the biggest contributors and advance to the security scene as far as tooling goes since NMAP I would say as far as like how how prevalent they are in our industry. So I will have a database of all of the subdomains and then I will just feed them to their HTTPX tool let's see let's see if I can do that here so what I have a file of uh of uh NASA stuff so okay so uh I will zoom in here so I have a file of some of the output of this stuff right and I can just do cats uh let's see see what's in here I think it's I called it two NASA or three NASA okay cool yeah three NASA. So here's an output right so now I have their tool HTTPX installed and what this will do is remember we're getting these subdomains from GitHub and from all these new places on the internet but we don't know if they're live yet right and so normally what you would have to do is port scan these but HTTPX it's base functionality what it does is it just tells you is there a website on this domain so you can just cat all of your domains and pipe it right into HTTPX and so this will tell you yes there is web servers live for all of these websites so that's the first thing we need to do we need to pair down our big data set to stuff that's live um with websites on it because we're going to attack websites um and so this will go through an attempt to make a a connection on Port 80 and Port 443 to all of those subdomains now what you can also do with HTTPX um is you can there's a whole bunch of stuff you can do with HTTPX but one of the cool things you can do about HTTPX is you can do screenshots and let me find the flag for screenshotting here, so you can pass it as ss and it will go to that website once it's live and take a screenshot and so if we do that for our NASA stuff it will begin screenshotting now this will take a while right it has to open a headless browser go to the site take a screenshot but what this will allow us to do is it'll give us a folder with the name of the subdomain and a screenshot of the page it lands on and so that is a way I can pair down this list a little bit I'll get a folder of screenshots and I'll start looking at the screenshots and just be like oh that looks interesting that looks interesting that looks interesting I'm going to hack those things first now that doesn't mean I can skip any of the other sites because there might be vulnerabilities on the other sites but screenshotting is a way that we can prioritize kind of our hacking a little bit what sites we're going to choose to to look at first so when I'm looking at those screenshots what are you know what are things I'm looking at well I'm looking at sites that you know basically look like they were written not with current generation frameworks that don't have very good CSS and styling right that indicates to me that you know they were probably not really paid attention to a lot probably having a lot of haven't had a lot of security love and so I will definitely look at things like that I will also look at the name of the subdomain so we talked about this in the last show right but if I look at some of these subdomains I can see that this one is git earthdatanasa.gov right now I don't really know what this is right but anything that's a git server I want to look at because it might contain source code anything that has like Dev or Engineering in it I want to look at because you know might have developer information in it I want to look at their their verbatim API because definitely want to check that out because I'm a nerd I want to check out JPL right so that's right here right so uh yeah so there's there's a lot of things like you just gain over time like through hacker intuitions like what do I want to look at and it's either visually through the screenshot or through the name of the subdomain usually but you can't skip anything I mean you really you have to look at like almost everything so. That's what I love about your training right and I don't want to hop on that but I think it's important to say there's a difference between knowing how to do something and when to do something yes yeah yeah And I mean it's um experience is a big thing right but sorry I interrupted you go on. No no worries yeah I mean um that's what I try to train um you know everybody I you know I work with and stuff like that it's um you could use the tools all day long but the the I don't know the the golden kind of stuff is the context around hacking right it's it's um it's knowing when and where to apply your efforts it's knowing how to get the last 10% I talk about that a lot in my training right but many people will just run the tool not configure it super well or they won't go through everything and they'll miss out right and it's usually that last 10% of effort that I put in or um you know knowledge that I've had contextually from working in the industry that allows me to you know win and in my case when I say win is succeed on an engagement right break in so so that was Amass and SubFinder right so Amass is still running right here it's still finding stuff it could run for another hour you never know SubFinder we ran and we got a whole bunch of stuff back and then now we have a giant list of of stuff to hack. So there are some other tools in this area that I use in my class one is uh BBOT on top of SubFinder and Amass uh you know I put it all in this great bucket right here also when Amass finishes it gives you a really nice table to tell your customer like if you know they're obviously people are paying for the service from from us right it'll give them a map of where everything they have is and honestly many times when I finish doing this and I give them the output of the map they're like oh my God we didn't know we had all of this infrastructure it you know people laugh at that and they're like no way that happens it absolutely happens with an organization as big as NASA or Tesla right it's just a giant business stuff gets bought purchased acquired marketing people go out with credit cards and buy Amazon space and you know Azure space and stuff like that so it's really interesting to hand it back to the security people and be like did you know you had all this? And they're like no um in fact one of the stories one of the things I did deaf times I did a panel with a whole bunch of red teamers um like myself and um it was just worst stories and one of the worst stories that we had was was I started off so they could get some time to kind of compose you know what they wanted to talk about but without telling the client name I mean we had a client name come to us and we did this Recon process for them and the first thing we found was a whole bunch of stuff in AWS and we started looking at some of those addresses as subdomains and a couple of them were AWS S3 buckets and inside of the AWS S3 buckets were code source code of certain different types and inside of the source code was their AWS secret key um hard-coded and so we had access to terabytes of data and this is literally we haven't even started the engagement yet like this is after the sales call basically and we had found all this stuff and so it was a it was a really good moment to say hey like. But you made them sign first before you told them yeah yeah yeah. No no we did not that's uh that's not something we gave it to them and um but yeah so that's uh. No no I'm just kidding I mean that's really good of you because you basically uh you didn't have to but you told them already before you'd signed so yeah and I interrupted your story again. No no all good I mean uh yeah so that's the that's the kind of stuff that happens when you go this this extra level right you do this reconnaissance yeah um okay so we're gonna switch gears a little bit to the red teaming side so we've found a lot of sites a lot of subdomains you know we can take some screenshots and um really with this checklist you know looking at all these places we will have a really great set of data for what we can hack and then so in a red team now that we have stuff we can hack I have to switch gears a little bit and I want to look at for more of these credential mishaps basically right and so with us um and this is this does not happen in the Bug Bounty world because it's a little bit sensitive with with that but um in the red team world you end up doing a lot of what's called threat intelligence and so we talked about looking at credentials on GitHub but there are other places where you can find credentials so I am sure that you have um have probably seen you know the site have I been Pwned right? I'm guessing yeah yeah. Yeah I did with Troy yeah. You interview Troy. For everyone is watching I'll put that link below Troy's a good fascinating stories to tell sorry go and Jason. Absolutely so in the uh in the red team level in the credential level we're gonna do some credential hunting and so if I'm looking at NASA right what I want to do is like you know Troy has this massive database that he keeps up to date people feed him breach information et cetera et cetera and then you can search through for your email address but this is a consumer site and so it's made for you or me to go and put in our email address and make sure that we're not in one of these breaches and then if we are change our password right and so it's a great public service. Now for a red teamer I actually want to search the databases and try to find passwords for targets of my company so. I would want to search kind of this data for nasa.gov employees and see if any of their stuff is out there now there are levels of credential hunting in in red teaming so you can you can look on source code GitHub and gitlab which we did earlier and then you can look in public breach data and everything that's in have I been pwned? I would consider you know it makes it to the clear web it makes it to Troy and it ends up in have I been pwned? And so it is like level one of credential hunting. Now the inverse of what Troy does have I been pwned? is a site called DeHashed and so DeHashed is a website dehashed.com and it's mostly for red teamers and threat intelligence people and it's the same idea as have I been pwned? except for you can get access to all of the data that comes in those breaches including the usernames and the passwords and everything like that so the first thing I will do is to use DeHashed to see if there's any anything that made it to the clear web for credentials of my target so I have an account on DeHashed and you would go up here and you would just search like um email or actually I think it's username username colon and then we will just search nasa.gov and so then you have uh 205 results and it tells you here's the user so we're gonna have to blur some of this out but here is the user here's where their breach data was from and if you click on it you get their username, email address, hashed password, phone number, everything that was in the data breach and so some of these you can get non-hashed passwords some of them you get hashed passwords depending on the hashing technology you could try to crack it yourself which I think some people on your show have done password cracking before so but this stuff has made it already out to the clear web has probably already been changed so what DeHashed is really useful for me to for me as a red teamer is really the email addresses these are valid email addresses of people I could phish in my social engineering portion of the of the red team campaign and so I will check all of these to see if the credentials work I will also gather the email addresses from DeHashed and so DeHashed is a tool that a lot of red teams you know count on to to search those you know uh data leaks that end up to the web so that's like level one of of cred hunting. So you mentioned like clear web right a few times but like when we spoke previously you said your company like does a like a full-on attack against a business yep because a hacker isn't is going to go on the dark web right? Correct yeah so we'll we'll do that in a couple seconds so uh. Oh okay brilliant yeah yeah I was going to say it's all good in will saying we're going to stay on the clear web sorry people with less that are less scrupulous than us yeah I don't care totally yeah go on. So so this is like level one of credential hunting is DeHashed there'sother sites like DeHashed that other places prefer to use but they're all the same idea you can build this database yourself too right so these data breaches the kind that end up on have I been pounding DeHashed they end up in all kinds of places but most often a torrent ends up online of the data breach and you can download it to your local box and build your own credential and username database from all of these things it is a lot of work and so a lot of people forego doing that they just use DeHashed instead because that's their job you know know DeHashed is a site their service you pay for it and you you get access it's not very expensive honestly for the DeHashed service but it is it is a four-pay site so um has an API and you can search all this stuff um you can get even more stuff if you if you just do nasa.gov instead of username it will come back with thousands of entries where it sees nasa.gov as part of the username password or metadata for a breach and so um we would look through this now one thing here that I like to tell red teamers is that okay so we may have got when we did the first search a whole bunch of people back that credential no longer works on the site that it got breached from right or you know you may not have it may not have worked on the site that you wanted it to work on when you found the password but that doesn't mean it doesn't work anywhere else and so when you're looking at an organization you have to realize that they use a bunch of software and a majority of it now these days is SAS software so they log into some web portal somewhere to use a thing like Miro or what's a good example like Salesforce or something something like that right and so when you get these usernames and passwords from DeHashed in this level one cred hunting you take it and you try it on those SAS as well because they're not integrated when the user changes their password at work right if you change your password at work it changes for all your Microsoft stuff and stuff like that but that's not always connected via oauth or you know whatever authentication mechanism to Salesforce so to mirror or to whatever and so we've had a lot of initial access where we've been able to get access to SAS sites using stuff off of DeHashed. So a list of you know like common SAS sites I think I don't know if I have it in here but I will give you guys a list if I can find one yeah but I have a list of SAS sites that I'll go check these credentials on so so that's level one. Now level two is is right here it's Private RaaS Sale so the next level of finding credentials is the uh is the dark web portion of kind of the ransomware as a service ecosystem and the biggest player in this ecosystem right now is LockBit and so I have my Tor browser open here I have LockBits website here let me refresh here but LockBit is an organization that provides the lockbit ransomware which is one of the most prevalent and probably best ransomware that exists out there but ransomware is just a software so what LockBitdata is they're the first big enterprising organization as a bad guy organization is to democratize the process of hacking and ransomware. So what they do is they say hey are you a hacker can do you have initial access somewhere already we don't care how you got it, did you phish somebody? Did you pop a Citrix box, did you do whatever we don't care what we'll do is we'll give you our really good ransomware software you've ransomware the organization and we will split the money with you you know 60 40 you know 70 30 50 50 whatever they agree to and so you have this ecosystem of hackers and then LockBitand uh and it's a it's calledransomware as a service basically. Now if you go to that you know I'm in the Tor browser right now on the dark web right now if you go to their main site you can see that they have ransomware you know a lot of companies and what they do with their demo is is they say hey we've ransomware at this company they have so many days to reply uh to pay us the ransom otherwise we publish the data and so this is where a lot of these data dumps get published before uh before they hit the clear web right is there through LockBitand uh and a community that's that's behind LockBitand so you can see here if you were to go into any of these you'll be able to download the data from from LockBit basically and again people reuse passwords everywhere so if there's a big site on here that doesn't pay and it gets published like you can reuse those passwords on other sites and stuff like that so this is kind of level two is getting into the forum and um and LockBit ransomware as a service ecosystem there's also a whole bunch of forums um there used to be Genesis Market which was a big one but it got taken down by a whole bunch of law enforcement but there have been ones that have come up and replaced it Russian Market there's a whole bunch of sites that have come up to replace it on the dark web where you can buy and sell credentials and breach data so um this is like level two is going to the dark web and finding credentials via these places about your target. The last and most deep level of kind of credential hunting is behind all of this even dark websites is secret telegrams discords and whatsapps and so this is the secret sauce I'm not going to reveal how we do our stuff here but we actually enter into these chat channels um via different means infiltrate them and monitor sales of breach data that are even before they get to LockBit and we can monitor if our customers stuff ends up in you know those chat channels basically and so those are the three levels of kind of red team credential hunting that you use to to gain access it's it's public and then dark web and then like the Secret Squirrel Discord, Telegram and WhatsApp stuff. So on our YouTube videos you did quite a bit on level one and some level two. In your course do you do level three as well or was that only when we you know get you as a as like we become your client? Ah yeah get your service it's only when you become a client and that's so it's so hard to get into these groups um yeah it's very confidential yeah so it it's definitely not something we're really I'm really giving away our tactics and stuff like that I mean it's not overly hard though right like it's it you know the the chat rooms exist you just have to get invited to them right and you have to find out where they are and you have to invited and prove that you're hackery enough to get in there and um provide something of value to get an invite and so you know that's that's kind of how they're they're managed it's all the web of trust between bad guys so uh but yeah we don't uh we don't really disclose all of our methods to do all that but um we do find a lot of initial access from credential hunting in all three levels right um some people the stuff out there on DeHashed is still usable I would say like 20% of the time maybe um when you get into the Private RaaS like LockBit stuff more like 50% efficacy rate I would sayand then when you get into Telegram and Discord it's usually closer to 80 90% of the credentials you find there are live can be used in a in a red team campaign so. Jason that's amazing right you've covered a lot I think the big question a lot of people have been asking and we kind of mentioned it already is they want to see actual hacking so you'll come back and do more of those videos right? Yeah absolutely so the second part of my class is um the first day is all Recon which we went over a whole bunch of stuff on and then um application analysis is the next part of my class now I don't want anybody to go in to think that we're going to go like hack stuff live like I mean maybe we'll do some Labs or something like that to show some vulnerabilities I know you've had a lot of guests do that what my content is about and in my training and when I train it's about where to look for vulnerabilities on websites and so that's a lot of my stuff um but yeah happy to come back talk about anything there more red teaming stuff um you know we haven't even broached you know what happens after you get initial access like what c2s do you use? What you know post exploitations do you do you use? All that kind of stuff so if you want me back happy to come back yeah yeah. So if everyone is watching please put comments below you know the kind of stuff you want to see I think Jason the big difference between someone with your kind of experience like years and years and years of experience versus someone who's just like gone through another one to mention names but like just like Labs is you know when and how the tools should be used rather than just what the tools actually do. Yeah I mean that comes with a lot of experience but that's what I want to shortcut for people when I come on stuff like this right like the end of the day it's about making people more secure right and if I can help shortcut someone who's learning to do this stuff and by shortcutting that we make the internet a little bit more secure I'm I'm super happy. So Jason just for people who want to reach out to you and perhaps learn more is Twitter the or X's at school these days the best place you know how do they get hold of you and what do you recommend people do? Yeah so I have a website it's jhaddix.com uh there's a contact form there if you're interested my company is Buddobot, it's a red teaming consultancy we do all this kind of stuff we do a service called continuous adversary emulation so we do a year-long campaign for this type of stuff and then um you can always interact with me on Twitter so I am @Jhaddix and I tweet about all things offensive security, my classes linked and pinned to the top you know, I talk about resources, I do interviews, all kinds of content stuff off of Twitter. I love what you're doing man because it's you know people who are starting their journey don't have money necessarily you know when you're student you you want to try and get as much free information as you can yeah to you know start your journey and I really appreciate you you know sharing so much amazing content on YouTube and other platforms thank you but you know once you in the industry and you want to learn more perhaps the company can pay for you or you know you can afford it and then you could attend your class and obviously if you're working for like a big company and you just want to make your company more secure they can engage and get you guys to like test right? So I'll tell you what my next course isn't until December so I give it a lot of time for me to get ready for it because I update it every time I do it uh I'm gonna send you uh two invite codes for two free seats if you want to give them away through your channel viewers and um if they want to come and check it out so. Jason really appreciate you doing that man that's amazing so for everyone who's watched till this part of the video, this is why you need to watch the last part of the video I have put a link on screen now if you click on that link you'll be able to enter to win and will randomly choose the winners. So Jason I really appreciate you you know doing that yeah you know people need to watch to the end of the video. Yeah yeah for sure well I think that's all I had for today we'll come back and do more application hacky stuff uh next time but um awesome awesome to come on. So just for everyone who's watching put your comments below let us know the kind of stuff that you want Jason to cover and please go and follow him on Twitter uh go and you know share the love um Jason once again really appreciate it man thanks thanks!",

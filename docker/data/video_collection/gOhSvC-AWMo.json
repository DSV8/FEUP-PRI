    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   I'm giving up my smartphone for one week. I'll be using only this Punkt MP01. It features voice calls, number pad text messages and that's it. This will likely be a panic inducing experiment. As you know smartphones have become an important part of our lives. Let's see what a week without one is like... a scary thought for an internet junkie like me.  *From the manufacturer  The more our phones do, the more they demand of us. Sometimes its good to take a break. But until now, the only alternative to hyper-connected smartphones has been the kind of phone you find at the back of a drawer.  The Punkt. MP 01 is a stylish, well-crafted mobile phone which focuses on modern simplicity, inside and out. It makes phone calls and sends texts. Thats all.

    "transcript": "Whats up guys Lew here, back with another video And today it's going to be a hard video to make. In front of me I have the \"Punkt Phone\" This has been in the studio for a while and I have talked about it. I talked to Jack, I talked to Joe Rogan on his podcast about it I talked to people in my personal life I talked to ... trusted individuals, spiritual leaders Because what is in front of me, is an intentionally dumb phone \"Why have they done this Lew? I am into technology, I want the latest. I thought we are talking about Android and Apple.\" I am going to give up my smartphone...This guy right here. I've got a Nexus 6P...I love it Think of what is closer to you than your phone... Exactly, not much. What am I going to do? A week? I am going to use this phone for a week...Not that phone A dumb phone for a week Now is this going to mean, that I am going to be completely disconnected? No. Right, I am going to be on my laptop, and, and my computer and so on. But It's just a way to see how it kinda curves my behavior When I'm out and about, doing human things Being a human And It's this phone right here This phone right here was the inspiration to give up my smartphone and do this experiment. It's a phone from the future... ...With features from the past What am I doing? I am going on a whole thing here Maybe I'll tell you that my life, uh, became rosy and sunshine and lollipops Since I gave up my smartphone I can breathe better, and colors are brighter and.. I found my humanity Or I'll just go of the grid and you'll never see me again Jack will probably love that. You're a sick man Jack The box is nice on this Kinda nice Good luck getting work e-mails on here when you are chilling out on the week-end. What have we got on here? Ok, so Volume is on the side over here looks like it has got a speakerphone on it Nice little buttons Sim card tray This interesting shape and texture on the back Micro-USB Alright, easy enough, have lots of those Tiny little power brick here It's a 1000 mAh battery Which will give you almost 300 minutes of talk time or 3 weeks of standby Oh cool, an adapter If you don't have one of these, you need one When you switch phones a lot Essentially this lets you take a nano-Sim and turn it into a temporary, micro-Sim Now I'm (I'll) legitimately do this.. A week! Guys I'm telling you, I know It's scary Let's just to it right now Let's bite the bullet and do it I am so stressed out... We did it And look my phone my phones screen is right there. One last gasp Umm, How do I even turn th.. [beeping] battery low Oh we have an earpiece So you can still- You got a headset An audio Adapter if you want to use a different set of headphones [Beep]\"Hey man, relax... Dude\" [to the phone] I have no contacts, no anything. Do you understand this level of sacrifice. It's like I am getting gorunded I am grounding myself My whole business like uploading videos, communicating with you guys... the whole process, it happens online It happens in apps, it happens in e-mail. A lot of people are going to be hitting up my inbox Expecting replies, and if I am not sitting at a computer, It ain't gonna happen. Wish me luck, my friends I will report back to you It's a wild world out there... ...full of cell towers And data connections... ...that I can't use.",

    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin'? There's a ton of Bluetooth speakers out there, and while the small ones are really convenient, they mostly suck when it comes to sound quality. Stick around, and we'll take a look at one that doesn't. [ Music - Intro ] This is the JBL Go. In terms of mini Bluetooth speakers, it's a bit on the large side, but still fits in the palm of your hand, and it's easy to throw into a bag or a purse. The build quality on this thing is solid. There's a rubbery coating on the outside with a metal grill on the front. It's not water-proof though, so you'll want to take care if you use it outside. It comes in a variety of colors; I just happen to choose classic JBL orange for mine. The right side has an Aux In jack, a MicroUSB port for charging, and the mic for the Bluetooth speakerphone function. That USB port will charge the Go in about an hour and a half, and you'll get maybe five hours of run time. Pairing the thing is quick and easy. It'll show up on your device and when you connect, the LED on the front will turn blue to show you're good to go. And that's about it. It's super simple! No bells or whistles, just plays audio and takes phone calls. Where most small Bluetooth speakers fall flat on their face is sound quality, but that's where the Go does really well. Despite the fact it's only got a single 40 millimeter driver, there's a surprising amount of low end. And the highs are fairly crisp. It still sounds like a small speaker, sure, but I'm honestly impressed at the sound this thing pumps out. I mean, here, listen for yourself: [] With all of three watts of power behind it, you definitely won't be doing any block rockin' with the Go. But it's still gets decently loud, enough to fill a room. The question I always save for the end of any review is if the thing is worth the price. JBL lists an MSRP of $40 US, which as good as the Go is, is just too much. But I got mine on sale for $20, and at a price like that, it's a no-brainer. I'm willing to declare the JBL Go the king of small Bluetooth speakers. But if you wanna get one, just make sure you shop around. So if you like this video, thumbs-up if you please, and be sure to subscibe. You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram at thisdoesnotcomp, and as always, thanks for watching.",

    "transcript": "this here is another viewer's broken gaming pc this one's a pretty small one it apparently turns on but does not show a picture which can be an extremely annoying thing to diagnose for a bit of context this bill was put together only a few weeks ago which makes this at least in my eyes a brand new pc the only recycled component is the case which is an origin pc case but everything else in here is again virtually brand new purchased from either amazon or newegg now the issue arises when it comes to the return policy window especially with amazon i believe for most tech products it's only 14 days so if you've owned a product for more than 14 days and you find out that it's not working well that return window usually your sol amazon has made some exceptions including for me but most of the time you're not going to be able to get your money back at least from amazon they're going to tell you to go through the manufacturer and the other problem with that is going through a manufacturer takes usually weeks sometimes even months and nobody wants to deal with that especially in a new build that you just spent a pretty penny for so that is why this thing is here and i'm really hoping we're going to be able to figure out what's wrong with it so we can fix it in the studio and give it back to the owner within a day or two versus right several weeks i think i'd choose the former so without further ado let's get into it stay with me if you're having trouble remembering dozens of passwords for accounts that seem to always require new ones and i know they do this for security reasons but still it does become overwhelming when you have like dozens of different passwords for different accounts you should check out roboform a secure password manager not only will it store all of your passwords it'll log you into each account with one click no more typing especially those long passwords this also means you can use super unique ones for each account without the hassle of memorizing or jotting them down that's roboform's job it's peace of mind and backed by industry standard encryption roboform is super easy to get started and you can have it up and running within a few minutes and if you sign up using our special link you'll get thirty percent off a robi form everywhere subscription that's just 16 bucks a year so click the link below or visit robiform.com forward slash greg salazar to get started today so let's first reveal what is in the box oh yeah no discreet graphics card so the specs of this build are amd ryzen 5 5600 g which explains lack of a discreet card uh 16 gigs of corsair vengeance 3200 megahertz ddr4 a 240 gig mp510 nvme ssd and a 750 watt corsair sfx power supply now the fact that this has a 5600 g in here and he's saying that he's not getting picture out but the system boots up just fine that tells me a heck of a lot about what i think this is i think it's a bios compatibility issue see a lot of these amd motherboards especially older ones but even newer ones that are reliant on b550 and x570 chipsets don't include native 5000 series amd ap support at least not natively so if you went to amazon.com or maybe a big box retailer like micro center and bought yourself a pretty modern b550 motherboard you would assume that it would work with one of amd's more modern cpus right like the 5000 series apu so 5600g should work with the b550 motherboard out of the box but it doesn't and that's because these motherboards a lot of them were manufactured long before these apu's were ever even announced so you need to update your motherboard's bios in most cases to get it to work in post with one of these modern apus and i've got a good feeling this individual did not do that not that i really blame them because again you would assume that these two would just work they would just be compatible by default but one of the downsides one of the only downsides really of recycling the same platform the same socket am4 over and over and over is that they don't just you know things just don't work right away usually you have to have a cpu that's already compatible with the bios in the board to post to get into your bios and then you need to update your bios that way right some boards have what you'd call a bios flashback function which we have a video talking about i'm going to have that linked in the video description if you're interested it shows you how to update your motherboard's bios without having an already compatible cpu in the socket the unfortunate situation here is that this motherboard doesn't appear to have a bios flashback function at least i don't see anything back here that indicates it does have that function so we're going to have to swap the apu in here out with another older cpu that i know works natively and then we'll update the bios that way i'm going through all this up front because i have a really really good feeling that is the only thing wrong with this build and the fact that everything else is new i mean there's no there's nothing really to warrant me to suspect that something terrible is wrong with this build apart from just simple software and compatibility that is very easy to fix if you have an older cpu first thing we're going to do though before we try anything is turn it on and see if we get the same symptoms exhibited that the viewer described so with the pc powered and our portable monitor connected we're going to try to turn the system on believe that button there this board does not have a doctor debug or anything of that sort you might have some led indicators on here actually i don't see that either this is um a more bare bones b550 itx board here so yeah this is the typical this is the typical symptom of an incompatible bios everything appears to be working all the fans are spinning but we're getting no picture now at this point there are a few things we could try we could swap the motherboard out but that doesn't really solve our our problem at the end of the day we need to get this bios updated and we can't do that by removing the board what we should be doing is swapping cpus and i have a 3400 g here this is a generation old apu that i think works with this b550 board it still depends on the bios but i'm pretty sure it supports these if it doesn't worst case we can swap it with a 3600 which i have in the closet that will work out of the box with any b550 board at least it should and then we'll have to throw in a cheap discreet card at least then we can power the system on we'll get a picture we'll get a post and then we can update the bios that way because as far as i'm concerned there's no native bios flashback function included with this motherboard so we have no choice but to swap it out with a compatible cpu or a dud you can get direct from amd but that takes a few weeks now of course the less likely scenario here is that the cpu is doa i highly doubt that but if it is we'd still need to swap these chips out to confirm that again my initial impression with this system is that all that is needed is a bios update and that is a relatively straightforward assuming you have an already compatible cpu on hand so we're going to remove the 5600g we've already cleaned off the thermal paste and we're going to insert the 3400g and instead of using thermal paste for this since we're just swapping these out very quickly i'm just going to use a thermal pad this actually isn't even the correct size but it should still pull enough heat away i'm not worried at all about thermal throttling ask me how i know and with that taken care of i think it's time to try for a post i do expect this will work now if it doesn't then it's probably just the bios still i i didn't check to see what this motherboard shipped with oh there we go well that was super easy so it was definitely a bios issue i i'm almost certain that it's not the cpu itself most cpus aren't just randomly going to die on you um so yeah uh and there you go so p1.00 that's the bios version definitely not the correct bios for the 5600g and a very easy way to take care of this is to first hop onto your motherboard's product page so you can see this is our board b550m itx ac we can confirm this in our bios i want to scroll down here to the support tab click here and then we'll want to click on the bios button you can see these are all the available bios's for this board starting with the most recent here at the top and you can see under all three of these updates it says to support 5000 series g processors it requires to update the bios with matisse renoir or vermeer um okay i just realized something so we just installed what i believe is a picasso apu i get all my code names mixed up matisse is the generic 3000 series zentu processors renoir is i believe the 4000 series g apus and vermeer is the 5000 series zen three cpus not the apus so i think why it's telling us that we have to have one of these three installed is because when we do flash this bios we're gonna lose support for the apu that's already in there the 3400g which isn't good because you don't want anything to happen to your system while you're flashing a bio so you could break your board i really didn't think about that very much i'm going to leave all this in the video of course so that you can kind of learn from my mistakes and and look ahead before swapping cps that i would have just put a 3600 in here if i had known that it was going to erase support for the 3400g once we flashed it but the reason why they do this is because you can only fit so many compatible cpus and apus into a bios package and the memory chips for these bios are really small so every time you include support for one set of processors you typically have to eliminate support for another and our poor 3400g is not going to be supported on any of these three bioses here whether it be 1.8 1.7 or 1.6 all three of these require at the very earliest matisse and our poor picasso apu is just um yeah it's not quite matisse so i'm going to download version 1.8 save that to a thumb drive it does include 5000 series g support uh and it does include a few against updates and things for better stability but i'll have that on a thumb drive and we'll swap the cpu in here out for a 3600 or 3600 x we'll have to put a discrete card in the system i know this is kind of annoying but this is what so we have to deal with if you want you know am4 to work with all these different cpus which is good in a lot of ways but this is the one downside uh and then then we'll be able to throw his 5600g back in here and hopefully get a post right so now we've got a 3600 in here which remember has no integrated graphics processor so that's why we had to also throw in a gt710 which is just a very cheap graphics card i wouldn't recommend gaming with it but it does allow us to get a picture out and we should see a post again i don't know why we wouldn't i've confirmed that both of these things work in separate systems if we do see that post then we'll be able to update our bios with this 3600 install we'll still have support for the 3600 after the bios has been flashed and then we'll be able to swap this chip for his 5600g any second now there we go what does that say new new cpu blah blah okay let's get into the bios and just like that with a little time lapse our bios was updated and after restart we got this screen right here which indicates that there's no operating system on the drive in here and that makes sense because he just built this system according what he told me and didn't get a post from day one or didn't get a picture at least so uh yeah he couldn't of course installed an operating system if he couldn't see what he was doing on screen with that now i'm going to swap the 3600 in here with the 5600g we're going to take the discrete processor out and we're going to attempt to get a post with a picture this time i i'm 99.9 sure this is going to work in fact the only reason this wouldn't work is if the cpu is actually dead and it was just a coincidence that the bios was also incompatible with the chip i highly doubt that but it is i guess a slight possibility so let's drop the apu in here i'll reapply thermal paste since that's what he had to begin with we'll do our x pattern with a few dots and just lock it in place we'll remove this graphics card say bye-bye gt710 you are not needed and let's try for one last post hdmi cable connected to the back of the motherboard power cable connected let's cross our fingers it's doing this little power cycling thing trying to train memory and the like any second now i'm gonna look really stupid if this was not the fix come on come on you'll get there i'm rooting for you picture picture picture oh oh yeah that's a post there we go now you can see our same board b550m itx slash ac we're now on p 1.8 instead of 1.00 and our ryzen 5 5600g with radeon graphics is good to go and now that this build is functionally good to go i do want to address a few aesthetic issues if you want to call them that cable management is a bit lacking there's a few cables just kind of running all across the motherboard and like it looks a little messy so i'm going to try my best to clean that up this case is rather limiting in that aspect because there's not a ton of space at all behind the motherboard tray so i think we'll still have a bulk of our cables sitting right here under the power supply but i do think we can clean it up just a bit so let's give it a shot and here we are you know while i was in the middle of filming all this i realized that his left side panel is actually not even like windowed it's it's perforated but you can't actually see in here so not that huge deal that this cable management looked the way it did honestly could have been just fine the way i had left it but i did change a few things i streamlined the cables so that it looks a little cleaner i swapped the power supply around so that it was pulling in air from the left because again the left side is perforated granted the right side is two but this just helped with cable management a bit more as well so now i've got two fans facing kind of inward which will look pretty cool we've got an exhaust fan up top and a smaller exhaust here at the rear all of that air for the most part again is going to be pulled in from the side so uh pretty cool layout i did confirm after doing all this that the system still posts uh the only thing he needs to install now is an operating system and because there wasn't one already on here because again he he couldn't have possibly installed one unless he was bringing a drive that already had windows over to this new system because he couldn't get a picture so i'm not going to install windows on here just because i'm not entirely sure what he's going to want to do with it but that said everything else is ready to go the system is working now and it ultimately just came down to lack of a bios update that's one of the things you should really look out for when building an amd pc in 2021 one of the side effects of having a platform that is so versatile and so inclusive is that you're gonna have plenty of bios out there that frankly overlap with each other in terms of cpu compatibility my rule of thumb is to always check the manufacturer's website always check e-retailer listings like amazon and newegg read the descriptions double and triple check that the motherboard you're buying is compatible out of the box with the cpu you intend to pair it with otherwise you'll end up in the situation we were in here where your build is otherwise fully functional but you get no picture you get no post it's because the bios is more than likely not compatible with the cpu you paired it with and this is mainly an amd thing there were a few instances where you could have this situation occur with intel but mostly amd and again it's it's more or less a consequence of just how versatile am4 is so there's a plethora of benefits associated with that obviously you can use b350 boards with some of the latest amd cpus out there and then they were released like three or four years apart that's really cool the downside is well you can only fit so many different cpus or c you can only support so many different cpus in a given bios and as a result of that you'll need to do a bit of flashing sometimes to get this stuff to work but uh not to worry this viewer system is now good to go and i'm glad we were able to help him in this video with that if you guys enjoyed this one be sure to let me know giving this one a thumbs up i would appreciate that if you have not subscribed yet i don't know what you're doing go

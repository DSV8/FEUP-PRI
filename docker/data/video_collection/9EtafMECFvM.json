    "transcript": "Did you know that we can connect to a Wi-Fi network which has a MAC address white list. Without our machine's Mac address being on the white list. As you can see when we enter the password we cannot currently connect to this wi-fi network. We set our Wi-Fi adapter into monitor mode we run airodump -ng on the access point we want to target we can see the clients connected to the access point and copy the MAC address of the client connected to our target network. We stop airmon -ng instance, we reset our adapter back to managed mode, we restart the WPA supplicant service. We bring the WLAN0 down. We then run the command sudo macchanger -b and followed by the Mac address of the client. We bring the Wi-Fi adapter back up and restart the network manager service when I now try to connect to the network it shows that I'm connected and have access to the internet.",

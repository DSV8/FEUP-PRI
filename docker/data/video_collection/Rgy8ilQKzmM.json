    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] Ah the cheese grater, ah. (laughing) Oh, I missed the cheese grater so much. Someone's gonna like break into this room and like vape with this thing. It looks like a vape. Sync with back porch? Do we need to install a back porch on this thing? (laughing) (beeping) (upbeat music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? Really? That's just great. You know what, I'm doing great too for two reasons. One, I have a Blackmagic UltraStudio mini recorder, which is basically like a capture card. And I get to unbox it and set it up with y'all. But you may be wondering, Ken, this doesn't look like your lair underground. It's because it's not. I went out to Pittsburgh to track down Brainiac Brent. Because he's gonna help me out with this. Now, you can hear him, but you can't see him. Hi, how you doing? You ass wipe, you couldn't even knock the box over. Your aim is horrible. (laughing) - [Brent] Shit. - [Ken] Couldn't, it's two feet. Oh, you ass wipe. (screaming) They know of your existence here now. Alright, so what this thing does is it will take SDI or HDMI and capture the video signal and convert it into Thunderbolt. So you can plug it into any computer and basically that source will show up as a web cam whether it's this crazy Blackmagic camera I like to use or a fricking like game system. You can use HDMI and SDI and just capture as a web cam via Thunderbolt. So with my leet, sharp, skills and nails, I'm gonna open this. Okay. - [Brent] Of all the things that we brought with us, we forgot to bring a razer blade. - [Ken] Well first of all, Brainiac Brent, somebody had to fly here and if I brought that on the plane, the TSA would punch a bitch, me being the bitch. So today, yeah, we're not just gonna be unboxing it 'cause that would be very underwhelming, 'cause ta-da, it's basically done. We're gonna be testing it out, though, so you're gonna stick around for the test. So as you can see, it's really securely in there just to keep it all protected. That's it, like that's, well. - [Brent] Well, I was about to say, is there no documentation? - [Ken] Okay, well there's a welcome, but it's typically an SD card. Yep, this one's no different. So your manual is on an SD card with Blackmagic. - Okay, that's crazy. - Oh yeah, it's. - I've never seen software distributed on a secured digital card before. - [Ken] They, well it's not necessarily software, it's just like a PDF. But yet it's a pocket sized 10 bit SDI and HDMI recorder for Thunderbolt. Like it's seriously that powerful and it's tiny, so let me show you this and then we'll get to testing it out soon. That's it, that's it. It's smaller than the palm of my hand and it can capture 10 bit SDI and convert it into Thunderbolt. - [Brent] Now Ken, what the hell do you use this sort of thing for? - [Ken] Well, you can use it for one, live broadcasting. You can hook a professional camera into your computer so you have more manual control and better optics as opposed to just a cheap web cam, or maybe you wanna capture a game system and run it into a recorder or a live broadcast, or maybe you wanna screen record from a computer without running screen recording software. Think about it for a sec. If you run a computer and you're outputting a video signal to this and you wanna capture it, you are not stressing the computer any more than you would just by plugging in a second monitor. You don't have to run screen recording software to capture things if you just do it with hardware. The hardware takes the load off the computer, so that is where that can be really useful. Is that the answer you were expecting? - That's very detailed. - All the more. (laughing) Okay, yeah. - [Brent] That was like A plus right there. (laughing) - [Ken] For additional information, consult the user manual. Yeah, it's not cheap, man. This is a. - [Brent] I mean like, it just, it sounds so hollow. - [Ken] Well, there's probably like, it's probably mostly hollow for cooling. - [Brent] Oh man. - [Ken] I'm kidding. I'm sorry, you wanna fondle it? You wanna fondle it more? - Like hm, it's. - [Ken] Off camera. (screaming) (laughing) Hey, shut your eyes, this is. Well, I just wanna show, there is actually a diagram on here that does show like where this can be used. So like as you see, they have a camera. They have a thingamajig, it's probably a deck, and then they have this, and then they're capturing right into the computer. - [Brent] And that looks like a Final Cut of this take. - It's probably DaVinci, but DaVinci. - Oh, that's right, 'cause Blackmagic. - [Ken] Yeah, but DaVinci looks like Final Cut Pro X, let's be honest. (laughing) I wonder where they get the idea from. Right, so in front of us, we have a magical computer box and we're gonna use this laptop. - It's got some dust. - [Ken] Oh, was that dust or was that like a, what was that? Piece of plastic? - I don't know. Piece of, I think it was plastic from the package. - [Ken] Gotcha. So we need to do some things on the computer. Now, the more I look at this, I mean, it looks like someone's gonna like break into this room and like vape with this thing. It looks like a vape. (laughing) Like, oh my gosh. So what we need to do is we need to go to Blackmagic's website. So if we're gonna set up this capture card, we need something to be able to interpret how it works, I would imagine. - [Brent] Was the software not included in the SD card? - [Ken] Oh, hang on. Actually. Software and manual. Brainiac Brent, you mother (beeping). - Yeah, it said right on software and manual, so it's a bit more than just a PDF. - [Ken] Oh. See, see, I. - Software and manual. - [Ken] This is why I can't do this alone. (laughing) I need someone to be able to say hey. - [Brent] Hey, get, get the (beeping) out of here. (laughing) (sad orchestra music) - [Ken] What did you just do to, on the keyboard to move that? Did you press like. - [Brent] Control left arrow. - [Ken] Oh, that's right. I usually have that turned off, but I forgot I refreshed the system recently. - [Brent] Well thank God you did. Otherwise, I would have looked like an idiot. (laughing) - That would have looked really dumb. The other good news is I didn't upgrade to the new MacBook Pro, which doesn't have an SD card reader, so we can put this right in there. Suck it, Apple. - [Brent] Otherwise we'd need a $50 Thunderbolt to SD card. - [Ken] Dude, like I've seen like camera people have like just dongles of messes now with these new computers. (laughing) It's honestly really sad. So we have the desktop video manual, which is the software, I'd imagine, and then here is the, oh, this is like the steroids version. That's not what we have, so thanks for that, that's useful. (laughing) Install desktop video 10, nine, seven. That looks like it to me. Oh, there's a Windows partition on here too. Smart, smart. Welcome to the installer, continue, continue, agree, continue. Shield your eyes. - [Brent] I got this. - [Ken] Alligator three on a train. You can look. - [Brent] On a train? - [Ken] We gotta reboot the computer it looks like, so yeah, we'll let it do it's thing. It'll go bing and then it'll go bong. (laughing) - [Brent] Also, alligator on a train, wasn't that the knock off they did in the Amazing World of Gumball? - [Ken] Oh yeah. - [Brent] Alligators on a train. - [Ken] Yeah, that's right. That was in the DVD episode, right? - [Brent] Yeah, where they try to return a piece of cardboard to Larry. (laughing) - [Ken] The suspense is boring me. There we go, boop. We're now in hour three of the reboot process. (laughing) There we go. Gosh. - [Brent] Wow, my Apple Pro speakers sound a lot better than that built it one. - [Ken] Your pro speakers are like bong. - [Brent] They sound, let. - Oh, well. - I can launch it. I mean, they're. - Are they plugged in? - Yeah. - Alright, yeah, do it. - [Brent] It's a little far away, but like. (computer music) - [Ken] Oh my gosh, that is a really bassy bong. - [Brent] There's so much more character to that. - [Ken] Oh yeah. Well. - [Brent] Is it trying to boot off the SD card? Where are we? - It's trying to do something. I think we just broke the universe. - Oh, there it is. - There we go. There we go. - Oh, there we go. - [Ken] Desktop video setup, I'm guessing that's it. No desktop video device detected because we don't have anything plugged in yet. Okay, so we will get to that. - [Brent] Thunderbolt. - [Ken] Yes. So the Thunderbolt is part one of this process, but we need something else to go from the camera. So I'm mainly using this to convert my beefy Blackmagic Ursa Mini into basically a web cam on steroids, but we need to output with something. That's where we use SDI. So we're gonna come out of the camera through SDI, use our, oh I can't believe I haven't said this yet, conversion technology to convert the video into a Thunderbolt, I don't know if it's a signal or what, but it's, you know, it's something. (laughing) And then. - [Brent] It's being carried over Thunderbolt where the signal is. - It's being carried over. Right, yeah, I don't know technically what you wanna call it. So we'll hook this in. - [Brent] Almost. - Just gotta have a feel. - I see you're trying to plug in a Thunderbolt cable. - Shut. - Would you like help? - [Ken] Clippy, you can go jump off of this 11 story window right behind this. - You you you you follow this. - [Ken] Alright fine, you know what? You do it, oh. - There we go. It took two seconds. - [Ken] Yeah, well you're on that, gimme. - [Brent] Okay, would you like, would you like this? - Yes. - [Brent] Okay. - [Ken] I need to vape with this. (laughing) - [Brent] Please don't. - [Ken] So we got the Thunderbolt port on the back, plug it in, and then we take our SDI, oh. - [Brent] Software update required. - [Ken] Software update required. (laughing) Okay. We'll just do update now. You bitch. (laughing) Just let me do the thing. - See, that's the thing that I like about Windows. - Well if I, don't, I don't know. That's weird. - Yeah, isn't it like control or command F7? On Windows it just works. - [Ken] Yeah, whatever. Warning, do not shut down or unplug your computer. And now this is gonna be a little meta because you can't really see this part because this takes place on the actual camera. - On the camera. - [Ken] So I gotta plug in the SDI. - [Brent] Are we gonna get a video within a video within a video within a video? Like can this actually output while we're recording? - [Ken] Yeah. - [Brent] Oh. - [Ken] Dude, that's the thing I like about Blackmagic. Now this is again, we're getting kinda meta here and like breaking the 16th wall. I don't like to always acknowledge the fact that there's a camera here, but this episode is all about the Blackmagic camera and if you wanna actually see the episode where I unbox the Blackmagic camera, you can take a look at that too, but yes. The cool thing I like about the Blackmagic camera is it's a zero compromise device. You can record, view the video in real time on the build in screen and output two SDI signals simultaneously. There are other more expensive cameras I have used where you can only do like two of those things and like one will turn off when the other is running and it's horrible. The Blackmagic, there is no compromise. It just works. Alright, so now we're just gonna let the software finish updating and we'll be back with the turkey update. Well looky here, please power cycle. - [Brent] That is the most advanced terminology I have ever seen from a software updater. - [Ken] Well I mean, it makes sense because there's no power switch on here. It's all bus powered, so we gotta. - Oh, they mean the device. - [Ken] Oh yeah, you gotta unplug this. - Oh okay, that is a power. I think they were talking about the laptop for some reason. - No, that'd be stupid. You couldn't actually do that. The battery's built in. You'd have to like rip the battery out of the laptop. Alright, so I restarted it, I'm gonna hit okay, and it's magically gonna work. Is there like a light on here? Oh, it did. - Oh my God, it just works. - [Ken] Dude see, I love Blackmagic. Oh, there is a light on here, that's cool. It just does. - It's like inside, but yeah. - [Ken] It just fricking worked. Okay so now what do we do? Do we click it? Oh my God. Dude, this is so intuitive. (laughing) Dude, why can't everybody make shit like this. - [Brent] So SDI captured as, oh. - [Ken] Yeah, well let's have a look here, so conversions, input conversion. Oh that's cool, we can downscale. Don't really need that, I like the full 1080. - [Brent] And that's what that is, 1080. - Yep, progressive video. This is I guess segmented video. I don't know exactly what that means, but I don't need it. Okay so. - I'm guessing it's a little more than just interlaced. - [Ken] Yeah, I don't know actually. So we're gonna capture through SDI and then we should be able to quit this and now let's open up something like, let's open up something like QuickTime and there we go. As you can see, we have Blackmagic UltraStudio Mini recorder, it just shows up like a web cam and we even have sound as well, so we could capture the microphone we hook up to the Blackmagic as well so we can have better video quality but also better audio quality when doing live broadcasts. - It's also showing our focus peaking and everywhere we're overexposed. So do you wanna see all of our flaws? There they are. - [Ken] Well I mean, technically yeah, the zebras are there, but now actually, this would be, well first of all, video echo, so have fun with (laughing) the video echo in there. - [Brent] That's not too bad, like I've seen worse latency. - [Ken] Right. So here's what we do if we're outputting. So Brainiac Brent, I'll actually let you navigate this. Press the menu button on the Blackmagic. - [Brent] Alright. - [Ken] Alright, and then navigate to monitor. - Hold on. - Wait, wait. You gotta choose main SDI. - Main SDI. - [Ken] Then choose clean feed. - [Brent] Clean feed. - There you go. - Hey. - [Ken] See, so then this is what you would use if you wanna capture like through OBS, QuickTime, different live streaming service. I mean, it just shows up as a web cam so any software can interpret a web cam can now basically interpret a crazy advanced Blackmagic camera or any other SDI signal. It does audio, it does video, you can hook up microphones like through xlogay. Dude, it's crazy all the stuff you can do now. - [Brent] That is some very cool beans. - [Ken] Yeah, just with a what, $130 recorder? And then, you know, you gotta get a Thunderbolt cable for it and an SDI cable for it, so together, you're maybe looking at like $180, but it's an awesome solution and it's all bus powered. You don't need to power the recorder with anything else. - [Brent] I think people will be pretty interested in using this for screen recording, so if I grab my laptop and an HDMI cable, can we plug this in and show it working? - [Ken] No. Of course. (laughing) Alright, so Brainiac Brent has his laptop set up with HDMI, so. - [Brent] Here we are. - [Ken] Got the HDMI. Got the recorder, our conversion technology, so now I'm gonna plug the HDMI in. Okay well, I'm gonna attempt to. Alright, okay, so now we have SDI and HDMI going into the recorder. - [Brent] My laptop picked up on the fact it was plugged in. - [Ken] So basically, your laptop's just gonna think like you're plugging in another monitor or something, it's not gonna have as much overhead. - [Brent] Yep, it's set to duplicate right now. - [Ken] I'm thinking we click on here and we switch to HDMI. Boom. - [Brent] Wow. - [Ken] Boom goes the dynamite, I'm sorry, I stole that from somebody else. That's not my catchphrase. - [Brent] Yeah, there you go. So now just whatever I do, there you are. Yeah, and that looks like it's coming through at 60 FPS. - [Brent] Yeah, yeah, like. - [Ken] Yeah that's, I mean, obviously people watching the tech video log can't see that 'cause we're shooting at 24, but I'm using my eyeballs and it's 60. Yeah, so this is a way you could capture off of something, let's say you can't get screen recording software on something, this is a way to capture off of it, or let's say you can get screen recording software on something but it causes too my overhead and lag. You can just use a capture card and it will have virtually no overhead for the system. So now we're just capturing through a capture card in QuickTime. This is a sketch, yes it is. This is a sketch, that's right. (snapping fingers) This is a sketch. - I don't have a mouse or anything plugged in, so I'm literally just going off my track pad, that's an A. - This is, something in Russian. - [Brent] Yeah. (laughing) There you go. - [Ken] So Brainiac Brent was like scrolling through some stuff and I noticed some ghosting, and yeah, it looks like actually right now it's capturing at 59i, so it's interlacing at 59 hertz, so if you set it to 60 hertz. - [Brent] Yeah, I can't set it as progressive, which is interesting. I can force it to if I wanted to, but. - [Ken] Hit apply, I'm curious to see how that works. - There we go. - Now like drag a window around or scroll or something. - [Brent] Yeah, and then. - [Ken] It still looks like its ghosting a little bit. It's probably because of that interlaced. (knocking) Oh, there's someone at the door. That must be the pizza. - [Brent] So this is my personal favorite message when you go to create a custom resolutions. Altering resolutions may reduce system stability and use of the system and chip set, cause the chip set and other system components to fail, reduce system performance, cause additional heat or damage, effect system data integrity. Intel has not tested and does not warranty the operation of the chip set beyond its specs. Are you sure you wanna continue? It's 60 frames per second, we're really not doing that much. - [Ken] No, you're gonna burn like the freaking flux capacitor or something. Now that was the opposite of a pithy message if any of you guys like word of the day type things, pithy, there's your word of the day. Yeah, do it. Force it to like 60. Did you get like a progressive scan option? - [Brent] It is if you look here. Its only resolution is 60p. - Oh, 60p, yeah okay. Yeah. - [Brent] This custom resolution already exists, okay. - [Ken] What the shit? (laughing) Maybe it's not compatible with the capture card. - [Brent] Yeah. General settings, television. - 60 hertz, yeah. - I guess it should show up, but it's. - It says 60i. - [Brent] It says 60i. - [Ken] What? - [Brent] Yeah, it's interlaced. So I did discover I did something wrong here when I clicked add. You actually have to go down here and select the right display. - Good job, good job you incompetent ass wipe. - [Brent] 120, and there's more advanced shit if I really wanna (beeping) with this. - Sync with back porch? Do we need to install a back porch on this thing? (laughing) What the, I don't even know what that means. - [Brent] Picks a clock. - [Ken] Go back to the other thing. - [Brent] What the hell is happening? - [Ken] I can tell that's definitely. - [Brent] That text looks really weird in some locations. - Well, it's because it's hitting every other field, so like it looks like it's gonna get cropped of like as you're moving it 'cause it's hitting every other line. I didn't mean every other field, I meant every other line. It's like I saw you set it to 60p but it's not. Oh wait, no it. (laughing) I am going to throw this thing out this window. This is a very, we are very high up right now. If I throw this out there, I'd probably get arrested, but it would break. Okay. - [Brent] And I know someone on the 24th floor. - [Ken] Wait, who's on the 24th floor? - [Brent] I have no idea. - [Ken] Oh, are there even 24 floors in this building? Holy (banging), oh (beeping). (laughing) I'm like leaning out the window, I'm sorry. It does, it does. - [Brent] Ken, be very careful. - [Ken] It does kinda just go up forever. It's like the citadel, you know. - [Brent] Well I mean, all I have to do is just look on that touch screen that's like right outside the room. I was gonna say we can just look at that. - [Ken] So I just wanted to confirm how many floors are in here. So this is like the only elevator I use where like the thing turns on on the outside and you pick your floor from the outside, but yeah, it looks like there's 23, 20, 26? - [Brent] 26, at least. - [Ken] You know, just in case. I feel like I wanna play. - [Brent] Oh, no access. So it does go higher. - Oh, there's a secret floor. - [Ken] I feel like I'm playing like Deal or No Deal or something, you know like, pick a case. One of them has one million dollars. - [Brent] Well, it is 26 cases. - [Ken] That's what I'm saying, yeah. (laughing) - [Brent] Go back into that application. Yeah. Underneath about, user manual. - [Ken] How come you're so much smarter than me? - [Brent] 'Cause I pay attention. - [Ken] Ah, the cheese grater. (laughing) Oh, oh I missed the cheese grater so much. You can actually like put stuff in it. (laughing) Okay, well let's, yeah let's scroll through here. Okay, so we did a little testing that we couldn't necessarily show because the camera had to be switching modes for this, but I put the Blackmagic at 60 FPS and the whole thing went black, so I think this particular UltraStudio can't support 60 FPS at 1080. - [Brent] It will still do 60 interlaced or 30 progressive. - [Ken] So what we were looking at though is well we have this awesome manual, but the manual has like all these different products in it. There is a, like a version of this that's called like the UltraStudio Extreme or something like that, and I think that can do 4K at 60, so like there is a level up from this conversion technology in something that's more beefy that's probably a little bit more expensive. But yeah, I mean, you have options out there. Just depends on how much you wanna spend. Honestly, I bought this for 30 FPS capturing, you know, 1080 for open broadcaster, so it works for my needs, but if you're gonna do, if you wanna do like 60 FPS progressive like desktop capture or game console capture, then yeah, you would probably need to get the. - You might wanna bump up or look into another brand 'cause I know Alvern Media has it. - Shh, (beeping) your other brands. I'm kidding. - [Brent] I know Alvern Media is a common solution for people who are looking to do hardware capturing for games. - [Ken] I typed in Safari, I typed in sad. (laughing) That sums up my feelings right now. (laughing) Okay. Let's, that was a mistake. - [Brent] Oh, it wasn't. Just in case you need a server rack mount. - It looks like there's a couple different versions of this thing. - [Brent] To say the least. - [Ken] Yeah, this is the 12G SDI Ultra HD, this is the UltraStudio 4K Extreme 3 which doesn't have enough, you know, inputs on it. But anyway, for what we need to do, we're good. So yeah, I mean, I'm calling this a win. Hold up, we have a situation here and I apologize for the nasally voice. Apparently I got sick on the way back from Pittsburgh. Something is not functioning quite right, so I'm gonna run some tests and show you the results and then after that, I'm gonna give you a sneak peak of the next Krazy Ken episode. Oh my gosh, it's gonna be horrible. So let's take a look and run some tests. So when I got this setup up and running, or so I thought, I conducted a live Computer Clan Live, that was redundant, episode with Computer Clan organizer, Brent. - You know to speak. - Right. - [Ken] And there were times when the audio went out of sync and this is actually the OBS setup we used, so let's take a look at what I did. So when I first set the camera up, I noticed the audio in the video did not sync up, so I applied a manual delay and then it was fine, but then as we were streaming, everything went out of sync again and we had to change the number of milliseconds for the delay. So it was like it was varying. Very bizarre. I'm not sure if I should blame the software, I'm not sure if I should blame the camera, not sure if I should blame the converter or the capture card, whatever you wanna call it, I really don't know who to blame. So let's run a very advanced test. I'm gonna flick the wall and you should see my finger flick the wall at the same time you see a spike in the audio meter down here. I'm using the camera's built in microphone to do this test, so if you see the meters jump right when my finger hits the wall, that means inside of OBS, things are synced up. Alright, let's give it a shot. That looked pretty good. My finger hit the wall right when the things bounced. So 500 milliseconds seems to be fine so far, so I'm gonna let this run for a while and get back to you in a bit. Place your bets. Is it gonna F up? Okay, so I've been letting the camera sit for a good chunk of time, probably over a half hour now, and we're gonna see if there's still a syncing issue. This time it looks like it is off by a little bit. Okay. So now we're gonna continue process of elimination. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna quit OBS and relaunch it. If it goes back to normal, we can assume maybe the software is to blame. If it doesn't, then something on the hardware side is probably to blame, so let's find out. Alright, we're back inside of OBS and let's do the little tap test. As you can see there, the syncing was now even more severe. Nothing changed on the capture card. I changed no settings with the card, no settings with the camera, I just relaunched the software, yet it seems worse. Let's see if something changed, nope. Yeah, the milliseconds are the same. I'm starting to wonder if this is maybe an issue with OBS and not an issue with my capture card. What I'm gonna do next is I'm going to stress test the camera in a different program, maybe just QuickTime just to do a simple recording instead of running it through an open source live streaming software. That'll be next. Let's do the same test. (tapping) That seems out of sync. Okay, so I believe we just narrowed down something. It is not OBS, so it is likely not a software issue. There might be something wrong with the capture card 'cause I'm looking at the levels bouncing on Blackmagic camera. You can't see them right now, but I can. They're in sync, so something between the camera and the computer is throwing the video and audio out of sync, alright. So again, I'm calling this a stalemate right now, but I'm not giving up. I contacted Blackmagic support, I'm gonna see what they say and I'm gonna continue testing, as Glados says. And now, let's take a look (dramatic music) at a sneak peak of the next Krazy Ken episode, which I'm only showing you because you are thousands of my closest friends. (laughing) I'm with Brainiac Brent and we have nothing better to do than fiddle with an old Power PCG with an iMac and get it to run some classic arcade games from out childhoods past. Sorry it's late, I'm Salty Ken now. Krazy Ken is gone, I am now Salty Ken. - [Brent] Yeah, but. Rote, oh wait, if you thought that was bad, just wait for the rotating (beeping) cube. - [Ken] Oh my God, are you kidding me? I wanna, oh my gosh, (laughing) how are you supposed to play these games? Oh there it is. - [Brent] I was gonna say. - [Ken] Son of a bitch. - [Brent] Oh my. Can't make this shit up. Fuck. (loud beeping) Aw, nevermind. - [Ken] Son of a bitch, I just wanna play Batman. (laughing) Oh my gosh. It's gonna be terrible. Look forward to that, mark your calendars. Next week . . . catch the crazy and pass it on.",

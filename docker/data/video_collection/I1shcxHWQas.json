Simply attach it to any surface, connect an audio source and watch the magic happen!  From the manufacturer -  As Seen on ABCs hit show Shark Tank. The Rock-It portable vibration speaker system takes music from your device and turns it into vibration sequences. It sends those vibrations through the Rock-It pod which sticks to ANY object.

    "transcript": "The wild and whacky world of gadgets continues to produce things to show here on Unbox Therapy *wheeze* *dies a bit on the inside* Things are about to get zany! *high pitched voice* *weird emulated noise* Today, I'ma show you how to turn any surface, This is what they're telling me. Any surface, into a speaker. It's called the Rock-IT 3.0 *slams box* Plug it, stick it, ROCK IT! Connect it to an audio source and then attach this little unit to any surface, And now you've got a speaker?! We've got a few things down here that we're gonna test out and see if this is actually true. Rock-IT uses bins, boxes, travel, umbrellas, cars, beds, cups, lamps, printers. Printers? Alright, lets check it out! *throws box at camera* *chortles* We're friends, forever. *strokes camera* *awkwardly makes heart* Closed Caption Creators: He loves you, dearly. <3 That is,- that's the Rock-IT 3.0 So USB on one end, and then audio, and USB on the other Some extra sticky pads, cuz' that's how this thing works, it sticks Little user manual, we're gonna try not to read.. THAT! *throws* On the back you've got an on-off switch, volume control, and audio in port. And there's also a built in mini-jack cable. Obviously not for use in your iPhone 7. *rim shot* And the cable- look at that. Isn't that nifty? This is the magic part. Sticky piece is what will turn anything into a speaker. You keep this little guy in your pocket, and you're ready to turn anything into a speaker at all times. Let's give it a shot! SO, I picked up a couple of everyday household items Glass, bowl, an iPhone box, Mountain Dew can, look at that. *clink* Now, I'm told that the more hollow, an object, the better it's going to sound, or the louder. So, *shrugs* I dunno, let's give that a shot. What does it sound like if it's not connected to anything. Let's see... *node(?) wobbles around, with quiet music from the phone* So, it's vibrating, *music* but, SUPER quiet Now let's see what happens.. *clink* *amplifies music, quietly(?)* *glass cup vibrates on table* PFHH *stares at menace of a cup* *ponders what the meaning of life is* That is weird. *music plays a bit more clearly* Alright, I'm just going to try just the table. OK? *music is muffled but plays a little bit louder* What the- What's going on here? iPhone box. *music plays louder and sightly clearer* *music improves* Haha! Is this like, speaker technology right now? Do we just-? Uncover something here? *music plays loudly* *music stops and becomes very quiet* *sound amplifies, Mountain Dew can vibrate* (punz) *happy noise* *music plays louder* *sick beats plays* CCC: Enjoying the video? :D *laughs* *music becomes quite* The O.E. bottle *music changes to hollow like(?) sound* Let's try this big box right here. *music amplifies to the MAX* *mystified* *music plays* What is going on? *music becomes faint and quiet* Now...Box *becomes loud AF* Why- Woul- Why does a box- Why do boxes work so well? Close Caption Creators: I dunno just gonna.. *sicks beats keep playing* GIMME THE SCIENCE JACK! *music keeps playing* That is by far the loudest we've had yet. By far. *places on camera* *music plays* *laughs* That- That is bizarre. My whole- Brain is shaking right now. *places Rock-IT 3.0 in wood trunk box* *plays magically* Stick it to ANYTHING! *sticks on Mountain Dew can, again* *plays* I mean it's pretty crazy! You stick it to anything and you're gonna amplify your music. Find yourself a box, find yourself a flat surface You got yourself a party!",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and I'm here with Ro. - And today we are back playing some Nintendo Switch. - It's been a long time, - Yes. since we played Switch together - It's been too long and it's terrible. - I mean, it was probably when the Switch first came out, we played like the, we were milking cows? - We did all of the funny games. Ready for some cow udders. Top, bottom, okay, top, bottom. Top, bottom. You get a gallon? - You did five cups, that's okay. My first time milking, I got like two cups. Today we're playing the new Super Mario Bros U Deluxe that just came out. Actually, it came out a little while ago, but I haven't got a chance to play it yet. - Me either. - But, we are going to play through some of the little challenges. So, the first one I'm gonna try and play was Boost Rush. - Okay - So, I don't know, I haven't played this yet, so we'll see how it goes. Two people are playing. - Two people. - I mean I guess I'll play Mario and Luigi, right? - Yeah, you can be your Mii? - I guess so, look at that. - No way! - Okay I'll be Mario. - Okay! - Okay, hat, no hat? - You even have little overalls on. - I can pick a hat? (gasp) - Yes, you need a hat. - I wanted a hat. Yes, yes, yes. - Yes! - Let's just play easy. - Please do. I've been playing a lot of Mario Kart, for years-- - Oh my gosh, okay. - But not, I haven't done this for years. This has been years since I've played. - Yeah, wow, wow, okay. - What do these do? What do these do? (gasp) I'm a squirrel, I'm a squirrel, I'm a squirrel. - (giggles) So, I think the more coins. - Oh no, I'm not a squirrel, I'm not a squirrel. - Speed up. - Speed up? We're too slow, we're too slow. - We gotta speed up. - We're just gonna blow through this level. - Yes, oh my gosh. - Let's do it, let's run. Run, run, run, run, - I'm trying! (mumbles) - I'm jumping on your head, oh wait, do we need to go up? (mumbling) Jump on top of me. - Speed up, speed up, speed up! - Speed up, speed up, we're up, we're up. - Oh my goodness, so it gets faster as we progress through. - Whoa, take that! Little Goombas, and gotcha! (makes up own sound effects) - It's probably going to get super fast as we go through the level, here we go! - It's just gonna get faster and faster and faster. - Oh, my gosh, speed runs. - Girl, uh-oh. (makes own sound effects) How do you fly? How do you, no, no, no. - No! It's okay, it's okay I'm still alive. - I started watching you, to see how you were doing it, - I wasn't going to speed up, I'm not ready, I'm not ready. (gasps) - Girl, run. (Justine screams) Run I'm stuck, don't leave me behind. I'm no good at this. - The wind is like pressing back on me, I'm trying. - Save yourself! Win it for the both of us, I'll float in. - Oh my goodness, okay, I'll see you soon. - Yup. - There's no time for that! - There I am, no that's not me that's a mushroom. I'm back, don't die Ro. Just don't die, just don't die. - Speed up! I'm here for you. - Win it for us Justine. - I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin' for the win, I'm stuck! - It's all on your shoulders. - Yes! Join me, join me, join me! - No pressure but I suck at these games. - No, you're good, look we beat it. (giggles) and we had time to spare. - Okay, oh, dang it this is fast. - How am I, oh my gosh, we're at max speed! (yelling) - [Both] No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I'm still here, - Justine, Justine! - I'm still here. - Get out of there! - Oh, this is fun. - Oh no, oh no, oh no, run, run, run, Ro, run Ro, you little nugget! Run, run, run faster than your little nugget legs, - I'm going as fast as I can go. - Have ever run before! - This is incredible. - Run, run, you're stuck, you're stuck, oh no. - It's okay. - Oh no, oh no, no, no, ah, no, no, no. - Oh my goodness, this is so incredible. Okay, now it's slowing down. - It slowed down? (mumbles) - Oh my gosh, max speed! It's so crazy! - Oh jeez, oh jeez, no, no, no, no, no, oh my gosh, I'm still alive, how'd that happen, we don't know. - I'm so much better at these games though when, it's not, when I'm not going slow. - Keep fallin' into this quicksand, you guys. - Oh my gosh, it's going so fast. - This is a terrible time to come back into the game. - It's a terrible time! - Okay, here we go, here we go, here we go. Max speed, max speed. Run, run, run, run, - Oh my goodness! - Run, run, run, jump, run, run, run, jump, (gasp) boom. (video game cheers) (both exhale loudly) - This is stressful. - Just, just, yeah. - I like the speed runs, though, 'cause it forces you, you have to keep going. That was fun, there's our best record, - But look how happy is he? - We could go back, and try to beat them. This is cool. - What I like about it, is that if you start with a bad run, you can always improve and always get better. - It's true, now let's go and do Coin Battle. - Oh, what is this? - How many people are playing? - You can be Luigi. - Okay, Okay. So, basically we just wanna collect coins. - That's all you have to do? - Lets pick a random battle. - This will pick it for you? - Yeah, so it's gonna pick us, - A surprise? - Yes. - What do we do? - We gotta collect coins. - Oh my gosh, I thought I was Mario. - I know I got confused too, I was like, wait! - We gotta get that big coin, get that big coin. - So, here's the thing, I think we may actually be playing against each other. - What, really? - Like a friendly competition, it's a friendly competition. - Well, I like when you play Mario Kart and all the mini games, and you have your little balloons and stuff, I like that, I actually enjoy it. - Yeah, the battle modes are always super fun. - Let me try to pick this up, and I'll run up the stairs, throw it up here, boom, boom. (making own sound effects) - This is great, so, I should be trying to collect coins because, that's basically the name of the game. (chuckles) - Okay, just get all the coins, get all the coins. - We wanna collect coins. - Eat all the coins. I have this, I throw this over here. (Justine yells) Oh no, wait! - It's okay. - I can hurt you? - Yeah, you can, because, this is battle, we want, - Oh, okay. - So, right now it looks like you're winning. - I didn't like that because, (Justine laughs) I thought I was throwing it at these little fighting guys. - No, it's okay, that's basically what you wanna be doing. - I thought we were throwing it at these little, okay, c'mon little Luigi, little Luigi, get up there, little Luigi. (screams) - I didn't wanna throw it at you, 'cause I felt bad. - That's really sweet, 'cause I really suck at this. So, it would just be like, (sighs) - I mean, we are just collecting coins though. - Oh my gosh, these guys are real aggressive. - They are. (gasp) - He just killed me, he just knocked me out. - It's okay, you're back. - C'mon, c'mon, I'm hitting the button, where am I? - But, at what point does the game end? (Ro making sound effects) Does it, do we just, - I need to take some boxing classes, girl, because, I feel like if we do, are you kidding, (Justine mumbles) I just walked out the door. I didn't mean to do that, - I'm Mario. - I thought I was you. - I'm Mario. - I thought I was you. - See, that's the problem that we've been having, because we keep switching. - We keep switching, and then I think, oh jeez. I'm dead. - It's okay. (mumbling) - At this point, are we surprised? - Actually, you would have beat me, 'cause you collected more coins. (Ro laughs and mumbles) - I knew that we were gonna have this problem because, when I was like oh, you've been Mario, the whole time. - And then we switch. What is happening, what is happening? (Justine squeals) - Oh gosh! - Okay, okay, get the coins, get the coins. - Alright. - Go Justine, go! Get the coins, okay I'm green, I'm green, Ro, you're green. You're green. - I'm Mario. - You are green girl, you are, - I'm Mario. - Also need to go, okay. I'm Luigi, I'm Luigi, I am Little Luigi. I am Luigi. (gasps) We're underwater! - Water levels, are all sorts of trouble. - Oh, look at us go! Look at the pretty pearl, I want it. - Gosh, I'm having so much nostalgia playing these, and playing these maps again. - We gotta get the coins. We gotta get the coins, no, no, no, no, no. Do these things chase you, do they chase you? - Yeah, kind of? - Are they smart, or do they have a traveled course? - I think that they may have a traveled course. Oh, he's trying to get me, he's trying to get me, oh my gosh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (Ro mumbles) - It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. (mumbles) Up here? Tricked ya, fooled ya, fooled ya sucker! Oh, oh, oh, oh, I want it. (Justine groaning) Got it, yeah! Look at all these coins, - So many. - Coins, coins, coins, coins, coins, coins (both scream) No, no, no, no, that's a huge, creepy dragon eel. I mean, how's that fair? - I don't know, I'm just gonna, I don't like this level. (mumbles) - We did it! - We did. See, I like when we play together not against each other. - It's harder, - 'Cause this is, competitive and I don't like being competitive. - I already have a hard enough time as it is, so, if it's not a teamwork situation, I might as well be in that floaty bubble the entire game. - Well at least this is cumulative so, as we keep playing you could potentially win this next round. Oh shoot, I thought I was you! - Oh no! Look at my, I'm alive, I'm living, I am living, I lived, I lived. - Oh my goodness. - Okay, that is just a life lesson for don't ever give up, don't you ever give up on yourself because, if you keep jumping, you could live. - It's true, oh boy. So we gotta go in here? (video game beeping) - Am I supposed to go in there? - I don't know, I think maybe you will join me, and you did. - Magic. (gasps) - Yes, okay, they have helmets, they have gear. - They do, I'm just runnin' - Wee! - Because see, Here's my thought is like I already collected so many. Look at your blue little hat. - I really like the blue fit. - I do too, it's super cute. So, that was the final round, I like the Coin Rush, that's fun. - I need to play this a bunch of times, just to get better. - We need to just have a game night, like an actual game night, not recording, - Can we do it? - Yeah, we should. - I'm coming over to your house, you have a better gaming setup than me. - I'll get us both a nice setup, it'll be incredible. - I'll bring some snacks, you have the games, done. - What are these? Oh, I think it's only for one player. - Okay, do it, I'll cheer you on. I'll be over here cheerleader. - Alright, lets try it. - Yes, yes, yes. - Time attack, so they're basically speed runs. (gasps) Okay, let's do it, reach over there, so I gotta reach it in 53 seconds or less, to get gold. Here we go. - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, - I'm pretty good at going fast. - Look at you cruise, you are really fast. - But I'm not, oh my, this is going to be so addicting. No! Too bad, I get real feisty. - See, I always feel like those are close calls 'cause I feel like you land on his head, maybe it just wasn't high enough, is that why? - Yeah so now I know but I just thought that I'd be able to jump over it, but I didn't. - They're so cute! - Justine, I don't know if you know this but, I actually made popsicles that look like little Goombas. - (Justine gasps) That's so cute! - Yeah, they were delicious, I think they were root beer flavored, it was a while back, on Nerdy Nummies but they were delicious and they looks just like Goombas. - That's so cute. - So, I feel like. - Look at you fly, you fly girl. - I mean, I might actually, oh no, no, no, that hurt, that hurt. - There's two, there's two. - That hurt me, oh my goodness, I'm not gonna get it. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - I didn't get it, I missed, I didn't get 50, I didn't get it, I got silver. I'm so upset. - What did we want gold? - Platinum? - You want gold. - Diamond? - You want first place, - What's the tiers, ruby? - I mess one single little thing, you gotta reach it in 40 seconds or less? These are so hard, 30-- - 30 seconds? - 30 seconds, what? - Go girl, go. Fly like those little legs have never flown before! Just fly, just cruise on top of all of these. Don't even care about anything. - I'm not. - Go, go, go. - Oh, that hurt, that hurt. - No, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it. (yelling in defeat) - One more, one more, one more, that's it. - We got this. - This is so fun. - This is like Olympics, it has bronze, silver and then gold just like the medals. That's how they do it, makes a lot of sense. Go, go, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, - Oh, shoot. - That's okay, that's a little slow, but you know what, fine, fine, fine, we can get it back, we can get it back. - I don't think we can, I don't think we can. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, - No, 'cause it's 30 seconds I didn't get it, I didn't get it, that's like impossible, that's like, that's so hard. - Bro, that's a medal, we'll take it. - It's a medal we'll take it. - Take it, you're still in the Olympics, who cares. - I feel like this may be my new addiction, just playing these. Well thanks for playing this with me. - You are very welcome, and I'm proud of you, look at these medals. - This is incredible, well I think for the next videos, we should probably try to play through the acutal game. So, that would be really fun. - One, it will be really fun. Two, I'm sort of scared but I love it. - No, you shouldn't be scared, it'll be fun. - Okay. - Okay. Well guys, thank you so much for watching, go check out Ro's channel, we have some fun videos coming out very shortly for you guys. Do you guys wanna see more gaming stuff? Yes, no? - Please say yes, okay you guys let's just put it out there, I know I suck at gaming, okay it's all out there, cards are on the table, I'm not hiding anything, but I love it. - It's so fun. - I have so much fun, and I love gaming with this one. - It's so fun, - And she teaches me things, so I'll get better over time. - We will, we'll definitely, we'll both progress. - I'll start at the dirt level, and we'll move up to bronze and silver, and all those other things. - Well we should definitely play Mario Kart one day, 'cause that would be really fun. - I'm actually okay at that, I'm mediocre at that. - Okay guys, that's it, Ill see you guys later, bye!

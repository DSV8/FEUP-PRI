    "transcript": "what's up guys I'm Dimitri and well I'm at Legion Lenovo and look what we found the new Y740 laptop let's take a look at it but first huge thanks to our sponsors thermaltake Phanteks MSI Razer and Corsair for making this trip possible so this is the Y700 series refresh for the lgion line of notebooks now with RTX graphics from Nvidia with the RTX 2060 and RTX 2070 max-q for the 15 inch and up to 2080 max Q for these 17 inch larger screen models these will start at $1600 a very competitive price point for than RTX you know equipped notebook and will have plenty of unique upgrades like a Dolby vision HDR panel option that goes up to 500 minutes of brightness and that's probably not full panel brightness but just like short flashes during really bright scenes and HDR mode and HDR content they are g-sync ready at 144 Hertz and only 1080p resolution so nothing tire and well it kind of looks like a really solid gaming panel especially with an RTX 2060 and you'll basically fly with fps and another hardware change is an option for overclocked memory up to 3200 megahertz if you opt out for this 16 gigabyte model and I really like this chassis design it's all practical as you have some USB ports on the side and audio ports on the other side but majority of i/o is actually located at the back with illuminated signs so you can see the port selection illumination on the ventilation ports looks awesome on the sides and in the back to the keyboard illumination is controlled via coursers IQ software so it's a nice collaboration and the trackpad is precise with smooth navigation the webcam isn't a bit of a poor location but the bezels are quite thin and the hinge feels robust and you know while their slogan is kind of terrible with the style meets average y740 and y540 notebooks kind of need that balance of design and power and then there is this monitor the widest thing that we've seen the show for right now the Y44w dash tank keyboard what are your thoughts it's a very wide monitor and I think there's a lot of screen real estate that you can play around with most particularly if you want to do a picture-in-picture mode you can have two displays or two different systems plug it into the monitor and like do your thing Wow very impressed Michael I think it's a great motor for productivity provided you can take care of the body of 100 and say I have no idea what I want to say it's great to see freesync 2 on this monitor if only they had an AMD GPU option it's all of their systems why do they not have any games installed like I don't get it I do agree with you guys and you know I would love to see some games install and PC just so you can get the true experience I don't know if we are going to be seeing something even wider than this later but that would be kind of extreme and hilarious hilarious not low-larious its file areas it's wide larious all right we got to get out because they are having a private event and we got ok but for real the specs on the Y44w monitor are kind of unique so it's a 44 inch panel with a pretty substantial 1,800 our curvature so it's almost the size of 2 24 inch panels it's got an odd resolution of 3840 by 1200 so the aspect ratio is 32 by 10 and it's great for multi window workflows but what about game support the refresh rate is 144 Hertz that's really nice it supports AMD freesync 2 it has HDR 400 specifications so it's not too bright at only 400 nits there is a detachable speaker built into the stand that is Bluetooth I find that really interesting plus this convenient drop-down IO with an audio jack and some USB ports and for the back IO we have duo Type C so you can charge other accessories or use it for display output we're not sure about the price yet but for a curved ultrawide gaming monitor it's got some interesting characteristics so let us know and this is your style thanks for watching we'll see you guys in the next video",

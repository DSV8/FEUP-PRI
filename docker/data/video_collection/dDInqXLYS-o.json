    "transcript": "- [Jonathan] Today's video is sponsored by LG. (calm electronic music) Yo guys, Jonathan here. 2018 is gone; January freaking flew by. So, before we dive too deep into the year, and before the tech gets crazy, I wanna showcase five really cool gadgets. First up is the larger than life, but somehow still compact and portable 17 inch LG Gram. This is packing a massive 2560 by 1600 resolution, and even though the screen is big, it is the anti-thick. It almost doesn't make sense how light this thing is. That makes this a perfect laptop to travel with, whether usin' it for business, for school, and on top of that, you get monster batter life. Up to 19 and a half hours. That is a lot Simpson videos. Now even though the laptop is lightweight, you are not sacrificing power. Inside is a Quad Core Intel chip, dual channel memory, and up to one terabyte of M.2 Solid State Storage. That is freaking tasty. You got ports on ports on ports. Everything you could possibly need and a brilliantly located finger print reader. So overall, this is a really well rounded laptop. Next up from there, we can all agree there are roughly 864,000 battery banks on Amazon right now, and for the most part they all look the same. Which is why I really like this one. Normally when you have a gadget like this, they look cool, but they're not the most functional. How many banana USB drives have you seen on Amazon and then realize, \"Crap, these are USB 2.0\" and nobody's got time for that. You're not getting anchor style quick charging, but you're also not getting bang you head into a wall one amp charging, which nobody has time for. The cherry on the cake though, is this has a lightning port which most battery banks don't. So you getting a little but of USB-C flavor, a little lightning, and this kinda just has the perfect recipe for that gadget that you need to pick up. From there, we are rapidly entering the world of USB-C. More and more things are adopting it, but the problem is there is a lack of really good USB-C headphones and Razor was like, \"Yo, we can fix that.\" Not only do these things sound good, they got a name that would rival, Mufasa. Okay, the name's actually not that cool, it's a little lame, but they really do sound freaking amazing. Build quality is on point, I love the fact that you have inline controls. For that, if you have that with a pair of headphones that just makes things so much more convenient. Using your voice is cool but sometimes you don't want to be that guy or girl out there saying, \"Hey Google play Lit Poppy.\" This way you can rock that incognito. Pretty much every single device out there minus the iPhone, I am looking at you Tim Cook, has USB-C, so if we can get to that point where we can charge, transfer data, and have really good sounding USB-C headphones that is the win. Now next from there, I am a huge fan of Logitech mice. So if you wanna bring that quality with a splash of wireless into the gaming world, the G903 is a fantastic option. From there, what's even cooler if you wanna turn on God mode and never charge your mouse again you can pair it with the Power Play Mouse Pad. Which charges the G903 wirelessly while you're using it. Now, I'm not a gamer by means, so Dave2D I personally apologize for this mediocre Fornite footage, but at the very least my guy Stevie got wrecked with really low latency. Next up from there, the Blue Yeti had been a staple not only in audio but in Youtube for a really long time now. And recently they packaged it together with this really sexy arm that clamps onto your desk and gives you everything you need to record beautiful, crisp audio. Whether you're trying to do gaming, or voiceovers, or podcasting, or maybe you're throwing out some gems. This thing is extremely versatile and sounds great with pretty much anything that you throw at it. For the money, I don't think there is a better option out right now. It looks great, it sounds great, and again I sound like a broken record, but having the ability to connect directly to your computer with USB is super handy. Sliding from that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video. If you did and you are feeling like being awesome, make sure you guys smash that like button. One like equals one prayer for Stevie. - It's cool. - Everything featured in the video is linked down below. Again, that you guys for watching and I will catch you guys later. You've heard Lit Poppy, right?",

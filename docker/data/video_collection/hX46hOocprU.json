    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   Alienline 3D Smartphone -   This smartphone is the first I've seen that features a 3D display without the glasses. 3D functionality is limited to certain apps but given the right video file the effect can be pretty amazing. That said, there are some drawback... When using the phone without 3D function the display isn't the brightest and viewing angles are poor. This is likely do to the integrated technology necessary for the 3D experience.  From the manufacturer -   More than a decade of combined research and technical development by American, Australian and Asian scientists, engineers and technicians has come together under the name of Alienline. As a result of their brilliant work a revolutionary naked-eye 3D screen has been created. Yes, naked-eye! which means theres no additional components needed to experience 3D visual impressions. No special 3D glasses, no virtual sets, just simply watch and enjoy. And its because this real 3D display does all the work by itself including delivering color-segmented frames separately to your left and right eyes.  The special geometry surface of an added extra polymer layer decodes the polar- and color segmentation so that each eye sees only what was designed for it to see, creating a perception of depth. The Right Eye image is specially segmented, matching the prisms Right side of the polymer surface. This lets only the Right image to be visible. The Left Eye image is segmented differently, matching the prisms Left side of the polymer surface. This lets only the Left image to be visible. The display switches between the Left and Right eye images at up to 100 frames per second (that's really) alternately segmenting each frame.  The human brain synthesizes the two images into a single image, creating the perception of depth. We designed a polymer layer with a specially engineered surface. Applying this extra layer on the parallax barrier line the whole screen itself becomes a Real 3 Dimensional Ultra High Quality Display. Thus 3D glasses are not needed anymore. Alienline 3D Smartphones and Tablet Phones are designed to allow you to comfortably watch a movie while reducing ghosting and image blur, which are side effect previously experienced with any kind of 3D glasses. And as an extra feature you can also enjoy our newly developed 3D operating platform specially designed for Android users.

    "transcript": "supposed to be three-dimensional here's the thing you never really caught on think the biggest part of that reason is the fact that you had to wear these funky looking 3d glasses and people didn't want to wear them the real thing that got me excited at the time was this idea of naked eye 3d that's right I said naked 3d without fancy funky glasses this is a phone from a company called alien line they were like we have a naked eye glasses list 3d smartphone i did a little bit of research found out that it's an indiegogo campaign happening right now I'm gonna have a link in the description if you want to check it out but their claim here is that they've got the 3d smartphone of your dreams and it will not require funky glasses seems pretty crazy let's take a look at this phone so its gold and look at that big badge not for sale so they've certainly sent me their prototype I hope it's not their only one but they sent it to me it looks to have maybe that's a fingerprint reader on the back I mean a pretty standard smartphone layout power brick micro USB cable and headset ok so pretty standard stuff the banging intro track now the first thing I notice is the display in general kind of has like almost a layered look to it when I do that make that little adjustment you can see how it's different essentially you're looking at a pretty basic android layout but the magic happens in these icons up here k 3dx gallery 3d video camera 3d player and 3d camera obviously you're not going to see those things on a standard Android device that is unusual I'm fairly certain that you will not be able to make that out because after all you're looking at a single camera lens not you know stereoscopic eyeballs maybe one day they can take 3d content movies and make that available here without the glasses right so I don't know let me what the whoa whoa that is very 3d the thing is poking me with it's right around this range again you can't see that what do you see you just see oh that's actual 3d wow I did not expect it to be this effective I really did not it looks good it's almost like the effect gets better and more comfortable the longer that i look at it they reloaded some provocative images in here would you say that's provocative Jack look at the images all in the gallery it's obvious loaded this up this must be jack affect my understanding to make your own 3d images when you snap a photo you keep moving upwards got it that's super bizarre for verification for bringing Chaz in he's gonna tell you people well what do you see it or not? Chaz: \"I can see it. it's got like a bunch of tools and it looks three-dimensional\" These are not not 3d glasses Chaz: \"yeah it's working with or without the spectacles\" Chaz, say hello to the world. very very is ok so the last one to try here gmax 3d game maybe like a little bit of a 3d effect it looks mostly like the 2-d game with like a little bit of extra tiny bit of depth honestly I've tried a lot of different 3d on TVs and such this is some of the most effective 3d I've seen and you can't really see it but I promise you these are legit 3d video files naked eyes these are naked eye while they have these grab his eyes are naked ok",

    "transcript": "It's called the Rocketbook Wave that is a weird name for a notebook(1), but it's because it implies something incredibly unusual for a notebook(2) This notebook(3) goes in the microwave. How many times am I going to say notebook(4) in this video? I dont know. Put a counter down below. Why would you want to put a notebook in the microwave(5), Lew? Oh, I don't know, because it erases everything in it? Let that percolate... You get yourself a fresh notebook(6), fill it up with all yo' notes, and then you're done. Stick it in the microwave, set it, forget it, pull it out, and it's an empty notebook(7). It's crazy. Maybe you write in your diary and... you're a guy like Jack and you're talkin' about weird stuff... Delete the evidence! \"Send handwritten notes to your favorite cloud services\" So if you do wanna keep those notes, you can save em' to the cloud and then erase your notebook(8) in the microwave and re-use it. Start all over again. Genius! \"Your microwave must contain a rotating glass turntable\" Mine has it. Fill a coffee mug 3 quarters full with water, you place it on the circle on top of the notebook(9), you let it run Flip your book, you do it on the other side, and then you've got an empty notebook(10). How gangster is that? A regular Pablo Escobar. I wonder if he had a notebook(11) or not? I don't remember how much this is, but if you think about it, what should you really pay for a notebook(12) that never runs out? The infinity notebook(13). Oh, it's actually pretty nice! Wow! Look at those pages! A little QR scanner in the bottom. That's for saving particular pages to the app. Ooh, it looks fancy. It's a Pilot Ball Friction. Nothin' like some ball friction. Wow. It's just a normal pen. Oh, it's erasable! It's an erasable pen. Let's do a test. \"There once was a man named Jack.\" There's Jack! Jack the elephant. *laughs* \"Jack was a sad man. *nasal snickering* *wheezes* \"Nobody liked Jack.\" Even more sad. \"One day, Jack died.\" Jack's lookin' like a... some kinda seal there. \"The world rejoiced. It's a balloon, by the way. Yaaaay! It's because Jack's dead finally that they're happy. Hahahahaha Finally, he's making everybody sad! Look at em'! Let's just scribble one or two on the backside That's probably what your notes look like I'm guessing. This is where the mug goes. Oh, shoutout to... they're called Printer Pics, so check them out... I guess they do custom mugs. \"Microwave your Wave until the Blue Rocket logo inside the white circle disappears.\" That Wave logo is gonna disappear. The anticipation is intense right here. *sniff* It smells like popcorn in here Jack! Like this... The moment of truth here! Ok, 30 seconds is up Oh, the logo is still on there. Let's do a minute. Ooh, the logo's gone! Let's flip this baby over... And let's do uh... I think 45 is probably sufficient. Woah-ho-ho-ho, that is so weird! There's like a little bit of butter there, I think there's a bit of leftover butter in the microwave. The truth! And whether or not this is actually the infinite notebook(14) I mean it's pretty damn faded. I gotta be honest. That is cool. Haha! Even this page where I was like super junky with it... To give you an idea, like this is what an actual penstroke looks like. You see what I mean, like, comparatively speaking it faded it a lot. Is it the infinite notebook(15)? Probably not, but it is definitely gonna be good for like 5, 6, maybe even 10 uses. But then when you include the digital aspect with the app and the ability to save your notes, I guess maybe in that sense it is the infinite(16) notebook because those could go on forever. Otherwise, look at this, even dead Jack is pretty much gone. Maybe I would've been more interested in school if I could put my notebook(17) in the microwave. All those sweat and tears you were like A+! Please! And then you're like NUKE IT!",

    "description": "The MacBook Air just doesn't make sense anymore... Sign up for Storyblocks Video today -   Buy MacBook Pro -  Buy MacBook Air -  Buy 12\" MacBook -   Apple continues to make their phones, tablets, and laptops thinner and thinner each year. MacBook Air remains an underpowered laptop with a form factor that's nearly identical to MacBook Proand for nearly the same price. Apple's product stack is confusing as-is, but having the 12\" MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro all cost the same makes things even tricker. In this video, we'll test everythingfrom thickness, weight, keyboard, trackpad, TouchID, I/O and USB, Thunderbolt, displays, speakers, webcam, battery, SSD speed, Geekbench, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, thermal performance, fan noise, and at the end... declare a victorthe BEST Apple Laptop!",

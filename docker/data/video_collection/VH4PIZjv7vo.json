    "description": "Artisan hand-crafted keycaps it's a thing, and some of them are hundreds if not thousands of dollars. So why is it a thing? Well, people like what they like, and if they're willing to spend money on it, why not? But where do you store them?  Check out the ARCHETYPE Chronos at   #shorts",

    "transcript": "- In the Mechanical Keyboard community, you can get artisan keycaps for your keyboard that can cost you hundreds of dollars. This one for example, was I think about 60 bucks or something like that but they can be so much more. And you know what? You don't wanna just store them in any old box. We got the Chronos from Archetype. This thing gives you 40 slots. That's potentially thousands of dollars. It's made out of machined 6063 aluminum. And it's got UV protecting glass on top. The sun's not getting in there. You're great, you're golden. If you've got hundreds of dollars to spend, I mean, you can get this thing too. But there's one big problem. (ominous music) I can't fit my space bar or anything else that's more than one U.",

    "transcript": "well guys after weeks of announcements the usual ridiculous unboxing embargoes and other teases it's finally review day for the $700 AMD Radeon vii GPU you honestly this launch had stretched out way too far but at least we're here now now if you're looking for a bit more information on the underlying architecture of this GPU you can actually check out our explain video right over here because this video is gonna be primarily focused on the benchmark results for both gaming and productivity and now that md's NDA is lifted we can actually share a little bit more information about this new GPU so let's say let's get into it right after this welcome the entire H series from NZXT we're in the most elegant case lineups with the premium construction you'll appreciate and the little details like purple USB ports / fresh routes floor and the iconic cable cover we've got an ITX option the H 200 your standard ATX mid tower at age 500 and the big guns the H700 all available with a smart device for RGB illumination and fan control or the standard variations with a smart interior to complement an easy assembly the H series is Hardware canucks approved and is something for everyone check it out below so the Radeon 7 is a great-looking graphics card I love the overall look the triple fan setup should hopefully keep temperatures under control while also offering much lower noise than the reference Vegas 64 notice I said should well stay tuned because this card is not quiet there's also a dual 8 pin power setup since this card is supposed to consume about 300 watts at full load one thing that's been removed is crossfire support either with an external connector or through the PCI bus instead AMD is counting on DX 12 and Vulcan multi-gpu configurations that's pretty disappointing but it basically follows industry trends to move away from supporting multi-gpu configurations in drivers now having spoken to board partners almost all of them are not planning on launching upgraded versions of the 7 and that's just too bad but I hope things could change later down the road now when we posted our last video a lot of you guys did ask us about rumors regarding availability first of all in North America aimed he's planning to sell the Radeon 7 on their website kind of like what NVIDIA does with their founder certain GPUs although what partners will have reference designs it's just that you know they've told us that their stocks will be limited so we're just going to wait and see how this all plays out in the upcoming days all right so let's quickly recap what the Radeon vii is all about basically AMD has used a modified version of Vega core that was originally used on the Vega 64 this time it has a slightly updated architecture uses the 7 90-minute manufacturing process and houses a huge 16 gigabyte of HP m2 memory even though it has less course and texture units than the previous gen this new GPU is able to hit much higher sustained clock speeds that along with other core improvements should technically allow 3m7 to outperform the Vega 64 by a big margin now there are a few other things that I wanted to talk about first and foremost a lot of people think that this card is targeted towards professionals more than it does gamers because the price of the GPU is around $700 personally I think the Radeon 7 is more of a dual use card that can fit both sides equally well though keep in mind that 16 gigabytes of onboard memory does make it feel like something that would interest content creators who use high-level you know programs or 3d programs like a Maya or 3ds max now another thing that should also be mentioned is how AMD is planning to position the seven against Nvidia you see most of us were hoping for an affordable alternative to the RTX cards and technically that's not going to happen because the RTX 2080 and the Radeon 7 are priced at $700 at least on paper now AMD will have a fight on their hands because there's been an increase in availability of $700 RTX 2080 cards back at lunch finding one of those was almost impossible but that's been changing some still hit $775 and above though I'm looking at you ASUS now we're testing we chose a card that's right in the middle of everything the gigabyte RTX 2080 gigabyte OC which usually is between 750 and 760 dollars but sometimes it goes for sale for as little as seven times thirty dollars so here's the rest of the test system but we're also going to be doing things a bit differently this time AMD is making some big claims about how well the radeon vii does in creative focus applications that means a few additional productivity tests will be added after the gaming benchmarks so let's get on to things because this is going to be interesting and I wanted to kick things off with an annoying point about the Radeon seven and that's this so yeah even though that it has three fans this is a very loud card that's really disappointing since Vegas 64 had the exact same issue and I was hoping for something better this time around now on paper at least the Radeon 7 is quieter than the Vega card but it is also much louder than any of the Nvidia cards even the most powerful card here the RTX 2080 is almost silent in comparison we actually talked to AMD about this and they're very honest about sound levels being an issue with Radeon 7 GPU and they're looking to address that in future driver releases now one of the challenges that they're having right now is the second generation Vega core uses a network of 64 thermal sensors and uses the the maximum temperature across that to determine frequencies and fan speeds this is called Junction temperature the problem with the junction temperature determining performance in acoustics is that when the GPU is under load it's typically 20 to 30 degrees or more about what's reported as a traditional core temp for example here the GPU temperature was read 75 degrees while the junction temperature ended up hitting 103 degrees as a result the fans started spinning up to make sure that the court didn't throttle so with that taken into account Indy told us that working on adding a quiet mode later on but that would eventually cause a cheap you to hit lower performance numbers so for now we're gonna be getting Radeon 7 performance numbers but with higher noise levels anyways speaking of performance on to that part and feel free to pause here at any time since we're gonna be going through these quite a bit faster as you're going through these results you'll notice that the Radeon seven does manage to tie or beat the RTX 2080 eighty a few times at 1440p but it typically sits somewhere between the 2080 and the 2070 that's certainly not what gamers had hoped for a given these $700 price point moving on to 4k in each game and things don't really change all that much with away on seven still losing in games where it was behind in 1440p but there are some places where the larger memory pool makes a slight difference a good example of that is Far Cry 5 what this shows is that a lot of today's games aren't bottlenecked by memory but rather by the graphics core itself maybe things will change 8k ever becomes a thing but window still has issues getting 4k to work properly and they're nowhere near 8 kos compatibility so adoption for beyond 4k displays for anything but professionals is probably years away and now on to some productivity benchmarks remember how AMD claimed that the Radeon 7 was really geared towards a real-time 8k acceleration and rendering performance in Adobe Premiere and DaVinci Resolve well I decided to put that to testing and the results were definitely interesting now one thing to keep in mind is and I limited the amount of GPUs in this case because I really didn't have the time to test everything so I used four cards in total gtx 1080 ti rtx 2080 vega 64 and of course the Radeon 7 so i'ma kick things off with a 12-minute 4k timeline it's completely edited it's a full project that we published a block a while back and I exported to the YouTube 40% and interestingly enough there wasn't a major difference between all four cards whatsoever every GPU rendered the exact same project in less than 10 minutes now I took a one-minute 8k project and I exported to the h.265 8k preset using Adobe Media encoder and once again there wasn't a significant difference between all four GPUs but there was something interesting that I noticed after or while testing the Nvidia cards and the AMD GPUs and that is real-time playback performance as I was playing this 8k footage in real time I noticed said both the Vegas 64 and the Radeon vii struggle to keep up with the frame rates while I was just playing back this one-minute time line and that's something that I wasn't able to notice with the rtx GPU and the gtx 1080 ti which was definitely interesting because you might have framedrops with the AMD GPU's were on thousand versus you know 500 on the gtx cards so if you're thinking about you know creating a work station based pc i would slightly lean towards the nvidia series GPU is because codec solution seems to happen more optimized for that which brings me to my last test using DaVinci Resolve I took this 13-minute 4k timeline exported it to the YouTube 4k high preset with in resolved and all four GPUs completed that task in right under seven minutes so it's definitely faster than Premiere that's something that I noticed with both these graphics cards but it really proves that there isn't really a significant improvement with the Radeon 7gpu you even though that it has 16 gigabytes of onboard memory it's just basically performing identically to the GTX and the RTX series cards now on to blender and for this one we're using a bill that's been recompiled to properly utilize our RTX cards as soon as the main versions of this application don't hit support invidiously latest architecture even in its unsupported form the RTX 2080 still beats the Radeon 7 by 16 seconds on a pretty simple render performance in v-ray for Sketchup shows the 2080 beating the Radeon 7 again but this time by a larger margin than in blender alright so finally let's move on to the last benchmark and that's power consumption so this is a pleasant surprise since AMD has obviously made huge strides in the performance per watt area versus the Vega 64 but this also makes it apparent how far behind Nvidia they are right now while the Radeon 7 is on an efficient seven anime manufacturing process it still requires 35 watts more than the rtx 2080 so that's about the benchmarks and I think it's time to conclude this review so I'm gonna start with a few basic numbers the Radeon 7 has improved or the Vega 64 by roughly 28% in 1440p and a whopping 31% in 4k and that is impressive considering that this car consumes less power now when you put it up against the rtx 2080 that's where AMD is gonna face a bit of a problem because that's where this car Falls pretty short in both 1440p and 4k not only that but having tested this card in productivity as well it just couldn't cash the nvidia gpus because you know the performance difference is barely anything and not also also to mention this card is loud as hell and it's also one of the most power hungry GPS that we've ever tested so far even compared to the RTX 2080 now normally we could overlook all of this if AMD at least competitive on their price but at $700 the Radeon vii just doesn't look like a good value even again see $750 gigabyte ocv used it falls short in the price to performance bracket that's really not a position where used to weigh down cards being in since they typically offer some awesome value so guys there you have it I mean this launch really feels like AMD needed to absolutely stay in the GPU news cycle and compete against what Nvidia is offering because they have to stay irrelevant right but at this point in time the Radeon 7 is just too expensive it's too loud and power-hungry and I just really can't recommend this GPU at the moment that's pretty much from me let me know what you guys think about performance results and what your what where your expectations for the weigh down seven are you surprised are you disappointed I wanna know your thoughts in the comments I mean both Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our boot sequence Channel I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

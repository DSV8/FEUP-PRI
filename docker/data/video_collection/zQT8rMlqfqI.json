    "description": "My review of the Asus Zephyrus M - GM501. The best gaming laptop from Asus for thin and light performance at a cheaper price. Zephyrus M -   A powerful laptop i7-8750H with a GTX 1070 on a 144 Hz 3ms screen. This laptop has incredibly strong performance in a thin and light package.

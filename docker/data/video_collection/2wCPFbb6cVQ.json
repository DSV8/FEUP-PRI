    "transcript": "(uplifting music) - [Michael] Depending on where you get your nerdy news, this year's Google IO was the story of a boring company doing important things, or an important company doing boring things. Either way, much of the coverage from Mountain View bore mentions of mundanity, the sense that the sizzle had fizzled and as a video guy trying to make an interesting piece out of this show, I get that. I missed the gadget-studded widget fest of last year with phone-controlled, paint-slinging robots and internet-generating balloons the size of a house. Without attractions like that, this year's show felt a bit more muted. But as my colleague, Jerry Hildenbrand argues, over at Android Central, IO isn't supposed to be a novelty, gadget carnival, it's a developers' conference. For devs, that means it's a place to learn how to build apps and services for Google's ecosystem. For me, it's a three-day long reminder of just how much sweat goes into the software, that's now running on two billion devices across the world. The raw pulp of IO is no secret. You can watch from home as executives unveil the stuff, that's pushed Google so far into our lives, like the unassuming little orb, that's suddenly a serious threat to both Amazon Echo and your home telephone or the next version of Android, that'll help you get even more done on your phone, while cutting down on some of the notification noise or the new, big, data-driven tools, that'll put a concert into your calendar, just be pointing your camera at the marquee or the new API, that'll let you put in a Panera order, just by talking to Google Assistant. Sadly, it'll do nothing to make their croutons edible. But being on the ground gave me a glimpse of all the tiny stuff that goes into making all this work. I've learned about the challenges involved in connecting your phone to your car wirelessly, instead of through a cable. I visited a security briefing, where I learned that Google scans 50 billion apps a day to keep malware out of the Play Store. I sat in on an Androidware panel that taught me how much battery life you can save on a smartwatch, just by changing the color of the screen or shortening up an animation a little bit. I learned why the Kotlin programming language is important, TL;DR, it's simpler for developers to work with, but just as robust and I started to think that maybe Google Assistant will finally be able to do on a Google Home what it can do on a phone and vice versa. Of course, not everything was ring dings and yodels. A visit to the Tango tent showed me little advancement in Google's augmented-reality projects, since my time with it last November and I was disappointed that the new, self-contained virtual reality headgear wasn't yet ready for trials and yeah, I'd be lying if I said that all this new machine learning in Google Photos didn't give me pause or that I'm entirely comfortable routing every single one of my voice calls at home through Google Home. But Jerry deserves quoting once more, \"This is cool stuff that everyone wants to use,\" and so the privacy versus convenience debate continues. The utility versus novelty conversation continues, because the work continues. For an observer like me, Google IO is a three-day showcase of people who are pushing technology to the next phase. That's literally people at computers, typing away. It may not have the wow factor of computer glasses literally falling out of the sky, but it's only boring, if you haven't been paying attention. Mr. Mobile will be back in the studio next week to turn a smartphone into a desktop, sorta. Subscribe so you don't miss it and visit Android Central for all the meaty details from IO 2017. Till next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile, my friends.",

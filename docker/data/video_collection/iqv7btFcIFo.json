    "transcript": "GET OVER HERE! There have been a lot of folding phones shown at events over the past few weeks. AAND these are phones that look pretty cool. Like we've seen Samsung's Galaxy Fold. We've seen Huawei's folding phone Oppo's Folding phone And, they look cool but ever since the idea of a folding phone has been presented to me I've always been skeptical of how useful they really are Like the whole question of 'why?' Why do we really want folding phones has been something I've never wrapped my head around And the argument of like 'multi-tasking', we've seen that argument been made and Samsung showed this at their event. Where they had this dude who was watching a video and using a chat application And he's kind of switching between the two and kind of multi-tasking But that whole scenario feels a little contrive Like no one's watching that video and thinking 'hey, that's me! That's what I'm missing in my life'. I've always wanted a tablet like device so I could multi-task But, I saw this video and you know what, I'll just let it play Right?! Isn't that cool? Like, I look at that and my mind just starts to spin It's not because I'm huge on mobile gaming Like, I know some people think mobile gaming is the future And a ton of my favorite developers are pouring crazy amounts of money into mobile gaming Which is a little bit controversial",

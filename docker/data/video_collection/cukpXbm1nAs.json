    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - We're checking out OnePlus's concept phone, this actually the first time that they're showing it at CES, and this inspired by the McLaren 720S. What's really special about this is this glass is eletrochromic glass, so what that means is, much like the McLaren, or some of the Boeing planes, where you press a button and the glass goes form transparent to dark, this also does that, so you guys can't see it right now, but the camera is inside of here, I'll give you a quick little demo, let me open up the camera app, did you see it? (upbeat music) OnePlus's attention to detail's always something that I love, again inspired by the McLaren. This is all leather, it is stitched, and they even have a 24 carat gold plated edge all the way around. Another thing that I love is obviously I shoot a lot with my phone outside, so this will also act as an ND filter, and that is something that I have never seen on a cellphone ever. So if you're outside shooting, this will activate and you'll be able to get really great outdoor photos, especially when it's really bright out. It also activates very quickly, it takes .7 seconds to activate, and this glass is .35 mm thin. Like I can see you, but can you see me? - [Man] Yeah - Okay - [Man] You're very close to the lens. - Okay, so should I move back? (man laughs) (upbeat music) Since this is a concept, we have no idea what this price is, when it'll be released, but this is definitely something that I'm excited to see what OnePlus ends up doing with this, they're always thinking about the future, and I can't wait to see what they end-up with. (upbeat music)",

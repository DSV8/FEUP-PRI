    "transcript": "(upbeat music) (sunscreen squirting) (rubs nose) (hat squeaks) (door squeaks) (lawnmower roars) - Well, I guess my days of going outside are over. Thanks to EcoFlow who sponsored this video. (door clicks) (music lowers) Some people get naturally excited about the outdoors. Even yard work. As you can see, that ain't me. Which is why the BLADE from EcoFlow is only the first in what is likely gonna end up being a series of videos covering yard maintenance robots over the next year or so. This one has a couple of standout features. First and foremost being that it comes completely preassembled, which... Really? Okay, well... They say it comes completely preassembled and it features what they're calling Sweeping Technology. Which means that not only will it cut the grass it will also remove, I guess, leaves, needles? Does it do needles? - It does needles. Great, 'cause that is a huge problem in this yard. By the way, that's Jordan. I think this is the first time you're meeting him. It's cute. Truthfully, I don't have much in the way of talking points about this thing, and this is the first I'm seeing of it but I do know that they offer repla- Are those razor blades? What the hell? That is not the kind of lawnmower blade I was expecting to see. The idea here is that if it hits a stick or a rock or something, it'll just give, it'll just spin around rather than, you know, whacking it and throwing it across the yard. Which makes a ton of sense because, if you're operating the lawnmower, you're gonna be at the back of the mower behind a shield. Whereas if this thing is just running and you're lounging with a drink or whatever, yeah, that could be very dangerous. This is apparently the Sweeper accessory. This really doesn't seem like it would work that well, does it? - [Jordan] It was picking up - I mean, yeah... - [Jordan] pebbles in the parking lot. - I guess so. It was picking up rocks? Oh yeah. Who needs a manual when you've got instructions right on the top here like that. - [Jordan] That's cheating. - It's not cheating. That's using what's available to me. Oh, I see. (part clicks) What is up with these wheels? That is funky. So these spin every which way, and these spin. This is apparently called an Omnidirectional wheel. My mind is completely blown right now, and the unit can clear obstacles as high as 40 millimeters. So that's four centimeters or about two inches for my American friends. Kind of feel like I'm in my yard playing with tractors, you know? This isn't the first you've seen of EcoFlow on our channel. Their whole shtick is that they're about capturing, storing, and using energy in innovative ways to simplify everyday living. So their newest smart devices include the GLACIER, a portable fridge freezer with an integrated ice maker. The WAVE 2, which is a new generation of their powerful, compact, portable, AC and heating unit. And of course, the BLADE, the first automated lawnmower with lawn sweeping capabilities with the idea idea being that it can keep your yard clear even when the leaves are falling. Overall, I haven't needed the manual yet. I'm pretty impressed with the simplicity of the setup. This guy goes on here. (Linus grunts) A little something like this. So the sweeping happens after the cutting, then? - [Jordan] You can pick. - You can pick? - [Jordan] You tell the app what you wanna do. - No way. Oh, you mean you can just have it go through the whole yard twice? - [Jordan] Yeah. - Sweeping first and then cutting, I see. Power for the sweeping unit plugs in at the back right here. Pretty straightforward. Okay, let's find out what these buttons do. There is nothing in the manual regarding the buttons on the unit because I guess you're basically just expected to download the app and set it up. That makes sense. No, before we get the app we need to set up the charging station and the antenna. That's what this is. We've gotta be more than two meters from a building and we can't install the charger anywhere where there's less than four meters to navigate. It can go on the concrete, right? - [Jordan] Yep. - Okay, cool. I'm just gonna put it over by the house over here then. Oh good, water resistant housing. I guess and was wrong. Ah, that makes way more sense. - [David] The sun's coming out, let's go baby. - Yeah, that's good. Oh, it has been chilly this morning. Thankfully, I have this wonderful 3D down jacket from lttstore.com, woo! The power brick also has little wall mount holes so you could kind of stick it on there, plug it in, and then it should be good to just leave it there forever. (charger scraping) You know... I feel like for a more permanent installation I would wanna put it somewhere a little more out of the way. Oh, you're gonna, yeah. Oh, you gotta screw it down too. - [Jordan] For our purposes, this is... - Can you screw it into lawn? - Yeah. - Like does it come with lawn screws? Oh, that's cool, okay. Lawn screws. I mean, should we screw it down then? - [Jordan] Sure. - Let's screw it down. - [Jordan] We can put it down - Yeah. - [Jordan] up by the planter. - Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, let's put it over here. You know what? I'm kind of feeling this spot right here. You're supposed to be able to map out the yard and set exclusion zones. So there should be no reason for it to accidentally run over its own cord. But I would rest easier just having this go, you know, through a planter or something like that that I know it can't climb up onto. Very important, by the way, this needs to be mounted level. Yeah, that's not going anywhere. On the subject of inclines. It should still be able to handle this okay. EcoFlow rates it for 15 degrees at the edge of the lawn and 27 degrees in the middle of the lawn, so... Yeah, this is pretty flat. It should be Okay. It comes in the box powered on, I think. So I'm gonna power it on. Wait, we didn't do the antenna. This is a GPS antenna? - [Jordan] This is. - Ooh. Okay. So this is intended to give a clear, always accurate, GPS signal that the robot can compare against to know exactly where it is. And this is particularly necessary because this robot doesn't have any kind of boundary wire around the edge of the property or anything like that. It only relies on this to know where it is. I should have, should have cable managed this the other way first. Yeah, there will be no need to record me doing this for the next four minutes. It's the same for both of them. It has to be at least two meters from the building and then at least four meters of navigation space around it. Does it go... Well, it doesn't seem like it has to go right next to the base. They show it like that. But why would they have this long cord if I couldn't just put it kind of wherever I want? I'm gonna put it wherever I want. I want to put it next to the base. (Linus chuckles) All right. Who doesn't need a GPS antenna in their yard? That's what I want to know. Let's fire up the app. One device has been found. EcoFlow BLADE 0282. Connecting. \"Camera or LIDAR sensor blocked, now in safety protection mode.\" (Jordan mumbles) Oh! Huh... See this my friends is why you always remove the peels. And this is a perfect opportunity for us to talk about how this thing navigates. It has a camera, it has LIDAR and it has GPS. So theoretically, it should be able to handle the obstacle avoidance (Linus chuckles) course, that we've set up for it here which includes a trampoline, these random two-by-fours that are propping up this tree, these saplings that my in-laws put in the middle of the yard for some inexplicable reason. That concrete fountain. This is gonna be really challenging. \"Press the Power button,\" okay. \"Power button followed by the Start button.\" So that's what these buttons are. There's Power, Start, and I think Go Home and Charge, I guess. I guess there's also Stop. - [BLADE App] Emergency stop. Please press the power button and then press the start button to continue. (Linus giggles) - Okay. Power button. Start button. (plastic ripping) Okay. And it lived there forever. All right! Oh, here we go. Okay, now I've got the Quick Start Guide. \"Assemble Product. Antenna... Mower is not charging,\" oh, okay. I can... So I should put it on here, come on. Bleh, bleh, bleh. Oh! Well, sorry buddy. - [BLADE App] Mower out of the Charging Station before shut down. - Oh, sorry. I pressed the Emergency Stop when I put it on the charger. It got mad. Sorry, buddy. Okay! \"Search antenna signal. Continue moving antenna to find a stronger signal and fix the antenna.\" Weak sig- Strong... Strong signal. Nice. See, I knew it. \"Mower Control Pra-\" Shut up, you can manually control it! Ooh, \"do not stand behind the charging station.\" Okay. - [Jordan] (distantly) Oh! - Ooh, there she goes. Okay, those front wheels trip me out. \"Control mower, turn around.\" (fearfully) Ah! (Linus laughs) Okay. She's going. All right, that's... That's pretty intuitive. \"Well done. \"Mower control practice completed.\" If only my driver's licensing test was that fast. Yeah, you got the basics, get out there. \"Create mower work map. \"Remove all dogs, soccer balls, and branches from the yard.\" - [Jordan] There is a soccer ball. - All right, no dogs. Oh, you got the soccer ball? The grass needs to be shorter than three inches which I mean, this grass just barely grows, honestly. It'll probably be fine. And you need to keep within two meters of the mower and follow it during mapping. Satellite signal is weak. Okay, you are definitely gonna wanna set up the base station somewhere where the signal is consistently good. I will say that. So can we go back now? Okay, \"create mower work map,\" here we go. Retest. Come on, come on. (angrily) Come on! Satellite signal's weak. Can someone grab an end of this stupid planter and let's just see if moving that a couple feet away gets us over the threshold. (Linus gasps) Yes! \"Start mapping,\" let's go! \"The mower's about to exit the station automatically.\" - [BLADE App] No signals for GPS. - [David] What? - It says it's strong but then the unit itself is flashing orange which indicates that it is not strong. (mower rattling) So now it's complaining about this one but it didn't complain about this one before. Okay. What if I do a little thing? Hold on, hold on. No, I think I'm gonna get away with it. Okay, so now I have to manually take it to the edge of the lawn, then tap Start to start the mapping. Oh, I gotta drive it? - [Jordan] Yeah. - I have to drive it the whole way? - [Jordan] You drive the perimeter you want to mow. - Oh my God. - [Jordan] And then once that's there, it'll plan the route itself to how to mow it. - All right, all right. I'm working on it, I'm working on it. Geez. - [Jordan] Come on. All those gaming skills, put 'em to use. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Peak Gamer Moment right here. I feel like I'm taking my really weird dog for a walk. (Linus laughs) (nasally voice) He uses a wifi leash, okay? He prefers that. (normal voice) Oh, this is cool. It has the map all like, drawn in real time here. That's pretty sick. And it looks like I did manage to fool it with my quick swap of the (Linus giggles) GPS antenna location. Okay. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, bud. Now seems like a good time to mention that you can set multiple areas and then you can draw a path between them in case you happen to have two yards. \"Approaching starting point, tap 'Complete' to save the map.\" \"No-go Zone.\" \"The mower is not allowed to go in this area.\" Okay. Should I make a No-go Zone under the trampoline? - [Jordan] I think so. - Okay, sure. Yeah, let's make a No-go Zone then. If EcoFlow's watching, which I know you are, I wouldn't mind if it went a lot faster. Like if you could put it in race mode. I'm sure lawnmower racing is a thing somewhere. Oh, I think it got a little confused. Yes, quit mapping. Wait, what? (Linus gasps) No! Are you kidding me? - Oh no, you're okay, you're okay. - Oh, we're... No, we're good. Ooh! Dynamic mode, let's go. How- 1.6 inches? - About an inch and a half. - Sure, okay. - Yeah. - Save. - [BLADE App] Dynamic mode. - Nice. Yeah, I'm mapping a No-go Zone. Okay, let's try it... Let's try again with the No-go Zone. Hey, there it goes. Look at that, perfect circle, baby. Start? - [BLADE App] Fast Start. - Oh. (Jordan laughs) I would say you should probably stay six inches away from the obstacles, yeah. Okay. So now it's gonna do stuff? Look at it go, that is adorable. You know what, it's on Mowing Mode. I probably just shouldn't have the Sweeper accessory on it at all. Yeah, I'm gonna take the sweeping- - [Jordan] Oh! (Linus giggles) - She's got some give or she's got some go. Whoa! Okay. This seems like it's gonna take a while. Oh, okay. We apparently brought a decibel meter. It's really quiet. 60 something high, 70 low. It changes the height of the blade for a slope? - [Jordan] Yeah. - Oh, interesting. This is an assumption, I don't know this, but I would have to guess that once it's kind of run the area once it gets a bit of a better idea of what's shaking. - [Jordan] Yeah, it'll plan its own route and it'll just zig-zag back and forth. Kinda like you would normally mowing the lawn yourself. - Right. - [Jordan] Right now, because we haven't told it where all the obstacles are it has to kind of get a feel for it. - It's kind of figuring things out, interesting. - [Jordan] And I think we'll be cutting a little bit low for the first pass, given how high the grass was to start. - Yeah, probably. - [Jordan] So there it saw the two-by-four. - Yeah, it does not like my two-by-four system for holding up this tree. I've been meaning to implement a better system but I don't live here anymore, - [David] What happened so it's been a low priority. - [David] to the tree? - It fell over. - [David] Oh, it fell over. - Like fell over. It's a miracle it's alive. This is going to take a very long time. Which, theoretically doesn't matter because... - [Jordan] Unless you're gonna ride it. - You don't have,... Yeah, no. No! No, that's not allowed. That's right in the manual, Jordan. You know what? It wasn't very clear what the method to the madness was, initially. But it's starting to take shape. You can see it found this obstacle. It's like, \"nope.png\" right here. And other than that, it's kind of doing a thing now. And I should say, as long as this looks like it's going to take, the cutting width is actually wider than most other mowers out there at about 26 centimeters- oh! - I think this wheel's just kind of gummed up here. (Linus hums) And we're a little bit low on the cutting height. - [David] Should we raise it? - Yeah, I think I'm gonna raise - [Jordan] So it's hitting the the cutting height. - [Jordan] whoa! - Yeah, okay. - There we go. I'm gonna set the cutting height to two inches and see if that helps. This lawn is just not level enough for it to go that low to the ground. Yeah, and see now it's not getting stuck as it tries to turn. - [Jordan] It's supposed to be accurate to two centimeters for positioning. - [Linus] Two centimeters. - [Jordan] Yep. I think it found a tree. - Honestly, I don't think that really matters. Because if you run it every day - [Jordan] It's gonna get it. - and it's off by just a little bit. Yeah, it'll kind of... It'll kind of grab everything eventually. Like it's more of a maintenance type of program than a, you know, \"oh crap, I haven't done this in three weeks. Oh, I need to get every blade.\" I definitely should have set a smaller area for just a product demo. (BLADE jams) (blades grinding) (Linus gasps) Yeah, we should have swept first. There's some pretty big pine cones and stuff here. Ah. Okay. Whoops. - Oh, that's a little big for it. - [Linus] Yep. Oh, there's still a lot of these. Uh oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, no, no. No, you're good. Don't go for it. (Linus grunts) (BLADE rattling) Okay. I'm supervising. - [Jordan] It's pretty good about figuring out obstacles. - Yeah, I should have just had this as an exclusion zone or set it up as a separate zone for just sweeping 'cause nothing grows here anyway. Then again, if this thing was sweeping the yard every day stuff might eventually grow here. I only hope that once the tables are turned our robot overlords give me a job like this to do. I'm gonna take the Sweeper off for now. We can take a look at the Sweeper later. Oh man, why is that, so tight. - [Jordan] You really got it on there. - How did I do that? - [David] Oh no, oh no! - [Linus] Oh no. - [Jordan] Uh oh. - I think my little switcheroo with the GPS antenna may have confused it. It's about to run over my camera operator here. (cameraman screams) It thinks it's in the middle of the mowing area and it's clearly not. It's like heading for the rock bed. We're gonna do the setup properly. Give me a minute. We're gonna reset the map and we're gonna create a new map. The GPS is not mad at me this time, which is good. Man, imagine this becomes a thing. Companies sponsoring videos with us. Just to reinforce that people need to read the manual before setting up their product. (men laugh) I can even see, just looking at the preview of the map on my phone though, this is way better. Here we go, okay. It absolutely nailed the start location. So we are definitely right this time. Oh hey, it's worth noting: it has a rain sensor. So if it detects rain it'll go hide away in its little dock, presumably charge up I guess, and then when the rain stops, it'll go mow the lawn again. Okay, it's already taking a way smarter path around the yard. Cool, all right, well... Let's go eat and we'll be back. - [Jordan] Alright. - [Linus] Good luck buddy. (upbeat music) - We're back, and it definitely went everywhere. You can actually see it was quite methodical here but as I mentioned before it's pretty clear that this is the kind of thing that you wouldn't wanna run once every two weeks. It's the kind of thing you'd wanna set to run more like every day. It did a way better job of cutting close to this thing now that it doesn't have the Sweeping attachment on it. So I think that sweeping is something you'd want to be a little more manual about. Maybe not just leave it on all the time. Definitely a learning curve. I will be very curious to see if it can actually sweep any of this stuff. 'Cause like... Hey, it actually sounds- whoa! Hey, hi, sorry. It sounds more like a lawnmower now. I also feel like you've gotta have the right yard configuration. Like it's pretty clear that there are some very challenging things about this particular yard. The fact that all this brick work is very wavy and sort of all over the place. The fact that I have two-by-fours holding up a tree, minor things like that. - The ground is pretty lumpy too. - [Linus] The ground is extremely lumpy. But I have to wonder: if you're the kind of person who can afford one of these would you just have a flat lawn, you know? - [Jordan] You might. - [Linus] EcoFlow recommends using the BLADE in a lawn that's between 100 to 3000 square meters. The bigger the lawn is, the better it will perform. It's not a replacement forever going outside and working on your yard that much is very clear. - Yeah. - But what it is doing right now is an 80/20 job of it. - [Jordan] This is better than I would've done as a teenager. - I mean, speak for yourself. I was a ni- I was a good teenager. - No. (Linus laughs) - You know what? I don't know if I was giving the sweeping enough credit before. It's definitely picking stuff up. And in Dynamic Mode it's actually going pretty quickly. - Mhm. - I do wish you could chop and sweep. There are some places that it didn't do a great job. But it's rated to handle three inches and that's more like four, four and a half. So on the one hand, even though this is a sponsored video we went out of our way to use it in the real world so you guys can see it in action and you don't end up with unrealistic expectations. But on the other hand, we did kind of go out of our way to put it in a very challenging situation and it's definitely doing stuff. Like... You do another pass of this thing with cutting. another pass with sweeping. Here, actually, you know what... I'm gonna hit the thing. Hey buddy. It did this little part right here. It actually picked up a crap ton of stuff. Lawn clippings, leaves, twigs. All this crap was in a pretty small area actually. And it charges fast enough that you could even run it twice a day for the first little bit if you just wanted to get things up to scratch. No, you know what? I would totally map my work area just with wider borders and I would just leave the sweeper on all the time. Because you can have different areas that do different things. - [Jordan] Oh. - So I could set it to mow this and then dock for a couple hours and then sweep that. Sick! It went and took a nap after doing a very small amount of this challenging area and we were like, \"what the heck is up with that?\" Any questions I had before about whether the Sweeper works or not, have been put to rest. (debris falling) It went to take a nap 'cause the thing was full. It picked up all of that. (Linus grunts) Just going around here and then along here. - [David] You can see it. - Yeah. Okay. Sweeper Mode: confirmed, does sweep. It depends on your standards. It's never gonna get right in there next to the edges. It's never gonna get under the trampoline or anything like that. But if you just want the place to not be overgrown. - Yeah. - And you don't want to go and do it yourself. (outro begins) The only challenge with that is the price. It's not cheap. We're gonna have a link down below where you guys can check out both the EcoFlow BLADE and Sweeper accessory. Come on! Come on! (Linus giggles)",

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave 2D here. So CES day 1 I got to check out a couple events. Now, before I get into that stuff I need to talk about the image quality of what you're looking at. I'm shooting this on a smartphone. I actually went to CES very light this year. I brought two smartphones: Pixel 2XL, and an iPhone X. And the image quality is significantly worse than I thought it would be. So a lot of event spaces are dark. I knew they'd be dark, expected it, but I just thought the image quality on these new smartphone cameras would just be a little bit better, and it's just, it's just bad. I apologize in advance. OK, first thing I went into was the Acer event. They have a couple of new devices this year. The one that stood out to me was the Acer Swift 7. So this has been updated, but it's now a little bit thinner, a little bit, just better across the board. And this is a really well-built ultra-thin laptop. It is literally the thinnest laptop in the world right now. 8.98 millimeters, and it's a 14 inch screen, but a really nice keyboard. So, a lot of devices that are this thin just have to compromise on the keyboard, just the typing experience isn't very good. This feels like a regular Ultrabook, with nice key travel, back-lit keys and everything. The thing that's a little bit weird about this keyboard is the backspace key. So if you look up the top here that delete is Right beside the backspace so if you're not used to the keyboard it might be a little bit weird the trackpad Does not click so there's a tap mechanism? But there's no actual physical movement when you tap there's literally no tactile response when you tap it It's just like tapping But it's a very good trackpad, Windows Precision drivers The whole laptop though is surprisingly expensive. This was $1,700 and it's I mean the market for this thing has got to be really nice, but if you're looking for someone That's really thin, and you want something. That's literally the thinnest laptop in the world right now. This is it There's also 4G LTE built right into the laptop so we can use a nano SIM or Isom And you can basically have this thing connected to the Internet all the time without needing to tether it to your phone or anything like that Now the thing that might be a deal-breaker for some people is that this thing is using a seventh gen Intel CPU and I thought? A little bit weird because 8th gen is already here, but for devices that are this small and this portable I don't think there's gonna be a big difference between 7th and 8th gen performance now another thing that I saw was the new Acer Nitro 5 and what makes this thing special and it's running an AMD CPU the Verizon 5 and an upcoming AMD GPU now the actual GPU is undetermined But it's going to give performance similar to the GTX 1050 or the 1050 Ti so that kind of budget gaming laptop range? If you have other things like the Chromebook They have this blue Chromebook with USB C port which is kind of cool if you're into that stuff But that's basically the gist of the Acer event so another thing I went to was the Samsung event and they had this huge TV that they call the wall and what makes this one special Well, it's 8k micro LED. It looks incredible a lot of like the OLED and Q LED TVs Just look really good But this one's probably the nicest one I've ever seen but the thing that really Impressed me about this thing was the AI so they have this technology for other TVs Not just this one, but a lot of their higher-end TVs this year But they use it as an algorithm to basically upscale lower res footage into 8k So they can take some crappy 480p footage look at this database kind of figure out what needs to be upscaled and how to upscale each Component with this algorithm, and then push it out in what seemingly is 8k content, which is crazy the last thing I saw was another really big screen It's the Nvidia BFG displays, which is probably a reference to doom, but they actually call it a big format gaming display It's basically the 65 inch TV shaped object, which is it's essentially a TV? But the panel is amazing for gaming It's actually not meant for TV like it's not geared towards having the best image quality for media consumption But it's freaking amazing for gameplay, so they have this thing connected up to a PC and they were demoing destiny, too And it just looked really really good like you're looking at 4k 120 Hertz really low response rate It's basically a giant high-end gaming monitor with g-sync. It looks it looks so good so it's always gonna gear to everyone it's more for people that are building like some kind of like man cave and they want just a single display to do all of Their gaming on so console gaming PC gaming and obviously it's got streaming capabilities, but it's got HDR support And they have this really cool demo where in destiny - there's NPC that's welding but because of the high brightness on this man I think it hits a thousand nits the spark on the welders tool was super bright It was actually this Blinding brightness that was emitted because of how bright the screen can get and it's all g-sync and able to allow for some really smooth 120 Hertz gameplay But it's gonna be expensive They didn't release pricing it depending on the partner you're gonna purchase it from like Asus is making one Acer HP Omen is making one. They're all going to be price. I imagine, but they certainly won't be cheap I'm looking for screen like that though like that's something. I really want for myself Assuming it's not too expensive, but yeah, okay, so that's basically CSD one again I apologize for this amazingly high res and crispy footage I'll see you guys in the next video at CES",

    "transcript": "- Hi! It's Justine. This is Ro. - Hello! - And yesterday when we were filming, I started the video off. (Rosanna laughs) I was like, \"Hey guys it's Ro\" I was like that's not me. - We were having so much fun, and in her defense she had had a lot of sugar. We tasted a whole bunch of candy. - It was so great. - So we were on a sugar high. And it was a little later. We were like, getting really silly. - We were. But today we're gonna do something very simple. I thought it would be really fun to do a Q&A, (Rosanna gasps) because people are always asking us questions in the comments, like, \"How did you meet?\" \"What's your favorite color?\" I feel like is always a very common question. So today I asked you guys on Twitter to ask us some questions and guess what I've got. Questions! - Questions! - The first one I thought was very appropriate. Now we did do a Q&A before on Rhett and Link's channel, which was very fun. - That was really fun. - So we may have answered a few of these, but you guys might not have seen it so just in case, this question is \"How did you guys meet?\" - How did we meet? - Mm-hmm. - Well it's kind of a long story. So I loved her content, and when I started my channel you had been doing Youtube for awhile. And she had a big fancy channel, and I was just starting. And I was too nervous to ask her to come bake with me. I made a cake that I thought you would think was cool. - And it was the best ever. - It was just a Call of Duty cake, because I know that she loved to play that game. Tweeted it, and I like tagged her in the tweet. I was like, \"Thought you might think this \"cake was cool or something.\" - And I did, and I wish that I would have filmed my reaction because I was freaking out. I was like sending it to my sister. I was sending it to everybody. I was like, \"Oh my gosh look at this amazing cake! \"This is so cool!\" And this was way before I ever even tried to bake anything. - I was so happy you liked it. That was like our first interaction was on Twitter. - You didn't even slide into the DMs. - I didn't then. I was still too nervous. I was really shy 'cause I didn't know really anyone in YouTube community. I think I knew maybe two people. And we ended up meeting in person at a YouTube thing. At the YouTube Space. - I don't remember what it was, but it was at Youtube Space. - Was it a panel? - I don't know, but I remember I got your number, and I still have you in my phone as Rosanna Nerdy Nummies. (Rosanna laughs) So that's how we met! - Yeah! And then I just blew her up, all the time. (Justine laughs) As soon as we exchanged info, I was like, \"We're friends now!\" - And we are, and here we are. - Yeah, and I just kept sending you funny pictures and GIFs. - I haven't met anybody not on the internet in a really long time, like in real life first. - I have to be honest. My whole world is now YouTube. All my friends are YouTubers, and... - Maybe we need to get out more. Do you think? - Oh, expand our world. - Oh, I don't know I'm nervous. - I know a few musicians. - Really? - But they also are on YouTube. - Oh. - Well if they got a Vevo channel, does that count? - Uh... - A gray zone. - Yes. We'll discuss. - Okay. - Okay! Next question. (Justine gasps) (Rosanna gasps) Would you consider touring together? - Uh, I would more than consider. I would say, \"Yes!\" - We could bring Matty because he's a DJ! - What do we do? - I don't know! - We need to have a show or something. We can't just get on a bus. - Well okay so my dog's a DJ. One. - Check. - So we've got one thing. Can Cookie do anything? She perform? Maybe she dance? - She's real cute. - She is super cute. - Talents... - It's okay we can work on it. We can work on it. She can be the tour manager. - She can sit. Okay we'll have to figure it out-- - To be determined. - What our show would be. - This could actually lead into a second question that I saw. Hold on. - What was it? What was it? \"Any hidden talents?\" - Well I just told you mine, that's juggling, and it's not really that hidden because I do it all the time. - You work it, but I didn't know you could juggle until we were hanging out. - This is kind of a hidden talent. I can bark like a dog. - You! (gasps) Oh my gosh. - It's weird. - Let me hear it. - Do you wanna? Okay, it might be loud. Hello to myself editing. - Okay. - Okay. (throat clearing) - [Man] I'm turning it down. - Okay. - Okay I have to stand up, 'cause I gotta really just like get in there. - Okay, okay. Your hidden talent is you can bark like a dog. She can also juggle but people know that. - Yes. - So let's hear it. - This tour is gonna be incredible. (laughs) - Oh yeah. Sound effects, everything, we got it. - [Justine] Do you think Cookie's gonna freak out? - Maybe. - [Man] Yeah. - So Cookie's asleep, right here next to me. She may wake up. Okay. (barks) (laughs) - She did! She woke up! (Justine barks) (Rosanna gasps) - Cookie, hi honey, are you scared? - She's very concerned. That is a true talent, 'cause she thinks it's real. - [Justine] Hi, I love you! I love you! - [Rosanna] It's okay Coodie, nobody's hurt. - [Justine] Oh no no it's okay! I'm fine! - You're okay! - What did I say? - C'mere! - I don't even know what I said! - Oh my gosh she's-- - Oh. Oh my. Oh my. - Hi honey. (shushes) - She's very concerned Justine. - Everything's okay. Let me get to hold your feet. - Yeah, we have to console her. - Oh my goodness. - It's not real. - What did I say? Is it something that you were into? She's like I like that. - That was really good, Justine. - Thank you, thank you. - 'Cause she thought it was real. Totally fooled her. (laughs) My hidden talent would be.. Well I like to sing. People know that I think. I did one song, but it was like an acoustic pop song, where it's... - What about the-- - But I sing Opera. - Wait, what? - But I haven't made a video of it yet. But I'm classically trained and I sing Opera. I can hit really high notes. - Really? - With that vibrato, and that legato. - Wait, I didn't even know this. You serious? - Yeah I'm serious. - Do you wanna give us like a little something? - Well I'd need more tea. But, okay, look it up. I do have O Mio Babbino Caro. - What does that mean? - It's like, \"Oh dad.\" It's... - Oh interesting. - Well it's Italian opera, and the girl wants to marry someone, and she's trying to convince her dad that she wants to marry her love. - I thought that story was going somewhere else. I was like, wait, she's gonna marry who? - Not marry her dad! No, No. It's there! (romantic opera music) Very Italian opera. - Am I getting a copyright strike? (laughs) - No! I'll whitelist you. O mio babbino caro - Shut up! Mi piace, bello, bello - I'm flipping this table! Vo' andare in Porta Rossa You didn't know you were friends with an Opera singer, did you? A comperar l'anello - This table's too heavy to flip. S, ci voglio andare - I am in shock right now. - Did I just blow your mind? - Yes! - (laughs) Cookie likes it! - Okay well I guess on tour, I'm just gonna be getting you tea. (Rosanna laughs) And (laughs) do you think the kids would enjoy an opera number? - See that's the thing, is that opera's just not as popular as pop music. So maybe if we made it like, pop-opera. You know when you mix anything with pop, it really works. Like it could be rock-pop, it could be country-pop. - EDM? Like an EDM Opera? - Yeah. - Like Matty could be up there, (Rosanna gasps) doing his little DJ skills? - I have always wanted to sing the song from Fifth Element. - I don't know what that one is. - They have an opera singer in Fifth Element, and I don't even know if some of the octaves are possible because she's an alien, y'know? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - We're not in the same vocal range, as a human. But maybe. - You could just lip sync. That's totally fine. We're okay with that at our show. - I'll just... - This is nuts. I had no idea. Like, what? - I love that we're learning stuff about eachother. - This is insane. What's your favorite color combo? - Color combo? What do they mean by that? - Hannah would be like a beige color, or a green. - Oh! - And an olive. - I would say my favorite color combo... I love white and black, but those aren't colors per se. If I had to pick a color, I would say pink and black. - Well for decor, I'm really liking white, gray, and blush. Like rose gold, for home decor. But in general, I'm really festive and I love the holidays. Halloween is one of my favorite holidays. So a black and orange combo for Halloween. - That's nice. - Or red and green, for Christmas. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I think those are good. I hope we answered your question. So Alexis. I can never read anyone's names. Like this, Alex? Alexis? - Alex? Alex-ee-us? They are asking if we have any advice on parent slash dog-hood. I'm assuming you mean dog parents. - Yeah, 'cause we're dog moms. - Yes we are. - We've got little Matty, little Cookie. - I'd say the biggest thing is, wow, I mean definitely giving them attention. But I think the hardest part is a lot of people will get dogs as rescue dogs, which you should always rescue. Do not shop! Always adopt. It's sometimes when you get a dog later in life, you're gonna have to break a lot of the habits that they already have. But training from a very young age is so, so important. - I would say that all dogs have different personalities, but different breeds do have different general temperaments. - For sure. I mean, even poodles like my dog. Poodle bichon, they're all very similar. - Cookie is a French bulldog, and they have a reputation for being very stubborn, and that is very true. (Justine laughs) So for her, when we were training her, had to train very young, and be very consistent. And it took almost a full year to potty train her to go outside. - Really? Aw. - But now she will never go in the house. - Mm-hmm. I don't know. I travel a lot, so Matty has been traveling since he was like eight weeks old. He's been on a plane. - So he's a great traveler. - He is a pretty great traveler, but he also doesn't like children very much, like small little kids and babies. So it's hard, because it's one of those things, that it's hard to break because I don't want to be like, \"Hey, can I borrow your child to see what my dog will do?\" So it's sometimes a hard thing to break. But man, it's the best thing, having a dog. - Yeah I love being a dog mom. (Justine sighs) - Me too, they're just so sweet! - Any advice, just be patient. And consistency. They love having a routine. - Yeah. Which Matty, does not have a routine. He's at my house. He's at my sister's house. He's with strangers all the time. - He's hanging out here today! - He's here! Yes. - With Cookie. They love to play together. - I know! I'll have to show you guys his DJ skills, 'cause they're pretty impressive if you haven't seem them. (Rosanna gasps) - Here. - [Rosanna] Usually I don't put animals on the table but-- - [Justine] You know, I do. - I've made an exception, a time or two. I had Doug the Pug sit on the table, because I was scared he would jump out of the chair. - [Justine] Go, stop! Go over here. Go over here. - Here here! Here here! Here Here! - [Justine] Okay, c'mere. Here, on the DJ! - [Rosanna] Alright, let's see it man! - [Justine] Time to DJ! Come on, you got this buddy! Good boy! Good, time to DJ. Here you go! Good boy! Okay, come on Matty! Time to DJ. Come on, let's go, you got this! Time to DJ! Good boy! Yes, come on! Let's go! Play those ones and twos Matty! Here you go! - Another really good piece of advice is to get a dog when you're ready for one. Like, I wanted a dog for so many years, but I wanted to wait until I really had the time to take care of one, and give the dog the best life. - And I mean I thought that I was ready, but then a lot of things popped up. He was sick for almost an entire year. So I had pretty much for an entire year, stopped traveling. I had to cancel a lot of jobs, 'cause I was like, \"This is a responsibility \"that I took on, so now I have to take care of him.\" It was worth it though. A hundred percent worth it. - So worth it. Life with a dog is amazing. - It really is. - Cookie makes me laugh every day. - Let's see what else we've got. We've got Wolf Blitzer who is asking, \"What is something you guys want to make together the most \"on Nerdy Nummies? \"Maybe something Super Mario Odyssey themed?\" (gasps) Super Mario Odyssey is such a fun game. I'm such a huge fan of Mario, and you love Mario, and you love gaming. - You have been talking about this so much yesterday. We were just talking about this yesterday. - I was staying up until like, three or four a.m. which for me, is very late. I don't stay up late. I go to bed at nine o'clock. But I just couldn't put the game down. - You were telling me that. I know it would be really fun. That's a good idea. - You were saying maybe like the Mario cap? - Yeah maybe we should make the Mario hat! - Or what about-- - It's so classic! - The Bowser and Mario wedding cake. (women gasping) All these idea-- And the hat too! - This is beautiful. You do little hat cupcakes to go around, and oh my gosh. - That would be so cute. - The wedding cake is pretty cool too. - Oh! - It's so great. No spoilers! No spoilers. - I'm really excited now. I feel like I've drank 10 cups of tea. - I need a sip. - Look at you! Look at the size of this coffee. - It's tea, at least, so yeah. - Oh! It is tea? - Yeah. - Oh! We're both drinking tea! - If I drank this much coffee, I would flip the table. Let's see what else we've got. - What do we got here? - Oh here's one, asking, \"Who is better at Mario Kart?\" - Justine! - Well, I mean, I don't know! - Hands down, it's Justine. - We might need to play one day. - We were playing Mario Kart at your house. - But that was with a group of people, and it's kind of unfair because, you know. - I was so... I'm real mediocre. I don't come in last place, but definitely not first. - That's basically my life motto. I don't want to be the worst, and I'm totally fine not being the best. Just okay, is where I strive to be. - I'm mediocre at Mario Kart. - You know, I like to set my goals low because then I can achieve them. - But you're really good at Mario Kart. - I'm not bad. - You don't wanna brag, because that's not her style. She doesn't like to brag. But she's really good at Mario Kart. - I still can't beat Matt though, which makes me very upset. - He's insanely competitive. - He really is. - When it comes to that game. - So this one, oh, save the best for last. - Oh! - Oh! - Ricky wants to know, \"What would your ideal first date be? \"And what do you look for in a potential boyfriend?\" - Okay Justine, I'm gonna sit back. You tell me what would your dream first date be. - I am not gonna lie. I love a good dinner. And I love a good wine. - Good food. - But I'm also fine doing absolutely nothing, because I feel like as I've gotten older, I just like to sit. I don't know, I mean, dinner, some wine. You know? - Dinner, wine. - Yeah! - A chill evening. - Very chill! - So you can get to know each other. - Yeah, or even if you're unsure, you can just go for coffee. That's always a good one. 'Cause you can feel it out, and you're like, \"Well this is something I don't wanna get into.\" - Well yeah, and it says, \"First date.\" - True. - \"Ideal first date.\" So a coffee date might be really good, because it's... - [Justine] Casual. - Testing the waters, casual, not a lot of pressure. - Definitely not inviting a first date to my house, so that's off the table. And then a dinner I feel might be too long, and then the wine... - [Rosanna] Maybe too formal. - First date, coffee. - A coffee date. - That sounds good. Or a dog park date! (Rosanna gasps) If they have a dog. - That's so cute! - That's good 'cause that could even be shorter if it's not working out. - Yeah, you could get coffee, and then go to a dog park. - That's good. - And then you could see if they like your dog, and if your dog likes them, 'cause sometimes dogs, they got instincts that we don't even know about! I feel like sometimes they pick up on stuff that we don't know. - That's true. I a hundred percent agree. And if you don't like dogs, it's clearly not gonna work out. Would you have an ideal first date? - Ideal first date would probably be something like, we're talking about... I really don't like to be swept off my feet. Like, romanced. Someone who comes at me who's super suave with like, roses and just over the top, usually makes me very weary. People who are fast-talkers, or sweet-talkers, too charming, I usually go, \"Whoa, you're really really suave.\" And then red flags go off in my head, like... - True. And then you can do some googling, and then you can research them, and then you can get a background check, and then you can search all of their Facebook, and then you can see if there's a police record. You gotta really do the digging. - Whoa! - Before you have the first date. So you basically have to have an internet first date first, to do your research. - I just like it to be chill. Something light. I would like a coffee date. - Well thank you guys so much for watching. Make sure you go check out Ro's channel, and be sure to subscribe. We've done so many fun videos together. - Yes! So many lately. - So just-- - I love it. - Do a quick search and you'll find something that hopefully you will enjoy. That's it! We'll see you guys later. Bye! - Bye! (upbeat music)",

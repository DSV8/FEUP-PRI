    "transcript": "there was a video i made a while back in response to a jay's two cents post and depending on how you hashed it up you could either say i was defending minors or defending the invisible hand for some context i've never mined with any of my cards i've several cards right in the closet it's part of my job reviewing recursive testing and the like i've never mind with any of them it just doesn't sit right with me because i don't necessarily pay out of pocket for them but what i also won't do is attack miners for buying what they can buy and using these cards in a way that they're actually fairly effective with many of these cryptocurrencies so there's my little disclaimer i have no animosity towards myers at all however what i do have animosity towards are posts like this one here people are getting a hold of dozens of graphics cards only days after launch and flipping them for huge profits in bulk it isn't even like any of these had a chance of ending up in a desperate gamer's hands above MSRP he sold all 72 of these at one time what kind of backdoor shady deal went down for this seller to end up with this many cards this early and why is this kind of thing so prevalent on eBay and the like let's talk stay with me the patriot viper vp 4300 is a blazing fast Gen-4 NVME ssd with a cutting edge controller and DDR4 dram cache with tight timings reads and writes peg well over 6 000 megabytes per second and included swappable heat shields ensure compatibility and ultra portable solutions enjoy a five-year warranty with either one or two terabyte capacities and you can learn more about them by clicking the link below so this particular listing here uh was for 72 EVGA GTX RTX 3060 ti XCS located in Logan, Utah the winning bid was 81 300 it was bid on 155 times and shipping was 500 extra dollars now this is a sold listing which means somebody actually won all 72 of these cards they paid 81 300 that was a winning bid and actually if you click here you'll see that these are all of the bids all the increments this looks pretty legit like if you were trying to just throw a ridiculous number out there you would go ahead and just pitch it right off the bat uh you can see that it was pretty much bit up from the start at about 14 000 all the way up in small increments relatively speaking uh to about 81 000 and winning bid right here from this person who apparently does a lot of business on ebay the description states that supply will not be split which means you have no choice but to buy all 72 of these cards at once which of course that shuts out any chance that a random gamer would have of buying one there's also a convenient hash rate listed here to of course encourage mining now let's be clear okay this listing popped up days after these cards were launched in fact you can see on February 27th which is like a day or two after the 360 ti launched the seller added the following information here this is not a bit scam all cards are real operable actual Nvidia uh 3060 ti cards like come on these cards were likely headed somewhere where they'd be sold for at or around MSRP okay at some e-retail warehouse could be amazon or Newegg distribution center could be a brick and mortar like micro center who knows but they'd probably be sold at MSRP that these big box retailers usually do stick to around manufacturer recommended prices uh and they'd be sold to gamers right miners even let's be real even flippers right there are folks who are buying single cards turning around flipping them on ebay it's happening with the EVGA Q system it's happening with Newegg's raffle system heck it's probably even happening um it's it's probably happening everywhere let's be honest anywhere you can buy a graphics card for a sensible price because that opens the door to arbitrage and it'll work so long as folks continue buying at two or even three times in MSRP on sites like ebay but my quarrel isn't even with the flippers i certainly think they rank lower on the totem pole than miners that's for damn sure but they still aren't the root of the problem see when you remove in bulk right the number of cards in circulation by circumventing retailers and vendors oems and the like you become the problem you were the ones creating artificial scarcity i mean look at this this is i mean what what is this how do you get a hold of this many as an individual it doesn't seem like the seller is you know some large brick and mortar able to obtain entire crates pallets whatever of these cards how is stuff like this allowed to happen these people are literally snatching cards from the hands of a little guy single end users and the fact that crap like this is happening on public platforms days after launch literally a day or two after this card was launched this only adds insult to injury how are genuine shoppers for gpu upgrades supposed to feel when they see crap like this how is it supposed to restore confidence in the system many already believed to be broken and rigged when we hear stories of pallets of cards being stolen or product being smuggled across borders is that supposed to make us feel all warm and fuzzy inside we're already being shafted enough as it is by e-retailers like Newegg and amazon amazon refuses to to hold almost any stock at all of graphics cards themselves instead they let the third-party retailers take care of that and they always charge two or three times what they should and newit continues to bundle cards with unwanted crap like motherboards and psus psus that aren't even capable of supplying enough wattage to the card in question that's what they're bundling with these things it's ridiculous point is things are already difficult enough to deal with it's either pay big bucks for a card now or wait several several months and cross your fingers but seeing ads like these should really be an eye opener it's all about profit in the end distributors will happily sell the entire lot to a random dude on the side of the street for full asking price just to see that profit sooner and that random dude will happily turn it around and sell each card at more than double msrp in a freaking 72 lot bundle not even decent enough to part them out i mean hell i'd be a lot less upset to be completely honest with you if this was you know a parted out situation where each card was being sold for a thousand bucks something ridiculous but still a consistent number that they frequently sell for on ebay right he's gonna make you buy all 72 of them he's going to advertise to miners and completely sidestep the little guy just look into game i'm honestly kind of surprised that this isn't a more common occurrence or or maybe it is and we just don't know about it that'd be clear there is a significant difference between something like this what we just saw and this here so this ad is for 20 gtx 1070 ti's these cards first off are several years old they're not making the same dent in this industry and especially with ampere's supply uh that these are i mean this is like what this is pascal architecture here great architecture 1070 ti's are awesome cards they were for the price especially on the used market but now i mean you just can't find it like what is this this is a lot of 20 and you bought them for someone bought this for 18 500 a little over a month ago that doesn't make i mean that that's an awful deal that means somebody paid pretty close to a thousand bucks each for these GTX 1070TIs that's um that's a bit desperate but anyway i wanted to clarify that my feud my issue is with listings like this one right involving ampere cards because these are being actively produced right now listings like these are directly affecting supply you see on e-retailer sites and in brick and mortars uh listings like these not so much not really at all actually this listing here probably came from a miner's been using these cards for several years and again the fact that this card was produced several years ago means it's not really making a dent in the current industry although it is contributing to the overall inflation of the market if the other sellers see that buyers are willing to pay upwards of eight nine hundred dollars for a 1070 ti then those other sellers might feel inclined to raise their asking prices as well and when they all do that then yeah prices across the board go up buyers get shafted in the long run but anyway supply is already tight enough as it is and when you remove entire shipments from the equation like this and sell to some miner directly you aren't helping the situation that's kind of the point here it's just you're not even giving bots and scripts a fighting chance which is pretty ridiculous to say because i hate bots and scripts but even individuals are using them because they feel like they have no other choice they're being cornered and you know when you sell to when you sell 72 cards all at once in bulk you're not even giving them a fighting chance because no script is going to buy 72 in bulk especially when these 360TIs are marked up this much even the intended goal was to flip right there's no additional room for profit here so there's no reason to buy all 72 and think oh yeah i can make so much more money these margins are crazy they're really not someone paid a premium for these 360TIs there's really no window no opportunity for uh making some extra cash i mean maybe a few hundred bucks but that's a pretty crappy return given the investment made i don't know guys this you know you see stuff like this and um just really grinds your gears i wanted to bring this to your attention because you should know what you're up against right the game is clearly rigged stuff like this is happening quite a bit maybe not to this extent but it is happening quite a bit under the table distributors and retailers are letting hundreds if not thousands of these cards slip through the cracks for a quick buck and it is leaving a sour taste in the mouth of the pc gaming industry that's all for this one leave a comment down below i would appreciate that consider subscribing if you haven't already and i'll catch you in the next one my name is greg sorry for the bear with bad news thanks for learning with me",

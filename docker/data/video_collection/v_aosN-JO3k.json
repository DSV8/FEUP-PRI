    "transcript": "- Hey guys it's Justine I'm here with my sister Jenna and today we are recreating one of my really old videos. Oh hi, no. This is in honor of national peanut butter and jelly day. I feel like that's your day, Jenna is such a picky eater that anytime we go to restaurants, she would end up just eating a peanut butter and jelly there because. - Or real cheese. - Or cheese. - So I thought today we would dedicate this day to you. - Oh my gosh. What day is it - so special. - What is today? - Today is April 2nd, national peanut butter and jelly day, obviously. - Okay, I knew that. - This is the video that we're gonna be recreating, I had a lot of peanut butter and jelly back in the day and I did a lot of things so take a quick look at what we're gonna do. I've got two loaves of bread, jelly, jelly, peanut butter you are very jelly, let's do a real big scoop. This is a very heavy, peanut butter. It's lookin' real thick, that's good, that's what we want, oh my god this is absolutely just, it looks like vomit. So what I think I'm going to do is put a big hole through this bread and just pour this delicious liquid into it. So this is what we have so far, yeah I didn't do a very good job of making this even but what I do want to do is I want to seal it and just dab it on the sides. Okay that's not working at all, let's see what happens when I pour the mix in. No! No! Let's see if we can do it better this time. Okay so first things that we're gonna need for our peanut butter and jelly sandwich tower is bread. - [Jennifer] Yes. - Peanut butter, jelly. - Oh my gosh. - Yeah, get ripped. - Do we need like a knife, should I do something instead of just stand here. - [Justine] Well. - [Jenna] I'll help. - Now we're gonna put this in here. Okay so we're gonna first put it our jelly. What is the difference between jelly and jam? - [Jenna] You don't know? - If I knew I would be stating it as a fact and not a question, Jen. - I actually don't know but it's probably like the way that it's prepared. - Does Tyler know? - [Man] Yep. - Tyler tell us! - [Tyler] Jelly, wait, jelly is doesn't have the stuff in it, jam has like the seeds and the pulp and the, the, this is my jam. - Okay so then I also have jelly. - Oh my gosh, stop your mind is it peanut butter and jelly or is it peanut butter and jam This video is a lie. - No it's the truth, we're telling the truth. - Oh. - The truth is in the pudding. - Watch this. - That's so you're - shut up, shut up - You got crumbs all over my MacBook. Oh, this is gonna be like our tower so what we're gonna do we're going to need to hollow out this bread. - Shall we get the drill? - Okay, ask Justine from 2013 why she thought this was a good idea. I own a new pair of pants, really excited about 'em. Why did I do this, I don't remember why. I need a circular thing. - When's it expiry? - This is like one of the videos that really started my cooking channel like I started cooking slowly after this. - This expires February 2021, this might outlast me. (laughter) - Okay so now this is, so we have to, oh gosh. So I think what we might, what did you do to that? - It's a (inaudible) I'm making a snack. - Are you eating it? So this has to be here so that then can keep in. This makes my finger. - [Siri] How can I help? - [Both] Oh! No! - So when I did this originally, I'm not sure what I had in mind. - [Jenna] Why are you putting the bread in there? - Because we're gonna mix it up, well this bread has expired so. - What?! I just ate some. - Did you really? Did it taste okay, were you okay, how are you feeling 'cause it definitely was expired that's why I'm using... - I'm a little sweaty. - So here's the problem that I ran into last time was that I really thought that like this was structurally going to hold all of the. - Nothing happened there. - You never saw my video from. - No, I missed that one, I was busy. (blender noise) - Get in there! Oh boy okay. - I just keep eating peanut butter. - Okay that looks good, I wanna take this peanut butter - Yep. - And we're going to, did you eat this too. I need you to help. - That's not how you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. - Oh I'm so sorry, do you know everything or dur bur. - No, it's like you're making a cake now, but I like this, whoa! - So we need to do this to keep the juice inside, this is like my redemption to make this work. - This is disgusting. That smells like fire. - I think my tower's done, if I recall let's see what happened last time. - I got tummy. - When I did this. (dramatic music) - No! No! What do I do, what do I do. This is what we gotta do, push it down a little more. Oh no we have a leak, we have a leak, we have a leak. No, shooks, oh god. No! I was trying to reach my camera. This is what happens when you don't have a crew. What am I meant to do now, I made a big mess and everything is a. Let's just hope that this garbage disposal works. So that's what we did, alright here we go ready. - Wait up, I'm gonna need to help, I haven't done anything yet, let me hold your sticks for you - This is gonna work, oh my gosh everything is working this is great, oh my goodness it only took me six years. - Ugh Maddie's eating Oreo out of the trash. - Maddie no! - He's like I'm sorry I'm cool. - Ooh look it's almost to the top, almost to the top. How's it feel, is it feeling pretty steady? Like there's leaks, we gotta put the jelly topping. - Oh my god I'm covered. - I thought this was gonna be like. - No, like icing. - Yeah and I was gonna like do like a pretty little. - No it's not. - Okay, so now we did that, so now what do we do. - I love video. - Because I feel like this is a very success. It's starting to get a little unsteady. - [Man] Looks like. - Welcome to 2019. - Is it gorging? - Yeah it is, it's. - Oh my god it is - It is I know - It's leak, no, nom where's my knife. - This PBJ thick. Do you want me to hold it like this, squeeze it back together. - [Justine] No. - [Jenna] I'm gonna squeeze it back together okay. - [Justine] No, no I'm putting it down, I patched it. - No! - I'm gonna squeeze it back together. - No you can't squeeze it back together, hold it up. Hold it up! - I'm gonna squeeze it back. - [Both] (Scream) No! No! No! (dramatic music) - But it looks like. - [Jenna] If you would have let me squeezed it back together - In six more years, we'll try again. - How old will we be? - I think I'll be forty something. - You'll be 41. So wait here's the problem like if you flip it this way it still looks good. This looks disgusting, I can't. - Oh my god it looks like intestines that have just spewed like it looks like, it looks like you just like bleh! I'm disgusted, thank you so much for participating in the remake of one of my old videos. I wanna do a couple more of these, there are so many other videos that I've watched of my old videos, I'm super embarrassed by but I would love to do remakes of them. - Shakira, shakira. - Wait. - Hips don't like. (singing) (laughter) - Let's get away now, oh wait I don't wanna go away I want this to go away. - I think I get out of here and go. - I need to like, I gotta move again. - Oh my Uber's here I gotta go. - Bye, wait why are you Ubering didn't you drive here? - Yeah I'm just trying to get out of this. - Okay, see you guys later. - We shoulda put an egg in the middle. - Oh should we have? - I don't know. (french music) - Argh! Okay guys well thanks for watching, let me know what you'd like to see me fail at making next. Uh-huh!",

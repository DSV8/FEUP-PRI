    "transcript": "so it's been almost 10 months since the launch of amd's third generation ryzen processors and it crapped all over intel we all knew it in fact intel was sitting there hoping that their coffee lake cpus like the 9900k would compete against the best that amd had to offer but that wasn't enough in fact what they're trying to do right now is come up with another 14nm called comet lake but look all jokes aside i need to level with you guys intel might not publicly admit it but they know their new desktop cpus are in a really bad place right now they're doing everything they possibly can to stop bleeding until a new architecture and a new manufacturing process is ready remember amd had to go through this years ago in fact they had to last six years on 32 meters until ryzen arrived and what's really interesting is that this is the sixth year that intel is on 40 nanometers but let's also not forget that the fx series from amd was targeted towards the market that was more value focused which kept fans happy one of intel's major problems is nearly every single one of amd's 3rd gen ryzen processors are on sale right now this isn't an official price cut but it still makes things look very different right now than when comet lake was first announced a few weeks ago so can intel overcome that we're about to find out my friends but first a quick message from our sponsor the new fantax p300a enclosure is a great value airflow focused frame thanks to the all new mesh front panel that is a single piece of metal for highest mesh area and durability the inside is nice and simple plus an exhaust fan is included check out the p300a down below alright so this video is going to be more benchmark focused and if you're looking for more information about the architecture and about the processors that intel has announced make sure to check out our explained video i've made a dedicated one covering all of the new cpus and you can check it out right over here even though they're going to be almost two dozen new comet lake cpus available today intel sent us two of them the core i9 10900k which is the flagship and the core i5 10600k a more affordable option both are completely unlocked for overclocking but where they end up against amd is very interesting you see the core i9 10900k is replacing the i9 9900k with more cores and higher clock speeds but with a price of 490 it's up against a pretty tough competitor and that's the ryzen 9 3900x which usually goes for about 500 but lately i've been seeing it floating around for between 400 and 440 it'll be interesting to see if those sales continue and if it actually does intel is going to be fighting an uphill battle against a processor that has a efficient manufacturing process with more threats and a much lower price tag as for the i5-10600k well as a replacement for the 9600k it looks pretty good by offering double the number of threads and slightly higher frequencies technically it's going head-to-head against the six-core 12-threaded 3600x but through the miracle of sales it's going for just 205 dollars these days so that means the 10600k ends up almost hitting the same price as the um yeah the eight core 16 thread ryzen 7 3700x which used to hit the 330 mark but prices have dropped below 300 now there are a few things that i want to mention about these prices before going any further first of all sales don't last forever so the ryzen 3000s might rise in cost but i'm not entirely sure about that also some of them are pretty old as far as processors go and amd did say that they will launch the zen 3 this year so until next gen ryzen cps roll out this is the perfect opportunity to keep those prices low and really put the hurt on intel now as for intel prices let's just say that i'll believe them when i see them online so take that with a grain of salt another thing i want to talk about is clock speeds because on these new cpus there is a ton of variables when it comes to hitting intel's advertised frequencies especially with the core i9-10900k it actually has a ton of different frequencies many of which you've probably seen on past intel cpus and all of them are dependent on variables like power temperatures and workload so there's a base frequency of 3.7 gigahertz and the usual turbo boost 2.0 which can bring a single core up to 5.1 gigahertz turbo boost 3.0 then enhances the capability by finding the fastest core and boosting that one to even further to 5.2 gigahertz in single threaded workloads then there's all core turbo frequency of 4.8 gigahertz which is the theoretical maximum sustained clock speed when all cores and threads are fully loaded the new addition here is what intel calls thermal velocity boost and it takes frequencies to the next level but only in very short bursts on your cpu's two best cores and under strict circumstances it'll only be enabled if these cpu temps is 70 degrees celsius or less and the cpu's power package allows for higher speeds speaking of those boost levels i should also mention that each motherboard manufacturer has a different way of addressing them and many tend to operate outside of intel's predefined limits so for example asus automatically enables their multi-core enhancement which artificially enhances scores meanwhile the latest version of gigabytes bios extends power limits so these new cpus will operate at higher power thresholds for longer periods of time we always stick to intel's predefined stock settings so let's see what that translates to in terms of clock speeds first of all you can see here that the two best course on the 10900k i have over here is number four and number five those are the only ones that'll hit 5.3 gigahertz on a single core by charting temperatures and clock speeds over time on a single core you can see that speeds hitting that 5.3 gigahertz mark but only occasionally this might only tell half the story though since our one second polling rate likely isn't picking up some millisecond changes in speed so the 10900k could be hitting the high ratio more often than we see but if you look towards the center of the chart temperatures on this core rose a bit which likely meant another windows process started eating up some resources since temperatures stayed below 60 degrees celsius and package power was super low as well technically the frequencies should have stayed between 5.1 gigahertz and 5.3 gigahertz but they didn't honestly this just shows just how damn picky intel's boost algorithm is but what about multi-core workloads like maya render well starting things off with a default fan speed profile on the asus motherboard and a noctua u12s that i'm using here things got interesting temperature spiked before the heatsink fans could catch up but then they leveled out way under intel's 70 degree threshold for thermal velocity boost as for clock speeds well the first 30 seconds shows clocks hitting really impressive speeds as intel's short duration power limit gives a more relaxed setting but that also caused the temperature to increase then intel's long duration power limit sets in and frequencies and temperatures go to a nosedive with the 10900k varying between 4.1 and 4.2 gigahertz but what happens when we add more cooling would the chips stay at higher speeds well i stuck two fans running 100% on the u12s and the temperatures never got above 75 degrees celsius which should mean we'd hit higher average clock speeds right well no after that short burst of speed it leveled out around 4.2 gigahertz again which is way under intel's 4.8 gigahertz claim but there's nothing new about that this seems to be more about package power limits rather than temperatures getting intel cpus to hit their turbo frequencies on a constant basis usually involves overclocking and what about the 10600k well it doesn't have thermal velocity boost or turbo boost max 3.0 and its behavior was quite different it's all core speeds remained really consistent over the course of the test so now that we have a better understanding of how these cpus behave let's dive into the benchmarks but before that i'll pause here for a bit just so you can go over our test system configuration so feel free to pause go over all the setups yeah okay so starting off with cinebench single core and this is one area where intel has always been strong even though amd has made some really big steps towards improving their performance here but moving on to multi-core workload and well intel's comet lake is a big improvement over their previous generation but in comparison to amd it just isn't enough one of the biggest concerns here is the 10600k which has the same number of processing threads as the 3600x still falls short moving on to real world testing the first thing that i wanted to tackle is adobe premiere pro since it's been through a couple of really important revisions lately that we needed to talk about let's start things off with the baseline rendering without any hardware acceleration this situation perfectly illustrated what would happen with a multi-pass render or with encoding options that only support software encoding here intel's pane is pretty evident and while the 10900k loses the 10600k gets absolutely creamed it barely offers any better performance than the 9600k this next test shows how currently intel can leverage their quick sync feature to accelerate video encoding sure their cpus are ahead but look a bit closer and there's obviously no reason to spend more money on an i9 since the integrated graphics module becomes the bottleneck but adobe has been pretty busy lately rolling out hardware acceleration for more than just intel in its latest release and 14.3 beta both amd and nvidia gpus are able to offer hardware acceleration which will even the playing field in a big way let's take a look at how that turns out with an rtx 2080 ti installed so this came as a bit of a surprise while intel has completely lost their massive lead they're still able to stay ahead of amd why let's drill down a bit to see what's actually happening here here you can see that in the current hardware accelerated build the intel gpu is responsible for video decoding the nvidia card takes care of some copying tasks and the cpu crunches through encoding and a bunch of other things switching over to the 14.3 beta allows every resource to be properly used in parallel that means video encode is being done by nvidia's and bank encoder the intel graphics takes care of decoding and the cpu is still being used but a lot less than before so the integrated gpu is still used here and allows comet lake to stay in front by a bit this also makes me really interested to see how amd's apus do here moving on to resolve and here the intel cpus are pretty competitive but not by all that much the close results are because this program is really gpu dependent when its hardware acceleration is enabled basically you have the gpu working away at almost 100 while the cpus only deal with light workloads as for the rest of tests well what you see here is a really similar situation playing out again and again in any situation where there's an all-core load amd completely dominates anything intel can offer meanwhile in mixed workloads like you find in some programs intel stays ahead but really not by all that much for example would i buy the 10900k or the 10600k over the 3900x or the 3600x for something like metashape well based on andy's current prices absolutely not because the ryzen series would give me more quality core flexibility for other programs too rather than just being strong in one area as a matter of fact depending on where the 10 600 case retail price lands it might have a really big problem with the 3700x even for lightly threaded workloads switching to blender it's a switch back to the pain game for intel versus amd but to their benefit the new i9 and i5 cpus do offer a lot more performance than coffee lake that'll be a big deal for intel buyers and applications like autodesk maya but all in all it just feels like amd has a better rounded lineup that balances multi-core domination with very good single core results moving on to gaming and this is an area where intel claims their i9 10900k is the fastest cpu that has ever been created well let's put those claims to the test and yeah it looks like these results really do put things into perspective don't they modern warfare does seem to really like high core counts and speeds but it's the only game in the situation i mean sure the 10900k and the 10600k do provide really good frame rates but those small chart differences doesn't lead to a subjectively better experience in any way even the one percent lows are pretty identical across the board i could have loaded things in intel's favor by benchmarking at a low resolution but that's just not a realistic situation for someone spending hundreds of dollars on a cpu as it stands we're using the most powerful gpu on the market right now and using it at 1080p yeah it just it still becomes a bottleneck look if you only want a system for gaming purposes avoid the 10900k the 3900x the 3700x the 10600k or any other high-end cpu for that matter just get yourself an affordable processor and maximize on your graphics card budget and thank us later so with that out of the way i think it's time to tackle something that a lot of people were concerned about when they heard intel was going to push higher core counts and higher frequencies on the same old 14 nanometer process and that is temperatures and power consumption back at the beginning of this video we've already seen that temperatures are fairly manageable with a decent air cooler like the noctua u12s it also feels like intel throttles their clock speeds based on power consumption rather than heat so what does that really mean well taking a look at the package power over time it really conveys an interesting story starting with the 10900k and already there's a problem that was evident earlier this thing sucks down a huge amount of electricity in the first 30 seconds of all core load yep that's about 225 watts and since most synthetic benchmarks like cinebench don't take that long to complete this out-of-spec behavior will artificially inflate intel scores luckily this won't impact our results since most of our tests are real-world scenarios that take a while to complete now after that huge boost it's almost like an algorithm saying whoops i shouldn't be doing this and stamped things back in line to the rated 125 watts remember this is supposedly an intel's defaults without any motherboard specific enhancements enabled but looking at this makes me wonder if the asus board isn't still doing something behind the scenes now taking a look at the 10600k and because it doesn't have the turbo boost max 3.0 or thermal velocity boost its behavior is a lot more predictable it remains flat 100 watts through the entire test and what does that mean for power consumption of the whole system well over the course of a 15-minute test both of those processors are relatively efficient all things considered but just like we saw there's a lot more to it with the core i9 10900k if we factor peak power consumption into that equation the 10900k gets all bent out of sorts this actually pisses me off right now since this can totally throw off power supply calculations and it can also push less capable heat sinks right off the edge on that note i think it's time to wrap up this review while the addition of new cores and threads make these new cpus a bit more competitive in my opinion it's too little and way way too late because intel had the opportunity to stop their bleeding back when coffee lake was launched but instead it was the same old endless identical refreshes basically intel buried their heads in sand and let ryzen walk all over them now comet lake can be really really fast in some situations but it feels like a generation behind at prices that have already been undercut by some amd cpu sales it's also coupled to a z490 platform which brings absolutely nothing new to the table but what if they're wearing any sales well i'd still recommend the ryzen 9 3900x over the core i9 10900k because it's just a versatile all-round processor the same story goes for the 3600x i still recommend that cpu over the core i5 10 600k competition is good though so i guess the best thing i can say about these new processors is they're causing lower rising prices and hopefully intel can adjust their strategy to somehow compensate before zen 3 hits so that's it for me guys thank you so much for watching stay safe spend responsibly and i'll talk to you guys in the next one",

    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Well, I have a wonderful electronic invention I want you to see. - You guys, right now, we are going to the Black Ops 4 community reveal event. I am so excited. They just opened the doors and we're all heading in. (intense techno music) - [Justine] What's up, bud? - Nothing much. I'm just excited for Call of Duty. - [Justine] Me too! - How're you doing? - [Justine] Good! - [Matt] It's been too long! Too long, six? Six and a half minutes? - Six and a half minutes before the event starts and then guess what? We get to capture some gameplay after. - [Matt] 35 seconds. - 33 seconds. It's coming. - Black Ops 4. It's coming. - [Matt] I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm copying everything that Matt's saying. - [Matt] 25 seconds! - [Justine] Woo! (intense techno music) (audience cheering) - Listen, we wanna start with what matters the most. With you, our players. - I gotta update my Twitter name before I'm on there. (audience laughs) - And done! - We gotta get you to show maintenance. - Oh. (intense techno music) - This is during Battle Royale the Black Ops play. (audience cheers) - This is Blackout. - We just got out of the reveal event. Okay, I'm not gonna lie, I'm kind of excited about Black Ops Blackout. Are you? - Yeah, it's just a lot of information to take in. - It was so much information and the zombies? There's like, so much is going into it that it was actually slightly overwhelming and extremely violent. At one point, I was like, oh wow, you guys really, you really went there. - Yeah, they went for it. It was a full settin' on trailer's part. - This is super exciting. We are about to play. We're gonna be capturing some gameplay and thankfully Matt is on my team and not on the other side, so, hopefully... - Well I'm just gettin' yelled at so- - Why? - They just gave us our USB to record with. I got T Martin, and a bunch of my YouTube friends- - I'm just glad that Matt's on my team this time. Are playing some Domination. Here's a little bit of gameplay from our domination game that we played. And spoiler alert, we actually ended up losing this. I'm not proud of it. Either way, we were playing on Playstation and I actually play on Xbox so that's gonna be my excuse as to why I'm not playing perfectly and I didn't do my best and why we didn't win. What's life if you can't blame somebody else or make an excuse for why you're not doing something correct. I'd say one of the biggest take aways from today's event, and I'm totally okay with this, is that there isn't gonna be a single-player mode. To be completely honest with you, I always start playing the campaigns, and then I'm like, Mmm I'm just gonna go back to multi-player because that's what I really enjoy playing. They did mention something about if you do like to play alone, there'll be some sort of solo in zombies. They didn't really go into specific details. They said this a few times, on different occasions, talking about people of all skill levels. So it does seem like they are trying to gear this also towards new players who maybe haven't played the franchise before. Which is interesting to think about, because there really are real people who have never played Call of Duty. Maybe some of you guys out there have not ever played the game either. There was also some exiting news for Call of Duty PC players that Call of Duty is now coming to Battle Net for the first time. Which is kind of awesome, actually. They'll have dedicated servers, uncut frame rates, and 4K HD Ultra-ride monitor support. Which almost makes me wanna try it out. I don't wanna get into a fight with the PC master race, but I like my Xbox. I don't wanna fight with Playstation people either. I just wanna play games where I wanna play games and be left alone. There was also lots of zombies updates. They showed a bunch of different custom options and modes. There was also gladiator arena, and a Titanic cruise ship, and it was cool, because they showed little mini stories surrounding each of these scenarios, but then everyone eventually turned into zombies, and then that was the end of the trailer. One of the things that was rumored and we all pretty much assumed that this was going to happen, it almost has to happen, they announced a battle royale map and it's called Blackout. You know, much like Fortnite and Pub G, they didn't say how many players would be dropped into the maps, but what makes this so interesting is because they have such a huge IP, the possibilities of integrating so many past stories, multi-player maps, zombies modes, characters, into one huge massive battle royale map is really, really cool. Haters are gonna hate, but I think this is gonna be pretty awesome. Let me know what you guys think in the comments below about the game. Did you watch the reveal? If you didn't, you probably should watch it, because I think I did a really bad job of summing it all up. So we just got done playing, I captured a little bit of gameplay. Matt, what did you think? - I actually enjoyed it a lot. I had a lot of fun. I mean the guns feel exactly like they did in Black Ops 3, I didn't get to use a lot of the specialists, which I think is gonna change the way that you interact and move within the maps. - Cool, and you brought your own controller. - I did bring my own controller, oops. - I did not bring my own controller and I play on Xbox as well so that's a thing. Oh, my goodness and it's Jordan, hello. - How, are you doing? - [Justine] Did you play? - I'm doing great, no I missed my time. - [Justine] Oh... - I was supposed to start at 11:00 and they were at the front and they were like, you wanna play on PC? Do you wanna play on Playstation? I was like, PC sounds great. Oh, head over there. Well, they're only capturing here. So I... - [Justine] Noooo. Well you can have some of my gameplay if you want. It's not very good. - [Jordan] Uh... - Oh, the game's fun. My gameplay's not very good. Hopefully you get to play. - [Jordan] Have you tried the grappling hook, the grappling hook's pretty- - No, because Matt kept taking that specialist. - [Jordan] Oh, can not more than one person have that at a time? - Nope, one specialist per team. - [Jordan] Ohh, that's why everyone else on my team was like, hey how do you try to grappling hook and I'm like I don't know, just select it. - They couldn't. - [Jordan] Sorry, guys. - Hey look who I just ran into, so this is my new best friend, Josh. - Condo Boys. - Woo! Condo 3.0? - No, 2.0! - This is 3.0! - Oh, yeah, yeah. - This is happenin' now. - Oh yeah this is way better. - What'd you think of the game? - So I thought the game was really cool I like the fact that you can manually heal yourself. But what I like better than all that is the zombies. - Yes! - The new storyline and how cool it looks and the mythical creatures-ness. I'm all ready for it. - I'm excited for the blackouts. So it's like- you're not? - I'm excited for it, but there's already so much of that coming out. I just like the whole storyline of zombies and I'm a big fan of zombies, so... - Yeah, I don't really play zombies that much, but I'm kind of excited to see what they do with the battle royale. Just the fact that they're taking all of the Black Ops characters, the franchises, and basically everything in the Black Ops world and turning into one huge map is gonna be really cool. But yeah, it was good to see you! - Yeah, I'm so happy to see you, too. Colab soon. - Let's do it, we have to. Mayven, there's a meme, oh that was lovely, of you with the blonde wig is my favorite meme ever. - I look just like you. - Yes. What do you guys think? Does it look like me? Or no?

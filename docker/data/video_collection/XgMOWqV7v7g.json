    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is Austin, lemme paint you a picture. - Please. - The year is 2026, five years into our future. - Yes. - Elon Musk has just been elected The Emperor of Mars. Dogecoin is the only universal currency. - [Austin] Checks out. Go ahead. - And AMD and Intel are on a banana peel. (Austin laughing) - That's not where I thought you were going with that. So, if you look at the trends over the last few years, there's a lot changing in not only the PC space, but in the mobile space, right? For a very long time, specifically on the PC side of things, there were two chip companies who made all of the CPU's; AMD and Intel. - Right. - You're probably familiar. However, now, as we sit here in 2021, their tides a changin' winds a drifitin', metaphors are falling apart. And the thing that I think we really need to keep in mind here, is that I think the next five years are gonna be really exciting. But, I also think that there's gonna be a lot of fragmentation because the duopoly that has existed for 15 plus years, - Wobble. - is, I don't wanna say crumbling, but there are some things that are gonna shake things up a lot. I say word \"things\" a lot, by the way, you're welcome. - And, we already have that starting now. So like, lemme say, a few years ago, the only chips you could buy was AMD, Intel. I mean, obviously there's some smaller ones. You have so many new companies who are making their own chips now. - [Austin] Yes. - So Apple makes the M1 chip, which is obviously the biggest one, which is-- - We're specifically talking about computers by the way. - Yes. - For right now, obviously-- - Yes we're not, yeah. - Mobile is a whole other thing. - Yeah. Microsoft has announced that they will be making their own chips for servers and surfaces. - [Austin] Yap. - However, just little asterisk on that. I, that's all gonna be business side things. I don't know if you gonna-- - Probably. - You're probably not gonna see those in a consumer laptop anytime soon. - Maybe, we'll see. - Yeah. Then you have little outliers. - [Austin] Okay. - So, obviously Samsung makes their own mobile chips and they do make some for Chromebooks. - For many years. Yes. You can buy a Chromebook with a Samsung processor, (indistinct) - [Man] Yeah. Amazon makes their own AWS chips, the Graviton Arm-chips. - Which are server chips. - Yes, they are server chips, but as we were talking in our pre-brief, I mean, I don't see why they would do it, but they could theoretically put those in a laptop, if they want to. And then you have weird outliers of, Raspberry Pi Foundation, just made their own silicon. - But that one's a little different, but sure. - It, but like, again, it's you have-- - There's a-- - When are we gonna see a Raspberry Pi full laptop? - I mean, you could just make one of those. So the thing is, all of these have a single threat, ARM. Now, if you're not familiar with ARM, ARM is the company and the, (shushing) - This is where I'm-- - I was gonna say structure, the instruction set. - This is where I have no idea what you're talking about. - Okay. Here's the thing, right? x86 and x64 have been around for a very long time, right? Intel and AMD have very much cornered that market. That's a traditional PC, however, ARM processors are based on a different instruction set, which is much more mobile focused. But, in a lot of ways, is a lot more modern, right? It's taken years to sort of catch up. But at this point you have a lot of that sort of legacy stuff that Intel and AMD are dragging along, the ARM is kinda jettisoned. Case in point, how Apple would the M1 chip have created essentially the fastest individual cores on any device, period. Your overclocks Ryzen, your i9 at 5.2 gigahertz. It still can hardly hold a candle to a 15 watt laptop chip, that goes inside your MacBook Air, for example. Right. So that's kind of like the baseline for what ARM makes possible. And the thing is, ARM, is not necessarily a company who makes chips, they design like the sort of the structure. And then other companies such as Apple, such as Samsung, such as Nvidia, who are purchasing ARM right now, could all license that and make their own versions, right? But ARM, it does seem like we're looking at a case right now where ARM is more powerful, or it has a potential to make more powerful chips and much more power efficient chips, which is essentially all that matters. If you have more performance and less power, congratulations, you have won, the Silicon Lottery. - ARM doesn't matter as much for desktop, because you don't, like, you don't need the battery efficiency. - Yes. - Like obviously you want lower power consumption. - [Austin] Of course. - And I mean, just from the practical standpoint, it just means literally as lower electricity, electrical bill. - Oh, but it also enables new form factors. You may not need as much cooling. - It's always a good thing. - It's, yeah, like there's, it's, good things but doesn't like matter as much as compared to like the MacBook, which is, you know, less than an inch thick, like obviously it has better applications for laptop side. - Yeah. - And so, if we were to see this massive change in the industry, the way I would see it rippling out, would be, our, we're already starting to see it with phones, you know, the companies making their own chips and stuff like that, better chips. - So here's where we are right now in 2021, right? Desktops obviously, overwhelmingly, Intel at the moment, but AMD are taking major inroads, right? AMD are doing very well. - [Man] Okay, past two years? - [Austin] Yeah. But AMD is really like, there are years and years of Intel devices out there. - Yeah. AMD has done nothing for decades before (indistinct) - I mean. - That's unfair to AMD. That's unfair to AMD. - It's been only a couple of years since AMD is on the come up, and keep in mind with all of this stuff, there are these huge sort of tides, right? None of this changes on a dime. It is a sort of gradual change, where kinda like the tide shifts this way, and that way. Right? But right now, Intel still has a pretty dominating lead, but AMD are certainly catching up. And if you look at like the individual, like month to month sales, AMD are probably doing just as good on the desktop side. - [Man] Yeah. - Right? But then you look on the laptop side, where Intel and AMD have come sort of blow for blow, largely because Intel had some major manufacturing issues which held them back by many years and allowed AMD to catch up. And inevitably TSMC is gonna make every single chip in the entire universe. So it doesn't matter. But, if you look outside of the sort of x86 ARM's sort of divide, what you look at here, is a future in which it seems like for some use cases, Intel and AMD, are not going to be as prevalent as they are today, right? Servers, would be a big one, right? For a very long time, Intel dominated the server market. They were really the standard, and just like in the desktop and laptop space, AMD have caught up in a big way and deliver generally speaking, better performance at cheaper prices. However, when it comes to a server, the price of the chips, so, a lot of times if you've ever watched a Linus tech tips video, and if you're watching this channel and you haven't I am surprised has you make it here, but thanks for joining and make sure to subscribe to the channel 'cause we make better videos than, I can't even say. - No we don't. - But when it comes to a server, right, you might look at like some $10,000 chip and go, \"Oh my God, that's insane.\" When you look at a chip, that's sitting inside a server rack, in a Google data firm, that runs at 100%, 24/7, for five years at a time, the cost of electricity to run that chip is far more expensive than the actual chip itself in many cases, right? So, in a service sort of context, ARM is perfect. And that is a big reason why you look at AWS being largely powered by these Graviton chips that AWS or Amazon or whatever subsidiary has designed, because they are more power efficient. And generally speaking, get delivered good enough performance that, if it costs half as much to run and it delivers 80% of the performance, you just saved $40 million on your electricity bill as AWS, right? I mean, there are very clear incentives for this to happen. The laptop side, I think, as you were talking about earlier, that's where it gets a little bit more interesting 'cause that's sort of a blend of the power efficiency is incredibly important, right? - Yeah. - The performance is very important, but it's not the be all and end all, but it does go a long way, toward making ARM a more viable future. - It's hard to look at like the M1 chip. - [Austin] Yeah. - And what is given on the MacBook and say that laptops should have anything other than ARM. Like, except for the, like the very specific use cases of like the (indistinct), like desktop grade laptops that are, you know, these massive bricks. Like, it's very hard to say like, \"All right. I want my 14 hours of battery life. You know, it's a laptop. I want to be portable and everything like that.\" It's having an x86 chip just makes it such a hard sell. - Intel, AMD. - Yeah, like. - So, for context, we're the laptop spaces is right now. If you look on the Apple side, they obviously control the entire stack. They make the software, the hardware, they make the chips, right? Which is why they're able to bring their very powerful, honestly, mobile based stuff, right? The M1 chip inside a MacBook is not wildly different than the A14 chip that you have in like a, an iPhone or something, right? They've just essentially scaled it up, beefed it up, but it's still, in it's core are pretty similar. - [Man] Yeah. - But the difference is, Apple as the creator of everything including the software, rewrote all of Mac OS to work natively and then said, \"Hey by the way, we're not making any more Intel Macs, so guess what, if you wanna make an Mac app ever in the future, and you want it to, you know, work on people's systems, make sure that you actually make it with ARM compatibility or Apple Silicon compatibility mind, right?\" Apple has the sort of strength to just say, \"Hey, Chrome, you wanna work on a Mac, get on board 'cause the train's leaving the station, and ain't got no breaks.\" I think that's a direct quote from Tim Cook. I think that's, he said that, however, on the Windows side it is actually very different, because Windows on ARM has been around for years, right? We talked about Windows RT with the original surface. - And every time we talk about it, it's talking about how poor ARM and Windows really is. - Well, okay. There are two problems with it, 'cause the compatibility exists. The issue is that right now if you're buying an ARM-powered Windows device, you're using almost certainly a Qualcomm chip, right? Now again, just like how the M1 chip is a extension of the mobile focused, you know, iPhone chips. A Qualcomm chip, such as the SQ1 or the SQ2, is very much an extension of the mobile stuff. In fact, the first sort of Snapdragon processors that you had inside Windows devices were just like Snapdragon 835. So, it was like straight out of your Pixel, or your Nexus, whatever, dropped into a laptop. Obviously there's a lot of software involved. But, the issue here is twofold. Now, at the moment here sitting here 2021, Qualcomm chips are just simply still too far behind. Apple has made the strides to actually outperform the Intels and the AMDs of the world, and the vast majority of these sort of like, laptop-based use cases. - [Man] Yeah. - Qualcomm are still a little bit behind, right? Not to say they won't catch up. And honestly, my bet is, when we watch this video back in 2026, we'll be like, (laughing) \"Remember when they were behind.\" Because there's certainly the trajectory, they're catching up a lot faster, but they're a couple years behind, right? Which means that at the moment, these Snapdragon on ARM or on Windows sort of devices, they're just simply not as powerful, full stop. Right? And then, you have the compatibility layer and you have the software where, you know, Windows is not saying, \"Hey, guess what? Until AMD processors go away, every Windows developer needs to now program for ARM. Because, 'cause simply not a lot of people are actually buying these things. - And I think that's gonna be a big factor in why kind of ARM on Windows will never actually catch up to M1 Mac. - Slowly, will be my guess. - I think over this, here's my prediction over the next five years, Apple is gonna really pull away, - Yeah. - for a time, while, you like you say, Qualcomm catches up while all these other manufacturers can catch up with ARM, but for the next five years, it could be a big gap. - [Austin] Yeah. - But I don't think that gap is ever gonna be, you know, actually closed. I think it will get much closer, but because of that compatibility, you know, controlling every aspect of the software hardware. That's why I think that the M1 Macs or whatever it is in five years. - [Austin] M6 at that point. - Yeah, exactly. Well, I think they're always gonna have that leg up there, which is kind of all like it's been true for a long time. And now this, the process is really the last piece of that puzzle. - Yeah. And it's gonna be difficult on Windows because while this certainly like, if you use a ARM-based Windows device right now, it is fine, right? Like the actual Windows part, they've had that up and running for years, the problem is, while the performance isn't quite there for an optimized out, that's fine, when you're running in that compatibility layer, so essentially something that hasn't actually been updated to run, it goes from being a little slower, to a lot slower than something like an Intel or an AMD device is certainly way slower than M1 Mac, which-- - The one we were trying was Adobe, which like Photoshop, just doesn't work on Windows. - And they promised updates for years. - [Man] Yeah. - But the problem is I, look, I don't, I've never seen any of these numbers. I'm completely taking a guess here. But if I were to take an educated guess, they don't sell a lot of these ARM, Windows devices, which is not to say that they're bad devices, They still have a lot of those same improvements like better battery life, LTE support. There's a lot of good stuff in these, but-- - Well, where they sell 'em is the business sector. - Yes they do. - And the need versus want scenario for the business sector, is so much different than-- - [Austin] Yeah. - You look at like every time we talk about a Windows laptop, a Windows service error. So many people like; no GPU, deal-breaker. - Yeah. - No this, deal-breaker. All of those things are not deal-breakers in the business sector. I personally think that Microsoft might actually just get out of the consumer side, of like, I think that (indistinct) would be specifically for education or business, where like, you know, having the best GPU is not a really a thing. That's just, that's another thing. - That's the thing though, right? That really leaves one segment of the market, which is the gaming desktop side of things, right? - Yeah. - This is the thing that I think will take the longest to transition. I think in 2026, we're still doing game PC builds with Intel and AMD processors. - Yeah. - I think by that point, like I was saying earlier, there's such a long sort of tail where like sort of a company comes up, and it goes down slowly. There's not like these like huge spikes, right? Right now AMD is absolutely ascending, right? They're doing very well. They're continuously sort of chipping away into Intel's lead. And I think for the next five years, that's gonna continue, right? Intel still have more systems out there. You have to consider desktops aren't updated every year or whatever, right? There's a lot of systems that are running three, four, five, six, seven-year old processors. I think five years from now, Intel and AMD will largely be at (indistinct), right? I do think that AMD are ahead right now, but Intel are gonna catch up, right? Intel are too big, they're too powerful not to be behind for that long. - Intel (indistinct) was riding their coattails for a long time, which I think is exactly what AMD is gonna start doing. And it just, it shifts. - Yeah. - Now, I do think there's gonna be a secret dark horse. - Ooh, go ahead. Hit me. - What happens in five years when Nvidia releases their, now that they own ARM. - Well, no, they actually don't. They're purchasing-- - They're purchasing ARM. - A lot of people don't want them to do that, but they are trying to purchase. - If that purchase goes through, now Nvidia owns the architecture, right? - That would be correct, yeah. - I wanna use the right term. - Yeah, it's an architecture. - Yes. So now they own that, they can start making their own chips. The-- - [Austin] Certainly. - The Nvidia G-whatever, which, guess what? Works better with their Nvidia graphics cards, because the two are made for each other. The same way that the M1 Mac works better on that system. - Yeah. - So, now we start to see, if we start seeing desktop Nvidia chips, that give that much better gaming performance. - That's possible. - I think that's something we'll start to see. - The software side will come. I do think that ARM on Windows will just get better, right? I mean, it's slowly gets better. It's getting very slowly better, but it will get better, right? But if you look at the desktop gaming side of things, I think that's a totally plausible thing. I think five years is probably a somewhat optimistic side of that, just because these chips, I mean, it's easy to forget. It takes years and years and years and years to develop a chip. And on top of that, it takes a long time for the market to move. And plus I think Nvidia may get anti-trusted out of this idea, if they start doing this, and then people start complaining, 'cause it gets a little like a, a little bit of a gray area there. But regardless, I think if you're looking at 2026 my prediction is this, game PCs are probably one of the last bastions of Intel and AMD dominance. I don't think ARM is gonna take over there. I think on the laptop side, it will be a little bit more of a mix, but I do think stuff like obviously the Apple stuff will be really far ahead. And by then you will see, you know, stuff like Qualcomm, stuff like Nvidia, I guess if they jump into it. Other ARM devices actually doing well on the laptop side, and then on the server side, I see it's gonna be largely ARM-based through Microsoft chips, and Qualcomm chips, and Amazon chips, and whoever wants to make one. I think it'll be really an exciting time, but let us know in the comments below, what do you think 2026 is gonna look like in the computing side? Are we're all gonna throw our computers in the garbage and be using our Galaxy Fold 7s? Let us know. Make sure to ring-a-ling that ding-a-ling bell. And until next time, we're gonna go be obsolete. - Are you implying that (indistinct) is gonna replace all your, our computers?",

    "transcript": "Be careful accepting USB adapters and USB cables from strangers. This is an O.MG adapter it has a built-in key logger so if you connect a keyboard to this I'll be able to capture your keystrokes including your passwords. It has a built-in Wi-Fi access point so I can connect to it remotely. I'll connect to the O.MG adapter to the computer and what I'll do here is connect an external keyboard. What I've done on my iPhone is connect to the O.MG cables Wi-Fi network and I'll open up a web browser to the cable and go to keylog. What I'll do is enter my password. Now sometimes it misses one of the keystrokes but I think you can guess what the password is that I use there if I go to show all notice at the end there we've got password one back on live view I'll open a wordpad and I'll type hello and notice there once again it's captured the word hello.",

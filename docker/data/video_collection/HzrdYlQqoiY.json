    "transcript": "- Look what just came in the mail, this is the brand new, Microsoft Surface Studio 2, and this thing is incredible. I had the first version, some of you guys may have seen that unboxing, and I have absolutely loved it, I've gamed, I've done design work on it, I've edited videos on it, this model that we're about to unbox has the 7th gen Core i7 processor, one terabyte solid-state drive and 32GB RAM. So let's slice and dice this up, this knife is so sharp, it's always so shocking! Are you ready? It's got a little illustration here that shows me that I should probably lay it down, so I'm not doing properly. Oh my gosh, this thing is so cool. Let's get you outta here, buddy, let's free you from this prison that they have put you in. Your styrofoam prison, that reminds me of a song They're tryna build a prison Does this move down, does this move it down, come on. Oh my gosh, I'm so weak (squeals) it's actually not that heavy but it's so awkward to try to hold it. - [Camera Woman] You're awkward to try to hold. - That's what she said! OK now we got that out, we'll get to you in a second, let's see what else we've got in here. (rattling) - [Camera Woman] Well don't shake it. - Oh sorry, I don't know, I got excited, it's like Christmas morning whenever you're like going underneath the Christmas tree, what presents did I get? To try to figure it out. Oh we've got the power cable, I would of never guessed. We've got, oops, ripped it. Oh look at that nice glossy finish. Oh, I wanted to smell the paper and I gave myself a paper cut. Here's probably the keyboard and the mouse. Ooh and a stylus, don't touch my stylus. Only like five of you get the joke, don't touch my stylus. What a great sound, can you hear that? (plastic crackling) should I just do a whole ASMR channel? - [Camera Woman] No. - Okay - [Camera Woman] I won't subscribe to that. - OK, you won't but someone would I'm sure. We've got the keyboard. Oh, wow, it just popped right out. - [Camera Woman] It comes with batteries. - Yeah, right? Oh that's nice 'cause it's just like magnetic. I love Surface products, like Microsoft really has done such a great job with these. Pull to activate, oh! I can't hold onto things, I have a problem. So that's everything that's in the box. (plastic crackling) what a great sound. So in the back here we've got four USB 3.0 ports, to an Ethernet port, we have, ooh we've got a nice Thunderbolt port, ooh we've got a nice USB-C port, ha, and an SD card slot and a headphone jack, what! (plastic crackling) What is that song? - [Camera Woman] You gonna plug it in? I almost stabbed myself. This, almost got me. - they're tryna build a prison What is that song? Play Prison Song, it is System Of A Down. - [Siri] Now playing Every Rose Has Its Thorn. - What? No, absolutely not! Play Prison Song. - [Siri] Every Rose Has Its Thorn by Poison now playing. - No! Play Prison Song by System Of A Down. - [Siri] Now playing Prison Song by System Of A Down. - they're tryna build a prison (\"Prison Song\" by System Of A Down) Dun dun dun dun dun They're tryna build a prison I'm, OK, I mean I love System Of A Down! Hey Siri stop playing, before I get a copyright strike. She doesn't care about my copyright strike, stop playing. Let's plug this in. - [Camera Woman] I love your decorations. - I love what you've done with the place. - [Camera Woman] I love what you've done, wait, wait, the tiny hat (laughs). - See, (laughs) you guys, you come for the unboxing and you stay for the tiny hat. - [Camera Woman] What about the pig that has boots on? - The pig has boots on and the dog's collar, don't even ask questions, it's like... - [Camera Woman] I'm not 'cause I did all that but... - It's fine. - [Camera Woman] Okay. - Ow, the sheath was not on. OK. - [Camera Woman] What are we gonna do now? - We're gonna turn it on. Ah, what's happening? I can't see anything, is something happening? - [Camera Woman] That screen. - It's honestly so incredible. Hey, oh. - Hi there, I'm Britannia and I'm here to help. - She wants to help me. - A little sign in here, a touch of WiFi there and we'll have your PC ready for all you plan to do. - I have the same reactions every time I go to the setup screen. - Just select the little microphone icon towards the bottom of your screen. - The little microphone! - If you need an assistive screen reader, press the windows, control and enter keys at the same time to turn on narrator. - OK, well I'm gonna set this up and then I'll see you guys in a second. - That's enough intro, let's begin. - Here it is, Studio Unboxing, May 2nd, 2017. Are we doing an unboxing, or what are we doing? I just love that this is touchscreen, like this is so great. (YouTube video playing) I made the same joke. - [Camera Woman] You should've worn the same sweater again. - I was so worried that I was gonna wear the same thing, I should've checked, I wonder if I made any other same jokes oh I don't think I said that one yet. Get this stylus poppin'. Does this come with a Surface style? I think we decided the last time, it does not come with a Surface style. So I've been working really hard on this illustration and I just am so excited that today I get to show it to you. So I have a secret talent of drawing, cars, but I don't like to finish them entirely, I just like, suppose I should a little bit. So this is my drawing (laughs) I don't know what to do, so I'm just gonna finish this up, color this in real nice, like look at that, wow, this is so incredible. I'm graffitiing all over this, oh that's, change the colors. This is where kind of a dial would be really cool, it's because you can use the dial to just sort through the colors and different brushes. So talented, shall I print this out, you guys want this? Do you want my art? How do I make a new document, this is my document, oh my gosh, look at this, this is so, oops. Oh my gosh I closed the book, OK let me open up my sketchbook. So I would like for you guys to... Subscribe. - [Camera Woman] You spelled it wrong. - Did I really? - [Camera Woman] No. - Oh my gosh, there's no Spellcheck on writing. (gentle music) Alright, well that's that, I'm looking forward to checking this out a little bit more, I do wanna do a Fortnite test, of course, that's how I usually always test out everything is, will it handle Fortnite Okay? And I'm sure it will 'cause I played Overwatch on my last Studio, oh also, by the way, when you flip it around it's an eraser. I have not written in cursive, in so long, it feels weird. - [Camera Woman] Piz? Piz subscribe? - Oh it's a plz, like pliz - [Camera Woman] Piz! - Be nice to me. - [Camera Woman] (laughs) piz subscribe, piz be nice to me! - Well let me know what you guys think of this, I'm such a huge fan of all the Surface stuff, I really love the Studio line. If any of you guys have ever used this or if you have one, I would love to hear from you, leave me some comments below and let me know what you think and what should I try out next? - [Camera Woman] Piz subscribe. - Plz subscribe. OK bye. Look I'm so talented. Ow. (gentle music)",

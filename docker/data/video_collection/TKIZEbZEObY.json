    "transcript": "all right so a couple weeks ago we posted our review of the RTX 2080 and 2080 TI and a lot of you guys brought up the fact that some cards we used we're necessarily representative of what was available to buy basically we ended up showcasing the reference based cards and what they were able to accomplish against one another with the founders edition GTX 1080 ti squaring off against the RTX GPUs the tested methodologies were perfectly in line with the ones we've been doing for the past 15 years on both the Hardware Canucks website and here on YouTube now using a reference based GPU basically allows us to establish a baseline performance whereas using custom aftermarket GPUs and comparing them against the founders Edition or AMD's reference based cards usually stacks the deck against anything reference spec notice I said usually there guys well the problem is the RTX founders edition cards on running at Nvidia's baseline spec at all nor are they priced like regular cards either they're pre overclocked premium priced monsters that cost a ton of money meanwhile literally all of the gtx 1080 ti cards available are non-reference cards that have awesome heat sinks and come with higher clock speeds that means a lot of you guys were right in holding our feet to the fire about the cards we chose particularly when we compared the RTX 2080 founders edition I think more fitting comparison would have been using a custom cooled gtx 1080 ti and that's exactly what we decided to find out since we didn't have one at the time of making that video so we ended up grabbing an overclocked EVGA GTX 1080 TI superclocked Black Edition gaming for seven hundred and seventy dollars however by the time you're watching this video this card may be more or less expensive personally I think this card is an excellent representation of what invidious board partners still have available and it doesn't carry a huge premium over the gtx 1080 ti starting price of about $700 right away I threw out the possibility of using something like the Asus GTX 1080 ti Strix OC or Zotac's AMP Extreme Core Edition in this video since right now both of those actually cost more than the RTX 2080 founders Edition which right away makes them a pretty poor value so using them to compare value and other factors wouldn't have worked maybe a look into those a little bit later but for now I wanted to include a card like the super clocked Black Edition since it combines pricing with pre overclocked goodness it's time to play with light with fine things digital RGB star kit that includes two LED strips and all the appropriate cables the main hub is magnetic velcro tape is available with three digital channels for LED strips or halos Lux fan frames that display a ton of lighting effects and they're absolutely gorgeous check out the kit down below so let's start off with a little test one of the issues with the GTX 1080 ti founder's Edition is that it uses a blower style heatsink on the positive side this means a lot of the hot air is exhausted outside your case but at the same time downdraft coolers are typically more efficient so with Nvidia's boosts outdoor them allowing for higher overall clock speeds under cooler temperatures our initial gtx 1080 ti results could have been lowered due to increased core temps there's no mistaking that Nvidia's RTX 2080 founders Edition runs incredibly cool given the size of the heat output of the TA 104 core however take a look at the gtx 1080 ti founders Edition as it hits 84c which happens to be right near its thermal limit in stock form and that could lead to some throttling as the boosts algorithm tries to balance temperature fan noise and power input compare that to EVGA superclocked Black Edition and the difference is massive EVGA's cooler capped temperatures at an amazing 68 degree Celsius which should give plenty of clock speed Headroom but what actually happens when we look at frequencies well here you go remember in order to give you guys an accurate idea of how GPUs performed while you are gaming we put them under load for a few minutes before each benchmark so here you can see exactly why we do that both Nvidia and AMD cards can paddle after a little while and if we would jump from one benchmark to another leaving card to cool down between each run our results wouldn't show what you guys would actually experience in this case the gtx 1080 ti founders edition goes from a respectful 1820 megahertz in the first few minutes all the way down to about 16 80 megahertz around the four-minute mark due to invidious and boost algorithm trying to balance things out that's a pretty big delta when he compared to EVGA superclocked Black Edition which remained around 1900 megahertz throughout testing and that's pretty amazing so it looks like some of our initial results comparing the RTX 2080 and GTX 1080 ti were negatively influenced by the founders edition heat sink which caused lower frequencies but that doesn't mean that they were wrong since for the last 5 years or so our testing methodology has been specifically set up to show gaming conditions rather than an optimal environment that avoids throttling now that EVGA card results are really eye-opening though so let's see if those higher frequencies really allow it to close the gap with the RTX 2080 i'm gonna roll these benchmarks without any commentary until the end feel free to pause the video if you want to have a bit more time to check them out so there you have it guys and I have to say that I'm actually really impressed with these results the EVGA superclocked Black Edition really showcase some impressive performance across the board and that's likely due to its consistent clock speeds compared to the founders edition in some cases it was able to match or even slightly beat the RTX 2080 founders Edition and I think that that's pretty awesome for the price that you pay for this card but in the end how do these numbers average out across all these tests as you can see the RTX 2080 is still able to very narrowly beat the EVGA card when every game is taken into account but only by around four percent at 1440p basically the RTX is noticeably better in dx12 and Vulcan whereas pre overclocked GTX tends to perform extremely well in older api's moving on to 4k and this is where the 11 gigabyte gtx 1080 ti ends up winning all day once again the margin isn't huge but in some titles the RTX 2080's frame buffer can be a limitation like I said and launched a review that's a big worrying since the lasting is an $800 GPU shouldn't be choking itself out at new HD resolutions with this in our back pocket we can now look at the actual value as well at 1440p the RTX 2080 and EVGA GTX 1080 ti superclocked are pretty much tied from a value perspective but before you all keyboard warriors start typing hate in the comments there's something important here based on how good a reference gtx 1080 ti does if you can find it custom one for less than $750 it'll be an excellent value but that's getting harder and harder without going into the used market since the GTX series is selling out quickly moving up to 4k and the RTX 2080 gets its butt kicked from a value perspective due to its memory limitations the EVGA card is far out in the lead something else interesting is that due to its huge performance numbers in 4k games the RTX 2080 Ti has closed the gap a bit too despite its ridiculous $1,200 price tag that's something to take into account if you have the money to burn so with all these new numbers has our opinion changed about the RTX 2080 yes and no you see it's amazing to see what a custom GTX 1080 ti and make a difference especially with the results and honestly we should have included one from the very beginning since it would have given a more balanced perspective with those taken in the equation the founders Edition RTX 2080 becomes a lower value and a less step towards stepping up to a 4k display compared to a gtx 1080 ti then again I have to wonder how well something like these $750 EVGA RTX 2080 XC would do since it is $50 less than the founders Edition but has very similar frequencies that's another question for another video I guess since we've had the time to digest what the market is doing now our perspectives have changed a bit too folks are frustrated at in video since those starting at $699 RTX 2080's have failed to appear and honestly the more I look at it the $800 RTX 2080 could be a brilliant but underhanded mood to clear out stocks of their discontinued pascal cards if that was a plan it worked pretty well but in no way to the benefit gamers it's actually pretty hard to find a GTX series cards at reasonable prices or even at stock and I wouldn't be surprised if we start to see the $699 RTX 2080 magically appear once the gtx 1080 ti cards are flushed out speaking of 1080 ti's remember when I said if you find that card for less than $750 it would be a good deal well I actually found this ZOTAC an for under $700 which i think is an absolute steal at the time of making this video I'm not even sure if this card will be around by the time you're seeing this video but if it is I'll make sure to link it down below just be aware that these kinds of deals are getting rarer and rarer these days the new mark 2 coursers tray and k70 keyboards are fully loaded with custom illumination convenient media buttons USB pass-through extra set of key camps and ergonomic wrist rest for each keyboard so you can type or game comfortably with a variety of MX switches available so you can check out which keyboard suits you best in the description below coming back to RTX and I think the main problem with RTX cards is a lot of their price is based on nothing more than a promise of right tracing and AI that'll be a huge or I guess a big thing for Gaming at least that's what nvidia is trying to convince us so I'm going to repeat the exact same thing that I said foot since day one of this our text lunch and that is if you don't absolutely need a graphics card right now waiting to see how things will look in the next few months but with the EVGA gtx 1080 ti super clocked in the charts it's obvious that depending on the price a Pascal based GPU can be a phenomenal value just don't pay well more than 750 dollars for one because about that price point you're looking into an area of diminishing returns for your money amiibo 800 connects thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over

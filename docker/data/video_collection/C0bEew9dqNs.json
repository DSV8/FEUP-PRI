    "transcript": "When I arrived for my Snapdragon X briefing with Qualcomm, I did what I always do, and I plugged in my laptop. I was mortified. Eventually, they coaxed me back in with unfettered access to their army of partner devices, and with my favorite kind of sponsorship. The kind where I make a video that I would have made anyway, and my sales team gets to hit their quarterly target. I mean, seriously. All I have to do is go over their claims about battery life, AI capabilities and performance, and show you guys some of the sick hands-on demos. Who's laughing now, Colton? Woo! Woo! Without getting too far into the speeds and feeds that you can read off of the spec sheet, Snapdragon X is manufactured on TSMC's four nanometer process and comes in two flavors, plus or elite with 10 or 12 of Qualcomm's Orion CPU cores respectively. It can be equipped with up to 64 gigabytes of high speed LPDDR5X system memory and it goes toe to toe with the best laptop silicon on the market. All of which would be absolutely worthless if all it could do was run Bing Maps. Fortunately, that is not the case. Right now, before the first Snapdragon X even ships to an end user, they're showing off video editing, audio production. There are over 1200 games working, and okay guys, look, I hear you. These use cases, and even gaming, are not the most important thing to everyone, and none of the designs that Qualcomm is announcing would really fall under video production workstation or gaming laptop but when you compare to many other types of software these ones are really really hard and they're working but how though All right, let's talk compatibility if you've got a lightning-fast piece of silicon that doesn't run anything You might as well leave it on the beach But with the improvements that they have made Microsoft now expects the vast majority of your use time to be on native applications like chrome, teams, Zoom, blender and so much more you can find a curated list at qualcomm.com/windows apps, which is super cool, but as one of you so poetically put it in a recent comment, \"I spend over 90% of my time not on the toilet, but that last couple of percent is very important to me.\" Well, that's where Prism comes in. Emulation for x86 applications is built right into Windows. And while some applications that need special drivers, for example, might not function at this time, they are claiming that Prism is competitive with Rosetta 2. Meaning that most applications should run well enough, albeit at the cost of some processing overhead. I'm actually really looking forward to taking a much deeper look at this. Maybe something kind of like our ARK gaming live stream, where you guys can suggest stuff for us to try, at least once the editorial embargo lifts. Because I can't help but think processing overhead would be like, you know, kind of a bad thing on a mobile-first platform, right? Except if it isn't. Let's talk about battery life. Let me put it this way, I chose this HP Dragonfly Elite for my work machine because it is among the best endurance Windows laptops on the market at around 15 hours and HP rates this Snapdragon X Elite machine at 26. Oh and did I mention that the raw battery capacity of the Dragonfly is 15% higher? To say that these chips are efficient then would be an understatement of epic proportions. Qualcomm claims that they can match the performance of an Intel Core Ultra 7 while using 65% less power in single-threaded workloads or 60% less power in multi-threaded workloads. Not only do they claim they can outperform Intel Core Ultra 7 though, they even claim to beat Apple's M3 in multi-threaded workloads. Although of course, we're gonna have to verify those claims when the review embargo lifts next week. All of this efficiency is in no small part thanks to their high level of integration. Just like Qualcomm's mobile Snapdragon chips, the X Plus and the X Elite are systems on a chip, or SoCs, and include a DirectX 12 capable Adreno GPU that can handle up to three concurrent 4K external displays, like some other SoCs. There's a USB controller that can hit data rates of up to 20 gigabit per second, and so much more, some of which I think they should be talking about a lot more. One of my biggest pain points on laptops is their webcams. Even premium devices get absolutely embarrassed by basic smartphones. Fortunately, Qualcomm has been making the chips for those smartphones for many years, and they know a thing or two about making their cameras look really good. On almost every existing Windows laptop, the webcam has its own ISP, or image signal processor, that's connected to the system over USB 2, giving it a pitiful 480 megabit per second of bandwidth. On a Snapdragon X laptop, the ISP is built directly into the SoC die and it connects to the camera via a blistering 3.5 gigabit per second over an 18-bit MIPI connection. Not only is the data rate higher, but it also means near drop-in compatibility for much better phone image sensors and, well, let's just put it this way. I think the results here kind of speak for themselves. And... If that wasn't enough, what about second ISP? Okay, this one runs constantly and has some really cool party tricks, like the ability to automatically unlock and lock your system to enhance security, and an API that would allow app developers to build functionality like automatically turning off your camera in a video call if another face was detected, say for the privacy of your children. The other big integration is Qualcomm's cutting-edge NPU or neural processing unit. It's rated at 45 tops of performance, making it the first processor to meet the 40 tops minimum for Microsoft Copilot Plus, which in a nutshell means that you can do AI stuff directly on your device rather than relying entirely on the cloud, where speed, privacy, and cost remain outstanding questions. A lot of the stuff is just kind of fun. Co-creator in Paint allows you to draw an image, write a description, select a style, dial up or down the creativity, and it'll spit out an AI image. This is really cool. Also, have you ever been a DJ and needed to isolate a particular instrument in a song without access to the stems? Wait, that's really specific. Are we trying that? Okay. Huh. Drums? Huh. Alright, we'll add bass. Keyboards? I don't want drums. Okay, how about vocals? Hit that button. It also includes the ability to instantly translate and caption audio from the 40 supported languages, or control your device using gestures to help improve accessibility. Obvious winners all around. So far, one of Microsoft's biggest and most controversial pushes with the NPU is Recall. Which records everything that you've done in your computer and makes it searchable. So, let's say you looked at a picture of a cute dog a couple days ago, but you don't remember if it was in an email or if it was on Reddit. Well, Recall can bring up every time you looked at dogs recently. This does come with some concerns about privacy, but Microsoft says it'll be okay because everything is stored and processed on device with no need to send any of the data to the cloud. If that doesn't completely satisfy you, I 100% get you. And they do allow it to be disabled, both in specific apps or system-wide. Coming back to other non-Windows applications, they're using their NPU to power this pretty cool demo in DaVinci Resolve, where they can use their NPU to do things like color correct for a single person in a group, or in other applications like, for example, Luminar. They can CSI enhance and magnify at both high speeds and without thermal throttling. Now. In fairness, a lot of the other operations in these programs are still gonna want a dedicated GPU for the smoothest experience. So we had to ask, is, is that a possibility? Let me put it this way. Qualcomm got a little cagey when we asked about it, so instead we asked a different question. How many PCIe lanes are on the Snapdragon X Elite? And the answer is 16. Four of them are PCIe Gen 3, and are dedicated to Wi-Fi 7 at speeds of up to 5.8 gigabit per second, because, of course, Qualcomm would have their bases covered for wireless connectivity. Four of them are Gen 4 for high-speed NVMe storage, leaving eight Gen 4 lanes that are just chilling for... something? Like a GPU maybe? . Who knows? I also asked them about potential competition for the Steam Deck or the ROG Ally and again. No, they did actually say something. It wasn't just crickets. They said we've done Android gaming handhelds before with our partners, and then they just stopped talking. So it wouldn't surprise me to see an extremely efficient Windows gaming handheld down the line. But that's pure speculation. What isn't speculation is the pricing and availability of the devices they've announced here at Computex 2024. Not only are they boasting incredible performance and battery life, they're actually undercutting the pricing of equivalent x86 models. At launch, we are still looking at pretty premium devices here with starting prices of $999. But guys, these are available for pre-order now, they're going to be shipping in mid-June, and hey, these are the top-end chips and- I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, with brands like Plus and Elite, if maybe down the line something less Plus and less Elite were to come. Guys, these are very, very exciting times. Massive shout out Qualcomm Technologies for sponsoring this video, getting us hands-on with all these amazing devices, and if you guys are looking for something else to watch, what should I throw them to? How about the Surface RT unboxing from 12 years ago to show you just how far we've come?",

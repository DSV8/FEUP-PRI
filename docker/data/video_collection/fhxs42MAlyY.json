    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we are checking out the brand new Sony vlogging camera, this is the ZV-1 Mark II. Now, this does look incredibly similar to their previous ZV-1, but it has some amazing upgrades, it now has an even wider angle lens, it's an 18 to 50, It has cinematic vlog settings, an AI microphone, touchscreen, USBC and a built-in ND filter, which is, I'm not gonna lie probably one of my favorite features out of everything. There's also a bunch of little other upgrades like closer focus, active mode, creative looks upgraded S&Q, self-timer, shot mark, step zoom and even connects with the Sony Creators app. Whew, there is so much packed inside of this little camera, it's pretty overwhelming. So first thing is this ND filter, which is built in and I'm so excited about this because I do a ton of filming outside. So as you can see this shot is very overexposed, it's super bright. Luckily we have a built-in ND filter so we can turn that on right now. And what's cool about this, is you don't actually have to turn the camera off and it's super easy because what you do have to do normally, this is the camera that we've been filming with outside and I have to actually screw this off if I don't want the ND filter and if I want it on, I have to screw it back on. But with this, it's just the press of a button. It's incredible. The new cinematic vlog setting will give you a wide aspect ratio and it'll automatically switch your settings to 24 frames a second and it lets you choose from various looks and modes. Cinematic vlog, 24 frames a second. We've got these black bars to make it just look even more theatrical. There's a bunch of different ones. So it's really fun to kind of play around find your look and see what you like the best. The face priority auto exposure is something that I absolutely love in these cameras. It keeps the brightness of your face consistent even in different types of lighting conditions. It's pretty well lit 'cause it's kind of overcast. But now when I walk into this dark parking garage and now the light is behind me, this will automatically adjust so that my face will stay lit and bright and it'll automatically expose everything. (upbeat music) Hello. - [Man] There's no filming in here. - It can be really bright in one second and then the next you step into shade. But with this, it's able to automatically adjust on the fly depending upon, what those lighting conditions are. Creative looks let you choose from these 10 different presets and there's eight different settings inside of those to change up the look of your videos very quickly and easily. There's also another option called My Image Style that lets you change the brightness color and look to whatever you want. I like this because it quickly will let you make some subtle adjustments if you need to. Now, this new microphone is something that they released in the ZV-E1 camera, and I already did review that camera so if you wanna check out that video, be sure to go watch it after you watch this one. But what makes this so powerful is how it uses AI to determine where it should be recording. If I'm out filming and I'm talking behind the camera it will automatically focus more on my voice, but if a person steps in front, it may start recording the audio from the front instead of the back. You can manually choose where it records if you want and that's super easy to switch right here in the settings. This windscreen is a nice little addition that helps block out unwanted sounds from the wind. I like to call this the wind wig. So go ahead, just try to change my mind by calling it anything else. It's not gonna happen. If you wanna add an external microphone there is a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and it has the multi interface shoe that works with various Sony microphones. Image stabilization is something that is always very important for me on these types of cameras. With active mode enabled, you'll be able to notice a pretty big difference in how stable the footage is. Also, if you wanna really dive in and get more stabilization you can use Sony's plugin that uses the metadata captured while you're filming to really get even more of a smoother shot. S&Q that stands for slow and quick. On the top here you have a dedicated button to choose from photo video or S&Q. I love using this for time lapses and getting quick slow motion B roll shots. Now for those pros who want more control on coloring you can shoot an S-Log3 and they even have proxy recording. No, I don't usually shoot with proxy, but this is great for those who do use proxy footage. This can actually save you a lot of time rather than having to create them in post later. This has the recording lamp light right here, and this red box around the frame is like this added extra bonus of like, hello, yes you are actually recording. I really wish that they had this on some of their ProModel cameras. And even if you think that you're a pro and you'll never forget to hit record there are definitely those times where I have forgot and you don't ever realize it until it's too late. Now, some settings that I really like in these cameras is the background defocus. This will quickly blur out your background and adjust the aperture for you, so you will have that beautiful, blurred outlook and all of that happens at the press of a button. This also has product showcase, which isn't a new feature but it is worth mentioning because it works so freaking well. So I have product showcase turn on and we're gonna try out these little almond bites. So now you see me, now you see the Almond Bites. (chuckles) Did it focus on 'em? Almond Bite? Mmh. You just switched to this mode and whenever you hold something up in front of it it will quickly adjust to focus on that instead of your face. They also have this skin smoothing feature. Now, this has a low, medium and a high and you can also decide to turn this off. I like to keep it at the low, if not off because sometimes when you have it set to the high version I mean you begin to not even look like a person. Like it is almost too smooth and too perfect that you're like, something's up. Is it a filter? And you'll be like, hashtag no filter. And then we're like, no, yeah, there's a filter. So keeping it on the low end just like this works pretty well for me. And I think if you wanna use this feature the low setting, mmh, it's perfect. Now, I mostly use these cameras for video and I honestly completely forget that they actually take photos as well. This has a 20 megapixel sensor with super fast auto focused speed and it will actually let you shoot 24 frames a second of raw or jpeg up to about a thousand frames and be completely blackout free, which is pretty impressive in such a small little camera. Another thing that these are great for is using them as a webcam or a live streaming device. It will only let you output up to 720, but honestly for most calls or streams, it's gonna look pretty great. So my friends, that's a first look at the new ZV-1 Mark II camera. I will put a link in the description if you wanna get more information maybe. Maybe I'll make you guys a special little ZV-1 Mark II vlog. They're naming conventions on their cameras like I just won't even go into it. (chuckles)",

    "description": "I made a Supreme build in the LOUQE GHOST S1 - an awesome ITX case funded through Kickstarter and manufactured by a passionate team from Sweden. Keyboard -  Mouse -  Case -   The LOUQE GHOST S1 is an adaptable PC case designed to be compact, clean, and extremely efficient. One of quietest mini PCs you can buy with great cooling performance. The case can be expanded with TopHats to fit even more components into the case. If you enjoy modding PC cases then this might just be the computer for you!

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it gone Dave 2D here and in front of me is a very small computer case It's one of the smallest cases you can get out there that can hold a full-size graphics card And if you'll notice in the front of it It's got supreme on it's a supreme Themed computer case now if you don't know what supreme is there a New York based skate brand they have this iconic look to their stuff with this white font against a bright red background and their stuff can be crazy expensive I customized this case to match their branding, but to understand where this thing came from and why it's Exists I have to go into story time, but let's start with the very beginning This is a case that is called the ghost s1 it's made by a company called Loque and They're Swedish company and now they hit me up a couple months ago on ok we have this really small case you like small cases You want to check it out, and I was like yeah Send it over when it's ready, and the thing is I receive a lot of cases small ITX cases the majority of them Just aren't impressive to me They're kind of like rehashes of one another but this one is really cool, and I actually think it's one of the best No, I'm just gonna say It's my favorite ITX case that I've ever used so this is why not only is this in a small case it's a modular case so the base like this little small box here can hold an ITEX on the board and SFX power supply and a full sized GPU but the case also has these modular pieces available that they call top hats and these basically Allow you to extend the height of the case vertically so by itself I'm just running mine without a top hat it'll hold everything that you need for just like basic air cooling But if you want to have bigger fans Or if you want to do something a little more advanced like water cooling or if your system requires water cooling they have different sized top hats available and because these components are modular you can run these top hats on the bottom or Underneath if you want to put your water cooling or your fans on the bottom of the case now for me personally I like to keep my builds as small as possible, so I'm running this without any top hats And I'm getting temperatures that are actually very similar to my old case the end case m1 so all the component that were inside here It's running an 8 core Rison 7 600 watt power Supply GTX 1080 32 gigs of ram and an nvme and everything was just straight-up Transplanted into this case now this thing is running a knock to a cooler at the L 965 and that can comfortably handle stock speeds, I just tend not to overclock my smaller bills But the crazy thing is that even with this smaller case I'm getting the same temperatures as the N case m1 which is like 40 or 50 percent bigger than this case so the airflow on this thing is obviously very good But it's not just that they've whole case design the way they give you cut out so you can run your cables and stuff It's just a really well-designed case now another thing I really liked about this thing is how easy it was to build into it so the top lid pops off It's magnetically attached and the side panels pop off really easily. It's surprisingly easy to build into this case despite It being so small just because of how well the whole thing has been designed now the last thing I love about the same is the build quality so small ITF cases like those boutique ITX cases they tend to be expensive and they tend to be really well built That's just the nature of the whole like boutique ITX case but the ghost s1 has Noticeably thicker panels than the N case m1 and the end case m1 was already a really well-built case is actually one of my favorite cases before this one came out But this one is just that much better now as for the reason why it's red and how this came to be so this is the story I Built into this case and have really liked it like I liked it so much that I was thinking I should use this case as My main rig so I thought hey why don't I make a custom Dave 2d case? And I was just gonna paint it blue, and I had these decals ready to put them up front But I go to Home Depot, and you wouldn't believe it They had every single color possible in the spray paint section Except for the one color that is most similar to my logo color which is like they call it seaside I think so I called up other Home Depot's and no one seemed to have the color in stock which is super annoying But then I thought what can I do with this? Array of colors to choose from and I just went with the red because it's something that doesn't go on my channel But I thought I would make something that just was a little bit different, and then the idea pops into my head Why don't I just make a supreme themed computer because I don't think it's been done before. I don't think someone's built a Supreme computer like at least not a little tiny one like this so I kind of thought it through and just went with it So this is what we have a supreme themed computer now this case is I? Really like it. This is not an endorsement pay me to say this This is literally my favorite ideas case that I've built in I think for a lot of people that enjoy ITX cases They're gonna like the now There's a couple things that need to be tweaked still like this is a Kickstarter project That is fully funded at this point I think today is when the Kickstarter ended so it's unfortunate that I'm telling you guys about this thing after The Kickstarter is over, but you can still purchase this thing through regular retail channels I'll put all the links for that stuff below, but the one thing that I would say is Really interesting is that during the Kickstarter process? they had a bunch of prototypes that they sent out to people and I found that the few things that I Had issues with like the power supply that I used didn't fit exactly into the framing is off by 0.5 millimeters or so so I email them and they're like hey we ready to know about this issue we're gonna fix it in the retail version so they have this list of tweaks and adjustments that they want to do to the retail version that my Pre-production and your new example didn't have but even in this kind of early form I really enjoyed this case little details like the pull tab on the top panel give it a more premium feel and Even the light up front is really subtle and elegant. It's not like this obnoxiously bright RGB LED or sound like that It's just a really elegant case. I think a lot of people like it now obviously this isn't for everyone It's an expensive case and then this thing goes for like 250 u.s.. But if you're in the market for a nice looking case this thing looks good now I have this thing actually set up at my office I have it set up with a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse and everyone knows this mouse It's the MX master 2s, but this keyboard is a new pickup It's made by a company called Revo or Dremel and actually got it as a Christmas gift, and it looks awesome It's like a wireless or wired keyboard whatever you want, and it's got RGB backlighting mechanical keys 60 bucks Can't go wrong with that. Okay that basically wraps it up I'll put all the information for the keyboard the mouse and obviously all the stuff. That's in here down below Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs. You liked it subs. We loved it. See you guys next time",

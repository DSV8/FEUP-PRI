    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] Pointer stick action. OK, what the f**k? What is with all these steps? I'm so confused, why isn't it going to the program I told it to go to? (beeping) (typing) (upbeat music) - Hey guys, how you all doing? Really? That's just great. You know what, I'm doing pretty great today too because I went through a lot of your guys' suggestions and a lot of people suggested that I try out CloudReady. So, thank you very much fellow techies, that is exactly what I'm gonna do today, yes. So, as you may know, I have these Lenovo machines. I installed Zorn on this one, if you wanna check out that episode, you can right there. And also in another episode I did an installation, well not an installation, more of a power wash, an exploration of the first Chromebook I ever used on this show, so you can check that out as well. So, I basically thought, well, let's revisit some of the Chrome experience but with these Notebooks. So I have a couple of these Notebooks that I obtained from a school that was just getting rid of a bunch of them. I thought, well I know some people that could use a computer so I figured I would donate some of them. But I wanted to get software on here. I didn't want to put Windows back on here, because I didn't buy the computer. So I wanted to use something free, hence why there's Linux on here. But, multiple people suggested CloudReady so that's what I'll be doing now. And maybe in the future I'll give away one of these machines to the lovely audience, so stick around for that. So, let's get CloudReady here. Let's do for personal home use. Yes, we don't need the education version because education is destroying America. Let's see, ready to turn your computer into a Chrome device? Yes, that's basically what we're doing. We're gonna be turning this into a quote unquote Chromebook with CloudReady. And I think that'll make it easy for any user that doesn't need to do anything super intense with their computer. 64 bit There it goes, and let's get that on a flash drive. And then we're gonna just basically erase this hard drive. 'Cause Zorn is pretty good, but yah, I like everyone else's suggestions of just making it a CloudReady machine. All right, download complete right there on the desktop. Got my old flash drive, we're just gonna stick that right into there. (groans) (laughter) - What? Why is that? Did I do something with this? I know I used it in the Zorin video. Huh, apparently there's not even a partition on here. I'd have to back track, does anyone possibly know what I did? (laughter) - Like did I erase it in a past episode or something? I don't remember doing that. Ah, whatever. Oh a dark spirit just crossed in front of the light, I think the curse is watching me. Curse you better stay out of here, this should be easy. That was spooky, ghost or something, wow. Yah, erase. And just in case anyone is curious, no I don't have the dark mode on because no I do not have macOS Mojave yet, because well, because of what happened with the High Sierra issues earlier, so I haven't updated yet. I don't really trust dot zero releases anymore. But do stick around because I will update eventually, and I will do an installation sensation. So stick around. Okay, I obviously didn't read the instructions because now we have a bin zip thing. OK let's see, download the appropriate CloudReady image below, oh wait hang on, if using a Mac click here for instructions on how to proceed after downloading the image. OK, what the f**k? What is with all these steps? OK, I guess I can't just burn an image to the flash drive. What the f**k is this? OK, hang on a second. Well, this is just fascinating. Due to a bug in Mac OS, the CloudReady file must be unzipped using the Unarchiver software, which I used to have but I don't have anymore. OK, so, I guess now I have three options to open this. I can go to StuffIt, Unarchiver, or Archive Utility. So, let's use the Unarchiver, 'cause apparently Wait now it went to Archive Utility. What the f**k, dude? I swear I clicked the Unarchiver. Check the tapes. See I did, and it just goes to the I'm so confused, why isn't it going to the program I told it to go to, oh boy, we're gonna be here for a bit. 'Cause apparently I can't even open a freaking zip file. What the shit? Yah, it just gives me that binary file again. What the hell, dude? What is your dealio. This clearly does not wanna work. Let's try it. Locate the CloudReady file, yep I did that once the file is extracted oh, oh! So it is supposed to be the .bin extension. I'm sorry, when I hear the instructions say disc image, I'm looking for an image file, I don't think of a binary file. We gotta use Chrome for this. OK, well it's a good thing I have Chrome installed. OK, so apparently, first of all, the Unarchiver seems to be doing weird things, but the Archive Utility actually did make the bin file. So I don't know what bug it's talking about. It looks like it worked just fine with the regular Mac OS Archive Utility, so those instructions must be out of date. So, let's now add this to Chrome, because apparently we gotta do this through Chrome. 'Cause everything has to be done through Chrome. Go into Chrome. Add to Chrome. Yes, I'd like to add this. There it is, huzzuh. You need a four gigabyte or larger, blah, blah, blah. Perfecto. Enter the model number of the Chromebook to recover. What the hell? Hang on a second. Use local image, OK. Here's the bin file, which apparently was correct this whole time, I learned stuff. All right, select the media you'd like to use. Kingston, perfect, that just showed up immediately. Continue. Create a recovery image. All data and partitions blah, blah, blah, will be deleted. That's totally fine, there's nothing on there anyway. Oh, Authopen, yes my favorite. And don't remove your recovery media. OK, looks like it's going now. All right, that wasn't too bad. I am excited, the tension is thick. Yep, we're almost a fifth of the way there. So we got five minutes left, we can play a game. Let's play Simon Says. Simon says right-click on your desktop. Simon says create a new folder. Simon says name the new folder homework. Simon says delete the new folder. Simon says pat your head. Simon says rub your tummy while patting your head. Now clap your hands. Oh, Simon didn't say, how many lost? I bet a lot of you did, yah, well that was fun. Hey look, now we're almost a third of the way done, see? We killed time. Done, done. And it ejected it automatically for me. Now that is courtesy. OK, well thank you Mac. Your services are no longer required. We will now be moving onto the Lenovo. Flash drive, insertion, insertion complete. And now we boot it up. And I believe we just spam the F12 button? (beep) OK, entering the boot menu, sweet. OK, so we have the internal disc, and we have our Kensington here, not Kensington, excuse me, our Kingston. We're goin' travelin'. Let's load that up, and hope it works. I like it. (bell rings) Oh, CloudReady, this kinda reminds me of an old operating system concept I had called Stratus OS. I did a video on it, like, maybe in 2008. Wow, we may have to show that on a Computer Clan time machine broadcast 'cause that is a real blast of the past. That'll be a nice nostalgia trip. Oh we got confetti there for a second. It was like, hey celebration, you installed something. Welcome, ya so far it does look pretty Chrome-like. Connect to network, yes we will use this. OK, anonymous data collection, I'm gonna say no. It's probably still gonna do it anyway, but I'm gonna say no 'cause at least that helps me feel better. Oh I'm getting dj vu to that Chromebook episode now. Sign in, ah shnikes. All right, get started, funtastic. I just got the security alert from Google on my email. Ya, it did not bring me to an installer. It, like, made me sign in to my Google account. Something is real bull-shitty. I do wanna just kinda play with this for a bit though. The animations look smooth. This looks like it's way smoother than Zorn. Yah, that's nice. Yah, I think this is gonna be a better option. So thank you to everyone who suggested this. But ya, I'm a little cornfused. So I'm going to find out what the hell happened. Oh, install CloudReady. It was just hidden in this little menu here. OK, well, whatever. Erase hard drive and install CloudReady. Sounds exciting, goodbye Zorn. You're great but looks like this is going to perform better. Plus I think it'll be easier to use for the potential people that will have these computers. Because pretty much everybody knows Google. And they know how to browse the web, and this is simple enough for that. OK, something said, \"Whoa there\" and I didn't read it. Um, it went away. Oh, notification. Whoa there, be careful. In the future, be sure to eject your removable. Oh I didn't unplug it, it's still it's still plugged in. Yah, something must have triggered that warning because it wasn't me. All right, so installation in progress. Don't turn off the machine. Install should take no longer than 20 minutes. Wow, that's at least 15 minutes. So again, when I use this computer sometimes, I flash back in my head to that Zorn video that I did. And one thing that's interesting is, you know I'm grateful that a lot of people watched it, but out of the approximately hundred thousand people that watched it, no one commented about the little, I guess you could say sight gag Easter egg I put in there. I wonder if anyone will ever find it. Oh well, maybe that's something that'll just be lost with time. The machine will automatically shut down after installing. Cool, all right, well we'll come back to this in a bit. Let's grab a brewski. And it looks like it's done. It did say it would automatically shut down, so I'm assuming it worked. I'm gonna remove the good old flash drive, pen drive, jump drive, whatever the heck you wanna call it, and boot her back up. ThinkPad, by Lenovo, a fragrance by Lenovo. Sweet, CloudReady, good start. And if this all works I'll fiddle around with it a little bit and then I'll just sign myself out, because, I mean I'm not gonna be using it, some other potential person will be using it. (laughter) Checking for updates, that's pretty fun. I'm just gonna browse as guest, I guess I could do that. See what that does. I'm probably not gonna have a lot of functionality in guest mode, but I basically wanna just make sure it works. Let's use the pointer stick, nice and smooth. Oh yah, pointer stick action. Whoa, is that a snap feature? Oh, did I try that out before? I don't remember that being there. There's like a snap feature, that's cool. There we go, that looks good. I guess the space bar isn't scrolling, let's try clicking in here. All right, still doesn't scroll, whatever. I will just use two fingers then. So yah, that works, oh hang on. Yah wait, oh inertial scrolling. Yah, nice and smooth. That's smooth, cool, let's test something out. Something that a lot of people would probably do with a Chromebook, they would watch a YouTube video. Maybe Vintage Apple Vault, what episode should we watch? The G4 Cube episode? I agree. There we go, I mean that loaded immediately. (soft music) - If you're using to help me out, Steve Jobs admired many things about design. - [Krazy Ken] Well, looks good. It's performing, sweet I think this will be a perfect fit for whoever needs to use it. Now I'm noticing this is an older version of Chrome 'cause the new version, well this is technically Chromium, so Chromium probably doesn't have those new tabs and stuff that a new Chrome has, I'm sure that will be updated soon. And yes, a Virtual Box, I've noticed is included in here. So that's pretty cool, so whoever gets it if they want to put, I don't know, like MS DOS on here, I guess they could. Well, pretty sweet, this was smooth. All right, so let's exit guest here, and while it does its thing I just wanna, again, thank the awesome techies that not only watch the show but suggested I do CloudReady. I really appreciate it. And keep the ideas coming, if you have other ideas for stuff you want me to experiment with on these Lenovos just let me know, 'cause I got a bunch of them laying around. And I know some people wanted me to do some other Windows betas and I did promise I would do that. If you have a hardware recommendation for what I am physically able to, like what I can and should install that stuff on, let me know. Because I definitely wanna do some Windows beta stuff on this show, but I wanna use some decent hardware that would actually run it. You know, compatibility and everything. So, if you have any ideas, do send them my way. I love hearing what you guys think. Well, this was pretty easy. Suck it curse, it definitely was not here today. So, I'm gonna shut this bad boy down. White, all important movies, and on a white screen. We tackled this one, no problem. Catch the crazy, and pass it on. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "- This is not a sponsored video on the REDMAGIC 9S Pro. Because if you're like me, you've seen ads and ads and ads for this phone all over the place. Instead I said, no thank you sponsorship. And yes, I will instead give you $900, and buy one for myself. Because I'm incredibly curious. Is anyone really meant to buy a gaming phone in 2024? I mean, I get it. A few years ago, when like the first Razer Phone came out, there's a real sales pitch to buy a gaming phone, but fast forward to today, and any reasonable flagship is gonna have the exact same chip. It's gonna have vapor chamber cooling, a big battery. And the problem is that, typically gaming phones have major downsides. You're gonna have subpar cameras, poor software support, a huge chunky build. So today, let's take a look at this REDMAGIC 9S Pro, which has taken over my subscription feed, to see is this actually worth it. Now, while I did pay $900 for this phone, I will say that you can get it cheaper if you buy it directly from the REDMAGIC site. So I bought on Amazon, and for some reason on Amazon, it is a $100 more expensive than it is on the REDMAGIC site. Okay. I'm so curious. I've seen so many ads of this thing, it looks kind of cool. This is Cyclone colorway and it supposedly has a transparent back. It does feel pretty nice. We've got a headphone jack on top. Oh my god, a headphone jack? All right. Wait a minute. I was about to like make fun of this thing for being all dumb and stuff, but actually, that's pretty good. Let me give you some of the sales pitch on why supposedly this makes sense. So one of the first things they claim is that it is cheaper than a traditional flagship phone, and that is true. So this is the $800 version on the REDMAGIC site. You can get a $650 version, which just has less RAM and less storage. It also has active cooling. So if you look on the side here, you'll see a little vent. So apparently there's a very tiny 22,000 RPM fan that will help to cool off the device. In fact, you actually can see it slightly on the inside of this side. Oh, actually no, I think, wait. Oh, I thought that was a camera. That's actually the fan itself. Oh. That's actually kind of a cool design. So you actually can see two cameras, and you got the the fan, which spins. Well, the other pitch is battery life. So this has a quite enormous 6500mAh battery. I will say that's just cool. That's just a significantly bigger battery than pretty much any regular flagship out there. I am completely unsure of what to think about this. So we do have a case in the box as well as well, the REDMAGIC girl. She looks like she's gonna mess you up. And a power brick. A power brick in a phone? What? Sit down. It's 2017 all over again. Have you heard about the latest REDMAGIC phone? - Oh my gosh. That actually looks kind of sick. (laughs) Hit the fan button. (chuckles) Fan lights up. (laughs) - That is crazy. So there's a feature that I've not tried yet. I was waiting for you. - Okay. - Give me a hand with it. - All right. - Okay, so hit Super Base. - Okay. - And then press on Mora. - Oh god, I already know where this is going. - I don't know what this is, but it wants me to choose my identity for Mora. - Oh my gosh. Okay. - I mean normally you go on the Play Store, and seek this out, but this just comes with your... - Hello. - Hi. (laughs) Okay. - Oh no. No. - Oh, you got different skins. - Here's the thumbnail one. Okay, all right. (laughs) All right, that's enough. That's enough of that. All right. Have fun with your REDMAGIC. I will grab this phone when you are done with it. - For obvious reasons. - For very obvious reasons. - [Mora] Earthquake. Hurry up, Commander. So I've been using the REDMAGIC for a little bit and I've got a lot of thoughts. But first and foremost, let's actually play some games because that's really what this is designed for, not games with Mora. Sorry, Mora, - [Mora] That's not allowed. - Okay, anyway. One of the advantages of a gaming phone specifically with this REDMAGIC is that it does have the triggers on the top, which is nice because you don't always need a controller. I'm gonna jump into COD Mobile, which is one of I think the better games to demonstrate how this works. Now the way these triggers work, you just have to swipe in from the side, and you can enable it via the gaming mode. And what happens is, they essentially will tap buttons on the screen for you. So it really just emulates if you just like touch the bottom left or bottom right, you can kind of adjust it. The advantage there is that, certainly for like games that have like shooting involved, it's a lot easier because you don't have to move your thumbs as much. You can actually use it a little bit like a regular controller. So you can see here with the triggers, if I tap left, it's going down to my sight, and if I tap right, I can shoot. The experience is good I will certainly say. The fluidity of running this on like high settings and like you know, 120 FPS or more. Like, this is good, this feels nice. If I can say some positive things about this first, this is a gaming phone, and it does feel good as a gaming phone. You know, like yes, it's a little bit on the bigger chunkier side when it's in your pocket, but when you hold it in your hands, it feels nice. That fan is spinning, and there's certainly airflow that goes through, but it's not loud. I've got on the auto mode, you can manually set it to like turbo mode, but to me, even when the fans crank at 100%, it's not that loud. For normal gaming, this is solid. But outside of the triggers, I'll say that this experience isn't really that different than something like using a Galaxy S24 where you really see the advantage of a gaming smartphone is in the benchmarks. So I'm going to start a stress test on both phones, and we'll talk a little bit about the performance that you're gonna get. So for context, when you look at the marketing for the REDMAGIC, it is very clear that they want this to be the most powerful gaming phone you can buy. And if you look at the benchmarks, you actually will see that that is largely true. So we've run this REDMAGIC against few other phones, mostly the S24 Ultra, but also like the iPhone 15 Pro, and the OnePlus 12. And this does score higher than any of those other phones, generally speaking. Let me remind you my friends, this is not a sponsored video. I bought this REDMAGIC with my own money, and therefore I have the freedom to tell you that these numbers are, I'll be generous and say, a little bit misleading. So with our S24 strapped to the REDMAGIC Cooler 5 Pro, what you're gonna see here is that an external cooler will get you almost the exact same score. So one of the things I will say, is that they allow, like when the REDMAGIC is really cranking, yes it has a fan. Yes, that is able to keep the processor cool, but the frame of the phone gets incredibly hot to the point where when you're running this benchmark for like 10 minutes, it's like hotter than I want to touch. Like it is incredibly, incredibly warm, and that's like the whole frame of the phone in the back. Like it just, it feels like REDMAGIC don't care about the skin temperatures. They don't care about you being able to touch it. They just let that thing run. Whereas with the S24 Ultra, I'm running it with a cooler right now, but even without the cooler, it never gets that hot. They just throttle the performance back before it gets uncomfortable. Then you might think that with a 65 00mAh battery, that you would get great battery life with the REDMAGIC. And that's largely true, except when you really tax it. So if you are running something like this, which is the 3DMark Steel Nomad stress test, it is a 20 minute full 100% load on the phone. The S24 in that 20 minutes burns 11% of its battery, but the REDMAGIC burns 18% and keep in mind, that's 18% of a much larger battery to begin with. It's really clear that to get that, you know, 10, 11, 12, 13% extra performance when it comes to 3DMark, they're throwing a lot more power at between the LEDs, the fan, and just cranking voltage through that Snapdragon. Now, I wanna put a little caveat on all of this. We're talking benchmarks right now. No game pushes these phones this hard. They just don't, right? I mean, this is an incredibly graphically demanding game. You're getting like 12 FPS like the phones are absolutely doing everything they can, but I do think it's just worth considering that to get that absolute max performance out of the REDMAGIC, there is some major downsides. You might see the number and go, \"Oh, it's 30% faster in Antutu.\" But like sure, and it also gonna burn your hands, and your battery's gonna drain faster than an S24 Ultra. So is that worth it? When you look at the REDMAGIC as a gaming phone, there's a lot to break down. First up, we've gotta talk about that display because honestly it is pretty solid. We're looking at a 6.8 inch OLED panel that's bright. Get up to 1,600 nits, and has pretty minimal bezels, especially for a gaming phone. Now, it might only have a 120 hertz refresh rate, which sure you could easily point out that the ROG Phone 8, has a 165 hertz display. Here's the thing, in real world usage, that difference is pretty much non-existent. Now I will say that the LEDs that are in the triggers are kind of neat, but it's like cool for like five minutes. I just don't want to draw any unnecessary attention to my waifu gaming phone. (laughs and giggles) - Captain. Stop, stop. - I surrendered. - I surrendered. You have some hand sanitizer? I don't know the last time I cringed this hard in a video, it was, but it was at least a few weeks ago. It's been maybe even a month or two. - [Mora] Was that an earthquake? Ooh. It was just a Captain's prank. - Moving on. Where was I? Performance, benchmarks, numbers. Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Other things I'm maybe not like a huge fan of, I don't like the power button mostly because it's really tiny, and it's tucked right above the gaming slider, which takes some getting used to. More often than not, I find myself when I'm trying to unlock the phone, finding the slider and then moving my finger up, like it just feels a little bit unnecessary. Now on the audio front, it is nice to find a headphone jack. It's a very pleasant surprise in 2024. That being said, I would've liked to also see a second USB-C port, like the ROG Phone, but that's not too bad. The main thing is, well, it does have quite good speakers so they get plenty loud. There's a good amount of separation and clarity. But the problem is that because the grills are so small, and the kind of oddly shaped, I find myself that most time when I'm gaming, my fingers are covering one or both of the speakers, which just feels like a little bit of an oversight. Performance wise, the REDMAGIC 9S Pro is definitely packing some serious hardware with the slightly overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 inside paired with 16 gigabytes of RAM in my model. Although the base model does have only 12 gigs of RAM, but boy does it feel like REDMAGIC are really pushing this chip to its limits. It's like they looked at the idea of the you know, you look in the dictionary for like thermal throttling and safeguards and go, \"Nah, nah, nah, we don't need any of that.\" Now, to be fair, I don't wanna oversell the battery as being bad or anything like that. If you are a little bit more conservative with your settings, and not just doing benchmarks all the time, you can easily get a full day of use with some moderate gaming, and when you do need to charge up the 80 watt charging is legit. Still though, I just can't help shake the feeling that REDMAGIC are playing a little fast, and loose with power management. It's great for benchmark numbers, and mostly avoiding throttling. It does a good job, but you just, it's hot, man. It just feels like they're cranking this chip beyond it's sort of ideal window. Now let's talk about the real elephant in the room, the software. It's, what's the word? Not great. It's ah, okay. Here's the thing. Like I don't want to unfairly point out some of the smaller things that don't matter, right? Like of course there are some rough edges, and things like typos that are pretty much everywhere, including one that I could not forgive, screenshot it so you can see it. They couldn't decide on how to capitalize their own REDMAGIC branding. Like there's like one line, it's like a lowercase M, and then just... Imagine Samsung just spelling randomly in one of their settings. Sam, space, sung. I would return it on the spot, but the real kicker is the update situation. According to REDMAGIC t hemselves, and I quote, \"We do regular updates every one to two months for two plus years with at least one Android OS update. Let me reiterate. They promised a minimum of one major update in 2024, when Samsung are out here promising seven years of not just updates, but full Android OS updates for the S24 lineup. To me, this is unacceptable. Full stop. It's like REDMAGIC, they're stuck in 2015 while the rest of the industry has moved on. Now, I guess you could argue that hardcore gamers don't care about updates, but like we're talking about like security patches, bug fixes, new features. I mean, even if they do give you the full two plus years that they may be able to reach, and that's not for full updates. Just like for like software updates for like the small things like security, this stuff matters when you want to use it as a daily driver. I mean, you're spending a lot of money on this phone. I want it to actually get updates in a timely fashion for more than a year or two. That's just, that's not okay. You also won't be surprised to learn that the cameras are passable, I guess? It's just clear that they've cut corners for budget's sake here. Now, while the main shooter isn't terrible, it is a clear step down from what you would expect with a proper flagship such as the S24. What's weird is that they've chosen to go with an under display front facing camera, which as I'm sure you can see is not great. Especially we have like lights around very like smeary and halo-y, and for the gaming phone, I get that you don't wanna have like big bezels and whatnot, but it just feels like a strange choice because who doesn't want to use the front facing camera on their phone? Like I feel that's like a very normal thing. For context, this is what the front facing camera looks like on the S24 Ultra. Like it is night and day better. Like there's a lot of problems I've got with the REDMAGIC, as I'm sure you're hearing, but the cameras are certainly one of the bigger sacrifices. Look how much better this looks. All of this brings me to my biggest issue with the entire honestly concept of gaming phones in 2024. It's not 2017 anymore, my friends. We have the excellent dedicated handheld PCs that aren't limited to just playing mobile games, and Mora. There's the Steam Deck, the ROG Ally, the Legion Go. These are all getting better and more affordable all the time. The idea of your phone being the everything device, it's tempting, like I get it, but at what cost? The REDMAGIC 9S Pro, and really gaming phones in general, they feel like a solution to me that it's a problem that doesn't really exist anymore. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a capable device, but in a world where our normal phones are getting more powerful by the day, are great for gaming, do so many other things, and if you care about gaming that much, dedicated handhelds are more accessible than ever. It just feels so difficult to justify these compromises. If you really care about mobile gaming, personally, I just think you're better off buying a more well-rounded flagship that is good at everything, and then buy a clip on cooler, a controller or a battery bank from time to time. Or well, I don't know. Here's a radical idea. Grab yourself a Nokia 3310, buy a Steam Deck and go out, and live your best life. Because I think it's hilarious. I think the idea of a digital nomad going out into the wilderness with a Nokia 3310 and a Steam Deck, leaving the trappings of modern society behind sounds like a great idea. Don't see a video next week, that's where I went. (upbeat instrumental music)",

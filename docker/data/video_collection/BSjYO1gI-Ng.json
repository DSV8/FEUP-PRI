    "transcript": "what's up guys I'm Dmitry with Hardware Canucks and my experience with the OnePlus 3 has been phenomenal and many would agree that this is one of the better value smartphones currently on the market but it is being replaced with oneplus 3t with better specs and a higher price point now the original oneplus 3 is approaching its end of life status and that means it will no longer be sold as a stock runs out so which of these two should you pick up now find out after this introducing the new OC CVX 500 s all state drives from Toshiba it offers great well-balanced speeds build with mlc nand flash for superior endurance and is also backed by five year advanced warranty program learn more about the VX 500 at OCC com now so interestingly the 3t is only sold in the new gunmetal color with a soft gold option coming later the slightly darker tone is subtle but it's clear that oneplus is moving away from the staple silver color to have some stronger device recognition I think the move to upgrade the internals to a Snapdragon 820 one grown the battery capacity to 13% bump up the storage option to 128 gigabytes and also improve the selfie camera to 16 megapixels versus eight on oneplus 3 and all of these kind of place the 3t ahead of the specs game without modifying the thickness or the physical characteristics of the device and you know what the $40 difference between the 64 and 128 gigabytes is very reasonable and good news it seems that they've updated NAND flash on the 3t scoring significantly higher than the oneplus 3 and the 3t also scores better than my galaxy s7 this means boot up times on the 3t is about 12 seconds faster compared to the oneplus 3 updating applications doesn't take as long but aside from that there are no other significant differences in everyday use because of this storage the six gigabytes of RAM is kind of a big deal the smartphone has more memory than 37% of the playerbase on Steam during the month of November but does that actually make a difference for multitasking and yes it does you have 14 applications running in the background which allows you to return to any of those applications without the need to load them again the entire speed and smoothness equation is really on point no complaints with operation I love the capacitive fingerprint sensor that gets me into my phone much faster than having to physically press the button on my s7 that now appears quite heavy physically nothing's changed I think that's for the better I don't mind the 1080p resolution and AMOLED blacks are fantastic out of the box white balance was kinda on a cold side but that can be adjusted plus an sRGB mode is available but with that mode things look a little bit dull without the vibrancy you'd expect from smartphone the camera bump is still here that is very well hidden with a cover of which there are plenty and helped tremendously with holding the slippery device now sure you are covering the beautiful aluminum but you know you could go with the darker woods that look awesome or the plain sandpaper which is my favorite it's great to hold plus a reminder of something unique to oneplus the alert slider is amazing we did not disturb in silent modes that you can easily customize I use this most often when going to bed instead of scheduling they do not disturb time or muting it when I'm in the meeting and more Android phones need to have this slider all buttons feel satisfying aside from learning not to lock your phone while adjusting the volume because their opposite of each other and that's the only crappy thing about the handling the applied screen protector on the 3t is wider and thus not as annoying when sliding from the side and I mentioned this because on the oneplus 3 it is way too narrow and you can constantly feel it during use when sliding from either side the speakers at the bottom sitting beside the type-c connection with USB 2.0 speeds and the headphone jack I could not tell the difference in audio quality compared to the oneplus 3 but it is more powerful than the s7 with a slightly warmer sound signature as for actual phone elements no complaints with the call speaker but the vibration motor is terrible it is even weakened with the cover installed so basically I cannot feel it in my pants pocket while standing although a pretty loud bottomed speaker is there to compensate - charging is awesome but how fast is it with the larger battery I didn't test with the screen on full brightness on airplane mode we went from 1% to 98% in one hour and 17 minutes but you know I realized this scenario is kind of unrealistic so I redid the test charging with the screen off with Wi-Fi on and in 15 minutes we juiced up pretty well and that is awesome to see the main camera can't you draw I love that Snapseed app now supports raw editing and exporting final images are surprisingly fast but still I find the auto white balance to be inaccurate as for the front selfie cam toe they have doubled the megapixel count from the oneplus 3 but I find more selfies on the 3t to come out blurry plus the shutter delay is definitely more noticeable the front camera on the oneplus 3 is faster with better detail and most of the time despite having only half the megapixel count the software as expected is very clean we have lots of customization available although you still cannot have five columns of icons on your main screen which is such a shame for such a large display however they have improved some things like swiping from the top to access settings that don't need to expand fully unless you do that extra slide but they've removed the recently closed app drawer at the bottom a function that I found really helpful on the oneplus 3 also another thing I've noticed the scroll speed on the touchscreen I think is a little bit too sensitive especially coming from the s7 so for scrolling apps like Instagram or Twitter I keep missing the post and have to scroll back up you can't adjust to it but the overall touch interface just doesn't feel as good as on my s7 and so the biggest strengths on the oneplus 3T over the oneplus 3 is having faster NAND storage plus having that optional 128 gigabyte capacity bump the front selfie improvement camera didn't need to happen it is not worse but as an overall usage experience from the software and just like physical daily usage scenarios they feel practically identical as a percentage of the price increase you're looking at 13% for the base model but even still it remains competitive the 3t my eyes is worth it due to that faster land and the larger battery and so oneplus is clearly riding the wave with offering more expensive devices while maintaining their original position in that value segment so well done and that is it for the review of the oneplus 3t I love the device but my daily driver still is the galaxy s7 because of a more consistent primary camera and also just a smaller size it's just a little bit more comfortable as my daily driver versus something a little bit larger like the oneplus 3 I'm Dimitri with Hardware Canucks thanks so much for watching make sure to check out our original oneplus 3 review linked in the description below we'll see you in the next video",

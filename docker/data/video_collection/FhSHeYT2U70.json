    "transcript": "all healthy human eyes perceive and interpret motion as specific rate this motion however is not bound by a frame rate and it would be improper to describe the human eye as a sort of camera which can perceive motion in terms of 30 or 60 fps that's just not how our eyes work rather our eyes constantly perceive object motion as it happens which is why objects moving at very high velocities don't appear choppy what our brain does do however is incorporate a great deal of motion blur into the moving image motion blur is the effect that results from an object being in motion during the time at which a single exposure takes place but hold on gray you just use the word exposure exposure is a photography term so why are we using that word to describe our eyes if our eyes are not cameras it's a tricky subject to explain Michael Stevens from vsauce already explained some one of his videos I'll go ahead and let him take it from here very good question what frame rate do we see the world in with our eyeballs I mean how fast is information travel from our eye to our brain now here's what we do know the visual cortex in our brain usually holds that information from our retina for about a fifteenth of a second so if an animation moves at 15 frames a second or faster it's gonna look nice and fluid but if it's lower than 15 frames a second our brains not fooled by the beta movement and it'll look like it's skipping so basically the faster the frame rate the better everything's going to look in the end something definitely worth noting is the fact that continuous motion as displayed via the mediums of TVs and monitors at around 100 frames per second and above are typically more difficult to discern from one another than their lower frame rate counterparts another clear truth in this matter is the fact that as the frame rate of any video increases the ability for the human eye to distinguish individual frames diminishes drastically past around 100 Hertz and yes while the well trained eye can easily spot the difference between 120 144 Hertz it can more easily distinguish say 30 Hertz from 60 this indicates a law of diminishing returns when it comes to monitor frame rates and the rates at which chemical reactions take place within the occipital lobe of the human brain it's also easier to see singular non continuous abrupt changes in individual images let me show you what I mean by that there this black screen and make a mental note of what color you see when it pops up in the center got it now make a note of this color did you see both the colors you should have seen where red and green if you saw both congratulations your I was able to perceive individual images as they appeared for only one sixtieth of a second on a black screen so there we have finite proof that Hume and I can at least distinguish 60 individual frames per second right well let's try another experiment tell me what color you see now did you see it was the color yellow congratulations you were incorrect the colors you should have seen were again red and green in that order and each appeared again for only one sixtieth of one second so what's going on here did we just confirm that the human eye could distinguish individual frames that exist for only 17 milliseconds well yes but only under the condition that the frame change was abrupt and non continuous you see when you're playing a video game on a monitor with a refresh rate of 144 hurt and assuming a full 144 frames are being sent to the monitor per second you were actually seeing and perceiving a full 144 frames per second there is no denying that however when the change is between each individual frame our subtle for instance when your character is walking around in an open world or when you're panning over an entire city those individual frames are less easily perceived in the case of fast-moving high intensity scenarios as in the case of csgo those individual frames are crucial because viewpoints and character movements are constantly changing and fast paces it's why the individual flashes of both red and green were very easy to perceive but also why the quick transition from red to green resulted in a mix or blend of both colors resulting in the yellow this is indicative of those fast view changes quick pivots and sharp character movements in csgo and other first-person shooters in particular which is why higher refresh rates are generally more desirable in those kinds of games in the latter scenario both the shape and duration of each color shown was identical so the abrupt change resulted in a blend and thus a lower perceived framerate 30fps over 60 the United States Air Force also conducted a response time test on their pilots what they did was have their pilot stare at a blank screen and then momentarily flash an image of a plane on to the screen they found that some of their pilots could identify even the make and model of the plane shown even though it was only shown for one two hundred and twentieth of a second now while this test does the human eye can distinguish individual frames at rates much higher than sixty Hertz it does not indicate how many successful frames the pilots could see back-to-back so for example if the plane was shown moving across the screen entirely in one second at a frame rate of 220 frames per second the pilot wouldn't be able to perceive and translate every single frame it's simply too much information for the brain to process in fact the moving image of the plane would likely give the pilot a headache as Michael Stevens explains here's the thing if frame rates get higher and higher you wind up with an image that can actually cause headaches when people watch it on the screen so back to the point about our eyes tracking onto objects if I do this move my hand in front of my face and track it with my eyes I can see my hand it makes sense but a certain point my handle moves so fast that it's just a blur and the reason it's a blur is because my eye can only track so fast and when objects move faster than our eyeballs can track your brain adds in motion blur that way we get a sense of movement happening but we don't see something like a hand randomly appearing all over the place so it's literally too much visual information for our brains to transpose without incorporating motion blur which is our brains way of relieving visual stress racing games in particular are notorious for incorporating artificial motion blur for this very reason when enjoying a racing game it's a 100 frames per second the car the center of your screen your car remains rather stationary with the exception of a few turns slides and hills everything else however it moves a very very fast pace especially near the edges of your screen if these moving images were shown without motion blur you'd likely develop an intense headache with time especially if you're not used to such quick movements this would occur because you're forcing your brain to convert 100 stills essentially into a conscious moving picture whereas in the real world your brain would most certainly resort to motion blur to alleviate the potential stress involved with the visual translation all in this video with one final trivial notion we've already concluded that the human eye is not a camera and therefore cannot be measured in terms of frame rates or even pixels however the next time you're riding shotgun with a buddy on a highway have a glance at a passing cars rims individual spokes rotating hundreds of times per second eventually become all jumbled up by our brain resulting in the illusion of no we'll spend whatsoever it's difficult to see at times and the car in question has to be moving at certain speed but when the conditions are right it will appear as though the car is simply gliding over the road without his tires rotating at all we can limit this exact phenomena via a camera by tiny exposure specifically to when the next spoke of each rim or the next blade of each rotor moves into the same position that the previous spoke or blade was the frame before so if camera see it this way and the human eye sees it this way can we still say that the humanized perception of reality is entirely separate from that of a cameras food for thought what is real how do you define real if you're talking about what you can feel but you can smell you can taste and see then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain so the next time you find yourself shopping for computer monitor ask yourself a following question what kind of games will I play if your number one answer was first-person shooters off for the monitor with the highest refresh rate possible and sure to pair it with a graphics card that's beefy enough to output that many frames per second if that's a little confusing check out the card above me other than that be sure to give the video a thumbs up if you like content give the thumbs down if you hate everything about life click the subscribe if you haven't already stay tuned for more tech related content here on the channel this is science studio thanks for learning

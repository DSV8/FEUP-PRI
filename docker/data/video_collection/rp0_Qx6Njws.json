    "transcript": "Aye, ye never had a body for fighting! What a frail little man. He did have heart though! More heart than brains he had. [laughs] What's up guys, Lew back here with another video. and today, this looks like a classic Nintendo controller, well in many ways it kinda is but there's no Nintendo logo on this box right here. No! Because this product here is from a company called 8-bit-do 8Bitdo? Nintendo, 8Bitdo.. It's, I don't Essentially we've got here is a replica of a classic NES controller which is now Bluetooth, can be used with iOS, MacOS, Android, Windows and so on. You can use it as a regular Bluetooth controller for whatever game you're playing or, boot up some emulators and play the classics with a classic style of input. You've got a built in battery, completely wireless and another cool thing, it...it appears to have something called the Xtander Little stand-type situation for your touchscreen device. If you wanna use it in conjuction with this Let's crack it open! The 8Bitdo The boxy, nostalgic... Whoa! I have you know, such positive memories when it comes to this... thing. Is this.. did i do that right? Yeah... Nintendo for days. You have shoulder buttons as well. You obviously did not have those. This micro USB port at the top I don't know... This little guy on the back OH! That must be the Xtand...Xtander Let's see here. Wait a second. Ahhh...... you go like that Oh that's not bad actually. So I get the phone on there Tzz Where am I? I'm at high school or... whatever. I don't know I'm in the... I'm in the cafeteria? I'm doing this. Everybody's like, \"look at that guy he's a classic. He's got the classic. He must be a classic himself. Let's give him a Coca-Cola Classic while we're at it.\" Everything old......is new again Oh my goodness Hit me right in the feels here. Showing it being used with a Super Mario Bros. emulator up there. That's cool. An NES kind of color. You know that, this color here the color that all gadgets used to be at one point in time I like that. I like that the attention to detail there. A keychain? It's got like a little signature on it. \"30th Anniversary\" They're making it feel special for you. Right? Look at that! They've got their sticker in their font in that kind of 8-bit font. \"Start\" Can you see those L.E.D.s right there Jack, flashing now? Yes! \"8Bitdo connected now\" Real quick. This guy here will work with a number of different emulators and even games that aren't classics, retro throwbacks, NES games, and whatnot. The emulator that I'm using is NES.Emu And you can see it brings up some different gamepads and you can see mine listed below. I'm gonna' load up a game here; Double Dragon 2 That's a banger right there! I grew up on these sounds! That sweet Japanese music that ruled my childhood. That's a banger. Right here, listen! Oooh. How 'bout that dude! Oooh. Tough guy over here. How 'bout a knife to your face dude! Ohhh. That's a few hits in a row. There we go. Ah, there you go. Still got it! \"Old man Lew\" still got it Jack!",

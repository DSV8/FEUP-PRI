    "transcript": "[Zack] Alright. Here we are behind the desk. There's a little monitor over here to the side, so if Cambry keeps looking over there...that's why. -[Cambry] Yeah. I can't stop looking over there. -It's her first time behind the desk...well at least on this side. And today we're going to be doing a little Q&A for you guys. We're doing our self quarantining together. It is very important. Wash your hands and stay away from people during this time. And I hope you enjoy this Q&A. We asked on Twitter yesterday what questions you guys had for both of us. We'll be answering some of those. Do you want to do the snap. -Let's get started. [Snap] [Intro] -Alright. So the first question, Tech With Brett: 'What phone does Cambry use?' Tell us. It's an iPhone 11. -Is it a Pro if it's small or big? -I think so. Yeah, the iPhone 11 Pro. -So I am an Apple fan. -Cambry was part of the Apple ecosystem before I met her. -It was actually our first conversation. -Was it? -It was about how your little text messages were green and mine were blue. And I was giving him a hard time about it. He gave me a worse time about mine. -She's one of those people. Well, you had an iPhone 7 when we first met, right? And it had a cracked screen? -I think it was a 6. -I think our second date or something like that I fixed your screen, right? Or our third date? -Yeah. -One of those. -When I first saw this table. -Uh huh. So since she started with an iPhone, I have since enabled this behavior of hers and someday we might convert her. But iPhones are find for right now, especially the newer ones. -They're user friendly for me. -Let's see what the next question is. 'How did you both meet?' Do you want to tell the story? -I don't know. We have different versions of this story. The short of it is we met on a dating app. Yep. [Laughing] -So we met on a dating app. I saw her...There was kind of a glitch in the dating app and I was...where like if you were outside of your normal range, someone who had swiped on you previously would show up. So I think I was in like New York or something at the time. I saw that she had already swiped on me and I was like alright. Like she is super cute. I want to take her on a date. So I swiped, and I knew we would match because of that little glitch. And my first question to her was...how did I word it? I was like, so if I want to take you on a date how would that work? Which is not the best pick up line. -Yeah. Clearly referring to the wheelchair. -Right. -Yeah. I really wanted to mess with him and come up with some like long explanation of like having to go to the DMV and getting a certain license and then picking me up at a certain time. -And a special van. -A special van...yeah. Then I realized it was just him being cordial and I should respect that and so I just told him we should meet for our first date. I would drive myself and he could drive himself. -Yeah she was like, let's just...we pick a restaurant and we go to it and we meet there. And I was like, oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So we did. We actually met...I think it was a Saturday night and we met at a crepe place. We started at 9:00pm and we didn't leave until like 2:00am. We just like talked the whole time and it was kind of... -We were just on the front porch. Like they were closing and we just stayed on the front porch and chatted till 2:00am. -And I think our first couple of dates were like that. We just talked a lot, and you know, the rest is history. Here we are. So we've been married for 7 months now and it's been good. Someone tweeted this: I made this for you, please acknowledge it. -Yeah, you look really pretty. Good work! -It's cool. I don't know if the eye shadow is my color. -We could test out some different colors though. -But it is very creative. Thank you very much for this. 'Can Cambry do a teardown instead of you?' Would you ever want to take apart a phone? -There would be a lot of bloopers folks. It looks intense but I would try it. I'm up for a challenge. -Maybe we'll do that someday. Alright. This one's kind of interesting since we're...for some reason we're on the dating spiel It says: 'Cambry, when you first learned that your future hubby was buying expensive phones and breaking them, what was your first reaction?' -I don't know if I remember the exact moment of that being...I think it was just like finding out that YouTube was your job. And I was like, do you live in your parent's basement and film cats. So that was my initial reaction. But yeah. I just learned more about it and it's a niche job. -She likes it now. -Yeah. I think it's pretty neat. -'Do you buy your phones with your money, or how do you get them?' So I do... there are very few manufacturers that send me retail boxes of their phones. LG used to way back with like the LG G6. OnePlus still sends me a phone in the retail box sealed. But basically I buy everything else. All the Samsungs, all the iPhones, all that. You know, I don't lose money on this YouTube channel thing. Like I...the views that the phones get when I take them apart and do the durability tests on them, more than make up for the price of the phone. So the short answer to that is no, they are not review units. And yes, I do pay for the vast majority them. I don't know why this is like our dating life. I guess it's because you're in it. So you have a bunch of questions. Alright: 'So what is your biggest pet peeve about Cambry?' And then you have to think of one about me too I guess. Okay, so this is hard because when...so Cambry's great. I love everything about Cambry. -You're going to have a hard time picking which one. -But when you live with someone, it's like, there's sometimes little things, little quirks that come to light. And Cambry has this thing...and I've talked to her about this already...but like I'll say something, and she'll say 'what' even though she's already heard what I said. It's just kind of like a filler word. And so if I just wait for a second, then she'll respond even though she already said 'what'. And it's such a small thing. -Well I think it's because I'm thinking about something else and you're saying something and it's like...what? Like I have to stop and shift gears. -And then it clicks to what I said and I don't actually have to repeat myself. -Maybe. -But anyway, sometimes. It's a small thing. -It's fine. -What about you? -I don't know that it's a pet peeve, but just something that I've observed. We will go out into public or anywhere...a building, whatever...and we'll be holding hands, and low and behold a little drinking fountain shows up. Zack has to stop what he's doing, holding my hand or whatever it is, and go to that drinking fountain and drink from it. It's fine. I don't know. It's not really a pet peeve, it's just kind of unique. -So her pet peeve of me is that I'm thirsty. -No! -Actually...either way. We're leaving it! -Oh gol!Okay, next question. -So this one's kind of about my phone. It says: 'We know you only update your phone every couple of years, but why do you always go for Samsungs?' I don't really have like a good reason for that. It's just kind of like what I started with and what I am used to I guess. And so I just stay with Samsung because that's what I'm used to. I mean, to be fair, I do feel like they make a really good phone, but it's not the best phone out there. It's just one of the good ones. So here's an interesting one: 'How many people of your audience are from Spain?' So I saw Marquez do this on his Q&A a couple days ago and he went through and talked about like how much watch time his channel has had. So I'm going to see if I can jump in here to my analytics and check out my watch time and see how many people from Spain there are. -Hey Siri... -How many days is 3.5 billion minutes? -[Siri] 3 billion 5 hundred million minutes is 2,430,555.56 days. -Wow, okay. Hey Siri, how many years is 3.5 billion minutes?.....You gotta do it. -Hey Siri.....Hey Siri...This is why you don't like Apple. Hey Siri...come on girlfriend. Hey Siri. -Okay, hold on. Okay Google. How many... -[Siri] Wow. Awkward. -...How many years is 3.5 billion minutes? -[Google] 3 billion 500 million minutes is equal to 6,659.056 calendar years. -So my channel has been watched for 6,659 years? That's a big number. And Google answered it way quicker than Siri. -Did you hear her while that was on? -Yeah that was perfect! Alright let's see if we can find out how many people are from Spain. Alright, so I found the top countries. My top countries are obviously United States, and then India, and the UK are my top three. And then Spain is down...so there's no exact number just .8% of my audience is from Spain. So thank you! 'Have you ever cut yourself while taking a phone apart?' That answer is yes. But I hid it very well. I don't think I've ever really told this. Okay, so when I was making a video...you'll probably be able to find it....it was a Star Wars like floating speaker. I think I made like two Christmases ago...like two years ago. And I was actually using one of these tools to pry open the little globe thing, and I cut my finger. Like it slipped and sliced open my finger so bad that I had to stop filming and wait for like a week for it to heal before I like finished the video. So you'll notice that the first half of the video my finger's fine. Second half of the video, I can't remember if I covered it up or was wearing a band-aid -Did you have a band-aid? -Yeah, I might have. But the first half of the video and the second half of the video were like a week apart from each other But with the razor blade I have not cut myself yet...while taking apart a phone. Remember, safety first. Another question is: 'Why is your name JerryRigEverything on YouTube and why is your real name Zack? So why not ZackRigEverything?' So I get this question a lot actually. Most people call me Jerry which is fine. I answer to both. -You still sometimes refer to yourself as Jerry. -Yeah, this is true. So my grandpa's name is Jerry and there's a phrase called 'jerry-rigging' things, where it's like you can fix what you have with whatever materials you have on hand...you know, like duct tape or wire or whatever. And so when I first started my channel Jerry Rig Everything was kind of like just having fun with projects and putting things together that might not be conventional but still work. And it's been fun. So my real name is Zack. The channel's name is JerryRigEverything off of that phrase and kind of out of respect for my grandpa whose name is Jerry. So someone does ask...you know, obviously coronavirus is obviously something that's prevalent right now. 'What's your opinion on the coronavirus situation?' And honestly, like we aren't experts on this subject, but we are listening to the experts. And that would be the CDC and scientists and doctors. And they are saying stay inside, self quarantine. Wash your hands. -It's stressful. I'm trying to stay off social media. But we're quarantining very well together. -We do have a lot of stuff to do. I think, well, one of our favorite video games that we...our only video game that we play together is Breath of the Wild on the Switch and we've had a lot of fun with that. We bought the expansion pack so we've been getting those extra shrines. -'Any new exciting projects coming up?' -So there actually is something we've been working on for the last year or so. -Yeah, over a year. -If you guys remember that off-road wheelchair that I built Cambry out of 2 electric bikes...we're building a much better version of that. -It's pretty sleek. -More accessible and can go more places. Maybe we'll put a little bit up on screen right now so you can see. We'll blur a little bit of it out because we don't want to release it just yet. But... -It's coming. -And it's going to be cool. We'll be teasing it a bit more over on Instagram over at @NotaWheelchair. I'll leave a link down in the description for that. And we're excited. 'Can you feature Cambry in every video?' [Laughing] I'll work on it. 'What does Cambry do for a living?' -I'm a registered Occupational Therapist, and I teach riding lessons. -Horse riding lessons. -Yeah. Clarify that. Equestrian riding lessons. -Okay, so here's one to end on: 'Would you ever $250,000 on one of those space cruises?' -No. I had a nightmare like 6 months ago that Zack was going on a space expedition and then it blew up in the sky. It was terrifying. No. -She let's me do a lot of things, but the one thing I cannot do apparently is go to space. There we have it. Hope you guys enjoyed this Q&A session. It was fun having you on camera yet again. We'll have many more videos in the future with Cambry in them. -Thanks a ton for watching. We'll see you around.",

    "transcript": "- I've never heard of Pixeo before, and you probably haven't either, but when they offered to sponsor this video for their new PX277 Pro it's a 1440p display, 165 hertz or something, and it's got a KVM inside of it. and the price tag is actually reasonable. We just, you know, we couldn't resist. So we're gonna open it up, and see if it lives up to their claims. We've got this sweet \"Engineering sample, not for resale\" sticker. We get that for most of the things that we get here so that, you know, we don't just turn around, and sell everything. - [Jono] That's why we can't give away anything. - Yeah, that's why we can't give away stuff. What else is on the box? So there's like nothing on this side. I don't know what David's looking at. Let's turn around. There's nothing on this side either. It's just box stuff. Like, \"Hey, handle the box with care.\" - [Jono] It does say 144. - And where does it say 144? Oh, wow. (laughs) Yeah, that's actually like kind of refreshing, but also a bit of a pain. because I like to be able to just look at the box, and be like, \"Okay, it's got this, this and this.\" Because you don't always want to like, if you're going to Best Buy, you don't want to sit there and Google every single product. And I'm sorry, I don't trust employees to like, tell me anything about the stuff there. Not harping on Best Buy. That's like almost any electronic store. I just don't really trust them, I guess. So here's the base. Here's the stand. And here's the cable. \"Warning to avoid danger from suffocation. Keep these bags away from babies and children.\" - Oh, don't let Jono get a hold of it. - Don't let Jono. (laughs) - I'm a baby. - \"Thank you for choosing Pixeo. Pixeo is a gaming monitor and accessories brand that is focused on growing and becoming a reliable partner in the e-sports community. Although small, we work hard to deliver big. We invite you to take this step with us. Thank you for experiencing gaming at its best with Pixeo.\" Wow, these guys assume that if you're buying this monitor, you know what you're getting already, you don't need reminders. And that's kind of true. Like most of the time when I buy a monitor, and it's got all this extra manual, and documentation saying like, \"Oh, it's this, it's that, it's X, Y, and Z.\" Or it's all over the box. It's like, \"Yup, I know, thanks. I didn't need to know that or look at that, or see it or whatever. The only reason I know anything about it is because they sent us a bunch of specs and we've looked at the website, and stuff and it's supposed to be pretty reasonable. I think it's about $350 or so. And you get a 1440p 144 hertz display. I think this is just a couple of USB ports, and some ethernet. It's also got a USBC display port attachment. So what you can do is you can actually hook up a laptop to this really easily. You don't even need a charger. It'll charge up to, I think 65 Watts. Man, more I talk about this thing, the more I like it actually. Everyone's still talking about 4k and even 8k, but the reality is like, who can run that? Like, I have a pretty nice computer with a 3070 and a 9900K and I can't run 4k. Like I can, but it's, you know, like maybe 60 FPS if I tone down settings and stuff, but I'm kind of a graphic snob. And so I like to have everything at least at like very high or high, I mean ultra if possible, but we've done a whole video on why that's kind of dumb, but 1440p is manageable. Like I can get really high frame rates in most new games at 1440p, I'm playing \"God of War\" right now. Boy! And while streaming on the same card, I can get like a hundred frames per second or so on very high settings. So pretty happy. Ah, okay. So one minor complaint already. Is it doesn't use that tool system that a lot of other monitors use, it uses this three screw system to screw into the base. They probably could have gone with a single screw just right in the middle, like most other monitors. I mean, this thing isn't huge. It's like 27 inches. So that's the KVM I'm guessing, and then there's your power, a USB (indistinct). And HDMI 2.0 144 Hertz, DP 1.2 165. You know, I really liked that these are all labeled, and not just labeled, like they don't just say HDMI or display port or whatever. It says HDMI 2.0 144 Hertz. It tells you what it is. It tells you what it can do. Even with the Type-C charging. It tells you it can do 65 Watts, and it can do 165 cause it's basically display port, and then a headphone jack. So yeah points to them. It doesn't do a couple of other things we noticed. Like it doesn't, pretty sure it doesn't go vertical. I want to try to bend it a bit more, but I'm pretty sure it's just going to break. So yeah, I can't like tilt this vertically, but you know what? Not many people even do that, especially if you've only got like one monitor. Who uses a single monitor vertically? - [Jono] I do. To look at my stonks. - One nice thing, just uses my favorite little feature, the navigation nipple. And it looks like that's all you get for your menu controls, which is perfectly fine. It's pretty thin bezel too. Like you basically just get a bunch of screen space, and a very small chin on the bottom. This is Pixeo. It looks like they're taking the approach of, \"You know, what do gamers need? Give it to them. Don't put any bells and whistles or frills or anything like that.\" But that being said, yeah, actually, nevermind. There is more play than I expected. You get a good amount of swivel. You can tilt. There's two little slots on the back here. I think they're for speakers, because they're on the exact same side. And I think they're just rear firing, which kind of sucks, but whatever, you don't usually want to use monitor speakers anyway, otherwise it's got to be for cooling. I don't know why else you'd put little vents in the back of your monitor, so let's just put it on our PC, set it up and take a look, see how it actually looks. Now for the other monitor. So it's 1440p, I'm going to turn on HDR. - [David] It looks off. - It looks off but I mean, this is what Windows looks like with HDR on. It's not good on monitors. It's just not, like mini LED when we get there. I mean, they're going to be expensive as hell when they launch, but man, they look really nice and they're going to have proper HDR with like really good full array, local diming with like 500+ zones. But that's going to cost you an arm and a leg like, over $1000 for 1080p or 1440p monitor. I mean, it basically looks like I expected it to. This thing has something like 130% coverage of SRGB like 97% DCI-P3 and 96% Adobe RGB, which is the majority of it. It covers a pretty wide color gamut, which is always a plus. As for accuracy. it's not tuned out of the factory or anything, but the fact that you have access to those colors means that you can try to calibrate it yourself, especially if you have the proper equipment to do so. As for brightness, it gets up to like 450 nits. Let's blast a white screen. Yeah, that's pretty bright, like 450 nits, isn't that bright, but for a monitor it's not bad. - [Jono] They're manufactured direct to consumer. - No way, okay. So that's actually really cool. Apparently it's manufactured, and it goes directly to the consumer. So that kind of makes sense with the box we got. It kind of makes sense with the price point they're able to hit. That's actually great. Honestly, I hate paying middlemen for like anything. So I'm all aboard the direct from the factory, straight to consumer train. It looks pretty good. And this is with HDR turned off. Like the colors actually look like they're supposed to. Those greens on those peppers actually look really good, and you don't get a bunch of like weird color bleed, like all of this black on the grill, and like the grease splattering and stuff. It all looks great. Even just looking back at like these pots and stuff, you can see a lot of nice color differentiation between everything. The chicken looks good. I think this is beef or something or pork, and that looks really good. - [Jono] Have you had lunch yet or are you hungry? - No, I had a salad. (laughs) I mean, so far I actually liked this thing. It takes out a little too much desk real estate. Like these monitor, the base legs. They probably could've gone a little bit wider, so it doesn't have to cut this far into your desk, but that's okay. Like that's a pretty minor complaint. Otherwise, like it looks pretty good. The bezel is a little thicker than I was hoping for. on the actual screen itself, but that's fine. They do have an inside bezel on the chin, which is a little unfortunate. It's a pretty minor thing. You're going to end up with the same kind of screen real estate overall. It's just, when you have the chin, you can usually put the plastic up a little higher. So that it hides that bezel completely. So that like the screen looks like it just disappears into the bottom. Otherwise everything looks really good so far. Even though this one here, doesn't say G-SYNC capable, like our Asus monitor does right there. There's a good chance it's just a driver thing. Like this is pretty early. I think this comes out around March of this year. So it probably just doesn't have its information up to date, but it can enable G-SYNC. It's G-SYNC compatible. It can enable it for full screen mode. It doesn't have the G-SYNC module, but it's still pretty good. Hey, I've got nipples. Can you milk me? - [David] Don't tempt me. - I kind of wish that it was centered. I've said that a few times when checking out other monitors, but you know, it's not that bad. It's a little lower, which is nice. Like I can do it like this. Let's crank it into a hundred baby, get even brighter. Contrast sure, sure, sure. Preset: User. Oh yeah, I forgot about the okay. So Movie probably looks the best at least for content consumption anyway, you can change the aspect ratio, 4 by 3 cool. - [David] Oh, that's good! - That's actually a pretty cool feature. If you like to play a lot of retro games, check out the 4 by 3 option. Honestly, I never thought I'd say that, but you know what? It's handy. Other aspect ratios? Not everyone can do that. Oh, you just change your input by like pressing up on the nipple, which is nice. So that's the other cool thing is you don't have to go into a menu. Like what happens if I go down? So down is the KVM stuff. So USB up and Type-C. So that's cool. Let's see what's left? Left is your color profiles. That's actually really handy. I really like what they've done here. Right is the crosshair stuff. If you want it. And an FPS counter, which is great. Well, it's got timer too. That's actually pretty cool. I like that they've got a timer because especially with Windows 11, games are on your main screen. That's really frustrating because you can't see the clock. RGB light on. So there is an RGB light. Where is this RGB light? There is a tiny little strip of my beloved RGB. And unlike another monitor that we did, it's got like the whole diffusion across the whole strip instead of just like, \"Oh, here's five little LEDs, and it splashes light across the wall.\" No, give me the strip. Let it diffuse. So it looks good when I look at it, and I don't have to look at it like splashed against something. Obviously everything kind of looks like ass. That's pretty much just because the game itself is probably, Yeah, 1280 by 768 - [David] You gotta change your aspect ratio. - Oh that's why. Why is it at 5.3? Oh my God. 16 by 9, RTX on. Yeah what do we have in here? Like a 3090? Okay, that's all looks good. Apply. Oh, it looks so much better. Everything is applied. It looks great. It looks like the \"Doom Eternal\" we know and love, and let's jump into wherever our save slot is on the campaign. It's not the first level, I don't think, but whoever saved this. - [David] I guarantee it's Linus. - Put me in with no ammo. I'm not an elitist, but I have high standards. - [Jono] Yeah, you are! Your keyboard stuff! - But there's some things. Everyone has a thing, right. And keyboards are mine and that's fine. But even with keyboards, I'm not an elitist. I just, I appreciate, the nice stuff. Like if I've got to type, like I don't like this keyboard but I don't care I'll use it, and that's just fine. I don't want to use this full auto. How do I switch? There we go. So even though it doesn't have like the best HDR, most monitors don't. The whole having like 450 nits brightness, does kind of make everything pop just a little bit more, even in SDR. And I'm a big fan. If you can avoid buying a 300 nit monitor, and get something even just 400 or 500 nits, definitely go for it. Especially if you can afford it. But like even just this scene here, it looks great, like the smoke down there, and like the green lighting up there, the fire looks nice and like fiery. Man, \"Doom Eternal\" looks so (beep) good. - [David] I find it really blurry when it's in motion. - There's a little bit of screen tearing. Like when you move everything too much, but it's not too, too bad, and honestly, we're trying to give you like a worst case example in this situation. Most people, when they play games, don't do this. You know, they like pan around, maybe do a quick 180, but by the time you've turned, you don't even really like notice any of the in-between stuff that maybe looked a little bad. So that's totally fine, honestly. So we're going to do some UFO Tests real quick at this 165, the UFO looks pretty good. It's pretty clear. There's not like a bunch of smearing or anything. Let's do some other tests. Let's do, where is the dropdown. Video game panning test. So the top one's 30 FPS, the bottom's 165. And I play a lot of \"DOTA\". So this is all very familiar to me. As long as you're using this thing with a high frame rate in games that matches, or exceeds your 165 Hertz refresh rate, it's going to look pretty good. Like even in \"DOTA\" panning around the map, this fast, these guys, they get a little blurry sometimes, but it's not that bad. Let's see what else they've got frame pacing, slight stutter \"DOTA 2\". Oh, there's other, this is cool. Quebec city. Yeah, so like when we look at this still image of Quebec, it does get a little blurrier, because there's all these much finer details in here. So, you know, who watches someone racing around Quebec, or a cityscape, maybe don't watch movies on this thing, use it just for games. It's definitely not going to be your like, \"Oh, this is my 4k 60 super good HDR monitor that I play all my content on.\" This is going to be just like, \"I'm gaming, maybe play some high frame rate E-sports like \"Counter-Strike\" or \"DOTA\" or \"League of Legends\".\" Something like that. It'll look perfectly fine. You can see a bit of stutter and tear as it goes, but I guarantee you, if we put just about any monitor on here, you're going to see a little bit, this is tough to do perfectly. Maybe an OLED could do this perfectly by turning every, like every pixel, just off to get these blacks exactly where they're supposed to be. But this is an extreme example. In actual use case, it looks really good. So Pixeo seems to be doing a pretty good job here. The PX277 Pro is this guy here, and it's going to be less than $380. It's going to be out in March. And honestly, if you're looking for a new monitor, you want 1440p, you want a high refresh rate. It's not a bad buy. If you can find something cheaper than sure. Maybe go for that. But I don't think with all the features that this has, you're going to find all that much for much cheaper. If you do want to pick one up, take a look at the link below, we'll have it available there for you. And if you want to watch any other Short Circuits, take a look at the Corsair Xeneon monitor that we unboxed. That thing has a worst stand than this, but it's still nice monitor. - [Jono] It's a very multifunctional monitor. + Yeah, it's very multi-functional, thanks for watching.",

    "transcript": "- So we're gonna hop up here and then they're going to raise it up. - [Jenna] Oh. Oh boy. - We're good. We're going in. (upbeat music) All right, you guys. This is something very exciting. This is the Microsoft Surface Hub and I guess we're in our pandemic bubble. They actually sell the large version of this at CES this year. And today, my friends. Hold on, we're going to unbox the 50-inch version and it is now going to be a part of my home and my studio and my life. - I wasn't prepared. Look at this little thing. What do you actually think you're going to do with that? - Can we show them something first? 'Cause this is cool. Come here, we're gonna show them something first. - Look at this. This is high technology called Tip N Tell. It's a blue beads, they indicate if mishandled they indicate if mishandled but we're good. (music continues) - Couldn't Tip N Tell myself. - Dude, you're going to stab me. - This is like a hamster unboxing. Like if I was a hamster that this is a box that I would unbox. - Okay. This is so small. Are you kidding me? Oh, that's a USB-C fingerprint reader. Hey, put this in your pocket, my pockets are full. - Oh. - Should I start... Should I open this stuff up? - [Delivery guy] You want to open it there or you want to open it in your house. - Should I open this in the house? So Sean had a really good idea. He said, why don't we time-lapse the delivery putting it together. We just don't want to waste there time. They know what to do. - It's here. - [Jenna] What's the plan here? - Well, so here's the instructions. We pull the pin. Here we go. Whoa. Wait, wait, do I move this? I should probably move this, put it right here but it has a cart. So basically we can move it wherever we want. Oh. Well, we've got a camera and this looks one of like a Crayola markers and this looks one of like a Crayola markers that you get as a child. So you could be like... Simple cable. Okay. Well, I need to lock this out. - [Jenna] Yes. - This says that we take it up with two people. One, two. Oh, that's not in English. - [Jenna] Read the ones that are - Okay. - Read here and look. Some of it is English and some of is not. - I know it's... Life is hard. - Okay. That's cool. All right. - [Jenna] Oh, I did top first. - I did too. There we go. - [Jenna] That makes sense. I did wrong one first. - Cool. - [Jenna ] Whoa. This is cool. - Oh my goodness. Oh my gosh. I'm going to start having lectures. Oh, look at this. Look at this peel. - [Jenna] This is so cool. - Look how clean it is. - [Jenna] Wow. - Whoa. - [Jenna] This can be the snack table. - Oh my goodness. Definitely the snack table. That'll be for appetizers. Here you go Matty, it's like you're the groomer. - Beep beep beep. - Careful, obstacle. Oh, this is the perfect fit. Oh wait. I have a better view than you do. - [Jenna] Wait a minute. There's a secrets? - Yeah. That's what we're going to be housing the snacks. Jen, remember that little thing that I-- - [Jenna] I have it. - You stick ahead. It's USB-C, it doesn't matter. At least, I don't think so. I actually don't know. - [Jenna] That looks the right way. - [Justine] That looks like it's in there. - [Jenna] That looks like a power button to me. - [Justine] Oh my gosh. Here we go. - Hi, I'm Cortana. - A little time to wifi here and I'll sign in there. - Jenna, so everything's set up. We've got the product key entered. We've got everything up and running. We got some apps, but oh, we're going to order dinner now. So I've got Elephante up, this is like our favorite restaurant. It's so good. - [Jenna] I'm going to sit on the couch, get a full menu experience. Absolutely. - [Justine] Yeah. We can't be... - [Jenna] My gosh, this is incredible. Premium. - We are now in the menu. Jenna? - [Jenna] Yes. - Please pay attention. - [Jenna] Oh wow. - Here's the Whipped Eggplant. - [Jenna] You can actually see that sea salt. - I'm going to have to ask them to up the resolution on their images because this is... we're talking about, we've got a 4k display here. We need high quality images on DoorDash. I can almost taste that delicious, delicious bread. - [Jenna] I think we're going to need to do at least two orders. - Okay, we'll do two orders. Who's up next. Food is ordered. Now it's time to draw the food that I ordered. So let's see. Oh, oh, that's my first mark. - [Jenna] Isn't it cool that you can just flip the pen over and it erases. Practical. - [Justine] It's super practical. Okay. So Jenna, what did we-- - [Jenna] I got the Rigatoni Pomodoro. It's like a ball shape, maybe. - Oh my gosh-- - [Jenna] What's that? What is that? That like a cup? - Here's the plate. Oh, look at that. If I don't press very hard it makes a small line. - [Jenna] Well, it's not spaghetti. - You just said it was Spaghetti Pomodoro - [Jenna] Rigatoni. - I hate this, it's spaghetti now. So we're about to get some training now so we can learn everything there is to know about this. While we wait for dinner. So the Surface Hub 2 is honestly really cool and realistically, this is definitely not something that I feel like a lot of people are going to have in their homes. But I do see a future where now people are working from home so often that companies will be putting things like this into the homes of their employees. This really is a one-stop shop to be able to sync up with your team. Obviously, one of the things that I love is the whiteboard feature. So there's a few different features in whiteboard that are kind of cool. There's this Ink to Shape, which will basically just allow you to create beautiful shapes just allow you to create beautiful shapes without really doing any type of effort at all. One of the things I love about the whiteboard is how expansive it is. I can just scroll over here and start working on something else. I want to show you guys Ink to Table. So when you have that turned on, you can use your pen to make a spreadsheet. So check this out. Oh, look at that. Spreadsheet, spreadsheet, spreadsheet. Cool. Food. Yes or No. Yes or No. Cheeseburger. Cheeseburger. That's really ugly. I'm going to erase it. Cheeseburger, yes. Grilled cheese, yes. Pancakes, yes. Salad, just for the sake of this video I'm going to say no. But I do love salad. Whoa. Check this out. When you click that little magic wand. It cleans up your handwriting. No way. I wonder if I can take a picture of myself. Oh, I can look at that. Okay. Ready? I'm gonna try to jump and take the photo at the same time. Look at this. It's so silly. I mean look at that, that's beautiful. It's a hat, that's my hat. One of the main highlights though of whiteboard is the collaboration aspect of it. So you can invite your team, your friends to work on the same document with you. So that's definitely something for businesses where I can see this is such a huge asset. But for us, we're going to of course be making a lot of spreadsheets about food. But like the maps on this look so amazing. But like the maps on this looks so amazing. So now we're in New York and with the pen you're able to draw and it'll give you the distance and the current time that it will take to go that distance. Oh, you actually took me a completely different route because that's the way that you should go to get there. You can also do just basic marking up. One of the things from using this that I kind of was struggling a little bit with is the keyboard because the keyboard is kind of large and sometimes you do have to hit it down here to bring it up. You can move it around and stuff like that but you can also hook up an external keyboard or a mouse or anything like that. So any other I/O you have, it will work with this. Another cool thing that you can do is if you have a Surface, you're actually able to mirror that display or you could duplicate it side-by-side. So we'll be able to project your Surface display onto the Surface Hub 2 or you can actually control the Surface Hub 2 with your Surface. You know what I have hooked up to this. Oh, that's right. We've got the Xbox Series X and there's a bunch of different inputs that we have here. So if we just push this little input button, this will take us to HDMI. Okay. I haven't played in a while, so let's just, let's not judge. Oh my God. I'm terrible. I'll just brine some rails, maybe. I did a kick flip. I feel like this is definitely going to be one of the most widely used features in the Surface Hub. But guys, thank you so much for watching. This was so fun to get a chance to check this out and here to thank to Microsoft for hooking me up with one of these to test. This is so fun. Since I did just get my hands on this. I haven't fully got a chance to really test it out extensively but this is now a part of the family. So I would like you to say, \"Welcome\". Welcome. There is one more little addition that I'm waiting for. This actually has a battery pack. So you're able to add the battery pack onto the stand and then I can freely roam around my house with this. That is definitely something that I never knew I needed and now that it's almost here. I can't wait.",

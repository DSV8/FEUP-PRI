    "transcript": "Welcome to Scrapyard Wars, where Luke and I compete to build the best computer on a fixed budget. And this year, it's gonna be interesting because we get to play with an enormous $800, including a hundred bucks to spend on whatever we want from our sponsor, Jawa. At the end of the week, our setups will be put through the ultimate gauntlet to find out who wins Scrapyard Wars! Yeah! Go! Go? Go! Do I keep all the money? Here! Wah! This year, the rules are mostly the same, except for one major change. Our teammate can make pickups after the 5 p.m. cutoff. We'll be bringing them in shortly. We still aren't allowed to research or plan off hours, nor are we allowed to use our industry connections or our influencer cloud for deals, which has become harder as the channel has grown and my face has become a bit of a meme. That is why our first stop is a little unusual. There's actually one more change this year. You're not building just a computer, you're doing a full gaming setup for $800. Oh, so like monitor keyboard mouse? Yes. Oh, I can do that. Desk, chair. Desk? Too easy. Unless he defines chair, I'm just going to show up with a log. I don't need to define anything because there's three parts to the score. There's going to be labs testing, there's going to be subjective judging, and then there will be a benchmark drag race at the end. So you need to oppress the judges with your setup. Well, that is harder, isn't it? Yeah! Oh, it kind of gives you a boxer nose. We're going to put on a few small pieces to aid you a little bit. Yeah, because that's what I need. Make you look a little bit more tired. Grumpy, haggard, biker. And you're a biker, you're probably getting all that wind hitting you. Clearly I'm a little ways off from my close-up, but that doesn't mean I can't start working on my plan of attack. We know the first name is Duke, what do you think for the last name? I think you had kind of mentioned offhand a bit ago, Sons of Anarchy. There was like Teller, Dax, Morrow. Morrow? Duke Morrow. I like Duke Morrow. That's a good one. You know what the end result for the makeup is supposed to be. Have you given any thought to your identity as this finalized person? Not even a little bit. There might be time to do that. Pick what bike does Duke Morrow ride. I like that one. Luke has a full alias ready to go. What? I'm probably just going to cheap out and just be my grandpa. Boo! You need a whole identity. What? My grandpa's cool. I have a whole identity. I'm John. I'm from the prairies. As is tradition, we start by scoping out the usual second hand marketplaces. Facebook has come up in a big way since the last time we did one of these. Craigslist is like dead now. Man, looking at GPUs over on Facebook right now I'm kind of wondering if my hundred dollars on Java would be best spent just getting a decent GPU and then fighting my way through like crappy old Lenovo pre-builds that are local. Honestly so far finding the things on Java seems the easiest but I'm trying to make sure that I look everywhere. We'll shop around. A 6700 XT is like 400 Canadian dollars on Facebook and as low as 240 US dollars on Java. So it's like 320 bucks. Wow! Oh yeah, aside from pricing there's a couple talking points. Put the market in the hands of gamers. You can find Parts pre-built systems new and used and they've got individually vetted verified sellers So that's probably what I'm gonna want to go with so I can make sure that we get it shipped up here in time That's exactly right. Are we considering things like shipping costs? No, no, no, we're gonna get like expedited so it'll arrive tomorrow They're not actually available in Canada. They're making an exception for us. I kind of wish they were though Looking at this right now meet your teammate What's up brother? My name is Duke Mero. Duke? So I've got a bit of a bad update for you. Okay. Turns out never buying your own computer components and not reviewing computer components for I think five years since the last backyard wars means I have no idea what's going on. The what I've done is nothing. Well I have some good news. Okay. I have a plan that I think will win us the game. Brother. There's a whole bunch of mom and pop tech shops or even just small tech shops that do like small to medium businesses. They have recycling piles. We could probably just call them. So we could as much get PC cases, power supplies, things like that. When I was working at a place several years ago, they were recycling 8th gens, CPUs. Whoa! I love this. One thing that I was doing actually was googling around for recycling places because something that won me a scrap yard wars in the past was finding FreeGeek. Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. But FreeGeek is closed now. Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Whoa, I like this deal. What the hell is this? Tower only, 250 bucks. Core i7-8700, 32 gigs RAM. This is obviously a custom build. Comes with a tower cooler. Whoa, whoa, Seasonic 520 watt power supply. Dude, I should just go buy this. I might not even keep all of that stuff. I got like four days. I can flip some of that stuff. We're gonna turn a paper clip into a house. Let's go. I'm gonna be super formal in my communication. I think that's gonna be part of my persona. I don't have a lot of money. What does he want? Oh, he wants to play Fortnite. I'm gonna spell it wrong. Thank you John. Okay, send message. Let's see how it goes. Apparently presentation is some amount of the judging I don't know how much. Okay, like if we end up with kind of an ugly computer. Mm-hmm. My idea was that we hide it by like desk mounting the computer basically and I have found a Desk that had like cable management holes in it and all that kind of stuff that was free It says pick up available today. So we should offer like now. It's in Langley too. It's nice and close. Yeah, Overdale This guy's like yeah, just come by and pick it up. So We will go pick it up today. This is interesting What the hell is a Ryzen 5 4500? Oh, wait, do I have a message back already? I'm not a gamer. You need to look at the specs and draw your own conclusions Sorry, can you advise if this is the best deal you can offer me? All right. Well, he got back to me really fast That's a big improvement over the Craigslist days. What do I want my angle to be? I got to impress the judges If all I had to do was build a fast computer. No problem. Who are the judges? Can we cater to the judges? Yeah, I'll tell you the judges. It's Nicole, Plouffe, and Riley. Okay, so Plouffe We need a good monitor and keyboard. Riley's gonna want minimalism. I want to make sure that we try to spend nothing Yeah on desk Chair things like computer case stuff like that, but we should still try to do cool things with it I should start figuring out What I'm gonna expect to pay for like a desk. I mean, it's got to be free, right? Oh, it's free as f*** things that I'm a little bit concerned about is peripherals and monitor labs won't be testing the monitor They'll just be testing the computer but the monitor will be part of the experience. Yeah. Whoa, this monitor is 300 Hertz for $175 honestly, you might want to even just send it. That's really good. It's a 24 inch 1080p 1 millisecond IPS low-motion blur dude I can get leftover paint for like five bucks Like if I like painted up the walls near my setup and stuff. I think that'd go a long way There's one system on Java. That's like really sick. It's like legitimately pretty well specced out My biggest concern was that's American which would be it might basically that's our budget. Yeah, I think that'd be like $800 Yeah, so you have to get like a free monitor free mouse free keyboard free desk free chair Where is it? Ooh, 400 bucks, man. There's some deals. Of course, the Seasonic Focus GM 550. Man, will not come with storage. Okay, that's what's missing on this buddy for 400. All right, hi. Just send in some messages, send in some messages. Hi Linus. Never better. Oh God, okay. Hello. It was the reverse of what happened when he shaved his beard off. Honestly, things are going a little rough. Okay. For team Linus and Sammy. Okay. I found a couple of pretty good deals. Okay. - They are not responding to me. Oh. I found one okay deal. Buddy needs two hours of notice, but it's for a Core i7-8700. Okay. Which is okay. Yeah, that's like worse than mine. And I play games that run on a hamster wheel, so... What I really want is a Ryzen 3000 series. There's a couple good deals out there. One of them I can call. But I think it might be actually better if you place the call. So guess what? You're up. Now we need a story. You're my daughter-in-law. So that's why you're communicating for me. Okay. I'm trying to buy a gaming system for my grandson. I guess he's your son then. I'm 23. You could have a son. Yeah. Biologically speaking. Look, I'm not saying you're a responsible daughter-in-law. I don't have a lot of money. I'm a pensioner. Okay. You have reached mailbox number. We're going to text. I guess that makes it a little bit easier. Okay. Okay. Stand by. What? I mean, you're good for now. Are you sure your old man fingers still? Should I type it off? If we get the whole computer for free, we could spend the rest of the budget just on Plouffe's monitor. Yo. His current monitor that he has. But that all depends on you getting it for free. So why don't you call the tech shop? Yeah, maybe I should. And see if they have ours. I can pile that up and let you dig through. Bruh. Okay, I guess we're calling somewhere else. So Luke is also doing this right now. Hey there, I was just calling. I just heard back from Buddy with the $400, 3600 machine. It's got a 1660 super in it already. We could probably flip that for a few bucks. B450A Pro Max, 16 gigs rip jaws, 3600, focus, 550 watt power supply. Serenity now. Nice looking case. Okay. Lots of nice looking fans and stuff. Will not come with storage. Yeah, that's fine. We can find storage. I worry that this place is gonna know my voice though, because I've definitely called her. Hi there. Bit of a long shot. But I've just been calling around trying to see if any of the computer shops have like a recycling pile or something. If you've got anything you were planning on recycling, if I could sift through it, that would be fantastic. Yeah, absolutely. I really appreciate it. What was your name? Luke. Duke. Duke? Duke, yeah. Okay. I'll give you a call back, okay? Thank you. Holy crap. What's your name? Luke the Duke. By the way, they probably know who you are. Because I've been there and they've talked about LMG. So this might be a little bit interesting. I hope they don't agree to do it just because they might have a sense of who you are. If they do, it should be fine because it's free, right? Not really. I suspect it would be against the spirit of the competition. I see. But I'll try to be pretty convincing. This buddy has no GPU in it. Okay. But does have storage. Okay. Oh, God. What's this now? I can help you out with that if you're not the most text-savvy. Oh, that's so helpful. I am asking my daughter-in-law to have a look at your listing for me. She is quite knowledgeable. No pressure, though. What do you mean no? I put things together. I've made one PC. That's it. Do you know how to graph? Data visualization, right? Yeah, I could do that on a Macbook. What time would we be looking at? I don't mind this one. Ideally, we should be picking up at least something today, or it's gonna be a big waste of Tom's time to make me up. Can we come in... No pressure, but... Probably take an hour. An hour? Can we come in... But it takes an hour to get there. 1.5 hours. We're gonna immediately flip this GPU. Okay. 'Cause we're gonna pick up something else. Okay. But we got basically everything else that we need here, other than storage, so we just gotta find storage. What GPU do we have? We don't have one. Oh, okay. So you just wanted something else. Why do you want to meet up? Oh God, we're gonna need like an outfit for me by then. Well, we're committed now, Sammy. Should we call Black Lab, Glenn? That's the guy who we did like buying out the mom and pop tech shop. Give it a shot. I'll give a call. We'll see if Keith answers. They picked up my recycling last week. Oh, okay. Yeah. I'm gonna ask him if he can do $25 off, but I feel like I might have committed already. Am I gonna be one of those guys that shows up $50 short and is like, well, do you want it or not? No, I hate those people. I actually hate them. I would be like, I don't know this man. Someone just reached out to me, so I'm not sure. That is f*** Luke. They just lowballed you. Yeah. They sound like a jerk. Pleasure doing business with you. That sounds very boomer. I know, well, it's what I'm going for, man. Yeah, no response from any of the tech shops. I'm gonna feel so dumb if we buy a 3070, knowing we can get the rest of the parts for like nothing. I agree. So overall update, we're debating on buying a 3070 on Jawa. And it is well-priced on Jawa. It is actually- well-priced compared to our local area right now. But the issue we're potentially seeing is if we spend that little of our budget on a 3070 and we get the rest of the computer for very cheap, we could have theoretically bought a 3080. And so now we're trying to weigh our options of should we just bite the bullet and get the 3070? Should we wait for one of the tech shops to call us 'cause maybe they'll say yeah, come look through our recycling pile. Well, we could buy the 3070. Hear me out. Do you think someone here wants to buy a 3070? We sell it to them for $20 more. That is actually fine. I don't think we could sell it in here, in the company, but if we were able to flip it on Facebook marketing. It's like a day and a half. Yeah. Because it's showing up from Java. That stuff has happened, by the way. Yeah. It's just very hard. Let's see, 3070. Okay, what's a 3070 going for? $200, $300. Whoa, whoa, whoa. $260? Is this just like... An amazing deal? The only thing we're gonna get that might be better would be if we could get a 6,800 XT. Okay. I don't think we're getting that. Maybe a 6,800 XT? What about a 3080 equivalent AMD card? That's what I'm looking for right now. Got it. Oh man, I'm a little scared to just take the first deal I see on Java, but like, I think this is like the best deal. If Luke doesn't get this, I think he's like boned. The thing is that like, I feel like if it's the official store, they would have tested it, question mark. That's true. Because that's like a big chunk of change, right? And we can't get it back. Still going with that then? Yeah, I think we're still going to go with it. Find a 100 hertz 1080p 22 inch monitor for 50 bucks. Or we get that monitor that we saw. That super overkill monitor. Because if we get a 3070 or 3080, it'll be able to drive it. But then that monitor is 100 Canadian. It was, yeah. And it's all the Java money. So we would only have 600 bucks left. Which then would be 500 for a 3080. So we'd have... $100 for the rest of the system and peripherals. There is a $75 one. It's 24 inch 144. That's sick, isn't it? Yeah, 75 bucks, and then we have 25 bucks still on Java. So we spend it on that SSD. What's the most we can get? For the max price of 25 bucks, we can get a 256 SATA or a 256 M.2. Sheesh, brother. Or we spend 28. So we go $3 US to Canadian and we get a 480. SATA, you want to do that? I think that's that seems pretty good to me. Okay, we need to find out what the cheapest SSD we can get is. Oh wait, buddy here has tons of them. Okay, no, no, we can yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so we can we can get them for 20 bucks Canadian locally. Now we're trying to make a commitment on the GPU so that we can have a pricing for the rest of the system, but we don't want to actually spend the money. So we're going to ask someone if we can make an agreement to buy the card and say can we pick it up tomorrow with full intention to actually do that. But by saying we're going to pick it up tomorrow. We're buying ourselves the time to figure out if it's even technically possible. So that is 100% the goal. We're not going to try to bail on this person. But we want to lock in the deal. 3080 in a $800 system is insane. I can pick it up tomorrow. Is there any wiggle room on the price? Smiley face. I don't know if... Okay, I'm deleting the smiley face. I don't know if Duke Marrow would send a smiley face. Oh, sorry. Yeah, you're Duke Marrow. Oh, I never checked my email. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I heard back from this guy. I'm three after six today. Okay, original craigslist. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, but it only comes with eight gigs of RAM, but it has a better motherboard. It has a Quadro 600. That's like really old, I think. Quadro 600 is worth $5. Where do you see 4500U in the posting? I mean, it says 4500. That's not a CPU. Wait, what the hell's a Ryzen 5 4500? Oh, it is a desktop chip. How okay with pending the rules, are you? We're okay with that. What if we like bought. this and then we went on like a selling spree over the next bit because I think this deal is crazy okay like I think this guy has no idea what the stuff is worth there's five knock to a fans the knock to a fans are worth $200 I say we do it and then we have to sell stuff to get back under budget Luke would do the same thing I don't we actually want to go with this name but hey young Mike if I come pick up today at 6 can you give me $20 off see this isn't so much a budget management exercise as a cash flow management exercise because the Jawa cash hasn't left our wallet so as long as by the time the Jawa card arrives and the cash is back in our wallet by then we're good okay right i didn't hear anything and i will allow it because it sounds interesting okay okay okay okay between these two deals i think we're in really good shape because like A Ryzen 3600 is worth like 90 bucks this is all mental math which is not my specialty have you seen the tattoos whoa you got one by your eye damn your nose is huge i can't get over the nose the nose is pretty huge this side is enormous yeah i really don't look that different i think if i put a hat on though yeah a hat would help here we go here we go we heard back okay sure sure sure 20 bucks off we just got 20 bucks off let's go 20 is the difference between victory and crushing defeat okay in scrapyard wars $20 is the difference between cute desk and not cute desk that's true and it'll get us points in Nicole Right? because she has a cat. Right? yes You still gonna shave your head all right? Let's do it. I think you should do it You want me to shave his head? I think you should shave his head. Why are we even why are we doing this at all? Does he need to be convincing as well is Linus this person also getting disguised is that a no? The problem is Elijah is actually kind of recognizable. We do need to go to our first port of call very soon though Here's what I'm thinking Sammy, okay, do you want to make a quick trip to the value village? We have a separate budget for clothes for our outfit. Okay, you got to help me out here I'm fine. If you try to actually style it you don't have to go straight bald. What is style at me? I don't know do a lower taper fade straight bald is the only style we know I already regret it. I don't know if this is the right time to say it, I've never cut anyone's hair in my entire life. If you want to see the full, you know, uncut version of me brutalizing Elijah's hair, check it out on Floatplane. And if you're not subscribed, there has never been a better time. We're gonna be releasing every part of Scrapyard Wars a little bit early on the platform. And that's on top of all the incredible content we have cooking at lmg.gg/Floatplane. But wait, there's more. If you're itching for even more Scrapyard Wars goodness, Jawa has an entire giveaway campaign running right now. They gave us a sneak peek and I gotta say, you're gonna want to check it out for yourself. That's at the link below. Now back to the video. Sorry, I'm a little focused right now, but yeah, check it out. I appreciate him being focused. Oh my God, that's a lot of hair. I'm giving young Mike a buzz. What does that say? I don't want it to... This is R.I.P. Okay, good. I don't want it to be like white people can't read this or something. We're here at Valley Village. Linus gave me $50 in cash. I was tasked to specifically get him a hat. We'll see what embarrassing things I can put him in. This is the name BJ, but he wears socks with sandals at the office, so I don't know how much worse it can get. $13.99. I'm gonna go with this. I'm an adult, but not like a real adult. I think this one is more fitting of a boomer man with a daughter-in-law who's 23 years old. How much is this one? $7.99. It'd be really funny if we had a fedora. His head's kind of small, isn't it? Maybe we do have to go with a cap, then. I'll go with this one. It's very beige and sad. Pants are hard, 'cause the thing is, like, he's so short, so I think getting shorts is, like, the safer option here. Khaki might work. Like, he goes boating and fishing every once in a while. He sold his house for $3 million, even though he bought it for $150,000. It matches. Okay, we're good. You look like that could just be your haircut. Yes! I did it. And same with you. I just look like I got, you mentioned it. I think you said it well. I just look older and like I had some bad decisions. What do you mean, great decisions? Now look at your young man. Oh my god. He looks way different than I do. You don't look that different. You look older. We're hoping a hat is gonna be a big part of the sale. I haven't, I have not seen myself yet. To be fair, you look older as well. You just look a lot older. I feel like you've maybe got a bit of an advantage here because people will be like nice to the old grandpa trying to buy a computer for probably what I'm assuming you're gonna say is your like young daughter. Gosh, I never thought of that. Oh, you just gave him advice. No, trust me, he was gonna do it anyways. I'm on a PC for my grandson. Yes, yeah. Have you seen the neck going? Oh, not bad actually. I like that. Yeah, it's good. You should get neck tattoos. You know you can have hats from here, right? Oh. A pirate hook. What? Elijah, whose team are you on? You could also just wear a freaking helmet. You know what? That sells the look a lot. That I'm gonna leave and get in my car. No, you want to go with like... The Canadian flag. Canada. The Canadian flag's really good. This hat is definitely too small for me. I think it was a child-sized hat. You know what? Your laugh is so distinctive though. I gotta not laugh. Found any good deals? Yeah, actually. I didn't. I got no good deals. Nice. Alright, see you later. See ya. Hi there, honey, give me a kiss Not bad, huh? How's it going? I mean, how's it going young whippersnappers? My goodness, you young people, it's inspiring seeing y'all working so hard in here The visual change is actually, people won't recognize it, I think. I've seen the other team and they look very much like the other team. Look at that Colin unspeechless. Dad? Well, you have a hat, but I bought you a dad hat, okay, which also might work. We gotta go basically like immediately, so I'm just gonna throw this on. This is a shirt, it still had the tag on it. It doesn't really matter what it says because I grabbed you a sweater. I grabbed you a sweater as well. Okay, maybe we'll throw the sweater on. And then I grabbed you like khaki shorts cuz I wasn'tI didn't want to buy long pants and have them be too long because- Okay, you know, so good luck me. I made sure that they didn't have weird stains or holes on them. Okay, thanks. We are headed to Valoo Village or Value village to try to get the rest of my costume like the clothing portions of my costume. Elijah is off to go pick up the desk and potentially other things from some warehouse. I'm hoping he can come out with a desk and a chair. Now my eyes ain't what they used to be but I think we're I think we're gonna turn right up there. Is that right? All right what's this accent? Hold on, hold on let me try again. You should have gotten coaching from Gary. I don't think any of these beat the Canada hat. Am I close enough to the steering wheel? Oh am I in the lane right now? Yeah. Does it actually work? Yes. We just get this and then I can check what shirt I have in the car and just go with that. Yeah, that fits really nice, yeah. Well, this is it. Yep. First deal. Am I gonna pass? I hope so. If you just like look down, maybe. Hopefully he's taller than you, so. That's rich, coming from you. Am I gonna get away with this? The voice, you have to change the voice. Sorry. So we're, yeah, we're here to pick up the PC. Our success hinges on selling some of the components that we've bought. His name is John. Isn't that Linus? I didn't tell you this, but I'm $80 over budget. Do you think he's faking selling stuff? This listing is being reviewed. Did Luke report it? That would be quite the a***** move. Sorry for being difficult here.",

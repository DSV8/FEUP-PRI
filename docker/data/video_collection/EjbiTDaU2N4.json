    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Oh my goodness, you guys, I'm so excited. Today's video is gonna be so much fun. I partnered with Best Buy to showcase some of their e-bike and e-scooter options. They have so many available on their website, so if there's one that you're looking for, you can definitely find the right ride for you. These are the three that I have picked out today. Let's check 'em out, woo! (bright upbeat music) Now before we get into the bikes, let's check out this Segway Ninebot D40X. I love Segway Ninebot products, so I was super hyped to check this out, because what really makes it so unique is the scooter actually has an optional seat. You can remove it if you want, but I like to be able to sit and scoot. This has a high capacity battery, so we're going to get up to 23.6 mile range, with a max speed of 18.6 miles per hour. It's got three riding modes that you can switch between, eco, standard, and sport. Much like my electric car, this takes advantage of regenerative braking. So as you're riding, energy will be collected each time you brake and give you more power. You can even connect this to the Segway app to monitor your riding status, lock your scooter, and upgrade the firmware. This has been so much fun to ride around. Now I tried it both without the seat and with the seat, and I'm not gonna lie, I've never scootered with a seat on before, and this is way more fun than I actually thought it was gonna be. It's also got (bell dings) a little bell, which is very nice, and this does fold up. You won't be able to fold it with the seat on, but if you do keep this in the traditional scooter mode, you can fold it up, carry it, put it in your car very easily. The other thing that I really like is this connects to an app, so I was able to update the firmware. You can change different modes, and it also has a guard mode, so when I go into the grocery store, I can just turn this on, so when I come back, I'm just gonna slide to exit guard mode so I can continue my ride. (bright upbeat music) (upbeat music) This is the NIU BQI-C3 Pro. It's got a much different frame than the next one that I'm gonna show you, but it feels more like a traditional bike with its step over frame. But, of course, it's electric. This has swappable twin batteries that will take you up to 90 miles and up to 28 miles per hour in pedal assist. It has front and rear disc brakes, and has a front light with brake activated rear taillights for better visibility at night. I really like the frame of this e-bike, because it allows you to easily step over it. This LCD has a lot of options that you can customize and it's easily visible while riding. There's a lot of things that I like about this bike. I really like that I can just kinda like step into it. It does have kind of a normal bike seat. It's also got this little extended area here that you can attach things to. It has a thumb throttle, as opposed to having like a motorcycle, traditional throttle, like you gotta gotta go like that on the handlebars. There are two brakes which are easily accessible right here. Now to charge this, it does have two batteries and there's a key hole right here. Both of those batteries are locked into place. So when you do wanna charge it, the charger actually has a dual charger mechanism. It's like a little cable that will connect to both batteries at the same time so you don't have to worry about coming back, charging one, then charging the other. You can charge both of them at the same time and it has three different modes of pedal assist. So when you switch to pedal assist, there's little buttons right here that you can go up or down for the amount of pedal assist. So as you go higher, the more that you pedal, the faster that you're gonna go. And this thing goes so fast you can also turn it off. So if you go to zero, it'll treat it like a traditional bike, no electric boost, just normal pedal and that's fun and all, but pedal assist is where it's at. It actually shook me to my core the first time that I went on the pedal assist number three, I just like instantly went, I was zooming. (bright music) (upbeat music) Meet the Razor Rambler 20. This retro looking ride has a much different look than the new BQI-C3, but both are super fun to ride. This does have a heavier frame and a more motorcycle style look to it with its bench seat. This will let you cruise up to 16 and a half miles on a single charge and hits speeds up to 19.9 miles per hour. It has electric pedal assist and you can choose from five different power levels. I love that this has a super bright front headlight and the brake assist taillights are pretty cool too. This is really great because I love cruising to the beach for sunsets and it's always nice to have that extra visibility driving back. So I've been riding around with the Razor Rambler 20 and so many people have stopped to like ask about it. They're like, \"What kind of bike is that? What is that?\" It's such a unique look because it does have that more vintage motorcycle vibe and I really love that. Now this has a little throttle here on the handle so you basically, all you have to do is just turn backwards and it'll take off, which I'm not gonna do right now because we'll be kicking up sand. Now this has a little LCD right here and this is kind of interesting because it has two buttons and the LCD itself is actually a button. So when you press up and down, that will change the speed and the amount of pedal assist that you're gonna get. These tires are also super thick and they're way more industrial than just a regular little beach cruiser 'cause this is something that I feel like you could actually take on the beach. This is definitely much more of an adventure vehicle. It has such a bright front light and I took this to the beach the other day for sunset and on my way back, it was pretty much completely dark. So having this headlight not only helped me to see where I was going, but it also helped for other people to be able to see me. It also has the taillight, which when you're turning it'll automatically activate as a turn signal, so it'll start blinking to let people know that you're about to make a maneuver. I had so much fun checking out these three options of e-bikes and e-scooters from Best Buy. They have so many more to choose from. So if this is something that you're looking for for your summer ride, be sure to check out Best Buy because I promise you, you will find one that is right for you. I think I found mine, bye-bye.

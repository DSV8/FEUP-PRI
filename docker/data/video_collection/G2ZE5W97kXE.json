    "transcript": "You're behind the scenes already (awkward silence) You are rolling aren't you? I'm at Mcdonalds right now I-ma-I-ma about to show you possibly the most high-tech way in the world to create your own burger to customize your burger whether whether you like an old classic maybe maybe you've been a big mac guy mm-hmm. Maybe it's maybe we're all about the quarter pounder Oh my god! Uhh, no problem it's a nice-looking whatever that is. Or maybe you want to go with that new stuff, the signature stuff. Maybe you like a little bit of barbecue sauce- There's nothing wrong with that. And the best part for you tech heads you do it all yourself on this giant touch screen over here. To kick it off we could tap anywhere and then first things first you gotta select eat in or take out. For me i'm going to eat in today. How about with the class of Big Mac. I'll start with the big mac but i'm not i'm not gonna leave it stock because that will be boring. It's kind of like you're doing some kind of online shopping, but it's all happening right here. Now the best part is this edit button. You could change anything; see-see- for me for example I like to go easy on the max- up. Hit the minus button. Now I'm gonna have a little bit less. Onions I'll take a few extras. Pickles, cheese let's get crazy with the cheese. Maybe this is the ultimate Big Mac. Five slices of cheese. Oh, an extra patty. You could do that too! Maybe you want to do something different from a sauce perspective. Chipotle, BBQ, honey mustard, sweet chilli suck. Ryan over here he advised me I should stick to the secret sauce or i'm going to make a lot of people upset. So that's what I'm doing this case. Apply the changes. Now that big mac- my very own Big Mac, is now in the car. This is the signature crafted section and there's a few recipes that by default are recommended to you; maybe you're in a hurry, you just want some signature quick. The pico guacamole, Maple bacon grecian, and sweet barbecue with bacon. I'm gonna go with sweet BBQ. Now you're gonna notice an unusual bun over here the artisan role. Give a look at artisan roll. Look how beautiful- I'm going to select it. Why not? The patty itself- It could be beef. It be chicken. Could be grilled chicken! Crispy chicken! It's up to you. So I went with the classic beef but I'm not done. What we have for bacon? One bacon?! Na- It's not- It's not gonna cut it. Go up to three. What do we have here? One patty?! NO. We're gonna double it up. This is between you, and the touchscreen. You get to keep it between you and the touchscreen. Now the best part here is when you actually confirm your order. You're gonna get one of these guys right here. You never expected to get table service of Mcdonalds. those days are done because you can now. I put my little 62 in here. Enter. Go over to my table and they're gonna track me down. Maybe I just created the unbox therapy signature series; comeing to a McDonald's near you I'm actually gonna get this though right? Oh yeah! Okay sweet. Sweet. Sweet. I think you should keep that. You know, reference it. You know what that's a nice Instagram post right there. Right there! There's my- there's my Instagram post right there. We just got a spot. Yeah let's go. We should scout a good spot. That my friends is $23.000000000000 and two hamburgers. Did I set a record? Maybe. It's possible We might be able to finish these two. Ryan, you might have to help me out on this. All right what do we have to do now? Nothing absolutely nothing. There's some cool tech inside of there which helps them navigate the right order to the right table, so they know where i am better than I do. Take this home do they show up at your door Ryan? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHAHAHAHAHAHHHAA I guess it's radiofrequency I don't know. Can I open this up? Anybody have a screwdriver? Ryan you got a Phillips? Don't do this at your local Mcdonalds by the way. This is how they track you, and they're powered by a watch battery. Now, I was gonna find some tech to show you guys while I was here. I cracked open the thing because I wanted to see what was going on in it. Are you aware of what's happening in here? Bluetooth technology. Look at the extra cheese; and the extra patty. MMMMMHhhhhhhhhh -Certain kind of comfort in the Big Mac. Look we got some people. We got some- we got some fans out here. YO, turn the camera. check these guys out. You're on it man. Haha. MMMM. That is juicy. That's giving the big mac a run for his money. Go for the extra patty or two all right? Live a little bit. Official recommendation! Step your game up. Gold signature. Alright guys before i take off i had to show you this. There's wireless charging at this mcdonalds and apparently, I spoke some people they say it's gonna be rolling out more locations- you know I'm a huge fan wireless charging, right? But it's not Just stock wireless charging, like if your phone supports it; There's also these little pucks here, and they use magnets to connect to this section here- I don't know if you guys have seen as before I haven't, and this one's for iphone; This one is micro USB. Plug this guy and at the bottom your device and then just slide that over the wireless charged spot. Your charging! Now they'll never get rid of you over here. I got a VR headset here that's because this experience I just had, you can actually have that experience yourself through VR. So there's a link in the description this video where you can click on it go over there if you have a headset use that. Otherwise you can look around using your smartphone and you can see what my day was kinda like. So definitely recommend you go check it out. Thanks very much for watching guys and I'll catch you on the next one. Notice you might need some extra napkins. Unbelievable!",

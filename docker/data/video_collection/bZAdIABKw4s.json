    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is. In front of us is the future of the Mac. Toss your old PC in the garbage, it clearly can't hang anymore. Toss your old MacBook in the dumpster fire, because the M1 Macs are here. - I've been playing with this now for a little bit. And you know what? It feels exactly like a MacBook, and-- - (laughs) Wait, wait, is that your whole premise? - No. - It's a MacBook. It feels like a MacBook (laughs). - And I don't mean that in a negative way. - Okay, okay, go ahead, go ahead. - So in our last video, we talked about this. There's a lot of speculation of should you wait and get a MacBook now? Should you wait for the M1? Should you wait until the M2? You should 100% jump on the M1 MacBook bandwagon. I don't know. - Oh, it's a bandwagon at this point. - It's really good. - So right now we have three M1 Macs available. It's like almost scratched the back of the MacBook. - Stop damaging it's new stuff. - This is a 13-inch MacBook Pro. So we also have a MacBook Air. And that actually that model is only M1. So while you can still get the Intel models of the Mac mini, which is also available with M1 and the 13-inch Pro. If you wanna buy a MacBook Air now, they are purely M1 powered. - Yes. - Which is interesting, We have this shell removed. - Whoops. - Oops (laughs). I totally didn't lose that inside the system. (both laughing) - Here, you can have that back. - So as you can see, is I hide the thing I accidentally left inside, we have the MacBook opened up. So this seems to be somewhat similar though. It's actually, it is a bit different. So we have a single cooling fan. And then I'm assuming underneath here is our SSC, we have our batteries. Now of course surprising exactly, no one, there is no upgradeable component whatsoever on the inside of these new MacBooks, right? So we have, what I assume is probably our SSD in the controller. This seems to be our M1 chip here, I'm not even sure what's under this. I'm not gonna open it coz it's probably just generic labeling. So why should you buy an M1 MacBook? Well, there are a few reasons, but the main one is absolutely this. the M1 processor. - Yeah, it's-- - I caught it, I caught it, I caught it. Okay, continue your point as if nothing went wrong. (beep) - So the M1 MacBooks, aren't doing anything different than the Intel based MacBooks, but they're just doing it more efficiently. - So top line. The M1 Macs are significantly better in pretty much every way. So they have a lot in common with the iPad and the iPhone chips just significantly beefed up for Mac purposes. So we're talking about an eight core CPU, which will not only blow away pretty much all of the previous, like MacBook Airs and whatnot, but even rivals and beats in a lot of cases stuff like these 16-inch MacBook Pro, which requires significantly more power, more fans, heat... - This definitely beat my six, not 16, but it definitely beat my i9 - 15. - 15. Yeah. - Yeah. So now that you're getting more performance on the CPU side, you're also getting significantly better graphics chips, right? So the GPUs built into these systems are by most benchmarks, at least as good as something like the base 15-inch MacBook Pro, which again is a much larger, much more power hungry system. And you're doing it all with better battery life the entire time. Plus, because these are the ARM MacBooks, you have things like, okay look, so it's awake right now, Move it down here, close it, it's asleep. There's a train coming, I don't care, open it up instantly awake, there's no delay. It's just like your phone when you unlock it compared to a standard Mac, we have to open it up waiting three seconds, touch ID. There's so much about these, which are significantly better, better battery life, better performance, better security. And importantly, the app compatibility is all still here. So if you're familiar with the ARM transition on windows, essentially a lot of apps that they're not specifically made for ARM processors on the windows side can run, but they're running and backwards compatibility mode, it's slow, It's clunky, you can definitely see the difference. Here on the MacBooks, first of all, they have a great compatibility layer in Rosetta, which essentially does all the work and sort of translating all of the x86 code to ARM code so it will just run. But on top of that, because these chips are so fast, even running a lot of Intel based apps, it will run them faster than the old MacBooks would. Which is crazy town. - Yeah, so there are trade-offs to using these new MacBooks, which can be significant for some people, depends on your use case. The biggest one is the port selection. - Yeah. - Every time you do something with that. Like what are you doing? - I'm showing off the ports Matt, see, like everyone can see the ports right now. They're so incredible. - Thank you. - You'll never believe how great they are in every way. They're wonderful. Just incredible. - There are two - Just beautiful. - USB 4 ports, which are backwards compatible with Thunderbolt 3. Unfortunately you're losing two ports compared to the previous MacBook Pro. - USB 4 is essentially is just Thunderbolt 3 is the best way to think about it. It's actually not quite the same, but USB 4 incorporates all of the functions of Thunderbolt 3, which include things like power in, video, backwards compatibility with older USB. Like these, essentially it's the same, right? You've got the same sort of functionality, except that on these are MacBooks. There are a couple of limitations specifically in that you can no longer connect an external GPU. Now that may change at some point in the future. But besides that you plug into like your 6K XDR display, all of the USB-C accessories, dongles, all of that stuff should just work as if it is a completely normal MacBook. - So the reasoning behind losing those two ports is actually because the ARM architecture has less PCI lanes than the X86. - The way they've built the M1, I assume an M1 X would probably solve that. - So that's like, that, that's really the, what it comes down to it. The port selection. - There will almost certainly be a M1 X, - Right. - Which is like a 12 core something which can go in something like a 16 inch MacBook or an iMac, or who knows even maybe a four port version of the Pro if you wanna get a little bit more performance, because one of the nice things about these chips is that while they're incredibly powerful, they're also very power efficient, right? So you look at something like the MacBook Air, which we will actually have in shortly. So again, make sure you're subscribed, but the MacBook Air runs without a fan, right? - Completely fan less, - Which makes sense, because you think about the iPad, right? The iPad pro has tons of power and that has no fan it's even thinner, right? So even something like the MacBook Air, like the difference between all of these M1 Macs is very minimal. The only real difference in performance with the fan is when you get into long intensive tasks, right? So say you're doing a long video editor, you're doing a lot of rendering or you're playing a game or something. Only then will these fans kick on. And that's where, you'll see a little bit of a difference in performance from like the Air to the Pro. But for most people, that's not going to be a regular use case. And even then even with the fan cranking at 100% you're not getting that much more for performance, right? These are very, very power sipping chips. - One of the main reasons I love the iPad so much is one it's super small, - Of course. - But then I can use it for hours and hours and hours on a single battery life, charge. And that's what I'm excited for for this. So I'm, you're kind of getting the best of both worlds. I would have loved to seen like the 12-inch return for one of these chips, but this is I think a really good compromise. - Sure. - Just meet something I wish that that Apple would have done is do one on either side of it. - Oh, so one Thunderbolt, one Thunderbolt like the Razer, the Razer Book? - Yeah. Yeah. It just, it makes things a little bit more ergonomic, you know, plus I, I dock my, my system a lot. - Yeah. - So now I pretty much have to dock it upside down, which is not to be great for airflow to, in order where it's on my desk, it's nitpicking. But like, I just, you know, if you're only gonna have two, I wish they would have done on either side. - Yeah, yeah. Apple's gotten a lot of Oop over the last few years for selling Macs that would thermal throttle they would run really hot. They would be obviously really taxing. And now that we've seen the performance of the M1 max, it is really clear that they were designing for these all along. They're designing super thin, super sleek devices. The Intel processors that were inside were simply too hot and too inefficient to be able to deliver that level of performance without needing the fans to be cranked up to 100% You look at a cooling solution like this, right? Single fan one heat pipe, very, very minimal, but this is more than sufficient to cool the chip inside this MacBook. It's like the designs for these MacBooks over the last few years, we're ready for the M1. - Right. - The M1 and the software weren't ready for the Macs yet. - And I mean, you talk about the fan and efficiency. So while running Cinebench, the fan didn't kick on until like five minutes into the, into the test. So, you know, running the full multicore stress test. - Yeah. - It just, it was fine. I think the biggest improvement for people are gonna be those who actually use the Mac, the Apple apps already. So Final Cut. I think we'll get a big, should, should get a big update with this. I think that Logic will get a big update with this, where it's gonna be interesting to see how much of an improvement this is, is on something like Adobe, where it's not first party. - It's running in a compatibility. So a lot of apps are being updated to be native on Apple Silicon, but I believe something like Premier is running under Rosetta. It's just the normal entail version. And even though I know it's maybe a touch glitchy, I've still seen some people run benchmarks and it's actually faster on this than on the completely dedicated Intel version. So, you know, once the update is going to be even better. I just think if you look at the current line, the Air is the no-brainer, right? Very few people I think will be better served spending the extra money on the Pro because really the only major differences are, it's a little bit thicker, you get a little more battery, you get a slightly brighter screen and you get the fan which can be helpful. But generally speaking, if you're not spending tons of time video rendering and even then it's not gonna be huge difference. The Mac mini is its own league. I feel like it is very inexpensive. It is a perfect little video editing box. Like I just assumed that like when I was 16, 17, first when I had a video edit. If I could have spent six, $700 saved up that kind of money for a Mac mini, it would have completely changed my life. And I honestly think that given the performance that we're seeing with these M1 chips with something like Final Cut that a little Mac mini editing box could be all you need. But, but, but it is not quite that simple for everyone because we have to keep in mind, these are the entry-level Macs. You cannot outfit them with more than 16 gigs of RAM. - And since one of the trade-offs that we were talking about before you noticed that there are no SO-DIMM slots on here whatsoever. So with these M1 chips, the RAM is actually part of the chip that... - It's probably like right here. - Yeah. Again, because of just the efficiency of, and, you know, everything being built for this, like Big Sur is built for the M1 chip every, at every level it's optimized in every aspect. - Yeah. - So that's just, I think what a lot of people fail to kind of get their heads around. - The thing is with the M1, right? These cores, they have four of the Firestorm cores, the high-performance cores. Those cores are the most powerful cores on anything full stop period. I'm not talking about like for performance per watt or whatever. I'm saying if you throw a single threaded workload at one of these cores, it will perform as good, if not better than your overclocked core i9, your Ryzen 9 5950X. And that's like, considering that you've got like crazy clock speeds and like 50 Watts and all this kind of craziness, right? Obviously when you get into multicore workloads, if you have a 64 core thread ripper, it is going to beat this. But if you're talking about single core, like individual core workloads, this tiny MacBook is now the most powerful CPU core on the face of the planet at this, this little thin, right? That's all you need. - With something like this. You just don't need that crazy amount of like your desktop PC. Look, it looks so overkill now. - But the MacBook doesn't have RGB. - It doesn't have RGB. So this, that's why this can't get that. That's the only reason that you can't game on a Mac is because it doesn't have RGB. - If you were in the market for a new MacBook, especially the Air. But any of these Macs I think are solid wins, huge performance leaps that we see once every generation, right? I mean that in like this is a huge, huge leap. Now, if you are a professional workflow person, buzzword, you may wanna hold off. But I think the only reason to hold off is to see what that M1 X chip looks like. There will be powering something like a 16-inch MacBook or an iMac, or of course, something like the Mac Pro. They will ultimately deliver even more performance with something like more ports. - This will 100% become my new daily driver. - I've already broken it, but you're welcome to take it anyway.

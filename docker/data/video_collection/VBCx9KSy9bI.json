    "transcript": "- This f**king thing. Ah! Oh shit, I got pooped on by a bird! Gross! What a terrible experience this has been! Hello, short-circuiters. Today we have the new kick scooter. These guys emailed us and I said, \"No, I don't want to unbox this thing. 'Cause it looks like it's a kick scooter that doesn't have a throttle.\" Well, it turns out it does have a throttle, So it won't be miserable like some of the other scooters I've tried. And now I'm really stoked on it. Total range of, what was it? - [Jono] 50 kilometers - 50 kilometers range, And I think 5 hours for a full recharge, which does seem a bit long. Wow, it smells like a new, something. So you can get in here a little. David, make sure you see all the stuff. What do we got? What do we got here? The recharger. Ah. What else have we got? Okay, little Hex wrench or Allen key. And I'm not sure what this is, is this for like inflating the tires? Some screws. Charging information, they use altitude is not more than 5,000 meters. I don't think that's going to be much of a problem. We're at sea level. All right. Making a mess. How do I? oh yeah. It's just all one unit. Okay. Oh man, I'm not sure how I was supposed to take that out, but this is a bit awkward. It's out now. [Jono] It has a bell? Uh, a bell. Yes, it does have a bell. Hey, this is like a safety thing. Hit that bell. Subscribe if you're not already. Oh, what is this? Okay. Maximum load 100 kilograms. Do not put one foot on the pedal or ground when riding. It is prohibited for several people to ride at the same time or to take a child while riding. Why is it called the kick scooter if you're not allowed to put your foot on the ground, that doesn't make sense. So how do you think this goes on? Bring this up, like that, and now uh huh, you got to connect this bad boy. I feel like it's the 90's and I'm supposed to plug my mouse into this. Okay. There we go. And ah, and oh, this is probably what those bolts are for. Here we go. Beautiful. Some assembly required, but it's really not so bad. I've had to assemble entire e-bikes and it takes much longer than this. I prefer E-bikes that has got like a thread lock on it. Is there like a manual? People joke about like, oh, let's throw out the instruction manual, but you really should read it. Okay. Good enough for now. Check it out. It's got a tiny, tiny, adorable kickstand. There's regenerative braking. Very nice. Yeah. And of course there is a disc brake. Is there one on the front? Oh yeah. There is. The front is where most of your braking power comes from at least on a bike and probably on aa scooter as well. So let's do the peel, do the peel. I'm sorry. Oh No. Oh this is oh no, no, no, no. What is this? Is this a compartment that opens up? We'll go outside real quick here. And I'll like go around the parking lot, but I'm going to ride around on this for a week or two to really put it through the paces, bring it to the gym, you know, show off. We still got some peels right here. Peel, peel. Oh, it's got a light on it. How did I not even notice that. That's awesome. We've got a little cable management thing as well. And let's turn this sucker on. Is there a key, oh, attention, right? There's an app. I don't like the idea that I have to connect an app to make my scooter work for example. And I'm hoping that I don't have to. A bunch of writing that I can't read. There's a, oh my God. I've wanted brake lights on my bike for so long. That is awesome. It works with both brakes. That's so cool. Well, there's no manual, so I don't know what I'm supposed to do other than check the QR code. I guess this is not, this is not the webpage you are looking for. Uh, I beg to differ new, I guess the app's not available yet. - [Jono] I wonder if you have to like, just go outside and start kickin'? Oh, maybe you do have to start kicking. Oh, you were right. I think I can hear the disc brakes rubbing a little bit. Get a close up on that noise. Hang on. Without a helmet. Hashtag don't try this at home. Whew. Well, here we go. Hmm I thought it went faster than this. Well, I guess this is my life now. Yeah, this is 15. Wait, it's supposed to go to 25. - It's probably in the app. - Yeah. Don't tell me, I have to use the app to unlock the last 10 kilometers an hour. And Jono has escaped with a scooter. Never to be seen again. All right. I've been riding around for a while, but before I tell you about it, today's video is brought to you by Manscaped Their lawnmower 4.0, offers intelligent functionality and an incredibly comfortable grooming experience. The new wireless charging system removes the need to bring cables with you and is compatible with most Qi charging pads. It has ceramic blades with skin safe tech, reducing nicks and cuts. It's cordless, waterproof, and gets 90 minutes of use on a full charge. Get 20% off plus free international shipping using code \"circuit\" below. Okay. Wow. I really like this thing, but as I suspected, it does require the app to unlock top speed. And that's like my number one gripe about it. And the number one reason why I personally wouldn't buy it, but everything else about it is amazing. The construction is really high quality. It's got all these safety features like this light is always on and also look, I hit it twice and the headlight is actually quite bright and it actually shows you where you're going. This hex wrench it comes with is a cheap piece of crap. Don't use it. It's stripped itself just on these four screws. I can't even screw this one in all the way anymore. I really actually like that you have to start going a little bit before the thumb stick will work as a throttle. Cause otherwise I could just be standing here and do this and whoa, it's going to Gallop away on me. That's also a really great safety feature. Oh, here's, check this out. We figured out what this is about. Oh, Tadaa! You can carry that stairs and stuff. Isn't that great. You didn't know about that. - [Jono] No There's a little bit of wear and tear on the scooter from where I've been. I don't know, putting my feet on it. It's just a cosmetic thing. I'm not so sure how waterproof it is. They say, don't ride it in the rain and don't ride it in more than two centimeters of water, which is reasonable. But it rains half the year in Vancouver. And speaking of Vancouver, the laws in British Columbia say that you cannot ride an electric scooter on the road or sidewalk. So where can you ride it? By the way, any footage you see of me riding this on the road is Photoshop. Definitely. I did not do that. It's not legal. Speaking of not legal, this thing, once you do finally unlock it with the app, it can go 32 kilometers an hour for you Americans. That's 20 miles an hour. That's really quite fast. Any more than that is going to be dangerous because you don't have a seat, you know, stabilizing you. You're supposed to keep both hands on the handlebars. So you can't really signal. It feels stable. It feels centered. Like I love everything about this except for the app. And this is going to be the new standard by which I judge all other electric scooters. Do you trust some Chinese company you've never heard of with your data because it needs Bluetooth, it needs your location, and it needs a wifi connection to work. You can't even like transfer ownership of this thing unless you have the app and you have to disconnect from the app so that you can reconnect to another app replacement parts and your warranty stuff. Like all that info is in the app. And I bet that if you call in and say, oh, I'm having some trouble with my scooter, that they're going to require you to use the app, to like get the diagnostic information. I used a burner phone to connect to this thing because I just, I don't trust weird apps on my phone. By the way, the app requires you to watch a safety video and travel for two kilometers at a low speed before unlocks the full speed. If you don't care, then sure go for it. But it makes me very uncomfortable. And frankly, I'm not going to review another scooter or electric vehicle that requires an app ever again because (beep) that. I also had some problem with like Bluetooth connectivity and then a bird pooped on me. No network connection, (indistinct) no network connection, This (beep) thing. Ah! Oh (beep) I got pooped on by a bird. Gross! What a terrible experience. This has been. There's no footage of the actual poop, but like, why would you want to see that it did happen. Hill climbing? It's good. I could go up one of the bridges nearby at like 25 kilometers an hour. It, it really doesn't struggle with it too much. It's got some torque to it. You cannot see the screen in broad day light. It's you just it's, it's dangerous to even try to look at it. Cause you got like, like, like cover it up with your hand to be able to see, check this out. When you turn it on, it goes to 88 miles an hour. - [Jono] I can't see (beep). - Screen's not great. They say that the maximum range is 50 kilometers. I didn't manage to figure out how far I'd gone on a single charge. But I think it's probably pretty close to that. The faster you go, the more you're going to burn through the battery. I did not have battery range anxiety. Like if it runs out of battery, it's not fun. You're not going to be going very fast and probably you'll just end up walking with it. And then, and then scootering downhills. They say that this is like a last mile transportation thing Anyway. I can totally see this being really useful to take on the sky train. But like you can't bring it to the gym. I tried that. And guess what? There's no place to hook up a bike lock so you can't leave it outside. So you got to leave it inside. And then I couldn't get through the rotating doors. What are you going to do with it when you get to where you're going? With, like the boosted board, it's small enough that you can just carry it with you. This thing is, is just a little bit too big. I don't know how heavy it is. I gotta, I gotta weigh this. I forgot to weigh it. Oh, there's a, there's a locking feature. First off. I need to crap. It's not connected. No, I don't want to do that. I swear. No there's supposed to be a little Bluetooth icon here. This is supposed to, oh my gosh. It was there under no internet access. Did you see that? It was invisible. Okay. All right. So the app is not finished yet. Anyway, you click the lock button and now somebody tries to steal it it freaks out and, and the, the electric brake is engaged to maximum. I can hardly move this thing. And the region braking is great because it keeps you safe on hills. This is not even on Indiegogo, yet. So if you know anything about how crowdfunding can go, this will not necessarily be the one that ends up being the final product. I don't know. So just be careful with that. I think the super early bird special is 500 bucks for this normal price is 700 bucks. I personally wouldn't buy it. I don't know. What's the conclusion Jono? - [Jono] Buyer beware? - Don't ride like this. This is very irresponsible. All right, guys, thank you for watching. Subscribe to short circuits, leave a comment, and check out some of my older videos. I just did one on the monogram creative console, but for electric bikes, I don't know. I still ride the rad mini, but we've got some more electric vehicle bikes coming up soon if they don't get stuck in shipping 'cause of COVID. So see you later.",

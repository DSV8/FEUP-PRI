    "description": "Intel claimed a lot of things when their 9th Gen mobile processors were launched but now that they're actually available, its time to see if these CPUs are really worth it.  Or should you just buy an 8th gen model on sale?  To test the claim we put the i7-8750H against the i7-9750H in a real apples to apples comparison review in the Gigabyte Aero 15 gaming notebook for battery life, performance, gaming and more!

    "transcript": "hey everyone Eber here with Hardware Canucks and Intel announced the ninth generation mainstream mobile processors a little over a month ago and while there isn't a significant architectural shift with these new lineup they did manage to tweak a few things here and there and of course add some more CPU options that Rock some wicked specs now we're all aware of Intel's processor release schedule I mean on the mobile side of things it's a bit confusing especially with whiskey lake and now ice lake rolling into the mix it just gets way too confusing for the consumers out there but if you look at the mainstream like high-performance lineup on the notebook space I think the biggest shift in that space was obviously with the introduction of the eighth generation processors because when you roll back a couple years ago the biggest or popular the most popular CPU option was the core i7 7700 HQ it was a fork or 830 CPU that was plenty enough for a lot of tasks but as soon as Intel announced those new Inc generation CPUs those two extra cores those four threads it was a huge benefit in terms of multi-core performance for video editing and of course a lot of other workloads that could that could take advantage of those two extra cores and now we're here with these new nine generation processors and it actually got me thinking what percentage improvement are you actually getting out of these new processors in certain workloads let's find out but first a quick message from our sponsor the new razor blade still defines portability without compromising on performance featuring Intel's latest agent CPU and NVIDIA MX 150 GPU up to 16 gigabytes of memory and up to 13 hours of battery life experience some of the most popular games wherever you are learn more about the blade stealth down below alright so let me set the stage for you guys before I hop into the performance segment you're gonna be finding these new 9 generation high performance mobile processors in a lot of gaming laptops as well as professional workstation notebooks because they still use the same 40 nanometer architecture just like the K generation CPUs what's really new with this lineup is the support for new things like Wi-Fi 6 support for Intel's new octane memory H 10 up to 128 gigabytes of ddr4 ram support versus 64 gigabytes on H end models and most notably it's the introduction of the core i99 a thk and the 98888 core 16 threaded CPUs and if you're interested in learning more about the new lineup you can check out our explained video right over here I should also mention the D core i7 8950 HK from last year was an overclockable CPU that was the flagship mobile processor at the time so the nitrogen offering Intel is offering two additional course without compromising on overclocking capabilities now the primary difference between the 98 a th K and the 98 a th is that the HK variant is an overclockable chip and you'll find that in a lot of desktop replacement notebooks now the 98 a th will be found out a lot of relatively thin and light performance notebooks like the gigabyte air or 15 which I also got a chance to take a look at at Computex and that one will have a little bit or would have some limitations as to achieving those clock speeds but at the same time it's not overclockable like the HK intel has also implemented something called thermal velocity boost on these new CPUs and essentially it gives these new chips an extra hundred megahertz boost provided that thermals are under control and again this is all depending on how OMS decide to cool these new processors but today my friends weren't gonna be taking a look at the core i7 9750 H and compared to the 8750 H now luckily I happen to have the gigabyte Aero 15 X featuring the H n CPU and big gigabyte 15 classic featuring the new 9 gen CPU they both have the exact same hardware with the same amount of memory in dual channel as well as the RT X 2070 max Q so pretty much an identical notebook so you're gonna see it's sort of like an apples to apples comparison with these new processors so that way I can sort of tell and give you guys you know if you're actually gaining a certain percentage improvement over a gen now what the 9750 H Intel has enabled something called partial overclocking and that means that it can be boosted for up to 400 megahertz provided to the OEM allows for it resulting in frequencies reaching 5 gigahertz now in my case I wasn't able to see those clock speeds at least on the arrow 15 classic obviously the cooling hardware isn't really capable of that but it's pretty cool I mean if OMS the side to kind of somehow figure out to cool those six core 12 thread CPUs and at the same time being able to achieve those five Baker's speeds that would be awesome now the primary difference between the 9750 H and the 8750 H is that the base boosts clocks are slightly higher you also get more cash more memory support and of course the new things that I talked about earlier and that's about it so with that out of the way let's get into the performance segment starting with some synthetic and we'll world tests and as you can see with Cinebench r15 and blender there isn't a significant difference between the two CPUs but in Geekbench four I didn't notice a substantial improvement with both single core and multi core performance and that's probably because of those higher clock speeds moving on to video editing performance I took this 30 minute 4k project exported it to the YouTube 4k preset using Adobe Media encoder and I noticed a pretty interesting improvement would be ninth generation CPU as you can see the 9 gen took about 10 minutes and 22 seconds to render compared to 30 minutes and 40 seconds with GA generation processor and I think that's primarily due to the higher bass blues clocks on the United 750 H moving on to game II performance and this is exactly what I expected I didn't notice a substantial or a significant improvement between the ancient and the ninth gen in fact they were pretty much the same with both you know 3d mark firestrike apex legends overwatch battlefield 1 and of course doom now even though the GPUs in these notebooks are technically identical there's absolutely no way to determine if they're operating at exactly the same frequencies at the exact same time frames even with that built into the results in gaming at least the GPU becomes the bottleneck which makes both these CPUs perform almost identically and my last test was to compare battery life and as you can see there is a bit of a difference between the 9750 H and the 80s and oth especially in the heavy workload scenario as you can see there is almost a 12% reduction between the two and I think that's most likely to be higher clock speeds on the newer 19 processor so there you guys have it the numbers really do speak for themselves it's not like we're getting a significant percentage improvement with a 90 cent of th compared to the 80 cent 50h unless in certain workload scenarios those slightly higher base boosts clocks do come Andy but for other tasks like gaming it doesn't really make a difference but I want to hear your thoughts on these new najin CPUs if you're in the market for a gaming laptop would you actually consider you know going for a 9 generation CPU or a discounted ancient notebook because a lot of them I mean I do see a lot of them floating around for a really good deal so yeah let me know your thoughts about that in the comments down below I mean we're with Hardwick UNIX thank you so much for watching make sure to check out certain relevant content over here subscribe to our boot sequence channel I'll see you guys in the next one",

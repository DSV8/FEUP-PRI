    "transcript": "Our editor Emily just picked up this sick campervan, but she's got one small problem. Not a single gaming PC in sight. But fear not, for DJI hath sponsored our effort to transform her mobile grass-touching machine into the greatest RGB-ified, ray-tracing, corner-camping campervan that has ever existed. Of course, it's not going to be easy. You see, computers. Constantly get destroyed in transit and the PCs in here are going to be permanently in transit meaning We're gonna have to get very creative if we want to build a setup that is still gonna work after Thousands of kilometers down only sometimes paved Canadian logging roads Like any self-respecting gamer couple, Emily and her SO expect to be able to play at the same time which means that our systems are going to have to be extremely efficient without putting out too much heat given the relative space constraints which by the way aside from power and heat space is clearly at a premium now an obvious solution to this would be to use laptops but come on guys this is Linus Tech Tips dammit so we're gonna need some full fat PCs and maybe a projector setup for some casual movie watching huh yes our original plan was to take advantage of both of these chairs right here so they can just swivel around we've got a table right here and it should be very great for space only problem is yeah not only does this one kind of struggle with clearance issues both with this table our mount and the door but if i could get it turned all the way around i would have nowhere to put my feet other than here because of the fridge that's under this bench moving that not the easiest but that's no problem we've got lots of gaming chairs kicking around we're just gonna put one of these in here and i think i have a better idea when we first looked at this this bed was just a bed but now it is Come on. Also a couch. Now all we need is a table. Hey, look at that. Now we just need somewhere to put the PC. Okay, now my understanding is you guys have actually designed something in SOLIDWORKS, right? Yes. Can we take a look? Yeah. Very cool. So what I'm looking at is intakes on the front, two machines side-by-side, almost desk PC-like, and then we've got what appears to be some kind of vent or shroud at the back. That's for the power supplies. And on the bottom, we have vibration dampers. Do you know what the best part is though? Whoa! It'll be all locked up right in here. And here it is. That looks great! Did we do that on the Avid CNC? Oh yeah. Looks beautiful! All right, all we got to do is put some computers on it. Divide and conquer? You do one? I do the other? I can't believe the kind of hardware we went with for these. We're going 7800 X3D. We're talking eight of the fastest gaming cores on the planet. We've got these super cute mini ITX B650 boards from ASRock. Speaking of, do these have EDP out? Is that what I'm looking at on the back here? \"Graphics output 1 HDMI 1 EDP.\" That is so cool! So you can output to like a laptop monitor that doesn't have its own built-in scaler. Just go straight to it. Also got an M.2 slot back here for a total of two. We've gone with 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 which has probably got you guys thinking, \"Gee Linus, that's a pretty normal gaming PC so far.\" What exactly is it that makes this thing camping? Ah, well. Aside from going with the 3D vCache version of our Ryzen 7 CPU, which is lower TDP and is therefore going to consume less power and kick out less heat, we've also gone with this Cooler Master 1100 watt 80 plus platinum power supply, small and efficient, and we've gone with, okay, I know it's controversial, but an RTX 4060 Ti. Is it the best bang for the buck? No. But it- Is it the best efficiency for the buck? If not, it's close. It's efficient. It's very close. Let's not put in the buck bit. Hold on a second, Alex. You told me to mount my IO facing this way, but you mounted your IO facing the other way. Well, the GPUs have to go here and here. That makes sense. Here's an idea. I found some 6/32 thumb screws and we could kind of go his and hers with it. Now it's time for our GPU, but I have to assume that the fans go up, right? Correct. Good. So, how is that gonna work? 'Cause the slots like that. So, if you look at these holes, they correspond to the ones in our backplate. Oooooh! So, it's getting hard mounted, straight to this, not going anywhere. It was actually super easy to do this. We used our 3D scanner to just 3D scan this. Boom, chucking in the SolidWorks, done. Thank you, Winescan. Wait, you're screwing right into the cooler of the GPU through the backplate? Yes. What about the PCI-E riser? Oh, it goes through here. Yeah, so it goes up. Down, around, and then in. I'd ask you have a better idea, but it's way too late for that. Uh, maybe not the spring-loaded boy? I think those ones are fine, but the ones in the center around the die, we are not touching. You're stressing me out, Alex. You do realize that, right? Why are you stressed? Because you are stressing me out. I'm sorry, was I not explicit enough? This is a flawless plan. They were going to execute flawlessly, just like that line. You hear that little GPU? You're about to get execluted. Are these washers just to stack up so they're not too long? What? No! I don't think you know what you're doing. How are we supposed to screw these in? Oh, and you didn't do the thermal pad. Oh, right. Sorry. My bad. That's the problem. The thermal pad is not really serving a thermal purpose. It's more just an anti-vibration pad. Not that it really matters in this case. I do have to say I am incredibly impressed by how well this lines up. What? I only got two hands. Well, it's not going anywhere. And like I've seen so many times like this is attached to a bracket and this is attached to something else and next thing you know your GPU is on the side of the road out of the FedEx truck. Sure. Yeah. Anyway. Not going to happen here. I have to tape my PCIe extension. We're going to be taping kind of all of our cables. We don't want over a long amount of time the vibrations of the truck rubbing that thing against this. That goes a little something like that. There we go. Do we want to test it here or do we want to just throw it in the van and hope for the best? Oh we throw it in the van. We hope for the best. All right. Let's do that. Okay. I can see why the futon conversion doesn't go that smoothly. This hole looks like they cut it with their teeth. You know Emily there's a such thing as a ruler. Look at this cool power supply bracket. This is awesome. How is this made? Is this just 3D printed? Yeah just 3D printed. 2200 watts in what is I mean basically about the size of a regular ATX power supply. Oh god this is really cramped. Yeah so I need to go left a bit. Yeah I see that. Power switches. Okay all right I got you I got you. Okay well we've got dual 120 millimeter AIO's from Corsair. Chalk full of RGB. This is gonna look sick. This is gonna look ridiculous. Yup. Sick-diculous. Wait I noticed Emily inherited more things that were supposed to be from my minivan. These expensive cables that Alex ordered. These are trippy. I asked for more of those for your minivan, and you're like, \"Eh, I don't need them.\" Oh. DisplayPort and USB, and then the USB-C on the other side kind of thing? Super cool. So it allows you to run a USB-C, so like a DisplayPort Alt Mode display, off of a regular DisplayPort GPU. So we're going to have just one cable going to our monitors. It's awesome. My badminton grip-wrapping skills are coming in handy here. We really could have done this more easily. I don't know about you guys, but I think this is going great. Same. LTT, where jank meets, you know, that's kind of awesome. Not bad! Now all we gotta do is stuff it down! I guess before we do that, should we put on the coolers and just like make sure it works? Sure. Why are AIOs a good idea in a space like this? They're an okay idea in this space. You can definitely get more cooling for the amount of height that we've got above the CPU socket here, right? Like you can see if this was down flat in order for us to have our countertop on top of it we've only got about this 120 millimeter fan which you might think okay means well sure you could have a 120 millimeter cooler but not really right because you got to have heat pipes and stuff sticking out of there so This allows us to get way more cooling surface area on the cpu socket than we could otherwise have there's that but also Vibrations was a really big consideration. How do we power this? I noticed that this extension cable does not do anything. Do you remember who our sponsor is? Yeah, DJI DJI. Oh Lordy I Do see them be some lead acid batteries suckas inverter solar charger all of that junk We are going to leave it because some of the systems we just want to know for sure will just run and not be our fault if they stop working But this will power the computers this will be like the computers the RGB all of the fun stuff coming off of this cool So we could just turn it on then I assume. Yeah All right, let's try and fire them up. Oh that looks flippin awesome. This is sick So legit, what is a ZenScreen? This isn't gaming is it? you It isn't technically gaming, but also it's 1600p and 120 Hertz, so Might as well be gaming. So it's a portable monitor Yep, right, but also you've got a stand for it. Yeah, that's just like a quarter inch So you could kind of mount this on anything. Yeah, very cool. Wow. Okay, cool. It's got inputs on both sides That's legitimately really handy for a portable monitor. I mean, you know how display port is it probably won't work So I'm gonna reboot it Just hold on, just hold on. It looked like it was working. If what we were trying to do was get the screen to restart over and over again. Hey mission accomplished. Wow, that looks great Yeah, and we hot glued down the spacers so that you don't have to worry about them moving around as we put all the stuff in I guess we figured out the GPU priority output issue. Do you want to know what the problem was? Bio setting? Someone didn't put the PCIe riser in all the way You built that one. No, you built that one. No, you built that one. Oh look, I definitely that's my tacit tape job right there. No, I built that one. No, I built this one right here. This is without a doubt my riser. I may not have a counter to that. Oh yeah, no, this is definitely mine. You didn't take off your peel. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Easy fix. Yeah, that's great. I've been tasked with extending the length of the power button lead on one of the systems because right now he no reach But rather than going and finding exactly these colors of wires in this gauge. I found a dead power supply So I'm gonna hack it together Haha All right, we're good. We have two computers and they both work. I shouldn't have given him this side quest. We have a lot of actually important things to do in that van. I'm having fun Not my finest work. But realistically if Alex wanted my finest work, he wouldn't ask me on a Friday. We are now roughly like 40% through the time that we have with Linus and we have gotten this You say that like it's a bad thing. I'm having fun. Yeah, I'm having fun Can we finally have the fun of looking at the projector? Yeah, sure. That sounds great. Heck yeah We can't do it any worse than this bed mechanism. So I think we got this. Yeah, look you can look at our mechanism Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's suitably adequate. Oh, where's it go? Oh, that's why there's a leg. Hey Oh, how you doing? Oh, oh, hey, that's pretty No way We use the magnetic cable management and look how solid that is That is freaking awesome Oh Man, I love it. Okay, so this is gaming desk lands slash Whoa, that is not secured to anything. I guess this is what we're doing. Yes Nice. Oh, this is cute. This is that little BenQ projector, right? Yeah 1080p small Auto keystone auto focus and I love this 3d printed mount for it. Did you guys use the 3d scanner for this again? We did it's like perfect though. Yeah, it has no right to be this perfect. So basically it's just gonna go up here We bolt that in And we're G2G. Is this plugged into the DJI? Is it ready to power on? Yep. Oh hi. Yeah, she's she's doing great She's doing great. Yeah, it's uh, it's not laser which is good, but it is bright. Oh, it comes with a little streaming stick so about that the first thing you have to do when you open this up is take the side off and just Jam the streaming stick inside of it and that's how you get a smart projector Please don't make me hold this while you log into Google Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, bud. Oh, yeah, bud. Oh, she's in there. She's great. Hold on. Hold on She's great like you're saying yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was saying. That was the demo I was doing All right, I am happy with it It's actually not that bad in a perfect world What you would do in a situation like this is you would either use an ultra short throw projector But we couldn't really do that because it would have to be here or what you would do is you would use a mirror So you use a higher end projector you'd bounce it off the one side and then we're not doing that So that's the size of their screen This is cool though, because I guess the idea here is that when we want the gaming setups We just pop the monitor arm onto it. Yeah, and it just what? Locks into place somehow and there's a little screw the screws kind of annoying perfect. Okay And then when we don't want it we just put the little cover on and I guess we would do that whenever we want To fold the table up. Yeah, so we just actually took the bottom of this stand And just screwed it in right there. Oh It's not the dumbest thing. Well, that's the goal, right? Yeah, you don't want to build the dumbest thing unless that's what you set out to do. That's on there and height adjusts Are you mangling it? It doesn't pivot but it tilts. I mean anything pivots if you push it hard enough. Realistically 99% of the time they're probably just gonna use the little built- in flippy stand but hey at least we thought of this. This is really starting to come together isn't it? Yeah it's not too bad. Is there a plan to keep this up here? Uh there's a couple of different things we could do. So that's a long way of saying no. Yes. These things are legitimately extremely flexible. You can use them for on-site power, which is obviously what we're doing with them. But if you only need something like that, very occasionally, they can also operate in UPS mode, which is as simple as just plugging it in and. Leaving it plugged in with all of your devices running off of the DJI Power 1000 in the event of a power outage, it switches fast enough that even something like a connected computer won't experience the loss of power. And it also has quiet charging and dual 140 watt type-c ports that can charge two 16-inch MacBook Pros to 50% in just 30 minutes. Pretty cool. You're really not going to like a plan for mounting these. We're just gonna screw these into the floor and then strap them down. Well, I was planning on going into these 2x4s, but... Okay, so what, we're doing this by hand then? We probably should pre-drill it. I hate you so much. I don't hate you, actually. That's good. I genuinely like you. Not right now. Is that secured, that thing up there? What thing? That thing on the thing. Oh, okay, cool. Yeah, if it falls, it'll probably hurt. Okay, no, no, I'll have my feet here to catch it. How's it going? Two of these will run their gaming rigs for over three hours? One of them will run their gaming rigs for about two and a half hours really so five hours with two of them That's freaking awesome. And in the future if they ever wanted to add like solar panels on the roof of the van or something like that I know oh wait, they have them already. Oh sick so they can charge these off solar during the day game all night That's the life baby. All right. Awesome. Then I can't believe these take the place of these gigantic batteries All of this crap over here and it's all just self-contained dang lithium You cool. Hey, I remembered how they work Go team. Well, that's not going anywhere. Ah, oh, yeah, but Sick man when you're not gaming you can run off these things for a long freakin time We've been using this to power everything in the van for the entire shoot and we're still at 51% Do I need a special cable to daisy chain these things together? no just that oh i oh wow so it really is as simple as just a standard c13 power connection on the one so you just plug that into the charging port and then you just go to the ac output on the other one yep oh all right well that's pretty simple then cool it's also super nice that these get charged just using a standard c13 cable some other battery banks you have to use like a power brick and a special adapter and crap all that's integrated into this so just Boom use this you're done before we get to tidying everything up to reveal to Emily, we've got to try out the passenger seat gaming setup Though hold on. Let me just see if I can ah Get in here It's not really meant to be climbed into from the outside. I don't think this is not bad Do we have a mouse pad for this though? Oh? Yes, the stealth mouse pad from LTD store calm if you don't like any unsightly branding This is the mouse pad for you. It's the same high quality mouse pad. You've come to know and love with absolutely no branding on it. Okay. Oh, it's quite adjustable. Oh, that's not bad. All right. This is kind of an awesome little display, dude. Oh, yeah. Like, it kind of rocks. 1600p and 120Hz. Pretty sick. Oh, yeah. We don't even have the top on it yet. And it's really quiet. That's pretty freaking good. Just putting some little finishing touches on it, so it's nice and ready for the big reveal. I'm just scared about hes trying. What? He's so sketchy. Why is this? Oh, bud, I got lots of room, bud. I got lots of room. All right, here we go. This is scary. Yeah, it's scary. I don't know what it's going to be like. All right, he made it out. That's fine. It's not broken, so we're good. Your gaming dream machine has pulled into the station. Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come. First of all, I would like you guys to notice that Alex is not just sitting backwards in the front seat. Go, go, go, go, look, look, look, look, look. He is gaming backwards in the front seat! Hell yeah! Ooo. Alright. Okay, that's pretty cool. So far. I like that. What we got? We got curtains. We got curtains. We got a gaming Alex. Did you just say curtains? Because I think you mean RGB. Oh, look at the fan though. Wait, what? Look at the fan. Oh, that's so cool. Wait, that's awesome. It's so cool! So there's two full PCs in here. Well, what, we're just gonna put in one? No, it just looks cooler than I thought. I thought it would look way more jank than that. Alex, are you gonna take that? Are you gonna sit there and take that? Like, it's fair enough. But wait, there's more. Once we stash this away, obviously, you've gotta be wondering, where's the second system at? Well, we don't want just one of you to be able to game. Remember you guys talked about how this bed is also a futon? Yeah. This bed is also. A foo, a desk. Oh, that's sick. Let's go. Oh my God. I'm gonna have you guys try it. Okay, so up here, you're gonna find your gaming peripherals. Did you guys notice the RGB? The RGB is so much better than it was. So you gotta grab your USB-C cable. It's a one cable solution. It does both power and display port to your monitor. Sick. There you go. Love that. On the side. Where is it? Nice and convenient. Let's see some gamer skills. Gaming camper van, LET'S GOOOOO! That's the crosshair. I got that, thank you. You should play Overwatch. Not everyone has played these two levels of Doom Eternal a thousand times like I have. Hell yeah. Pretty smooth though, right? This is running amazing. And honestly, this monitor is fantastic. It's small, but another word for small is compact. But wait, there's more. This is a problem. You put a game in front of a gamer, and you just... It's alright, my brain cannot. Just zone out. Okay, okay. I died, it's fine. We're good. Okay, we've got another trick. Oh, that's awesome. Moving night! Okay, so... The projector's not ultra short throw. Oh. So don't be disappointed when it's not quite the whole size, but... Look, it's bigger than the screen you had before, okay? This is true. So you just open up this bad boy. It's better than an iPad. That's what we're up against. We're up against an iPad. Would you believe that none of this is feigned? These guys actually, sight unseen, just allowed us to do whatever to their van. It was kind of scary. It was very scary. This is fantastic. Like, I would game on this. This versus iPad? Okay, big bezels. But we didn't have a hydraulic press to put it in so there was no way to make it smaller of course You know you're not necessarily gonna game when it's you know time to spend quality time on the couch watching a movie So go ahead and shut it down And we can watch our favorite movie crab rave I'm actually so surprised by the speakers on that projector, that's sick. Not too bad. And when you don't wanna look at it, boom. There you go. Of course, we haven't even shown you guys the best part yet. Under where you guys are sitting, you now have up to 2,200 watts of output. The ability to tap into your existing solar system in order to charge them, we didn't wanna mess with what you kinda had here currently, so that's something that you guys are gonna kinda. want to figure out in the future and simple just C13 plug-in charging whenever you guys are at home. Nice. They're a little on the heavy side and the mounting system for them is in there. Yeah. Oh yeah. There you go. But that's a lot of power you guys got sitting under here and what's great is they're pretty much exactly the same form factor as your existing batteries so if you guys ever decide to ditch these you can just put those right where those are and you can get all your storage space back. That's pretty cool. That's really cool. Oh, is there an even bester part? What is this? This looks awesome. What is this? Well, you know, you don't want just RGB fans right there. So someone can be like, what the heck is that and go and steal your gaming computer. So we have a privacy panel. Here you go. Oh my god. What is this? Oh my god. Of course. You had to bring the worst part about Rocket League into the van. You got your Rocket League. This is amazing. We had to cut out the fans so we got some holes out of that and they were coaster sized. So we made you some coasters. Oh, no. Oh, jeez. Oh, no. No! Oh, jeez. Why? You guys can game on these systems just off of battery for about five hours continuously. Although we found out the RGB draws like close to 150 Watts, so maybe turn those off. Oh, gosh. No RGB gaming. Massive thanks for real to DJI for sponsoring this tech makeover. By the way, you can fast charge drones on it. I don't know if you hit that talking point. Super cool. We couldn't have done it without them. If you guys enjoyed this video, you might enjoy the time that we teched out a boat.",

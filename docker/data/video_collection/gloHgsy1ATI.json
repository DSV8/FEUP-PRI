    "transcript": "ah it's finally time for another episode of David accepts a whole bunch of random crap for a video no offense to the people who make the random crap of course this time around though I don't really know what's in any of these boxes because Anna chose all of the products herself so I'm going in a bit blind this time but first a quick word from today's video sponsor today's video is sponsored by PayPal honey apparently PayPal owns honey who knew honey is like a viscous liquid that sticks to many promo codes while shopping on the internet and like most viscous liquids honey is deliciously useful when it comes to finding many promo codes on your favorite shopping websites I find that Honey's viscosity works the best at attracting promo codes while buying PCS from major PC manufacturers all you do is get honey and when you're checking out you do some honey and it'll look for the best coupons it can find to maybe save you some money on your card so add honey to your browser today and join honey dot com forward slash darvel and then get some free honey thank you very much honey for sponsoring today's video I think I'm going to start with this one because it says from the future on it apparently it's a crazy cool speaker with ultimate sound so I'm guessing it's a very modest Bluetooth speaker oh we've got some very anime-esque pictures on it it's called The Mars Bluetooth speaker and it looks really angry it looks like it's gonna come and invade my office and maybe do some terrible things to me which is quite exciting 15 hours of battery time I actually think it said 20 hours of battery time on the outer box so let's just quickly make sure uh yes the outer box does indeed say 20 hours of battery time but I guess it's fine Mars is the god of war after all and not the god of consistent Packaging foreign a lot of comments from people saying that I'm too mean to products I've I heard the product's feelings and then it means that they can't perform the way they need to perform because I keep pointing out their insecurities and kind of poking it a little so in today's video I'm gonna try and be extra nice that's what we're gonna do today we're gonna be very nice that that's pretty cool you've got some foam in the shape of the thing let's pull it out oh I probably shouldn't have just grasped like that with my gross man hands oh it's really heavy as well oh and then here we have all the styrofoam sound here is the speaker and it's in kind of like a matte black oh it's like an alien murder orb thing now on the front we've got a little Tweeter that'll handle all of the high frequencies and then on the back we've got this Midwifery thing so from what I can tell it's a two-way speaker there's a USB C port on the base that has a bit of an orifice vibe to it there also seems to be LEDs all over it so I'm sure it's gonna light up all menacingly this is a very sturdy feeling thing I think the top is made of metal and that combined with the weight of it means that Mars feels nice and thick I'm excited to hear what it sounds like very promising stuff oh I'm being so positive next up I want to have a look at this tiny little package so the outside like wish packaging is completely unmarked and then the inner box is also unmarked mysterious oh it's two things tick time what are these Shenzhen Green Giant energy technology okay that's just an address a okay so I think this is the tick time whatever the tick time is and then here we have a USBC to square USB cable uh that's a very good thing I like when they put USBC ports on stuff so that means this is a very well thought out product whatever it is after spending quite some time examining both the tick times and reading the manual I still couldn't figure out what they were I think this is like an egg timer but then I Googled it and it turns out their Pomodoro timers which I was quite disappointed to learn does not involve pasta apparently it's like a time management technique designed to increase productivity and these timers make doing Pomodoro easier I guess you learned something every day now I'm not entirely sure why they reached out to a tech channel that mainly looks at gaming Hardware to review their Pomodoro timers it's a bit weird but anyway let's look at the next thing peek do I already liked the case it's nice and easy to transport you've got like a little handily thing oh it looks like a steam decky switchy thing so that's very exciting let's look at the accessories first though there's this HDMI dongle thing wait is this one of those wireless HDMI transmitters that would be awesome other than that it came with a 45 watt Woolworth what looked like a Bluetooth dongle and every cable you can imagine it's finally time to check out this bad boy wait these look like joy-con controllers it is surprisingly comfy to hold you can see here the little third-party joy-cons have this bulbous booty that makes them much more comfortable to hold to the Nintendo's joy-cons but these controllers are uh and I'm trying to be positive here interestingly attached to the display on the side there we go okay they are removable that does help explain the but there's quite a bit more play than on a switch which says a lot on the back we've got a whole bunch of buttons with a headphone jack next to it that's very nice and then we've got two USBC ports and a mini HDMI port it actually comes with a cable for that which is pretty cool and then finally we've got a decent bit of heatsink poking up here we have a message from the CEO oh in this note Peak 2 spoke a lot about their seven millimeter latency free streaming technology which got me thinking that this was like a streaming console that uses that wireless HDMI adapter to stream games from other devices but then when I tried Googling it it quickly turned out that this product doesn't seem to exist there's like no info about this thing at all so I guess in the review section of the video we will find out how this thing works no way it's another switchy thing it's like a giant switch it's called the Orion gaming display you can strap a battery pack to the back for maximum ergonomics it doesn't come with much in terms of extras we pretty much just get these two little handles are not little switch controllers you just kind of screw it onto the side and then you can hold the display nice it comes with a little travel pouch and just like a blank keychain for some reason and then finally there's some little plastic bits for you to lose at some point wow these are some serious velcro straps on the back of it they do kind of hang out the front when you don't have a battery pack strapped in but we also have speakers on the back no that is not a stand so it's just got a stand on the one side kind of folds open as well oh I see this is like a Mothership for your switch so I think you can kind of like strap your switch in here and then you like close it in attach the controllers on the side and then you have like a huge Fisher-Price switch I am so excited to try this thing on but with that let's get to testing all of this super amazing genre redefining products see I could be nice now I'm going to start off with the little tick times which as we've established are Pomodoro timers and basically how they work is you turn them on with these two buttons and then you choose a side which has the amount of time you want and then you have that facing up and then timing happens there's not a whole lot more to it than that if you want 25 minutes you have 25 facing up and then at times you could also set more specific times using these buttons If you want oh it's upside down which is actually easier to do on the other one with this one when you have it facing the one minute Direction you can actually tap and then add minute intervals to the timer so this one's easier to like set custom values in I don't know what else to say I don't know how to review a timer um you can also set the volume of the ringer if that's important to you and there's also a magnet in it so you can stick it to the side of a fridge or whatever if you want and um what else oh yeah according to Amazon reviews the battery life on these are pretty bad and you can't use them while charging so you know that could be a problem potentially and then finally they cost just under 40 dollars each which considering the build quality I feel like is quite a lot for a timer but that's up to you to decide and um yes with that let's move on to the next thing foreign to try out this little Mars alien Bluetooth speaker uh so first off I guess we just power it on and then ready to pair oh we've got some some Starcraft Terran sounds coming from it when you power it up I immediately could tell from the Starcraft noises that you know considering that we have a tweeter on a side it is kind of directional so I am gonna gonna point it at me although look at the RGB on it okay Bluetooth is connected now one of the first things I want to check it is very directional yeah it's super directional which for a Bluetooth speaker I don't think is ideal it's not a huge deal but I feel like you just want to plop a Bluetooth speaker down in a room and not worry too much about where it's facing in relation to you you know I'm not going to talk too much about the sound quality of the little testicle of death because it's mostly a novelty right especially the special editions that have like mini guns and stuff glued to it but compared to the only other Bluetooth speaker I have access to Anna's UE wonderboom 2 which is a bit of an unfair comparison because that's like half the price but the Egg of the extinction sounds way better than the UE 2. it's got decent low end extension and when the gonad of Destruction is facing straight at you it stays relatively clear even at higher volumes having said that the top end does take an ice pick to my ears a little bit too much for my liking you can also use two of them in wireless stereo mode but having to buy two gets really expensive for what they are all in all taking into account the build and sound quality of the little overview of immolation I think the 230 dollar asking price is quite a lot but fair for what you're getting wow that is a thick switch we've got see if it can run off the switch's battery because at the moment I don't have any external power plugged into it a few moments later okay well it doesn't work so clearly it needs external power just give me a moment foreign wow it is now a reasonable amount heavier despite me using the smallest battery bank that I could find one positive of the battery bank is you can kind of use it as a stand to like rest the thing on my first impressions of gaming on it were very insightful I mean it is it is bigger than the switch display now at risk of being a Debbie Downer the display isn't amazing the only information about it online is that it's an 11.6 inch IPS HD display which I think means it's 720p I mean it kind of looks like it wait let me quickly try the switch display whoa the switch display may be quite a bit smaller but in terms of image quality you know things like black levels and color vibrancy the switch display curb stops the Orion's display this isn't even the OLED version I do also want to point out after filming this initial session I could only get the switch to interface with the Orion one more time and it took me about half an hour to get that one more time to happen the Orion would just give me no signal warnings despite having the switch running plugged in in the same way I had it plugged in when it was working earlier oh in terms of price this thing cost 250 dollars without a battery pack which means it's finally time for me to give my opinion on the Orion and considering that earlier I said I wasn't going to be mean to stuff in this video um yeah let's move on to the next thing at this point I'm pretty sure the little Peak 2 can't natively play games on it it can just like Channel them off of other devices but let's give it a quick try no it seems like this doesn't even have an operating system on it it's basically just a display with controllers so let's set up some external hardware and take it from there foreign so I've plugged the wireless HDMI transmitter into the Xbox at this point I'm not entirely sure if this handheld has a wireless HDMI receiver built into it or if I have to use a different dongle but I guess we'll find out soon enough hey it does have the wireless HDMI transmitter built in so that's very cool that's exciting stuff now we just need to wait for the Xbox to finish updating so a bit of a problem the joy cons won't interface with the Xbox which come to think of it makes sense uh even when plugged in so let's try and transmit from the switch that should make it much easier wait actually I wonder if these connect to a switch maybe if I okay so they're like functioning joy-cons so that's good to know wait a second I just realized what I'm trying to do here I'm trying to wirelessly transmit the HDMI signal from the docked switch to a dummy version of the switch I don't know that feels like a bit of a stupid thing to do so I'm gonna stop doing that and set up a PC instead and use this as like a controller for PC games instead that makes a whole lot more sense to me let me do that aside from connecting the joy cons to a PC which was a bit of a faff the whole process was quite straightforward and in no time I was busy playing some GTA 5 on the wireless switch clone thing but almost immediately there was a bit of a problem oh some and Terrible's happening I'm not entirely sure what happened there but I think the haptic feedback motor in this right joy-con just went ham there uh but it stopped now so we're good but the haptic feedback didn't stop freaking out it was all over the place yeah the haptic feedback is some of the worst implementation I've encountered pretty much ever I think it's really weird but like I mentioned before I need to be positive about the product so uh yes the haptic feedback does make it feel like you're experiencing an earthquake I I don't know if if immersive is the word I'm looking for but it is a thing that's happening anyway moving on the display isn't very good but the input latency is it kind of feels like I'm playing GTA 5 on the device just like the CEO said it would feel like in his note although I'm sitting right next to the PC with the wireless HDMI transmitter plugged into it so yeah let's quickly test out the range the PC is just on the floor over there and we're here and we've lost signal we don't have direct line of sight with the transmitter so I I guess that makes a difference but it's not the longest range ever so here we have signal again this is despite us not having line of sight of the transmitter which is on the back of the PC so let's see at what point it's working again oh no we've lost it so my rough estimate is that the range is about two and a half meters without a direct line of sight with the transmitter the thing is I don't think this product exists I couldn't find it anywhere online and when we reached out to Peak 2 asking for a link to it they just didn't reply so I have no idea what this thing costs or if it's even for sale you can check the video description We'll add a link if Peak two ever replies but at this point this test may just as well have been a fever dream because I don't think this product exists which brings me to the end of the video let me know in the comment section down below what you thought of this second Roundup of random products we get emailed about on a weekly basis and yeah until the next video thank you for watching bye oh yeah oh",

    "transcript": "- Hey everyone. It's David Bombal back with Chris. Chris, you recently passed a security certification, and I'm hoping that we could do a security video today, but firstly, welcome. - Hey, it's great to be here, David. And wow. That's a way to come out the gate, so. (David laughing) - Yeah. What so did you do? - I went ahead and did these certified ethical hackers, CEH. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, there's a lot of different opinions floating around around that one, and definitely will dig into that one. But I actually had a client. What happened is I had a client that went ahead and asked me to get it and they went in and helped me out with that. So boy, did I learn a lot, David? That said, the test is another thing, but I certainly enjoyed getting into a lot of different new topics for me coming from a packet background. (bright upbeat music) - I'm hoping you're gonna teach us something about Nmap. - Oh yeah, for sure. This is a tool that I've used for years, but I just hadn't used it to this level until I started really digging into it. For me, I'm the kind of guy, if I don't see it at the packet level with Wireshark, I don't really understand it. I came from a background of, that's what I would first do with a tool. I see a tool, I start up Wireshark, and then I compare what Wireshark sees with what that tool output gives me. So that's why we're here about Nmap. - Yeah. So explain what are we gonna look at today? Because I'm hoping that you're gonna run Nmap and then do something, and then we are gonna actually look at the packets. Is that what we're gonna do? - Yeah, for sure. If you are out there studying for a cybersecurity certification, Nmap switches are gonna be on your test. I mean, you're gonna have to know 'em. Now learning them is another story. Really, we have one of two ways of doing it. You can either flashcard and, okay. What is dash, S, capital S, dash ST, dash S what, what are all those switches and what do they do? Or you can use it practically and have a lot more fun doing it. So, which one sounds better to you? - The base way to learn any protocol is to just capture it and have a look at what it's actually doing, not what the textbook tells you it's doing. So take it away, Chris, show us what you know. I'm hoping you're gonna start Wireshark like right now and show us what's going on. - Yeah. Why not? That's always fun. Let's get those packets going. So Nmap, let's just take a look at Nmap. So basically, what Nmap does it's network mapper. All right. So it allows us to discover devices on a network. Why is that important? Well, how are we going to go in and try to hack a device or even inventory devices? I've used Nmap just scanning around my own network and taking a look at what's there and what ports are available. Even doing like an internal pen test on, and Nmap allows us to do that. Now there's a thousand switches with Nmap or options. And if you look through the actual help of Nmap, there's a lot that it can do. And we can see some of those here, David. Look at all these switches. So we have host discovery, target specifications, scan techniques, port specification, looking at services, even enumerating operating systems. So we can take Nmap and we can launch it at a device, and we can learn a lot more about the type of OS that that device is running. Why important? Because how can I find a vulnerability to then exploit if I don't know the operating system? Okay. So yeah. - I'm hoping you're gonna show us at some point. I believe that's in a separate video. We're gonna cover that as well. - Yeah. We'll get there. But first we wanna just talk about some basics and understand more about how Nmap works. So let's just do this. - Now. Like a question would be like, what's the difference between like a normal scan and a stealth scan? And you know, there's a lot of options in Nmap, so hopefully you're gonna show some of that. - Yeah, for sure. So I think the two biggest ones are, I should say, maybe biggest is the wrong word, but two of the ones that you're definitely gonna be learning and using, have to do with TCP connections, all right. And you're gonna find that there's two major ones. If we come here to scan techniques, you can see the first two here, sS and sT. So this is TCP SYN and connect. Now, those are different. There's a difference between TCP SYN scan and connect scan. And that's what we're gonna really focus on today. Maybe in other videos, we'll get into FIN, Xmas scan and some of these other ones, even UDP scan. But for today, we're really gonna focus on those first two. So does that sound like a good time to you? - Yeah. I mean, it be good to know the difference, so yeah. Hopefully you're gonna like show us farther packets. - Absolutely. So let's do this first. I'm just gonna say Nmap, and here's the way to remember it. If it's a scan, then use dash S, lower S, use your small S. And then the next letter that you use, that's going to tell you the type of scan that you're gonna do. Is it an up scan? Well, that's up Oops. There we go. Bottom S that would be an up scan. How about a UDP scan? How about a connect scan? Is T. All right. So a lot of times you can just use the name of the scan to figure out the type of scan. It is a FIN scan. Now there's different reasons why you would use each one, and we'll build on that, but just to get this right out the gate, let let's have everybody, if you don't have Nmap, then go get it and follow along with me here. You can just do Nmap and you can just do, let's just do a SYN scan, and I'm gonna come over here. I'm just gonna start this up here. Let's start up this capture. You can see a lot of our traffic going on here in the background. What I'm gonna do is just launch it. Okay. Let's just grab a device, and let's just see what we do. What I am going to do, though, I'm just gonna do dash F. There's a reason for that. It's a fast scan. It's only going to test the top 100 ports. The number of ports that are available, again, another test question that you might find, there's 65,535 ports that TCP can possibly have opened, right? So we don't wanna have to just destroy a device as we're trying to scan it. Let's just be a little bit more simple with it. And we're just, oh, look at that. Sorry. I forgot about out my root privileges. Gotta come back. I'm just gonna do sudo, A lot of scans require administrative privileges on the system. So it's a lot of times you're gonna have to do sudo. So there we go. And let me just run this. One second, password. - Are you running this on your Mac or on Linux? - The I'm running this on my Mac right now. The nice thing is that the commands are gonna be all the same, right? So if you're in Kali and really, even on windows, I mean, except for the sudo part, you're just gonna have to run your terminal as administrator, okay. So if you notice here on my capture, over here, and I'm just gonna set a filter. If you didn't know, you can set a filter while you have a capture running, and that'll filter on just the traffic going to this device. All right. So I've got a device out here. I'm just gonna stop my capture. I've got a device out here and I have TCP 53 is open. There's one open port and then the other one is 1900 using the SYN scan. Okay, cool. Well, let's go ahead and take a look at, just on this live capture. I'm gonna show you this live, David, and then I'm gonna open up another capture that has a few more interesting ports. And we're actually gonna be able to share that with everybody. You can go down to the description down below and you can download the Stealth scan pcap, and you'll be able to follow right along with me. So we'll get to that in just a moment. But what I wanna do is I just wanna filter. So let's just do, okay 4.1 was our device and let's just do, and TCP port equals equals 53. Let's see what we get. All right. So here we can see that here's our client. It established a connection or it sent out that TCP SYN to 4.1. That was our target. And we're sending this to TCP port 53. Well, seven milliseconds later, we get a SYN ack back. But notice what happens right after that. Our client says, \"Nah, let's reset.\" This is known as a half open scan. The reason is because we only have half of the connection open. a TCP connection is not open until you have sent a SYN and you have received an ack for that SYN. So as a client, I got my ack. So I sent my SYN and I got the ack for that SYN. But the server sent his SYN, I never sent no ack, I just went, \"Nah, reset.\" So that's why it's called half open. Now in Nmap that type of scan is called a stealth scan. Right, so sS, okay. So, that's any port that is open and available is going to respond with that SYN ack. If it's a port that is not open, let's go ahead and try port 80. This is what we're gonna see. I send out my SYN and I got a reset ack back. So this one closed. - The survey reset it because it doesn't have that port open yet. - Correct. When you hit a port that is closed, sorry, talk to the hand. Reset. Yeah. All right. - That's how Y shock knows that the ports are open. Sorry, not Y shock. That's how Nmap knows that the ports are open because it's getting an ack. - Correct. When I send a SYN, then I get a SYN ack, that port is open. Simply, let's just call that the stealth scan. Now let's think about this though. Why would this be called a stealth scan? Well, basically back in the day it was thought, well, okay, if I send this SYN and then it gets a SYN ack and I reset it right away, well, maybe that device that I'm trying to enumerate, I'm trying to attack, maybe it won't log it. Where if I do a full TCP connect scan, the potential is there that it'll go, \"Oh, there was a connection attempt and it was reset.\" Really anymore, most systems today, even on the Nmap, if you go out to the Nmap website, they even tell you, they're like, yeah, stealth might not be the right word for it anymore 'cause a lot of IDS systems will find this anyway, right? So it's not like one is really clandestine and secret, and the full connect scan is gonna be just out in the open. If you're enumerating network, if you're pen testing, likely you're gonna be found if you just launch this thing on a network. So should we contrast the connect scan? - Yeah, I was gonna ask you how's that different to a standard like connect scan, right? - Shall we? Let's do it? I'm just going to start up another capture. And then what I'll do, is I'll flip over to the other ones that we're gonna share with everybody. So everybody can be on the same packet page. All right. So let's do this. I'm gonna go ahead and start my little capture. Got it going now. Let's come over here. I'm just gonna do sudo again, but this time I'm gonna do sT. That's all I changed now. Let's see how that changes things. All right, so we have those same two ports open, and I'm gonna go come over here. Let's just do an and TCP port equals equals 53. So let's take a look at this connection now. What's different here? Right, I have a SYN and I got a SYN ack, but this time the client or the tool acks back, this is a full connection. Right after that only a whopping 18 microseconds later we send a reset. So basically, Hey David, you there? Yep. I'm here. Great. Bye. That's a full connect scan. Now there are some other differences here that I'd like to point out that if you are looking at traffic on your network, there's some differences between these two types of scans that if you see them in Wireshark, you'll be able to quickly tell the difference, more than just the half open and the full handshake. There's also some things that Nmap is doing or not doing with these scans that I'd like to pull out too. Let's go and flip over to the other trace file. All right. So in this pcap, which I'm going to share with everybody, you can hit that link in the description down below. What I did is I went ahead and scanned a much more open device, a device that had a whole lot more ports open. So in this scan, what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a look at just that, that SYN scan, but how certain things would jump out to us if we were looking at normal network traffic. This is where it turns into the real world, David. If we're a sock analyst, blue team, if we're looking at pcaps from our environment, how can I know if my stuff's getting scanned? And that's what my clients come to me for. They'll send me, here's a terabyte, a hard drive full of stuff. Here's a bunch of captures, like what's going on and where are we getting attacked? Okay, so let's go ahead and take a look from a scan perspective anyway. Let's just pick a port here. So I'm just gonna do TCP a port equals equals 80. All right. So right out the gate, we can that this was a scan going to port 80 among others. So if everyone put that port scan there, so here we have SYN SYN ack and then we have a reset. There's our stealth scan. But there's a few other things that we can take a look at that look a little bit interesting in this type of scan. So I'm just gonna go to that at first SYN. Now here's the thing. When we send a SYN scan, the stealth one, Nmap is actually generating that scan. It's actually coming from the tool itself. So Nmap is generating that SYN, putting in things like, for example, oh, let's just pick out some stuff, window. The window is 1024. If everybody's seen some of our TCP deep dive stuff that we've done, David, you know that I'm advertising that I only have enough room in my receive buffer for 1024 bites. That's teeny. Okay. So that's something that might catch my attention. Something else. If I look at that SYN, if I come down here to options, the only TCP option that the Nmap stealth scan is offering to the other side is an MSS. In the real world, when you're looking at true TCP connections, true SYNs that are happen, that's not the case. You're gonna have a lot of TCP options. You're gonna have things. You're gonna see stuff like timestamps, and you're gonna see window size and selective acknowledgement, SACK. You're not gonna just see only one TCP option, typically. - So in other words, what you're saying is, you know this is dodgy traffic, for lack of a better word, because the window size is really small and they're not enough options. - Oh, that would flag my attention in a heartbeat. Absolutely. - How would you find that in like a terabyte of data, is how do you find this stuff, Chris? Because needle and haystack top stuff. - Glad you asked David. Well, why don't we come down a window, and let's actually talk about that for a moment. How would I set a Wireshark filter that will directly find this? So first of all, finding a packet that I would be interested in finding later is a great way to do it. What is it that makes this packet unique? Well, first of all, I got a window, right? So let me go ahead and right click that. And I'm gonna come up here to prepare this filter and I'm gonna go to selected. Okay. So TCP dot window, underscore size underscore value equals equals 1024. Ugh. That's a mouthful. Do I ever want to have to type that out? No, of course not. That's why I can find a packet with that field. I can borrow from down here on the bottom left, ttp.windows, size value, all that. And I can send that upstairs. Or what I could do is I could just take this, this is another kind of cool thing about Wireshark. You see how I'm dragging this right now. I can also drag and drop that filter. Super cool. In fact, another thing that would to be weird about this, I only have so many options. There's not a whole lot here. There's only one option. So something else that might catch my attention, there's a couple ways that we could filter on this. Let's come up to header length, and I'm just going to right click prepares filter. And I'm gonna say, And Selected. Now, let's see what we just did. I said, show any packet that has 1024 as the window size. And also the TCP header length is 24. All right. What does that mean? Well, basically the TCP header without any options, without anything else going on is 20 bytes. You've got your source board, destination port, sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, flags, window, all that stuff right up to urgent pointer. That's the last part of the 20 bytes. After that, if I have options, there is some extra stuff. If this isn't the beginning of a handshake, which by the way, let's not forget that need this to be a SYN, right? So let's go ahead and write click flags as well. And I'm just gonna say, Prepare as Filter, And Selected. So look at we're building this filter out. If this is a SYN, which is flags, what I'm doing is instead of just focusing on that individual bit of a SYN, I'm saying take that whole flag's field. And the only bit that will be set is SYN. If I say SYN, if I do this another way, if I say TCP dot flags, SYN equals equals one, that's gonna get SYNs and SYN acks. I only want the SYNs. Let's go ahead and back up. So I'm just saying flags as a whole. Here's the hexa decimal value. And if you look sideways down here, that's for the hexa decimal people out there, I've got 0 0, 0, 0 1 0. That's a two. That's why it's 002, right? So I just want that SYN location to be one. That's why my flags are 002. So let's see what we did with this filter. This is only SYNs. This is SYNs that are advertising a TCP window size of 1024. And that header length is only gonna be 24 bytes. Now let's talk about that for another moment. The header length. Again, TCP is gonna have a 20 byte header. And at the beginning, if there's a lot of different options, that header length is going to be much larger, it's gonna be another 20 bites or so. So this would catch a stealth scan. - Is it always 24 on Nmap or is it like, can you change that? Or was that just the default? Yeah. - For the stealth scan, tell you what, why don't we test this against a couple other packets. Let's actually apply this thing. All right. So I gotta a thousand packets. And I know for a fact that I sent a thousand, when I did this scan, I did it with the thousand, most common ports. Right there I'm able to see that it caught everything. - And you just did like a stealth scan like we did a few minutes ago with no, you didn't specify anything else. So that was just the default values. - Correct. If I want to, I can come over here, and this is probably a good way to actually show it, so we learn it better. If I do dash P that's for port, and right after that, that's where we can specify. Do we want specific ports? Do we want a range of ports? If I wanna be specific, I can say one to 1000. Or let's just say, if we don't leave this, then what it's gonna do is it's gonna try the top 1000. It's gonna say these are the most common ports. If I don't want a thousand, if I don't want to run a little faster, that's that dash F, it's just gonna be the top 100. - Yeah, what's interesting is that it's using like a window size of 1024 and the TTP headers 24. So that's just looking for 24 bite header is an easy way to see if someone's scanning your network, unless they've made specific changes to try and hide what they're doing. - Exactly, and that's the thing, you know, when we're talking about cyber security, it's hard to make absolutes. All an attacker would need to do is change this to 25 bytes. - How did you discover this is? Is just, you were looking through data, and then suddenly you thought, well, this just looks weird. - Yeah. That's exactly what I did. Let's go ahead and run that full scan again. And what I'd like to do is show you how that would change when I'm looking at a full scan. Let's go ahead and check that out. All right. So I'm gonna start my capture. And let's just run this guy, only this we're gonna do the sT. And I'm gonna show you 'cause remember that was for the stealth. So what I started to do is, I was just looking at these scans. I started to realize, oh, and we already caught that scan. Let me stop. Okay. So let's see what's different. Let's see if everybody can pick this out. Full connect. So first of all, what's our header length, right? That's different, and SYNs the same. But if I come down to my window, I've got a complete 65 535 window. So on the full connect scan, look at all the options I have. - Yeah. Very different. - SACK, timestamps window scale. - And that's more realistic for proper traffic in the network. - Exactly. Here's the reason why these are different. Now the audience might be thinking, \"Great. Okay. So the stealth scan looks weird, but the can next scan doesn't.\" And that's because Nmap, doesn't generate this on its own. What it does is it issues a connect call down to the operating system kernel stack. And it says, \"Hey, you TCP, you generate this connection. I'm not gonna do it as a tool. I want the actual operating system to do it.\" That's why this SYN looks so much different 'cause the true OS stack is the one that actually generated this. And that's why it looks much more real. A real window, a useful TCP window. So instead of saying, \"Hey David, do you wanna connect? You can only send me a thousand bites.\" Now I'm saying, \"Hey David, do you want to connect? I'm gonna start out with 65 535 as a window. By the way, you're gonna be able to multiply that bad boy by 64. So we're gonna have a big, cool bucket of data to work with.\" That's why that caught my attention when I was looking at those stealth scans 'cause this was so low. - I mean, in some ways the stealth scan is less stealthy compared to this, isn't it? - To me. yeah, I would catch it way faster than I would this for sure, yeah. - Is there anything here though, that looks weird? Is it just because she see... How would you catch this? - I would come to this part of Wireshark, and this is called TCP conversation completeness. Now what on earth is conversation completeness? Well, glad you asked. Basically, what this does is it assigns values to different aspects of the TCP conversation. So here's a standard conversation. So basically what conversation completeness does in Wireshark, this is basically, it it's a cool little feature. It's come out just in the recent year really. So basically, a full TCP conversation that is normal and healthy, it has has a beginning. So a handshake. Okay? And the first packet of a TCP handshake, everybody is? - SYN (laughs). - Good job. All right. Yes. You got a gold star. - Thanks. All right. I can't believe I'm giving David Bombal gold stars, anyway. - Yeah, no I know nothing. I know nothing about this. - Okay. All right. No yet. No, a lot of things. Okay. How about the second packet? Everybody? What's that one called? - Called SYN ack. - Good job. Okay. Here we go. And oops. All right. Flushed out. All right. Last packet is, ack, good job with our handshake. Okay. We've already seen this in our INAP scan. Okay. There's a handshake. So a connection began. Data gets exchanged. Okay. Acknowledged. Okay. And then this connection gets shut down. So this could happen any way either through a FIN or a reset. Okay. So let's just say, I'm just gonna shorten this out and just call this FIN, okay. This is a complete conversation in TCP so called, all right. Now what Wireshark does, it assigns values to each one of these functions. SYN, this gets a little deep and we're gonna actually, I'm gonna link the Wireshark page and the actual information or the Wiki where it talks about each of these values, but we'll just go over it together. So basically the SYN gets a value of one. SYN ack gets a value of two. The ack gets a value of three or of four. This is binary. Okay. A reset down here is 32 and the FINs are 16 and data is eight. All right. Do you see the binary way we count? So 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 32. So basically, the way that TCP completeness is calculated, all right, so we have a TP completeness of 39. All right, so what this means is we saw a one, we saw a two, we saw a four ,that's seven, and then we saw a reset. We add all that up. And when we say a handshake followed by a reset, that is a TCP completeness of 39. - Yeah. So no data sent you and that's why it says no data. - Yeah. So in this case. - That's weird, isn't it? - Oh. Boy. Yeah. Well, I mean it means... Okay, does happen in the real world? Yes, it does. It does it happen often in the real world? It shouldn't. If I said TCP completeness, and this is where I would do this, David. This is where I would look a little closer. I would say prepare is filter and let's do, And Selected. And I'm gonna go ahead and remove my port off of this just to keep things more open. Oh, you don't like the parentheses. Hang on. All right, so anything to, and from this host, TCP completeness is 39. This is going to show me when a connection was attempted. SYN ack came back, ack went out and a reset happened right away. Right away I would be thinking if I saw one of these, David, maybe I wouldn't be super worried about it. If I saw thousands of these, Hey. - Someone scanning. - Absolutely. So this is one way that we can filter for that. TCP completeness is 39. - How did you discover this, Chris? Is it just like you just captured packets and then you looked at what was weird based on what you normally see, yeah? - Good question. And yes. For me, as far as the TCP completeness thing goes, what I thought was, okay, how can I capture a handshake that is immediately reset? That's a tough filter to build, right. It's like, if you do that by hand, that's a long filter. I gotta say. - Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. - Yeah, I mean, basically what I gotta do to, to do the equivalent thing, that conversation completeness is doing, first, I gotta set a filter for SYN and then I gotta set a filter for an ack that has a sequence number of one and an ack number of one, and reset on the same port number. Uh, it's just, I'm confused even explaining what I just explained. So that's part of the reason why the amazing people behind Wireshark came up with conversation completeness is because we could do these kinds of tests where we could say, \"Hey, how far did the TCP conversation get?\" And this is really useful when it comes to port scans. So another thing that I could do is I could set TCP completeness. Let's just say that I'm only looking for a SYN and a reset. Well, the SYN is one, the reset is 32. That could be 33. Now I can use that feature of Wireshark to get a better handle on how much of this scan activity has. And it all goes back to if I see it once, maybe I'm not super worried, but if I see a pattern here, or even if someone comes into Nmap and slows the scan down, which by the way we can do, we can say, \"Hey, be really stealthy. Only let out a few of these every couple minutes or seconds.\" - You'll still pick it up though. - You can still pick it up. - I mean, I suppose the problem is if you do it over a long period of time, you're gonna have so much data. So you are capturing device has to have the capacity. And Chris, that gets us to another conversation. Are devices good enough today to capture huge amounts of data? Or do you need specialist devices? - That's a great question. Okay. So here's your threshold and this is what I do. Okay, So I'm a packet consultant, right? I get paid to go in and find problems. The last thing that I want is missing data because sometimes it comes down to that one packet that the analyzer missed. And as soon as I see that, I start to doubt my whole trace file. Okay. So sometimes people will send me pcaps, even from YouTube, they were watch a video like this and they'll say, \"Hey, I just need some help analyzing this certain problem.\" Which is great, they can interact and send a pcap and right away, if I see previous packet not captured or if I see symptoms, if almost looks like false three transmissions, which it does take some time to learn how to identify that, which you and I can continue to chat about. But the point is, if I have, I call it dirty data (laughs) if my data's missing, then I start to question my whole pcap, right. That's like a gold standard. - It's unreliable. - It's unreliable. - Yeah. It's unreliable. - So your question was, how well does a hardware keep up? Well, I think everybody knows that Wireshark with a laptop in normal data center world, it can't keep up with super high data rates. Most network engineers know that. If I ask them, \"Can a copy of Wireshark on a laptop keep up with 10 gig?\" Most people are gonna say, \"Oh, no.\" Okay. Then when does it start to fall? - Yeah, exactly. - My benchmarking shows that most of the machines that I have had and done my best to optimize, I'm not able to accurately to capture timestamp and everything much over 100 megabits per second. - Oh, wow. That's low. That's low. When you go to site, do you have a laptop or what do you do? Do you have like specialist hardware? What do you? - So, yeah, Dave, that's a good question. And let me just show you what I use, just because it's backpackable, if that's a word. So this is actually the profits app IOTA, and literally what it is is it's a hard drive, terabyte hard drive with a tap built in, right. So I can go network one way then device under test the other way, or I can connect it between two switches on the uplink, but it comes in 10 gig as well and beyond, depending on the money you wanna spend. And then it's got a management port. All I have to do is I literally plug this guy in power it, and then there's a little button here. See how little guy, that button? - Yep. - Capture. - And you just let it run for a while. - Yep. - I let it cook, let it grab all the traffic that it can. And then what I can do is interface with it. I can pull pcaps back from it, or I can also use some of the analytics that are built in. So a lot of times I have this running, even on my home network, just to keep an eye on things and look for scan activity. Like we're talking about a lot of times I find my own, but, (laughter) Part of what this does is it allows me to go to a period of time where I say, \"Hey client, Hey customer, what time was it when this happened?\" And I train them to tell me, \"Oh, it happened at 3:30, Chris.\" Okay, cool. At least I can go to that time index and I can back up five minutes and go forward five minutes and I can extract that component, right. So capture better, capture smarter. No one should be digging through a single pcap that is, you know, a terabyte. - I mean, that's important to know. I mean, the, the other question is, okay, so you've got like a terabyte of data, whatever it is. I mean that, it's going back to that whole question. How on earth do you find things? So, I mean, you've given us some good tips, but have you got any other, like, just from your experience, you know, you've got this crazy big file, how do you even start to look at that stuff? - Right. So there's two ways. One you can make use of the command line tools. So from there, when you install Wireshark, you also have command line tools like T shark, Edit Cap, Merge Cap, these other tools, you actually install like nine different tools, something like that, when you put Wireshark on there. Those tools have a much better time with their very large trace files. So sometimes what I'll do, if someone just literally gives me a hard drive full of data, what I might do, if it's a super large pcap, what I'll do is I'll go in and break it up. I can go in and say, just break this up into smaller pieces. Better though, let me show you the real thing that I do. - Yeah, please. - This is legit real world. Something that I train my students, in my classes. I talk a lot about this and I know we've left off from Nmap, but this is a really important part of capturing this stuff in the real world. What I do is I try to train them from the beginning to capture wisely. And one way is by using, let's just go ahead and use dumpcap. Now, a lot of times when you're in Wireshark, Wireshark, actually calls dumpcap to do the actual capturing. Dumpcap, is a tool that gets installed with Wireshark. If you don't already have it, or another one that a lot of people might use on a server, on interfaces, tcpdump, right? So what I'll do is, I'll say, \"Okay, let's just go ahead and do this. Let's go to dumpcap.\" Okay. Now, if I go to dump cap dash D, this is going to show me all the interfaces that I have access to for doing pcaps to capture from. Let's just grab the first one. This is a WI-Fi interface. Okay. So let's just do dumpcap dash I, so that's interface, one. So I'm saying, \"Hey, dumpcap, go grab a bunch of packets off of this interface.\" And if I just let this thing fly, it's gonna go great. It's gonna start to dump that traffic into a temp folder. And it's just gonna call it Wireshark Wi-Fi. And David, this will go until I stop it. This is gonna be a big trace file especially if I leave it for a full day. Well, I don't want that. So instead, what I'm gonna do, let me just back outta that guy. What I'm gonna do is give it some parameters. So I'm gonna say, actually, it's called, if you look at the help menus, you'll see this, but if you go dash B, you can do file size. And in kilobytes, I give it the amount of traffic. So my file size, let's just say, okay, so one kilobyte, 10 kilobyte files, a hundred kilobytes meg. That's a hundred meg file. So what I'm saying is dump this into a 100 megabyte file, then dash B, files. And I can say, let's just start with 10. Okay. So what that does, the files switch is it says, save 10 of them. And then let's just say, I'm just gonna write this out. And I know there's a lot of switches here, but. - You know, it makes sense though. And I mean, this is a lot more efficient than grabbing traffic rather than the Y shark gui. Like you said, the Y shark gui actually goes and uses this. - Absolutely. Yeah. I just started, what's called a ring buffer. Now this gets back to your question. How do you, you find this in an ocean of packets? How do you find the three that make the difference? Well, first of all, let's capture smarter. So what I did is I started a capture. I said, I want 100 megabyte files, and I want 10 of them. So what this does is it starts, it's called a ring buffer on my machine. Now I'm gonna grab 10 of 100 megabytes each. And after the 10th one, it's gonna go override the first one. - Okay. So it's continuous. - Yep. Ring buffer. So now I can play with these numbers. I can go, you know, a hundred megabytes is too small. Why don't we bump that up to 500 megabytes? And I got some horsepower to work with on my hard drive. So why don't I ahead and up this to a hundred files, and that'll give me more time. Point is, David has a problem and he goes, \"Oh, that weird thing happened that I'm troubleshooting.\" Or things look kind of funny. It happened whatever we're troubleshooting. And I say, \"Hey, David, around what time was that?\" And if you say, he's like, \"Oh, it was about 8:30.\" Cool, I can go back to my ring buffer and I can look at my time date stamps that are right here. And I can say, okay, \"Look at us, we're at 222 222. For me it's 10:56 AM. And I can just find the one that happened. Okay, I'll change from 8:30 in your example to 11:00 AM. So I can find the one that was capturing during that period time. And now I just went from a terabyte hard drive down to a hundred megabyte file. - Yeah. Yeah. So capture smart. - Capture Smart. I try to make my pcaps as small as I can. And also when we're looking at real data, really be focused on the when, the what. The wrong thing to do, David is just to jump in and just hope that we get the right packets at the right time right. We need more information. When did it happen? What type of thing occurred? And when we're doing cybersecurity, open captures like this, just, it's a lot easier and more digestible when we're dealing with these smaller pcaps. - I remember, you know, doing a lot of network troubleshooting, the hardest problems or the transient, like weird things that just happen seemingly randomly. It's so hard to try and troubleshoot that stuff. So I like what you're doing, you know, like, let it run. You know, this is running continuously and just overriding itself, then you know, and correct me if I'm wrong, but like the client's running this. And then when something happens, they can call you, \"Okay, it's happened now.\" Or, you know, they can try and give you a time when it happened that day. And then it gives you time to go back and look at actually what happened at that time, rather than just trying to guess. - Absolutely, in fact, let me show you one other thing that I do is I'll get this capture going either locally on their system or somewhere on the network off of a spa port or a tap. And what I'll do is I'll come in, and imagine this is the user's machine, okay? I just have a test copy of windows running. Here's a VM. But what I'll do is I'll go into their system and I'll say, let's go ahead and just do new... Let's just do a shortcut. And I'm literally just gonna type in my personal website. (indistinct chatter) pioneer.com. Okay. The reason is because it's unlikely that that person, that end user, that I'm trying to resolve is just going to go out to my personal website. That's an unlikely thing to happen. It used to be that we would do this with Telenet back in, you know, when Telenet was just a, it was a part of a standard tool set that was still on Windows. People didn't use Telenet because it's open and you can see the traffic, like that's actually happening. You can grab passwords and things, but now SSH people are doing that through putty and such. What I just need to do is I just need to find something to trigger on, right? So what I do is I name this, It happened, okay? I put that right over here on their desktop. And then I say, \"David, go about your business, do your work.\" And then the next time it happens, just go double click that, and it'll go out and it'll go to my website. What does that do? Well, now I can stop my capture. And this is a great little example here. And let me... Gotta find where that file went. I think it's just on my route. There we go. Yeah. Okay. So now I'm back in Wireshark, right? So I've got a ton of stuff here. I've got a hundred thousand packets. How do I find the one where? - It happened? - It happened, right? So let me just do frame contains packet pioneer, and I'm going to get all the packets that contain that name. Now, I am packet pioneer, right. So, but I actually tested this once in here. We have it again. So usually, you're just gonna see right here, now I have a bookmark. Now I've got packet pioneer. This is where this was actually generated. And I can now look around that period of time in the pcap. And that allows me to set other filters for when it happened. - That's great. So, in other words, you find the timestamp just off that black marker, and then you can say like five minutes after that or 10 minutes before it or whatever. - Yep, then I can come up here to View, Time Display Format, Time of Day. And now David said it happened at 11:03, and he hit the It Happened icon. And now I two bookmarks. I have a period of time, but just in case my time sync isn't correct on the capture device, now I can know also from the packets themselves, he hit the, It Happened icon. - That's brilliant, but I mean, are there anything, any last like parting thoughts about tips that you've got from the real world? I mean, we started with Nmap and we kind of like morphed into like real world stuff, but I think it's important because you like highlighting what's weird on networks. Any other quick tips before we wrap it up? - Yeah. I think for me, I don't get something until I see it at the packet level, especially getting into cyber security with those that are, if they're new to cybersecurity or if they're learning how these tools work, Wire shark is a great way to have that open and get that thing capturing while running these tests. Don't do that thing where you just become... You're just generating a tool or you're using a tool and hitting a button, and then watching some that you don't understand. Wireshark is a tool that can help you to understand it. And David, hopefully you and I continue to do this kind of content where we can walk people through what to look for on the Wire. - To the audience, please put in the comments below stuff that you want Chris and I to discuss. I mean, the good news, Chris is we're planning to do a whole bunch of videos and I think we want to cover as many protocols as we can. I want to twist you to get back for more TCP deep dive stuff, UDP deep dive, and some other protocols. So yeah, it's a lot to cover. Chris, really wanna thank you, you know, for sharing your knowledge for free. Really appreciate it. - Thanks for having me back, David. I always enjoy hanging out with you. And of course, everybody who watched too. - Brilliant. Thanks, Chris. (bright upbeat music)",

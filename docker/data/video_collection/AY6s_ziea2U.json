    "description": "Are many gaming keyboard companies ripping us off?  That's the question we asked ourselves during Computex 2019 where companies like Varmilo, Leopold, Wooting and Ducky were busy putting their \"gaming\" competition to shame.  We wanted to make a video dedicated just to them since these are honestly some of the best and most unique keyboards around.    Learn more about the companies in this video:  Ducky:   Varmilo:   Leopold:    A special thanks to Steelseries and Phanteks for sponsoring our trip to Computex 2019.

    "transcript": "Haggar people oh my god this is so satisfying it's actually it will relieve all the stress in the world tapping away the quality mechanical switch and now my friends a magic trick nice alright good people so before we get them to really cool keyboard content at Computex I would like to thank fantex and SteelSeries for making our visit possum so our desire to explore really cool keyboard contact at Computex really started with still series and their introduction of a new switch called omni point they're using the whole effect technology in which you can customize the actuation point from point four millimeters to three point six and that is a cool concept but it is not a new concept because the Hall effect switch is been out I think for like thirty years or so so let's start with Wooting keyboards the winning one was my first analog keyboard and you could customize the actuation point as well just like with Omni point switches and now Wooting is releasing a new lacquer switch so it is using the same Hall effect technology as SteelSeries does so there's a magnet at the bottom there's magnet in the actual switch and they're measuring the signal between the two magnets to calculate or calibrate the actuation point so the licker switches will be linear of course that is needed when you have the customization of the actuation point but one cool thing is they're introducing this dynamic reset point and that is if you bypass the actuation point and you still do not reset the key anytime you go slightly up the key will reset so you could theoretically activate the key and then perform these minor up-and-down movements and the key will again activate to granting you much faster actuation so you don't have to bottom out and reset the key every time all the way to the top because the dynamic reset point will already be active beyond that first actual actuation point I don't know that makes sense they will be introducing a special-edition keyboard from Wooting so this is the booting - so a full-size keyboard with a really cool graphical and vibrant layout and obviously using pvt key gaps quality lacquer switches nice body and they're trying to shift away from the gaming demographic and move into and enthusiast and serious crowd for keyboards I'm really excited to have more Hall effect switches on the market now and by far the most visually impressive keyboard we saw the show was the ducky one two SF s f stands for sixty-five percent this is the year of the pig edition from ducky which has an incredibly unique font it has this dark rich red key caps really cool body additional special key caps both for the escape and for your right key caps both of which have meaning and they describe to you exactly what it means in in the culture we have a little bit of golden accents behind a type c connection and the overall keyboard is just it's so unique that you most likely will not be able to buy it because it's not that expensive either only like it's under $200 and for that type of special edition TV tiki apps like a really fantastic build quality the space bar also has this really unique Pig graphic and they are using PBT keycaps with dye sublimation technique and what's really cool is the new one to SF keyboard is also available in your standard edition white or black ranges from $89 to $119 and it really removes that stigma surrounding ducky being like a really expensive brand because of their quality it's not like that they deliver really good quality keyboards but are actually not that expensive moving on to cooler master we finally have a properly low profile keyboard the sk851 it will use Imran's newbie 3kl switches which are incredibly low profile it will come in both linear and tactile formats and just from our typing experience alone the switches felt much better than the linear low profile Reds that they have currently on their SK850 line of keyboards and I'm really really excited for this type of the SK851 keyboard to come out because it will be fully wireless right now it's only full size but it'll be both PC and Mac compatible and hopefully the battery life will last forever and the switches themselves feel really awesome and so do the key caps and then we found very low and this is something that I'm really excited to share because they're this boutique slash enthusiast slash almost budget-friendly keyboard manufacturer and where you customize absolutely everything from your switch type to your key cap color to your font to your spacebar design to the actual body of the keyboard TK l versus full size everything about the whole customization process is up to you they use p bt key caps which are super high quality and dye sublimation techniques in which the actual font or whatever is written on the actual key cap is imprinted throughout the entire body so if you were to have a cross-section of the key cap you will actually see that dye of the font or whatever else so it will never wear off it's not laser printed it's not a sticker it's literally imprinted inside the key cap and the most impressive part with Varmilo keyboards is the price so II broke ustym eyes himself at ek a layout with different switch types throughout the board so the walls area was something else he got himself additional key caps a wrist rest and that price was a hundred and fifty dollars and that is usually the price point of a your regular traditional gaming keyboard that is very mainstream yet here you have something that there's literally tailored by you in your color customization and I'm really just wanted to pass that information to you because I feel like they deserve some attention and then the wooden guy's tipped us over into direction of Leopold as supposedly a company that makes really high-quality keyboards but their pricing tops at one hundred and twenty-five dollars but from what we saw in terms of the customization of the different layouts and different color options different wrist rest it was all really really high quality for example the PCB underneath all the soldiering points were really well done and this is coming from wooden guys that make keyboards themselves they said it's a fantastic job on the actual soldiering points so for all silent enthusiasts this is something really cool they had this silent focused keyboard that had felt underneath the PCB and the frame the frame was aluminum and this is to minimize any vibration noise they had felt underneath the key cap itself and the little rubber piece on the body so when the key cap bottoms out that sound is being absorbed they had additional stabilizers on the space bar and simply typing on the keyboard not only did the felt and additional materials kind of dampen the sound but it also gave the the keyboard a little bit of a different feel and that is so unique and that keyboard was a hundred and nine dollars and then we got to try their new switch that aims to compete with opera and that is one most unique switches that I've ever typed on and that after the actuation point the switch becomes heavy and that descent advises you from bottoming out it was so enjoyable to type on and so that my friends concludes our little keyboard exploration and Computex this is something that I never expected to see here and the fact that we were able to just see these five companies in the span of like 30 minutes just is incredible and I'm really looking forward to doing more exploration at next Computex because I'm sure we'll find some gems in the future but if you guys have any experience with duckie or very low or leopold let us know in the comments because i would definitely want to branch out into that target that premium and niche keyboard market that isn't so expensive as it turns out I'm a Dimitri thanks much for watching and check out this other relic content as usual I'll see you guys in next",

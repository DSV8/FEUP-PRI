    "transcript": "- Hello, welcome to This Is. Smartphones are out of control. So if you look at what the flagship level of a smartphone looks like today. - Okay. - You're spending over a thousand dollars easy. I mean, if you're in Samsung's camp, you might get up to two grand for the Z-fold too. And while there's nothing wrong with some crazy experimental high-end device, you also look at something like the iPhone, which is well above a thousand dollars. And I'm sure with the iPhone 12 would even higher, Look at something like the S20 Ultra or the Note 20 ultra. Those are approaching $1,500. - Yeah. - The flagship that we all know and love is just simply ridiculously overpriced for most people, which means that the previous mid-range of the market. So the OnePluss, the iPhone SEs, the LG Velvets of the world have now very much sort of filled that role of $4700 or so that I think most people probably want to buy their phones in at least in the kind of the mid-range of the market. - Right, and there's so much there where you start to have this fight of like different trade-offs. - Yes. - And like things that you might prefer and different platforms, like, where do you stand on it? - So what really got me thinking about this is the Google pixel announcement from a few days ago. - Okay. - The new pixels are, I would say no longer flagships, right? I think last year, the pixel four was aiming to be a flagship and had most of those same features, but the pixel five and the pixel for 4a 5G, I can't believe I'm saying that with a straight face, are both phones I think are pretty solid in this sort of upper mid-range that has been coming standard, right? So specifically with the pixel five, you were getting a $700 device that has a lot of flag shipping features. So aluminum build water resistant 5G. - The camera obviously, right? - We'll talk about that in a second. But one of the downsides that you're getting is only 90 Hertz display as opposed to 120, which is not the end of the world, but also it has a lower end processor. It has the same Snapdragon 765G as something like the velvet or something like the OnePlus Nord. And specifically with the Nord, I mean that is available and a $450 phone. So it's one of those things where it used to be your flagship was the high-end specs, the high-end camera, the high-end everything. But at this point you can't get the high-end no compromises device below a thousand dollars, right? I mean the OnePlus 8 Pro probably the closest to that do everything device that's just barely squeaks below a thousand dollars. - Yeah, and the thing is that there are weird outliers. I think like where I partially agree and partially disagree at retail, especially when you're looking at MSRP. A lot of those phones retail for a thousand dollars or more that have those top feature specs, you know, the top of the line, you know, this generation, this, what is it? The Snapdragon 865. - 865 and 865 plus, yeah. - If you look back at traditional Samsung, in fact even up until fairly recently, you could get the thousand dollars Galaxy S20, which was sort of one of the phones that really kicked everything off this year, because even the base model of the S20 this year was a thousand dollars. And then they announced the Galaxy S20 fan edition. Now on the surface, this looks like a really solid phone. So yes, there are some compromises that it has a plastic back. - Right. - You have slightly worse cameras. Although I think the selfie camera has been upgraded and you have a 10 ADP display instead of 1440, but it's still 120 Hertz still has 865. It looks like. - It's most of what people want in the S20, just at a lower price which is, I feel like is a smart move but. - There's a big button there. $700 seems great, right? - Yeah. - There's minimal changes. Guess what? As soon as that thing came out for pre-order on Amazon, every S20 immediately went straight back up to a thousand dollars. They were discounting those as 20s. I'm sure if you look hard enough, you'll be able to find them. But as I was starting to do a little bit of research, I couldn't find a cheap S20 anymore. And then if you look at something like the pixel, right? So again, pixel five is $700. - Okay. - It is $200 more expensive than the 4a 5G, which has shares the same cameras with the same specs 5G. There are a couple of things that the five has. So you have the 90 Hertz display, you have the aluminum build, the water resistance. But generally speaking, I would say they're very similar phones. - Would you get the pixel five over the fan edition though? - Something I've been thinking about a lot is what is the right phone at this kind of price. Earlier this year, we had the iPhone SE, the Nord, the pixel 4a, all of which are really solid phones in that 350 to $450 price point. - Right. - Honestly, any of those phones I think are 100% daily drivers, you can get years of use out of them, no problem. But as you start to get up to this slightly higher end market, there are a couple of things that jump out. - Right. - So first of all, we have more phones that are coming. So on top of the pixel, on top of the S20 fan addition, on top of the LG Velvet, there's the iPhone 12 mini, that thing's probably going to be out very shortly. I'll be very surprised that is not in the 700 to $750. - I would hope so. - Absolutely needs to be, I think we're going to see iPhones from like 700 to probably like 12, 1300 based on the iPhone. - To get to bridge the gaps, right? - Yeah, and there's also potential that some of the iPhones may or may not have high refresh rate pressure displays 5G. So the pricing I feel like is going to be all over the place. And also OnePlus have recently come out and talked about the OnePlus 8t. So we'll be getting some upgrades over the OnePlus 8. So just like always every six months they upgrade things. So the 8T will have a 120 Hertz display as opposed to 90 Hertz. But what we don't know is what that price will be. I assume it will be roughly in that $700 price point as well. And it could easily be the most well rounded of all these, because the OnePlus 8 is great right now. - Right. - And the eight pro I think is still the closest to a fully featured flagship. - Yeah. - It's not crazy expensive. - I think the main crux here is that in the $750 price point or like, you know, more or less right, there are a lot of compromises that you have to sift through in order to figure out, you know, what suits your needs the best. - Yeah. - Where obviously, you know, phones that are over a thousand dollars. You know, when price is no object, you have less compromises there. You're closer to finding that perfect as I said again, no compromises phone. - Yeah. - It's just what will get you there the closest? And if I had to pick one. - Go for it. - If I had to pick one for 450 bucks. - I think you took a breath but you actually sit and say the name of the OnePlus Nord. - You're like plus Nord. - $450, if you can buy one, which we can not here in United States. - Yes, we don't have one in the US. I don't know if it was on record or not, but there might be a Nord in the US at some point, right? - I don't think they've announced anything, but there's tons of rumors over the Nord. - Right, yeah. - Maybe cheaper though, it sounds like they may be working on a even sub like for $300, something like that Nord. - Right. - Yeah, it does sound like there are more Nord. - It's just for the price. - Yeah. - I feel like this is about as close to no compromise as you can get. The velvet is an interesting device because you do have the ability to connect to the dual screen device which I use a lot. - Yeah, like there's some things that are going for it. But when you look at the OnePlus Nord, you have these 765 G, you have 5G installed to it, 765 G with 5G. - There are a lot of fives and Gs. - I know my names and numbers and whatnot, but then I think if you're looking at this kind of price point, it's might not be crazy to go for pixel 4a, because that's a full hundred dollars cheaper. You get the plastic build which I actually personally like. There's nothing against the Nord, but it doesn't feel particularly premium whereas the pixel actually has a little bit of character to it. - The 4a, 5G. - No, the standard 4a. The 4a, 5G is a whole separate beast. But then to make everything even more confusing, the iPhone SE 400 bucks has a lot of advantages. - I love this phone a lot. This is probably my favorite iPhone of this year because it broke a lot of rules on the Apple side of things. So obviously the main reason why this is a great deal, especially right now is because it is running current flagship specs. - A13. - A13, that's should be the one that you get in the iPhone 11 and 11 pro. And it comes with the same image processing as well. Not necessarily the same camera. - Yes. - That's the biggest probably, you know, criticism of this. But I still think that with the image processing this old lens with the new current image processing looks miles better than a lot of the phones that you can get at 400 bucks, including the Nord, including the LG Velvet which costs $200 more. - You almost have to tear up your pre-conceptions on what you need in a phone. What are the main things of like, oh, I want a flagship, I want this, I want that. Because I think in 2020 going into 2021, there are a couple of things that for me have kind of changed order as far as what's most important. Battery life with almost no exceptions besides the iPhone SE is now good enough, right? Very few phones ship a battery that will not comfortably last you a full day. - Especially in the mid-range, the mid-range oddly enough, is where you find those bigger battery capacities. Like the LG Velvet has a pretty big one too, right? - Yeah, absolutely. Camera I do think is important but the baseline, I think has also been raised, right? Even the worst of the camera phones out there right now in that mid-range are still, I would say good enough. - Right. - But some things I think that are really overrated are the specs and the 5G. I don't care that my phone has 5G. Now, yes, if I can get 5G versus not have 5G I will take it. But I don't think that something like going from the pixel 4a to 4a 5G is necessarily worth it. Obviously not having used that 5G version yet, but the extra money to me doesn't seem like it is a huge difference. The thing I do think you should be paying attention to is not only the price, but also the screen. So getting a high refresh rate screen to me is a far more noticeable difference than a better processor. It's a far more noticeable difference than having 5G, it is something that will make a real difference in day to day life, right? It is so much quicker and snappier. - It feels faster. Like you can have the fastest processor in the world, but if it has a 60 Hertz refresh rate, subconsciously when you don't have that motion blur and things seem like they're going quicker. - So the winners I think in all of this are companies like OnePlus who got a lot of oh, for going up in the price category, but everyone else, I feel like this year went even farther. So there's still, the difference is a high-end OnePlus is still hundreds of dollars less. So props to them, I will say good job to Google, but really on the 4a, the 4a 5G and the five without having used them yet. But at least from what we know right now seem to be a little bit of a tougher sell where's that 4a. I mean, they even said something along the lines of like, it's the highest selling pixel they've had in either ever or in a long time, like clearly a very successful phone. - Right, and I want to say good job to Apple. - Yes. - Because I mean, granted they want the SE to be in the market for probably the next four to five years. So we'll see where they're going to be with the SE 2 down the line. But the fact that they included their top level specs, you granted an older body but their top level specs for $400. - I'm willing to sacrifice no 5G specifically the lower refresh rate on this because it's $400. And then the wild card here is that iPhone 12 mini. I really do think the iPhone 11 is the most popular smartphone in the world. The year before that the iPhone 10R was the most popular smartphone in the world. Tons and tons of people buy in that 700 to $750 price point, the old space where flagships used to live. And I think that that iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 mini, if there's still indeed in that 650 to $750 price point are going to be very competitive if they do have some of these new features. If they're able to have 5G, if they're able to specifically have higher refresh rates, they're going to have the improved cameras, et cetera. So it was a very, very good time to be purchasing a smartphone, but also probably one of the more confusing times we've had in a long time. So thank you very much for watching.

And until next time, Ken, are you going to recommend a phone for the very last four seconds of this video? - IPhone SE 2, very good buy it unless you are an Android user.

    "transcript": "- Hey it's Justine and welcome to part one of CES 2020. There's so much stuff to see so we better get started now. This is Sharp's 90 inch See-Through Display, obviously it is transparent, but hold on a second, I can't actually see you because it's a one way mirror, so when you guys come around to this side, to see what I'm seeing, you're not able to see out. I'm waving, see. - Oh what? - Right. Behind me is the BMW i Interaction EASE and what this is, is a concept of what it would be like in the future when there's no steering wheels. - And what this is is our vision of the future of autonomous mobility, looking far out, understanding when autonomous mobility is more common place, how do you actually interact and understand and enjoy that environment. - I am relaxing now, no way. - [Computer] If you tap again I will put the seat upright. - What if I want to stay here forever? - Fine (laughing) - Out of all of this technology one of the things that has impressed me so much is the technology over here. This is what I would like to call Dorito technology. I don't think this joke was as good as I thought it was, so I'll just carry on. This is the brand new Insta360 One R, you guys know that I'm such a huge fan of Insta360, but what's great about this is it's modular, so you can swap out different pieces of it to make it a different type of camera. We have a 360, they have a one inch sensor. They partnered with Leica. This is the Leica mod, this is so great because it is a one inch sensor, so obviously you're gonna get some really great low light, having this inside of this little camera is pretty cool. This is the ariel edition. There's two different camera lens. There's a 200 degree one on the top and one on the bottom and this rig connects to the brains of the camera, so this is our little LCD screen and then in post everything gets stitched together and it'll remove the drone including the propellers. It takes a lot of skill to be FPV drone pilot, but with this you can kinda fake being an FPV drone pilot because it is capturing everything, so you can recapture and reframe and shoot as if you were actually shooting FPV. I'm sure this is going to upset a lot of FPV pilots, but don't worry your talent has not gone unnoticed and you guys are so incredibly talented at drone flying, I'm such a huge fan. This is the 3D edition, so you'll be able to shoot stereoscopic video, 180, you guys know that I've done a couple of 180 videos . The future of this is, basically the possibilities are endless because they can keep coming out with different pieces of this and you can make whatever type of camera that you want. This one is mine, so don't let anyone take it from me. (energetic techno music) - [Justine] These are great. - [Salesman] Yeah. - So I wanted to do an unboxing but I didn't bring a knife into CES because I was afraid I'd have to go through a metal detector, but guess what, we found a knife anyway. Look at this little guy. This is gonna be perfect on top of the Insta360. This is a nice little rig. Look at this, they even have little filters. Let's go vlog, so you've got the low setting, medium, high, high is really bright. Oh my gosh, it's a Yoga Synchro Visualizer. - [Yoga Synchro Visualizer] Begin to sense your center of gravity. Be the visual representation of the changes. Bring your arms down slowly. Exhale. - Am I in trouble? Should I go to the doctor? Should I go to the hospital immediately? I'm not sure if I'm okay. I asked if I was okay, but it was too loud in there, so I don't know, I mean should I go to the hospital, like what does this even mean, I don't know. I feel fine. This is my first time riding a motorcycle and it's electric. - 0 to sixty is in under 3 seconds. - Under 3 seconds. - Yes. - 0 to sixty. (motorcycle revving) - Oh, I'm so scared. I know it's not gonna go anywhere. So now all I need is a license and a live-wire. (calming music) I feel like we just transported into another dimension. (upbeat music) New this year at CES, not only will the rollable TV roll up, but you can also have it installed in a ceiling, so it can roll down. LG has the largest OLED 8K display, here is their booth. It is 88 inches and the screen is massive. So this arm reminds me, anytime I'm at the bank and I'm sitting talking to like the bank person and they're talking about bank things and they're like, I have some important information to show you and they spin it around, show you the information. Nice, rotates vertical too. Have you seen my latest Instagram story? Debuting today, at the bank. So you guys know that I've been a huge fan of the Wallpaper TV, but one of the biggest complaints that, well most people have, the sound bar was a little bit big. You just kinda didn't really know where to put it, but this, the TV is slightly thicker than the Wallpaper TV, but the sound bar is so incredibly thin that this makes so much more sense. This is the new design of the sound bar for the OLED Wallpaper TV. You guys have seen me unbox this before. I love the introduction of this new design because it is so much more slim and compact. (upbeat music) This is the Razer Kishi. It'll turn your phone into, basically it looks like an Nintendo Switch. This won so many awards here at CES and it's both IOS and Android compatible. It has pass-through power, so it'll also charge your phone. So this is Razer's concept 5G mesh router. It also has a built-in battery, so if you do want to take it on the go, definitely possible. So one of the trends recently is modular everything, you guys saw the Insta360 R, well this is a modular PC. This is their Tomahawk gaming desktop. Kevin just told me that you can build this thing within 30 seconds. All right, so we're hoping in Razer's simulator here. They said this is one of the most realistic simulators that you'll find. - [Razer Assistant] So just like a real car, down shift a couple of times. (upbeat music) - So I've been using the Atomos Ninja V for quite a long time now and I'm such a huge fan. Since I've started recording externally it has made everything so much easier to edit. So today we're checking out the Atomos Ninja V that is connected to the Nikon Z6 and one of the things that I'm most excited about this, is you can now shoot in ProRes Raw, so if you do have this camera you do have to send it in to get a FirmWare update to be able to shoot in ProRes Raw. I saw a really great demo of some of the footage that was shot on here and it looks incredible. When I said before that Amazon Alexa was integrated into over 100 000 devices, did you ever think that it would be integrated in a gas station. Very shortly at Exxon mobile stations you'll be able to say Alexa pay for gas, you'll then tell Alexa which pump you're at, the pump will activate, you pump your gas, get back in your car, drive away and it is automatically charged securely to your Amazon Pay. You can activate it using any Alexa devices, so you do have the Alexa App on your phone, so you can just use that, but if you have the ear buds, anything that's Alexa enabled that is connected to your Amazon account, you'll be able to drive away and pay. I need this now. Now if only the gas prices weren't so ridiculously expensive. I'm waiting for the Amazon electric car, where's that? Alexa, left side. There is goes.",

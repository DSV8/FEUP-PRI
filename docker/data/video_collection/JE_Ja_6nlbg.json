    "description": "Before my review of the Razer Phone 2 and Mercury Razer Blade, here are some early thoughts from the Razer event! Laptop Skins -   The new limited edition mercury razer blade looks stunning. It is one  of the best looking laptops I've seen this year. Spec'd out with a GTX 1070 Max-Q and the i7-8750H, it has awesome gaming performance and is still one of the best gaming laptops you can get in 2018  Background Music - The Break  If you want to support the channel, consider a Dave2D membership by clicking the Join button above!

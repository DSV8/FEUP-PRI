    "description": "Asus showcased the Zephyrus S -  GX531 and the STRIX II 17\" - GL704 today. Review coming soon but here's a first look at the hardware. Zephyrus S -  Strix II 17\" -   The Zephyrus S looks to be a really strong performer while coming in at only 15.7 mm thick. The Strix II 17\" has the world's first 144hz 3ms 17\" screen and is a very well cooled laptop. Both of these devices have ultra fast 144Hz 3ms screens.

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave 2D here. So Asus announced two new laptops today They're zephyrus S as well as the 17-inch Strix two, so the Zephyrs S is their thinnest gaming laptop They've ever made it's remarkably thin it's 15.7 millimetres thick So last year we had the zephyrus like the regular zephyrus and we saw devices from Acer like the Triton 700 which were really thin those were like 18-19 millimeters thick. This thing is fifteen point seven. It feels noticeably thinner so the design is Similar in the sense that it's got like the same kind of design language as the other Zephyrus models and it's made really well So we've changed a few things. It has an aluminum bottom panel. So the original Zephyrus had a plastic one I don't know if I like the metal. It feels more premium. It looks more premium But when you actually use it, the metal plate still has a little bit of flex So I'm not sure if they did for engineering reasons or marketing reasons or aesthetics But it is a metal plate on the bottom this year So when you open it up inside - the biggest change is actually the screen. The original Zephyrus had some pretty thick bezels These are significantly thinner and the panel has improved. Its a 144 Hertz 3 millisecond screen. It's fast. It's smooth It's a really nice looking screen. I think it has a 100% srgb. I would this is an engineering sample, right? So I wasn't able to run the full gamut of tests that I'd like to But it's a good-looking screen. The webcam still up at the top which is nice and there's a chin I don't love the fact there's a chin But you know if I'm gonna have a bezel anywhere I prefer it on the bottom other than the top and the sides But there is a chin. If you'll notice the whole keyboard is shifted down again So the original Zephyrs had a keyboard layout like this Where the keyboards on the bottom and the track pads on the right and it's something that you just have to get used to it Looks really weird and in terms of usability everyone's gonna be a little different I personally have no issues using a keyboard like this. The trackpad is not in an ideal position Like if you're left-handed you're screwed, but even for right-handed people it's not the best location. It's not so much the positioning for me It's the fact that I don't like my trackpad having no kind of like rests like a wrist rest for it But my keyboard I'm okay with. The keyboard actually feels like a regular desktop keyboard Like if you have one of those small compact keyboards where the keys are buttered up right to the edge of the chassis It feels like that at least for me, but everyone's gonna be a little bit different now the reason why they do this -- the reason why they have this entire shift in the first place just like the originals Zephyrus is They're trying to optimize cooling for the components at the top So when you shift it down like this You can put your thermal solution directly on top of the hottest stuff like your CPU and GPU You can cool it more aggressively but it does require to shift it down like this so the thermal solution they're using this year has slightly thinner blades and more blades which is supposed to help with cooling it down and it also has that lift like when you lift the The laptop screen that hinge lifts up to kind of increase air flow I always wondered if this was some kind of gimmick the truth is I'll never be able to tell I'm not a engineer But my guess is that if you're opening a hole on the side of the device like this How can it not help with thermals? Right? I-I think it's a good thing I was able to run 3d mark a couple times on this and the thermals are really good It is just an engineering sample and I was expecting it to throttle a little bit None of it I mean if they're able to cool something like this this thin then I feel like other companies should be able to do the same thing Biggest disadvantage I see with this thing though is the battery size It's a 50 watt our battery -- wasn't able to run any tests on it, but logic would dictate that This is probably what a four hour battery at best So if you need for the full day, you'll have to bring a charger with you. But yeah, super thin gaming laptop that Honestly has no real compromises and that's that's a nice product Pricing. I'm not sure maybe my guess is like Two grand maybe a little bit less comes in a 10 70 max Q version and we talked about the graphics card But it's a 10 70 max Q and you can think you can get a 10 60 variant for a little bit less But that's that. Okay Strix to 17-inch real quick I did a review of the 15 inch model Love that device one of the best cool devices on the market right now for that 15 inch kind of mid to your premium segment It's not cheap, but it's made really really well. I mean these are built -- they're built to last I think that's the big thing about the Strix devices like their gaming laptops But they're built a little bit better than a lot of the other devices they cost a little bit more But you're getting some premium components. This device -- I think the thing that makes it special is the 17 inch 144 Hertz three millisecond screen So I think it's the first of its kind -- really fast really smooth Like if you're into competitive gaming and you have to use a laptop This is like a it's a nice screen for that. Good laptop -- I haven't really used it much. Obviously these are both engineering samples but that's basically it. Two devices from Asus that I think are pretty interesting ones. Particularly this thing I Would I would consider using this as my daily? I mean once the review units come in, I'll check it out Give a more thorough examination on it, but I like it. Okay Hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs you loved it. See you guys next time",

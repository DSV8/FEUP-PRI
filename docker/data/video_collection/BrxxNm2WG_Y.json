    "transcript": "i'm really excited about today's video because i bought via craigslist knife battling this insane looking msi gaming prebuilt and today we're gonna do some heinous things to it now just by looking at the box you can see that this is not your common garden gaming pre-built i mean look at it it's got little ears although considering that it's an msi prebuilt it's probably gonna have at least one trouser whoopsie over the course of this video it does it does have a smell uh you know when you were a little kid and you'd like go to someone else's house that smelled very distinctly different to yours it kind of is that vibe it just smells like someone else's house which is interesting oh yes there we go that is best pc ever now i'm quite conflicted by the looks of this thing because the adult in me is going that's pretty garish but the child in me is like it looks like a gundam's head what more could you want in a pc although in terms of build quality it does do that the front i o is pretty standard we've got a couple of square usb ports and a type c port on the front some front audio headers and then we want some and cool which i haven't seen in a while a front hdmi port for vr nice now if we have a look at the side you can see that the layout of this case is actually quite interesting we have the graphics card panel here which has a bit of mesh and then plastic for some reason i guess plastic covered ventilation looks more gondomy i don't know and in the base of the system we have a surprisingly losery looking power supply which does not bode well for what's coming later in this video and then around the back we have what looks like a standard msi motherboard which is good and you can see that it's kind of behind the graphics card so this is laid out kind of like a dan case on the inside aside from the power supply placement in the base but with that let's open up this very war-scarred gundam and have a look at the insides now this is a gtx 1070 which means this isn't the newest pre-built as you can probably tell by the condition of it but it's still a very solid graphics card and this is a really nice version i like that they have some mesh behind the bit of perspex you know they got to think about airflow in these situations in the top of the case we have the mandatory gpu illuminating rgb if you have a look under the graphics card it looks like there's some real interesting stuff going on inside optimus prime's head so let's dig a bit deeper no way is that an empty single laptop ram slot on the back of the motherboard okay now we really need to get that graphics card out to see what's going on on the other side of this motherboard yeah there we go whoa no way what is this thing so on the back of the graphics card we have this blower style fan that is used for cooling the cpu down here so this i think is an i7 7700 that we have under there which is a quad-core cpu with these two heat pipes that run up into here and then this fan blows heat out the back of the case that is not a whole lot of cooling solution if i'm honest and then right next to that we have the absolute holy grail of pre-built ram configurations a single 8 gig stick of laptop memory hell yeah msi hell yeah okay so i just spent the last three hours screwing to get this base loose but hopefully we have access to the power supply now let's see it comes off it's an fsp unit and it's it's 450 watts uh this is not gonna go well but before we do anything heinous to it let's fire it up and see what kind of temperatures we get from this weird laptop desktop hybrid now that is the unfortunate problem with buying a used prebuilt is you can't see what kind of venereal disease it's loaded down with out of the box because this seems like it's a user windows reinstall here is our 7700 and our 8 gigs of laptop ram running at 2400 megahertz let's have a look at the gaming performance starting off that gtx 1070 is only sitting at about 40 percent utilization uh now the cpu is higher than that it's about 63 utilization which means say it with me kids we have a bottleneck going on and we can only guess what it is right now granted there's not much power draw going on but those temperatures are really surprising that's actually pretty impressive now in all fairness considering the cpu utilization which briefly jumped to 90 uh the ram configuration may not be the only problem we have here but we'll test that a bit later with that let's try a more demanding game and see how it how it handles that okay so with battlefield 5 at 1080p high settings that cpu is working a lot harder than the graphics card that's interesting uh i wonder how much oh okay nevermind i wonder how much of that is due to the memory configuration i'm not sure how much of an effect a single channel laptop ram configuration has on a desktop systems performance so i'll drop a full kit in in a second but first i think we should try a another game wow the power draw on that cpu is very low considering the hundred percent utilization uh now it isn't a k variant of the cpu so unfortunately we can't overclock it above four gigahertz but considering that we're creeping up to about 70 degrees celsius there's not a massive amount of headroom left in the cooling solution okay so i've been running the game for about half an hour and temperatures are fine uh the cpu has topped out at about 73 degrees celsius and the gpu is in the mid-60s honestly all things considered i was expecting a hell of a lot worse uh but having said that let's play around with the ram configuration and then try and make it explode now in order to see how much the single stick of laptop ram is kneecapping the performance of this system i'm gonna drop in this dual channel kit that runs at 3200 megahertz it's double the ram and it runs faster so let's see what a difference it makes it's really annoying that you have to remove the graphics card just to change out the ram under there oh lift it out like that now this is the ram that it comes with is standard it's a single eight gig stick running at 2400 megahertz so hopefully the slightly less stupid memory configuration will help out a little bit uh i guess this is why they used laptop ram on this motherboard because spacing is a problem i get it use laptop ram to compensate for your terrible layout i'm really curious to see what that's going to do because this does seem suspiciously like one of those thermal management via ram kneecapping situations oh this gpu mounting is really terrible is that is that in this it doesn't it's stuck on come on cause it's okay there we go i think we're making yes okay there we go i think it's in that is the most oem pre-built reassembly process ever wow that's made a big difference so this person has been running this system for years with a single enking's thing of laptop ram in it and it really makes me wonder how many people are currently running single channel laptop ram configurations in desktop gaming prebuilt that is a that is a sad thought granted we do have more than 10 degrees higher temperatures on the cpu now because of the ram upgrade so again i was kind of right with the whole thermal management situation well i guess the last thing left to do is see if we can make this pc explode what i've decided to do was drop the most powerful graphics card i have that'll fit in this case which is an rtx ti now for those of you with functioning short term memory you'll remember that this pc only has a 450 watt power supply in it that we can't upgrade and considering that trying to power an rtx 3080 ti with a 450 watt power supply is a little bit like trying to power a tesla with a double a battery it may not go very well but i'm hoping that the cpu in here will bottleneck the graphics card enough that it won't want to draw enough power to just explode the pc so let's see if that works otherwise we'll have to under clock and undervolt the graphics card uh but basically we're going to find a way for this to work so let's drop that in there and see how it goes wow this case is pretty much the worst case condition you can run a founder's edition rtx 3080 in because this fan on the back is gonna be squished right up against that so that may not go very well but again i'm counting on this just laptop ram powered 7700 to keep this graphics card in check enough that nothing explodes whoa that is nearest makes no difference flush with the back of the case i am i'm so sorry big guy okay well let's hope this goes okay now taking it one step at a time uh let's see if it starts that's a good start hey we've booted into windows with it it's drawing a lot of power but we're okay for the time being ah there it goes no there it goes uh we're definitely gonna have to uh throttle it it's actually not turning back on maybe the power supply trip let's see no it didn't that's concerning um going by the smell down here i i actually think we killed the power supply so the most important thing here is that the graphics card's fine so let me quickly plug it into a system and see if it's okay okay i i really hope this still works so let's flip that on and then that is a fan and we've got a signal out yay uh so the graphics card's fine that's good uh now we need to go see what happened to the pc now i've put the 1070 back in the system and maybe it works with this let's see oh it's not firing up with the 1070 in it either oh no i killed it it's the 3080 ti was too much for it and the power supply just committed horror carry it it just died oh no at least the 3080 ti is fine that's that's the main thing um but let's let's open up the base and have a look at the power supply it smells like pc death down here i'm not gonna lie i can i can really smell the pc death take this off yeah it's dead uh i killed it fsp you clearly didn't design the power supply in a way that it'll protect itself because it didn't although this was definitely extreme negligence on my part and you know me shifting blame but still i feel like it shouldn't just have died like that but on that note let's quickly open it up and very carefully have a look inside now it is very dense so it's difficult to have a close look in all of the nooks and crannies in here but i actually don't see any obvious damage in here uh then again i don't really know what i'm looking for it was a very anticlimactic power supply death there wasn't even a pop or anything it just switched off but it's definitely dead i did also try and power it up without a graphics card in it or anything and there's there's no power going from this into the system like something catastrophic happened and uh with that i don't really know what else to say other than i am a pc murderer i guess and i am extremely glad that 3080 ti is fine uh so yeah thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video subscribe to the channel maybe consider watching another video where i don't destroy a prebuilt a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video thank you for watching bye you",

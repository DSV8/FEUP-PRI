    "transcript": "This is 10Base5 the very first type of Ethernet that was invented devices or PCS would be connected to the Ethernet network of with vampire Taps such as this so we'd have a transceiver cable would be pierced and we would connect to the network using this vampire tap. Here's one example and here's one that's actually working I've got a Windows 311 computer connected via transceiver vampire tap to a 10Base5 Network, the other side of the cable connects to the Cisco router which in turn connects via Ethernet to a Starlink. Starlink obviously connects via the satellites to the internet. Let's see if I can ping devices on internet I'll open up a DOS prompt ping google.com as you can see there pings are succeeding to google.com. Old technology very new technology. Old Ethernet two Satellite technology I'm able to ping google.com and other websites on the internet using this old computer.",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and Jenna, you can't see her, she's behind the stuff. - Hi! - You guys know that I do a lot of videos about tech, and lot of times companies will send things to my management company or send me to review and I don't get a chance to do them when they send, so this is what happened. This is gonna be a massive unboxing of a lot of things. And some of the things that you'll see here I will be making videos about later on, but I just wanna get them all unboxed. The last time that I did one of the massive tech hauls, I gave away some Amazon goodies to you guys, and it was actually really difficult 'cause I was like mailing you guys things, so this time I'm just gonna send an Amazon gift card, I'm gonna choose two people. I'm not sure which platform, so you guys have to be on top of it on all platforms, so on YouTube leave me a comment below, tweet me on Twitter @iJustine, and leave an Instagram comment on the Instagram photo from this video. It'll be a thumbnail, it'll look like this, a bunch of stuff. - I'm so overwhelmed. - I am too, I'm not really sure where to start. Let's clear some space, so we can do this like one at a time or something, I don't know. - (groans) My god, it feels like Christmas. - You also got this, didn't you? - I did, I did a little Twitter unboxing. - You already unboxed it? - I did, I even like, we put it to like the Gears of War music. - Oh my gosh, I'm so behind. Oh, god, this is-- - Oh, it also was very hard to open that. - [Justine] Believably industrial. - But you're doing a good job. - [Justine] Ow! - Yes. - Oh my gosh, there's more stuff to open. (laughs) Whoa. - Yeah, there's a lotta things in here. - Really? - Yeah. - [Justine] Oh my goodness, this is so great. - I'm prepping the trash bag. - This is for Gears of War 5. - This is so cool though, keep-- - Okay what do we have? - Keep going, there's surprises in the bottom. - Oh my, what? - Cookies! Course. - Cookies? - It's really cool. (gasps) There's also this really cool, figure. - Oh my god, I love this, this is the Xbox Pro charging stand. - I've been using that actually. It's, - It's really nice, I've seen these. - incredible. I have a two station set up in my room now, so I have the new Xbox Elite controller, and then I have that on the other side of the bed. - This is really nice, look at that. - In case I don't wanna like, get up. - Is there a controller in there to match? - Yeah. Yeah, so here's the controller. - No, oh my gosh, this is so nice. - Also another thing for your table. - (gasps) Yes, I have the Gears of War 4 on my coffee table right now! - A T-shirt. (plastic rustles) - A Gear 5 Rockstar Energy Drink? (slurps) - Also, a Seagate game drive. - No way, this is nice. (both gasp) - A book. - Another book, oh it's a novel. - I don't think I got the, I don't think I got a book. - Well, they knew you don't read. - I read. - Six months ultimate game pass. Okay, so I'm gonna give this away to somebody, also on Twitter so pay attention to Twitter, I'm gonna tweet it out, it's only gonna be good for one person though so. We're gonna need a bigger trash can. - Ah. Ah. Oh, the shoulder. - Oh my gosh, this matches me! (controller clicks) - [Jenna] Did you take the batteries out? - I did not. - Another game pass. - Hm, mm, nice. Okay yeah, I guess I can give away two. I think I needa turn the air conditioner on, I'm sweating. Are you sweaty? Is it because I'm wearing a big sweatshirt? - It's weird, 'cause I'm usually always sweaty. - Hm. Okay. Jenna. - Have you opened the Xbox yet? - There's an Xbox? - No. - You ruined the surprise! - Sorry, wait is there a controller in there as well? - Oh. What did you do with the knife? - These are pretty noise-canceling. - Oh my god, those are cool, lemme see. - Like I couldn't even hear you. - Are they Razer? They are Razer. - They are, yeah. (gasps) Speaking of, these. These are the kitty, - Can I have those? - these are the kitty edition, and they light up so, kind of excited. (laughs) - I need a headset for my gaming. - Wow. - This is beautiful. I still use - It is. - my Gears of War 4 Xbox. Okay, you guys need to look how incredible this is. The attention to detail, it's like inset. - It's amazing. That looks really good. That's a real nice winter look. - This is honestly, out of all of the Xboxes that I have seen other than the pink camo one that I custom-made myself-- - Braggy. - Mm-hm, there're only two of them in the whole world. This is amazing. - It's so good. - This is unbelievable, what an incredible press kit. Oh, and this T-shirt is nice quality too! I'll tell you what, - This-- - I get a lot of free T-shirts from like events. - The Xbox ones are always incredible. - They're always nice. - They're really great. - Okay, so maybe I'll just clear out some space and we'll open up the next thing. (electronics clatter) Jenna is putting herself into the box. - [Jenna] I'm not going in the box! - So I was gonna open this, but this is Razer, so I'm gonna open this with all of the Razer accessories that we have, so let's continue on the Xbox train. Choo-choo! Choo-choo. So I already know what this is 'cause I saw a bunch of people already unbox this so it's kind of like a spoiler, but this is a Taco Bell Xbox. (squeals) - Oh my god. - [Justine] Woop! - Oh my gosh, what is this? - [Justine] Okay, so. - [Both] Whoa! - Okay, well. This has a unique silver-to-black ombre fade design, comes with the new Xbox Elite controller. - What? - Ermahgerd. - The Elite controller is incredible. (gasps) We've been using it, playing Call of Duty, what? - It even makes the Taco Bell bong sounds when you power it on. (refrigerator thuds) - Okay, this looks nice. - Oh. - I love this, because it's so super subtle. - [Jenna] It's ombre. - Okay, ready? (Xbox dings) Oh my gosh. - Ermahgerd. - Oh my goodness. I can't even believe it. - Okay, wait a minute, is this? - This is the, the smallest things have just, I am shaking. - Is this like one of those things - Shaking. - where it's like, you turn on the Xbox, you hear that sound, and then you're automatically like salivating? (slurps) I understand what you're doing Taco Bell. (Xbox dings) Oh. - We need to hear the Gears one, oh this video's gonna be 25 hours long. Okay, ready for Gears? (Xbox crackles) Whoa. It was a real frosty crackle. - You're a real frosty crack, ah! (laughs) - We might need to take Jenna to the hospital. Okay there's still more, (gasps) to this, - There's so much stuff. (muffled whispering) - to unbox. The Elite wireless controller. - [Jenna] Oh. - Oh my goodness, the Elite controller. You guys, it is worth it. I pre-ordered it at E3 while we were looking at it. Like this thing is just beautiful. - What's in here? (laughing) - This says \"Enjoy the new Sport Blue controller, Xbox.\" Wait a minute. (screams) - Oh look at that hoodie! - Hold on, this is somethin' I'm into. - Oh. Oh, that is super nice. - Sorry, I think, this, it's Lululemon. (zipper whooshes) Oh, I actually remember, they asked me for your size. Yeah, why didn't you ask me for my size? (screams) - Look how nice this is! Okay, all right, oh my gosh, okay. Oh my gosh how, this is so sweet and so thoughtful, I love Lululemon. - That's a good color, it's like one of my favorite colors. - It is a nice color. Do you see anything over there that's Razer? Hyped about that. - Oh my god. - Also hyped about this. So one of these is for you actually. So-- (laughs) - Bye. - This is something that I wanted to do a complete video about, but I ran out of time, but this is so awesome. So this is like a microphone that you can connect to the Razer Synapse app, and you can add emojis onto it. - I saw it on Twitter, and I was like, this is incredible, and then I came over and I saw it in real life and I was like, open it, woman. - Ugh, I can't wait to try this out. I'm also redoing a little gaming station for a PC setup. So stay tuned for that video. - Oh, it's cute. - So now I'm gonna have all these great accessories to go with it. What is this over here, what do we have, this is the new, (laughs) Huntsman the Tournament Edition. - We're just really gettin' in there, it's for gamers, by gamers. (gasps) - Oh yeah. - It's so nice, oh gosh. Yes, yes yes yes yes. - Think I messed something up. I did. Did I? - This looks like a Best Buy exploded. - Yeah maybe, do you wanna grab a PC? - Yes. - So, the pink Chroma, it is in my-- - I know where it is. Okay, I found this. Beautiful. (gasps) - God, this is just, it is one of my most, I think prized possessions, I will not even joke. - Hey. But look how nice this fits in here, to the keyboard. - [Justine] Thoughtful. - It's super thoughtful, and super flat. - Windows is updating, great. Let's open up these. As much as I've always tried to like not like pink because that's like a stereotypical girl thing, I've decided I don't care what you think, and I'm going to like what I want. - I don't really like pink. I like purple. - That's fine. Okay. - Chroma Kitty. No. - So these are, yeah, these are the newest version, so what's really cool is these also light up, and if you're a streamer, it will also react to your audience, they say, which is kind of interesting, so the different colors will change. Okay, wait, I've got things stuck on me. Yeah, oh yay, these are cool. - Cleanup crew. Cleanup, cleanup, everybody. (boxes clatter) - [Jenna] Oh. - Okay, we're setting up the Razer Hunstman Tournament Edition, so while I'm setting this up, do you wanna maybe bring in our next victim? - [Jenna] We'll stick to gaming. - Okay. So I'm gonna be making a separate video about this, but, I just needed to get it unboxed and set up, 'cause this is so, it's gonna be great. - It's so cute. - [Justine] Super cute. - So this is the Sega Genesis Mini. - Mini! Okay well wait, look at my ears, am I lighting up? - [Jenna] Wait. - [Cameraman] Yes. - I'm lit! - Wait a minute, are these all the games, 40 classic games? - Plus two bonus titles. - Plus two bonus title, I, oh Tetris! - So there's 42. - Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Spinball, Golden Axe. This is gonna be fun. - Hm. - This is super exciting. Oh my goodness, oh my gosh! - Oh, oh! (gasps) - Sega Genesis. - Look how cute this is. - [Jenna] What's this? - That's the Tower Mini. And look, it even has like a little cartridge and everything. (plastic crinkles) Wow. - Oh, it's cute. Ooh! - So, I think this all like stacks on top of each other. All right, there we go. (claps) A true fan. This is gonna be super fun. It's also gonna be a big throwback. Look, we plug these in, we can play together. - This is gonna be fun. - I just always like a full-size controller. The controller is bigger than the console. Okay, what should we open next? Oh my gosh. - This is cool. - Okay. - I use mine every day. I've already made two videos about it. - Really? - Yeah. - Ooh. Oh, I did see you make this video! No way, okay this is what I'm most hyped about, because you can charge your AirPods. - [Jenna] And-- - What? - Your Apple Watch. And your phone. Shooketh. - All of the things. - It's like if Air Power was a thing. - This is, I'm traveling with this now. A wireless phone charger, AirPods, and Apple Watch all at the same time. So-- - It's very convenient. - Movin' on. Movin' on, movin' on - I'm slacking on my cleanup. Did you say you wanted to open a box? - What's this? Oh, so clearly we're going on the iPhone case party. - These are the Gear 4 Ultimate Impact Protection cases, apparently. - Oh, this one's nice, this is like yellow. Hello. (gasps) I'll be opening-- - Have you seen? (gasps) - Open that up. - This is a look. - Oh, no that is a look. Mm, this is really nice. What makes these so special? - \"Our tough \"and stylish cases feature a D3O smart technology \"which is trusted by motorcyclists, sports professionals, \"and even the military.\" - These also were sent, and I'm, kind of overwhelmed. This has a purse attached to it. And like a little wallet, and a chain. Okay. (gasps) Do you like it? - Okay so I thought, I looked over, and you know like those measuring tapes where you're like, need to measure something? I thought that's what you had on you. I will say, the idea, when I see people that're like I'm wearing my phone, I'm like, that's convenient. 'Cause you're just like, hur-oop. - Look at this pink. - I'm gonna go over here and brush my hair. I'm gonna get a trash bag, - Okay. - because I have a smol OCD and the trash is bothering me. - Okay. - What do we got next Just? - Oh my gosh, okay so I got you one of these. I was on the Kickstarter - Me? - so long ago for the SwitchPod, you guys have already seen tons of people open these up, but they're pretty cool, so they have SwitchPod, I have one for you. We've also got some DJI Osmo accessories, I got a Pixelbook over here, so I guess while you open that up, I'm gonna open up the Osmo accessories. So this is the Pocket waterproof case, which I'm super hyped about. Yeah, nice. - Oh, oh my gosh, this looks like some type of weapon. (blows out) - [Justine] Yes! (gasps) - What's that? - This is for the Osmo. For under water. The Osmo Pocket? Osmo Pocket. Ah! Definitely could be a weapon. (tripod clanks) Ooh, - Ugh. - the extension rod. Yeah, this is gonna be fun. Jenna, I wanna, - I feel like a sprinkler. - go on an adventure. (tripod clanks) What do we have next? (gasps) - I can't believe that you bought these for me, you are so kind. - I actually did buy these. Because, - For me. - well, I bought them for my new office, - For-- - and then I never end up setting them up. - I'm actually really excited about these, I tried to get them but they've been like back-ordered. - I ordered them awhile ago. - Makes sense. 'Scuse me. Ah! - Oh! (laughs) Whoa! You can plug in three in one! - So we did that. (laughs) - We did do that. So when I am ready to set these up, you connect it to the Hue app, which is great because you can control the colors, you can assign it to a room, you can then connect it to your smart home and, control, it's very bright, I'm staring at it. - There's more stuff. - I'm gonna get a little container to put all this stuff in, so that it doesn't get separated. - Ooh, little stand-y stand. - See, we'll put all of, it's very bright, it hurts my eyes. - I know, I can't tell what's happening. - So we'll put all this in here. Then it's time, to set it up. - Okay, we've got a lot more things here. - We do, we're almost done guys, I promise. - Ooh, these are the Sony noise-canceling ear buds. - This is the new Nest Mini, and I have the new Pixelbook Go. Thank you. Incredible. I'm so excited - Oops, well-- - [Justine] to try this out. - I used these on the way back from New York, and I really like them because it's nice, because they're noise-canceling. These are the Sony WF-1000XM3. - Look how cute this is! I'm ready to go. Pixelbook Go. (gasps) Nest Mini, excited to try that. 'Kay, - Nest Mini? - [Justine] Pixelbook is updating. - What's Nest Mini? Small and mighty. - Small and mighty, you're small and mighty. My update, two minutes away. Gosh, this bag is so nice. It said it's made exclusively for Google. (gasps) Wow, it's nice. - Small and mighty. - They came in a few new colors as well. Is there anything else that we're missing? I think that's just about everything. We've got some updates that've happened. So this is the editor, which is kind of awesome because you can edit the little emoji here in the little editor, so there's like a little J, that's me! And, the emote shows up here, and it's cool because you basically can put like anything on there. If you're a streaming, you can set up alerts so that when someone subscribes, or donates, you can have it do cool stuff. And you can also have that happen on your headset. Did my, I, did my ears change colors? What if we turned off the lights? - [Cameraman] Let's try. - Yeah, just hit that light, hit that big boy. Okay. Test. Am I, is my head doing something? Does it match this? Everyone's shaking their head yes, so I'm, (laughs) I think that that's something. This is-- - You don't even have to be good at games 'cause I'm just distracted by all the lights. - I know, right? You can change it to do like spectrum cycling. - [Jenna] (gasps) You're all pink. - Am I? Oh, this is so fun. What do I look like, is a question. Do I look silly? Oh look at this, this is the fire. (plastic crackling) I'm gonna have to say, this is probably, other than the Gears Xbox, I think like my favorite. Oh, also the Gears cookies. - Well, they're not Gears cookies, they're just Chips Ahoy. - Well yeah but they came in the Gears gift box, that's so sweet of them. Okay, let's turn the lights back on. (claps) - Oh my god! - Magic! Razer, thank you, Xbox, thank you, DJI thank you, Google thank you, thank you everyone for, - Sony, thank you. - Sony, oh my gosh, this was an incredible unboxing. This is probably the biggest unboxing I've ever done. Sega Genesis thank you, oh my gosh, thank you to everyone. Thank you to you guys for watching. This was amazing, and don't forget, I am doing a giveaway for a few Amazon gift cards. Thanks everyone for making my dreams come true. - This is so overwhelming. - I gotta set up my Pixelbook now. - I'm gonna go. - Okay, bye. Sorry I kept you so long. - It's, there's just, it's fine, this hostage situation had cookies, so. (chill music)",

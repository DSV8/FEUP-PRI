    "transcript": "Do you know what these are? These are network taps it allows me to basically tap into a network and see the traffic sent between devices. In this topology I've got two Cisco switches, a Kali machine which is connected to switch 1 and a phone which is connected to switch 2 and I'm tapping the traffic between the two switches. This Kali machine has an IP address of 10.1.3.4 and I'm going to ping that IP address from the phone the pings are succeeding and what I'll do now on my Mac is open up Wireshark so as an example if I filter for ICMP traffic I can see traffic sent from 10.1.3.5 to 10.1.3.4 and I can see the layer 2 information, I can see its Mac address going to VMware, I can then see the 802.1Q encapsulation. They can ping each other but the switches indicate to one another which VLAN the traffic belongs to. Here's the reply I can then see for instance the IP addresses of the devices and then I can see the actual ICMP message and any data. A network tap allows me to basically tap into a network and capture traffic.",

    "transcript": "the Intel Core i9 9900k the world's best gaming cpu that makes AMD look good what's up guys I'm Dmitri with Hardware Canucks and today is a good day because we get to see performance numbers on this new processor and this whole fiasco will definitely come to an end but Intel still in the hot waters with reviewers and consumers especially from a value perspective and also trying to fudge the numbers that didn't work that well for them then as you'll see in this video the 9900K as expected it is powerful its power efficient it tops all the gaming charts but it also does highlight the competition and its strengths not just within AMD but also with different generation of Intel processors like 8700K so I'll do the full analysis right after this so you're looking for something with class good value comfortably populate an ATX motherboard are you it's all about the user experience and great airflow who knew your temperatures would drop that low route the cables behind the cover illuminate your hardware with built-in LEDs the age 500 I is for you to discover this one's in real life not in your dreams say hello to the link below the HR 100 series from NZXT is a go so first of all the new nine generation coffee-like processor lineup looks pretty promising 9600K 9700K although that one doesn't have hyper threading and that's kind of weird and then the 9900K which is an 8 core 16 thread part so it should check off a lot of the boxes for productivity because of high thread count and gaming because of the high clock counts especially because it can boost to 5 gigahertz on its own obviously with the coffee lake ecosystem you can expect good overclocking I have my 8600K running at 5 gigahertz my 8700K at 4.6 but I can push that to 5 gigahertz no problem and the same is expected hopefully with the ninth gen coffee lake CPUs and we'll touch on overclocking but later for the 9900K you know everything is kind of there except value and so this is where we start talking about the price the pre-order price of 580 dollars for the 9900K now that price is interesting because if you take a look at the competition you know the 8 core 16 thread part from AMD would be the 2700X and that's around $300 and then they're a bunch of bundles and deals that include the motherboard so you can buy a motherboard Z or X 470 and the 2700X CPU and still have a bit left over versus buying the new 9900K by itself so value wise definitely it doesn't favor Intel but also if you look at the 8700K you know if your team Intel and want to go with the higher clock counts if you're using video production with the new quick sync support 8700K is a fantastic chip you can still buy this 8700K with a Z370 motherboard and that will still be less than the pre-order price for the 9900K the price in Europe for this new chip is 650 euros that is expensive my friends and so if you look at a bigger picture the 9900K may be the best CPU gaming processor but obviously it's also the most expensive especially when considering you can purchase entire CPU and motherboard combos for less than five hundred and eighty dollars now because the 9900K is on core and thread parity to the rise in 2700X so if you want that many cores and threads for productivity and gaming - I've highlighted in the benchmarks so you can kind of visualize on where the 9900K sits in comparison to the 2700X here's the specifications for our test bed system running the same cooler and both chips running the same memory and latency on both rise in an Intel let's begin with the benchmarks starting off with Cinebench r15 the 9900K does beat out a 2700X and the 2000 points is pretty strong well done this is in a multi-core test in the single core test because of the higher clock speeds we definitely see a nice little significant boost in there - versus the rest of the inter lineup and obviously 2700X as well looking at PC Mark Creative Suite test it does top the chart obviously but only what 400 points more versus 2700X so the difference there is not that significant but it does score higher same thing with the home conventional test where the 2700X I'm guessing because the slightly lower clock speeds is kind of at the bottom of the chart there for W prime and single-core test performance is quite strong thanks to those clock speeds but then multi-core benchmark and the gap closes between the 2,700X so not really significant difference there moving on to Aida 64 CPU AES benchmark look at how far below the 9900K is below the 2,700X the same thing with the CPU hash benchmark yeah like 2.5x performance on the 2700X which is quite nice in Aida FPU test the 9900K tops the chart so pretty good performance there in either 64 photoworks so it simulates photo environment the higher clock speeds are better here but again the difference here isn't that significant but versus the 2700X and even the 8700K and definitely keep a lookout on where the 8700K sits so that you can kind of compare on what the two additional cores at these benchmarks so here's some real-world processing benchmarks 7-zip 9900K is powerful but look at the you know massive lineup above it it does beat out the 2700 by quite a lot though and whenever our that performance gap widens quite a bit tops the chart very nice moving on to pov-ray the 9900K beats out the 2700X but the higher core counts on the other CPUs above it definitely benefit with this benchmark and hen breaks the 9900K again beats out the 2700X but not that significant and there plenty of other CPUs that perform better in the GIMP this is where the core clock counts for the 9900K it does atop the chart right there along with the 8700K and 3dsmax the higher core and clock counts definitely benefit here the 9000k leaves the 2700X and the 8700K quite behind there in blender same situation slightly higher performance versus 2700 X but many other CPUs with the higher core counts above it that perform better and finally Adobe Premiere this is what QuickSync off the 9900K performs very well right along the lines of like the really expensive 7980XE and I'll definitely do more Adobe Premier testing with quick Singh support utilizing that Intel UHD 630 graphics versus the 8700K and the 8600K and I'm hoping that because of the additional two cores and higher clock counts that I will see a significant improvement in rendering performance versus what I use now on the 8700K but now let's begin with the gaming benchmarks starting with 3D mark firestrike the 9900K performs very well almost 25,000 points here but the 8700K tails just a little behind that 23.4 and almost 21,000 for the 2700X for the time Spidy X 12 CPU benchmark the 9900 K is quite powerful 11,000 points over here while just under 9,000 for the 2700X and look at how below the 8700K is well for the entire time Spidey x12 benchmark the 9900K tops the chart over here at 9600 81 points and just nine thousand three hundred points for the 2700X so it's not that far behind moving on to Battlefield 1 and DX12 so yes the 9900K is the top performer it is the best gaming CPU it tops the chart over here but look at that it's only for frame difference versus the 8700K which is much cheaper and then about what 17 frames versus 2700X and when you're gaming it that high frame rate anyway does it really matter and again when you look at the value equation the 9900K is 67% more expensive than the current price of the 8700K at around $390 $380 dollars but it's only giving you 3 percent extra performance in bf1 hmm moving on to Deus Ex mankind divided and dx2 again the 9900K tops the charts of course but at what cost moving on to GTA 5 again it's a chart topper and the separate itself quite nicely from the 2700X but then that 8700K is right below and that's 6 FPS difference really is down that significant but a very powerful chip regardless same thing in the overwatch it tops the chart that what almost 300 frames per second but so do the rest of them over 250 frames per second on every single CPU in this chart so that performance you know that performance King when you're looking at something over 250 FPS does it really matter moving on to Cod infinite warfare so all the CPUs are powerful no issues here no bottlenecking and the same idea with doom at Vulcan at that 200 FPS frame cap now if you want to read the full review with many more gaming benchmarks make sure to read it in the scription below and you know the past few weeks have been kind of crazy with the RTX 2070 launch with Michael and Eber in Beijing so these benchmarks are not in the full scope of what we normally deliver but definitely stay tuned for more because the 9900K it's a it's a powerful beast of course but then how does it compare to others that are so much cheaper then that performance gap really isn't really worth it for that giant price hike moving on to power consumption and this is actually pretty impressive with a new 9 gen family so the 9900K has two additional course versus the 8700K yet it's more power efficient at load and at idle too and it's kind of they consume about this much power as the 2700X at load so the power bills are not as much as they would be versus the other CPUs in the stack and that's really good to see power efficiency on both AMD and an Intel with this eight core 16 thread parts now I am excited to see what we can do with the dhobi premier and what type of performance we get where video production where the core clocks are much higher versus Rison and that's a huge benefit with Adobe and the second thing is so many cores and threats to you know for all the processing tasks to just happen which is awesome that was for overclocking I have my notes here from Patrick our motherboard reviewer so he was able to push the 9900K to 5.1 gigahertz at 1.35 volts and he was even able to achieve 5.2 gigahertz stable with the exact same voltage for gaming and day to day but Cinebench r15 with crash therefore deeming the overclock not 100 percent reliable so overclocking 9900 gain is very similar to what you find doing on the 8700k but what we're told is that the memory controller on the 9900K is weaker than on the previous 8700K chips so you need to give more voltage to the memory controller to achieve higher clock speeds on memory on this new a9 processor and also he was not able to run ddr4 at 3866 megahertz on the asus strix z390 email the board while every recent Intel motherboard was able to achieve that memory speed no problem so therefore most likely something is happening in the BIOS on that z390 motherboard that will have to be probably updated in the future in terms of the actual speed performance improvement with that 5.1 gigahertz overclock we had a nice Cinebench r15 score of 2179 so giving us roughly about the hundred point boost in Cinebench r15 versus when the cpu was running at stock and finally the peak temperature that was recorded with the 9900K at 5.1 gigahertz was 87 degrees Celsius which is basically identical as what you would find with the 8700K at five gigahertz with that identical 1.35 volts and so there you have it the 9900K is out it's powerful its power efficient that overclockeds well just like in 8700K wood but the price point that price Delta between it and let's say an 8700K or the 2700X does not reflect the performance difference between those CPUs and therefore you kind of have to ask yes it's the best gaming CPU right now but from a value perspective it makes no sense because you can buy a motherboard and the chip for that much money and performance difference I mean it's there but you decide if it's worth to you and so my recommendation is still looking to the 8700K it's still cheaper to buy that a motherboard then the 9900K by itself look into the horizon 2700X performance there is lower in gaming because the clocks are not higher but that's just the nature of aim D versus Intel debate but in terms of its overall umbrella performance is really good on both 8700 K and the 2700X and so yeah if you don't need the best of the best just might as well set off something that performs very similar to the best but is a lot less alright so that is it for me make sure to check out this other relevant content subscribe to a new boot sequence Channel and we'll see you in the next video",

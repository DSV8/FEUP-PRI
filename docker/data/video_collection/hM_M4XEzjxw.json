    "transcript": "What's up, guys, Lew here back with another video and today... I hope to blow your mind. And my own, while I'm at it It's called \"Smart Hologram\". It's a hologram for your smartphone. Or, it's a lens, that allows you to display holograms on your smartphone. Doesn't matter if you got an iPhone, an Android phone... If you can watch YouTube videos on your phone, like this one, you're watching, then you can, supposedly, with a device like this, display holograms. As you can see, there's some basic instructions here on how it all clips together. And then you can simply search 3D hologram videos on YouTube to watch this thing come to life. So that's what we're gonna do, together, let's find out if it works... And if so, potentially blow some minds. You know, last night I was watching the original Star Wars, and they had the message from Princess Leia: \"Go get Obi Wan.\" And it was a hologram. Okay, so, that's it, that's what you get. Does it look fancy? Not so much. Careful... Okay, that's simple enough. \"Interlock the tabs to secure this... the shape\" - Okay... That's it! Look at me, look at that. Looks like, super simple, right? Launch YouTube... 3 - D - holo - hologram! *smooth, relaxing music ensues* So, what happens is... If you glance into it from the side... You get this really... interesting, holographic perspective. Now, the video is key, because it essentially has... the image you're looking at four times, and when it comes through each of these and reflects, you end up with this... kind of floating... version of it. *giggles* You can look at... fireworks in... hologram you can look at... skulls, as you're seeing right here. Fish, octopus, jellyfish,... there's like... So much stuff that's been... converted to hologram form... You can actually make one of these on your own if you have like, an old CD case or something like that. But this is crazy... You can get a legit 3 dimensional, floating image, plastic foldable origami type thing in your smartphone and you can actually see what these look like in real life. So... there you have it. Ten dollars gets you this ready made, little pyramid, which is gonna enable the smartphone you already have to become a holographic viewer And most people aren't gonna believe you, you're gonna show them that and say: \"Yeah. I can look at holograms with this.\" They're gonna be like: \"I don't, I don't think that's...\" Drop it on... *mind blown*",

    "transcript": "- Tattoos. Whether you love 'em or hate 'em, there are three aspects to tattoos that often deter people from getting them. The pain, the price, and the commitment. Kind of sounds like a bad relationship. I myself love tattoos. I have four and definitely plan on getting more in the future. Personally, I believe tattoos are a awesome art form and a great way of expressing yourself and body positivity. As tattoos become more and more mainstream, there are different companies that are popping up that are providing different options for people who are looking to get something that is a little less permanent and a little less painful. This is a tattoo printer. The first temporary tattoo machine, that you can use on yourself to print temporary tattoos. I suppose let's just get to unboxing. We have a USB cable, assuming this is the cover for the tattoo printer. This is the machine, it's really cute. Prinker has two different types of of prinkers. The M, which is the one we have here, which is the personal use prinker. And then they also have the series S, which is the professional use one. Aim for the middle. (box tumbling to ground) That was not the middle. Now, as every good unboxing goes, we must start with the manual. The Pinker M kit comes with a skin guide, the Prinker machine, colored ink, which is YMC, also very commonly seen in print media and printing. And then a skin primer, which you use before and after you print the tattoos. Within the app, it looks like there are tattoo options, which they provide in case you don't necessarily wanna design a tattoo for yourself and just wanna tattoo something on a whim. Lots of options here, lots of options. They have a liked page, in case you want to come back to doing a tattoo later. Or maybe you're going to a festival and wanna save a few designs before the festival actually starts. You have an upload and draw option. So for someone like me who's a graphic designer and want to experiment with tattoo designs before maybe potentially actually getting them tattooed, I feel like this would be a good option. But let's see how it prints. (spritzing spray in air) Probably shouldn't do that. Yeah, it smells kind of nice. It's kind of got a florally scent to it. So if I remember correctly, I think the colored cartridges don't print black. So we might only be able to print color tattoos today. Which is fine, 'cause I don't have any colored tattoos. Hmm, maybe I should have looked at a tutorial before I just opened this. - [David] Nah, yolo. - Yeah, let's guess it. It looks like there's a little opening here. There we go. And this, maybe this isn't as easy as just inserting the cartridge. (cartridge popping into place) There it was. Okay, we're in. Okay, I've turned it on. I'm excited to try this. It's really cute, like this is super convenient. You can take it with you wherever you want to go. Well, I'm kind of a sucker for spot gloss. And this emboss right here is very spot gloss esque. It's super clean, it feels ergonomic. Like it's kind of got a handheld curve in here. The branding is cute, aside from the name, as prior discussed. Do I get started? Should I start printing? I have had this tattoo idea in mind for a really long time, so I'm going to download the Google dinosaur. I'm interested to see if this can auto remove backgrounds. This one is apparently a png, but it's definitely not. Those darn fake PNGs with the checkered background. Drives me crazy. Oh, it says you can add it to public or adult content. I really wanna look at that. (crew laughing) Notice, upload is complete. All right. I am aware there are some limitations to this prinker. The designs that I've seen so far people using are very long and narrow designs. Rather than like doing a huge arm piece or a huge thigh piece, you're kind of limited in that aspect. So in measurements you can do 18 millimeters wide and 1,000 millimeters long. How long would that be? Like down my entire arm? 1,000 millimeters? Well that's- - [David] That's a meter. - That's a meter, yeah okay. So you could technically do your entire arm, or you could do a long strip of your back. So to get started, I'm going to spray my arm. Oh, maybe I shouldn't leave this like that. - [Sven] Is it magnetic? - It is magnetic! That's really nice. (patting Prinker) It doesn't say how many sprays. I just did three. Oh it's sticky, oh I don't like that. Ew, it's really sticky. Oh, it's giving me the battery percentage. Do I hold the button? Nope, nothing's happening. Oh, that was easy. Do I need to? I guess I have to clean the nozzle. Now it doesn't say in the manual that we need to clean the filter or anything first, but it's not letting me tattoo. So, this is what we're doing. Stick the device to paper underneath. Press start, then glide. Is there a start button? Is that my issue? - [David] Doesn't it say start on the phone? - No. Oh, well here. Oh, press the... It's early! Whoa, do you see that? Art. We should sell this. Oh, do you think I can just start now? No! I've been branded. I'm doing everything it's asking me to do. - [Bell] Yeah, that's your reward. - So these tattoos, thankfully, are washable with soap and water. So I don't have to be branded forever. However, if you do want your tattoo to last, it is water resistant and should last between one to three days. I just want a dinosaur on my body! What do I need to do? It's just giving me information. Oh, I needed to scroll. Is it this one? (slamming hands on desk) You just needed to scroll. My first recommendation would be a finer spray nozzle on this. 'Cause right now it kind of just sprays in like really chunky spritzes. Let's try this with my non-dominant hand. Press. Oh, okay, here we go. Is it dead? Okay, that's another downside to this machine. It was at 26% before it printed. It printed this and now it's dead. So speaking of battery life, the Prinker should last between four to five hours. For us, it didn't last that long. Oh, it's so little. Do you see that? It barely looks like anything, it's just like a little smudge. - [Bell] I was hoping it would be the Prinker again. - No, we got that beauty right here. Okay, oh it's very important that you put the cartridge cap on the printer. And your app will remind you. Let's see if I have something on my iPad. - [David] Is there no editing inside that app? - It gives you different scales. - Okay. - So you can do 50%, 70%, or 100% of the scale of your artwork. But, if it's super small, you can't increase the size. Ah, I have the perfect thing. This, this is the best thing I've ever designed in my entire life. And, I'm going to prink it on myself. It's nice that uploading artwork is pretty easy. It's just the whole scale thing that's kind of an inconvenience. No cartridge detected. Did you take? - It's broken. - Oh you broke it. - [David] No you just used all the ink. - Yeah, literally. Speaking of, the ink cartridge should last up to 1,000 different tattoo designs. And, to my knowledge, we have not done nearly that many. Press Prink, oh here. (bright upbeat music playing) Oh that's a long boy. Do you see that? He's so long. Does that mean I need to go slower you think? - [David] I don't know, you went pretty slow that time. - Yeah. - Go faster. - Faster? Oh, yeah maybe faster. Because the primer is sticky, you can actually see the marks of the rollers on your skin, too. Because I think it's peeling up or sticking to the primer. Okay, I'm gonna try here again, but a little bit faster. Oh there we go. There we go! - Whoa! - Wow! - That's pretty good. Cute! You can definitely see the individual colors. They combine pretty well, to make it black. But not as cleanly as I'm sure using just the black ink cartridge would be. So it's time for me to enlist the help of our thumbnail artist, Maria, to help me design some tattoos for a few of the people around here at LMG. Before we have fun tattooing, we recently got an opportunity to partner with Paradox, the sponsor of this video. They're the team behind City Skylines and Stelaris. But I wanted to take a minute to talk about Crusader Kings III. You can play free this weekend, starting on the 11th and going to the 15th. CKIII is a medieval strategy game where things get so unhinged, it's probably not safe for me to repeat the Steam reviews here on camera. If you don't believe me, feel free to look for yourself. There's a link below. Play the role of ruler, raise taxes, face the betrayal of one of your seven children, and then become your son. Just like any other weekend. Again, Crusader Kings III is free to play this weekend. Click the link below and try it out for yourself. What would you tattoo on yourself? - I really like plants. - Yeah! - Like I have a flower here. - Oh, it's so cute! - So, something similar. - Do you want me to give you a tattoo? - Yes, I would. - Okay, I'm gonna draw a plant for you. - Yay! - Because you like plants. - Yes. - So the Prinker here, it doesn't print black ink. But I know that you're really good at doing colorful drawings, so this is the perfect opportunity to test out its abilities. - Okay. - What size would you like your tattoo? Probably pretty small, huh? - Oh, we are gonna go- - No, big. - Oh like this one? - Yes. - Let's draw a cute little plant for you. - Nice. - Okay, it's already not working, so that's good. Okay, I think- - Oh no, that's. - Uh, this is so bad compared to Procreate. - Yeah, it's so bad. - How do I go back? Okay. What in the, oh okay, here's different color options. So let's do green. And then I'll just draw a cute, cute little. This is horrible. Where did the green go? It just, it doesn't work as well as other drawing apps, like Procreate. I hate when you press the back button that it goes back all the way to the black pen ink too. Work! Maybe if you do it, it will work. I just have really bad luck with technology. It was working. Oh, oh, oh, it's back. Okay. (cast and crew laughing) - Ugh, no. - This is horrible. Green, I think it's selected. - Nice. - Okay, okay. (bright upbeat music continues) - Yay! Nice. No! What happened? - Oh no! - Maybe from this side. Good enough. Prink! - [Bell] You never want to hear your tattoo artist say that. (both laughing) - 'Kay, connect to Prinker, which we did connect to. Okay, look at that streamline. - That's way better. - So much easier, perfect. And look at this, we can even resize. It might be a little pixely, because Procreate is not a vector program. We go to the Prinker app. Now, let's see you go in and export. - Okay. - Let's see how easy it is. - It has to show something, like it's transferring? Or like? - I don't know. Do we just exit? I can't remember. It's not there! - No! - Machine? Cool. The interface, is headache inducing. - Yeah, the UI is horrible. - It is, it is. Upload is complete. Oh there. - Oh it's working, okay. - Okay, so now it's time to ink you. (glove snapping) So we gotta spray you with the primer. - Oh wow. - Let's move this. What do you think of the smell? Did I just smack you? - Oh sorry. It's just like alcohol. Hmm, yeah it's meh. - It's time to Prink you. Like why does that sound horrible? Prink. Oh no, that's not right. This one. (repeatedly tapping phone) (Maria laughing) And, we'll go for 100%, size. Are you ready? - I'm ready. - This is a lot of commitment. - Okay. It's like microscopic! (team laughing) You can't even see it. Oh my goodness, this is the tiniest. - [Bell] You gotta prime it again. You gotta seal it. - Oh yeah, right. I forgot to do that with my other tattoos. - [David] Also, is the blue and the yellow misaligned? 'Cause like- - Oh yeah, it is. It's not great, that's for sure. (clapping) Talk about microneedle tattoos. Yeah, did it hurt? - No, not at all. That's the only good part. Okay so how do you, have it bigger then? - That's a question I've been asking myself. And it's stuck on another loading screen. - Like 90% of the time I've been here is just like waiting. - Yeah. And it actively not working. So, so far you need two Apple pencils, two iPads, a Prinker, an iPhone, and some patience in hoping that it will actually work. Oh yeah, and you also need two people. Very important. At least two people. I just got an amazing idea. - What? - The creative juices are really flowing today. - Okay Riley, we are ready for you. - You ready? I'm good with a tiny tattoo. - Yes! - You're about to get pranked, dude. - [David] You should get a neck tattoo. - Um, I know. - It does come off with soap. - When Jake told me, he's like it'll only last a day. I'm like no, and then I Googled it and I'm like, oh, you can wash it off. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's completely different. - [Bell] You shouldn't, it's not in the spirit. - What? - It's not in the spirit to wash it. - Exactly. - I'll probably, I'll wear this for the day. - So I'm gonna spray you. - I don't want my kid to see it. Ugh! - [Bell] Get any ideas. - Oh! - And now we wait 10 seconds. - Wait, but is that stuff permanent? - No. - Yes, yes. - Oh. - You will never get it off. Your skin will be primed, permanently. Do I have to like brace for it? Does it hurt? - It's gonna hurt. - Yeah, it's very painful. - It's temporary, you can wash it off with soap, but it hurts just as much. - Are you ready? - Yes? - You might wanna hold your breath for this. - [Crew member] The screen is a button, push it in. - The screen is a button. - And then just- - Ah! - okay. Ope! - It's eating my flesh. - That's right. - Yes, it worked! Great success. (team laughing) - [Bell] Spray it again. - [LADY] Oh yeah, right. I gotta finish priming. - Oh you gotta prime it. Oh no, or it will... - We wanna hold it. - Or Linus will melt away. - You're good to go. - Oh my gosh, I got a little Linus. - It's life-size. - Thanks. It's life-size. (team laughing) - I feel like we can do a few. That didn't take very long. - Yeah. - [Bell] Client Andy's here for his first tattoo. - Yay, Andy! - Yay! - Okay, let's get you primed, prepped and primed. - [Andy] Okay. - Come take a kneel. - Please, give me a tattoo. - Where would you like this tattoo to go? - I don't know, like maybe upper arm. - Okay, so I'm gonna prime you. - Yeah. - I would turn away, unless you want to be intoxicated on the job. What do you think of the smell? - Doesn't really hurt my feeling, so. - That's good. - So you and Riley will have matching tattoos. Oh wow, that one's kind of glitchy. Oh, I didn't finish. - Oh! (indistinct background chatter) - You have half a sad Linus. - Oh my god. - That's beautiful. (all laughing) - You don't like my cat? - I like it, I like it. - Okay, let's export that. - Export. - Sony, you better give me more cameras. - Oh. After, how long has that been? Like five, 10, a minute? It does smudge a little bit. - Okay. - But, it's not too bad. - It's not coming off, eh? - It comes off with soap. Oh, you know what the problem is? I didn't finish. - [David] She just made it harder to take off. - It's permanent. - There you go. - Oh my God! - You're inked for life, Andy. - Okay, can we make that bigger? The design? The camera, or- - Nope, it's just gonna be as big as however you do it. - How do you do the big logo? - Oh, I didn't pick that. They branded me. - Oh! Oh my goodness. - Are you ready to get prinking? - [Andy] Let's go! - All right, it's ready. Is it working? - Oh it hurts, ahh! - Prink, prink. - There you go. - Oh, I got a new camera. Heck yeah. - That's not bad. - Art. - You just saved me four grand. - Oh yeah, we gotta finish, we gotta. (solution spritzing) - I like it. - Yay! - It's got a little bit like rainbow in there. - Yes. - You can really see the ink colors. - My camera is RGB. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Well good job, you did great for your first tattoo. - Thank you, yeah, it doesn't really feel that much painful. - Good, good. - Yeah. - People lied to me. - What will be the name of our tattoo studio? - Ah, Prinkin' and Stinkin'. (team laughing) - How interesting. - How interesting, thank you Nicole. - A mystery tattoo. - Yes. - Okay. So unlike the other two, you actually do have a tattoo. - I do. - How was your first tattoo experience? - Pretty nice. - That's good. - It was like getting scratched by a cat. - Now this one, unlike your other one, instead of cat scratches, it's kind of like a glue stick. - Oh. - It's kind of sticky. Are you excited? - I am. - It's permanent, so- - Oh okay, I'm so, I'm down. Mystery permanent tattoo, let's go. - Full commitment. Oh it's so cute! - Awe! - That's so cute. - It's actually a cute little floral design. - [Nicole] Wow. Can I, is it- - [David] Prime it. - Prime it. - Oh yeah, we gotta prime it, don't touch it. (spritzing solution) - It's a little sticky. (spritzing solution) - Are you having fun? - I'm having so much fun. - Great, I'm so happy. - I did not know, I'd be getting tattoos today, this is awesome. - Oh wait. (team laughing) - It was because maybe this was not like fully dry. So it got stuck like oh, oh. - Should we try again? Let's just go- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have plenty of arms. (team laughing) - We should prime again. - Okay. - But I need to start like a little bit, here. - Yeah, okay there. - Oh. (team laughing) - Okay, not I know what it is. He's in my elbow crack. (team laughing) I can flex. - You're flexin' on sad Linus. - That's hilarious. Oh my god. - Yeah, the thing with this is you can't really tell where it's going to be, like the exact position. - Yeah. Yeah, it's true. Like as you start it just kind of goes whenever. - Yeah. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Thank you for helping me and tattooing people. - Thank you for having me. - Yes, yes! - It was really fun. - I enjoyed myself very much. - Yeah, my favorite was Andy's camera. - Yes, yes. Andy's camera was wonderful. - Okay, bye. - Bye. This is the Prinker, a hand-held headache. While the concept is super interesting and unique to the market, in practice it doesn't really work that well. For starters, when it does print the tattoo, you can see each individual color. With a little bit of practice, you might be able to figure out a way to get the ink to align properly. But as of right now, it seems like it's been an issue with every single tattoo that we've done. You can get a legitimate tattoo for $270, that will be on you permanently, but I'm sure it'll be something that you want to get. Or, you can spend 270 U.S. dollars for a Prinker. You can get very mediocre, not very good tattoos and a really, really (beepy) interface. It does need some improvement. However, I feel like the experience of everybody kind of trying this out was fun. So, maybe bringing it to a party and giving your friends tattoos would be the only real purpose for this. Even then, those tattoos that you just put on your skin and wet with water and peel off would probably look a lot better. How much is it again? $270. I can't get over that. - [Bell] It's on sale. - Oh, at $270? And how much is it on sale for? - [Bell] It is $250. - Oh nice, $20 off. If you do want a tattoo that looks good, maybe just get some sharpies. And draw on yourself. No, that's bad advice. Aside from all of those aspects, I think with some improvement, this could be a really unique and fun tool. Just at this point in time, I don't think it's at that caliber of, I don't know, it's just not that great. I don't wanna sugarcoat it. Is it user error? I don't think so. Like, it took so long for the Bluetooth to connect, to illustrate something in their drawing program. And resizing tattoos is a issue that we weren't able to resolve. So overall, you probably shouldn't buy this. I would wait for maybe some future generations to come out, that have improved the issues that we discussed throughout the video. Because at the end of the day, there's no tattoo that's gonna be as good as a legitimate, actual tattoo. Don't forget to like and subscribe.

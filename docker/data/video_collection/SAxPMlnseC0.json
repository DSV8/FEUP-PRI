    "transcript": "yumom And today i have a very special upload for you Now many of you know That I'm intrested in, maybe obsessed with Trying to create the ultimate setup The ultimate setup monitors to sit in front of Now, back there in my office I have a four monitor editing setup I've got a triple monitor, OLED, racing simulator from LG Now LG saw that And they said to me \"That's great, we like the look of it\" \"But we want you to take it to next level\" \"Lew, what would you do, with fourty monitors\" \"And a venue to set it all up in Iceland\" To which i said \"Im on the next plane\" 'He's known for his honest Youtube reviews' On newly released electrionic products Let's welcome Unbox Therapy [ crowd cheering ] Hello,hello. check check. Lew: Did you guys see the display? You gotta look at it, right? *Crowds agreeing* Lew: That's fourty screens up there Lew: Hundreds of milions of pixels Lew: That's the kinda stuff that turns me on right now *Crowd's laughing* Those people that know me, knows that technology Is very important to me That's the stuff I've been enthusiastic about for a very long time And when they said We're tryna put together this kind of ultimate display setup We wanna use OLED, we wanna use multiple screens I said \"Im in\", let's figure it out Can they be curved, can they be immersive Immiediately i wanna to participate Okay, Can i say something about Iceland? The people here, Unbeliveable You guys are amazing Iceland! Wake up! Wake up! Lew: So you guys watch a lot of youtube or what? Yeah. Lew: Yeah Yeah. [inaudible Mumbling] Lew: aww yeah, That's cool Is that like code name? Or is it actually a sheep's head? Kid: Yeah What part of the head i'm I eating? All of it? Kid: Yeah you can eat the eye Lew: I can eat the eye For some reason that doesn't sound appetizing to me. [crowd giggles] I took a trip around today, i went out i flew some drones I looked at the landscape I found some volcanic rocks, Yes there is alot of it I know Um, And i just, I don't know there is a certain sense of Almost like a mystical type of Aspect to Iceland Been a incredible time here Major appreciation to Iceland Lew: I really can't um, i really can't give you the real experience of being here i can only show you and tell you. But this is a special place Dare I say, Magical Alright let me say something real quick about O-LED Alright ok so I seen Everything that is out there I've seen every tech as it comes along and the first time That i Put a O-LED Infrount of me. I was like. Oh this! oh this is what its supposed to look like The whole time. No seriously if you put one of these things in your living room. you're going to know what im talking about. These Deep Blacks, that high contrast. It's a different experience. There's no doubt this is the new frontier right here Not to say that I understand all the complexity's of getting this operating It's incredible resource retentive trying to push all that many pixels independently in each 4K Display You know you're looking for a environment looking for and a sort of a natural recurrence That can really take advantage of some of the technology that is happening behind the scenes there Sometimes when technology gets out of the way and enables a kind of personal more human experience that is when its doing its best job. Girl : Thank you so much and we will follow you on YouTube, I will. Lew : Iceland Thank you very much. Thank you to Lg for putting this together. Unbelievable. How bout the music to? how bout the music?",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today's video is just a little different. I mean, it's not that different, I've definitely done these videos before, somebody tweeted me this on Twitter and I said (gasps) What is it? How do I get it? Where do I find it? And I went to Amazon and I bought them and I love kettle corn so much. It is like my favorite taste. Like it's just something about the sweetness and just the popcorn and the crunch. A good kettle corn, it is unlike anything ever. When I saw this come through my Twitter timeline, obviously you know what I did. What I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna do a little taste test. Two cookies is 150 calories? Okay, I'm just gonna forget that I saw that. Anyway, moving on, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a taste test, and I'm gonna see what they taste like, and then I'm gonna bring my sister in and I'm gonna see if she can guess what flavor Oreo this is. So first, my friends, let's open it up. I would love to know from you guys because there are so many flavors of Oreos that it's honestly so overwhelming, what is your favorite flavor? Do you like just basic ones? We're gonna lift and taste. How? (packet crumpling) How do I get you out of here? Oh. Smells so good. So here's what they look like. They just look like an everyday, basic, golden Oreos. Here we go. (crunches) It tastes phenomenal. But does it taste like kettle corn? I'm not sure. For research. (crunches) It's for research, okay? Research does not count calories, at all. So my research is concluding, this doesn't taste like kettle corn, but whatever it does taste like, like a slight butterscotch maybe kind of flavor, it's really good and I would eat this entire container. (packet rustles) So there's 10 servings, that means there's 20 cookies. What is 20 times 150? - [Siri] The answer is 3000. - This is only 3000 calories. This is like what I would eat in a day. But I would just have, but I could only eat just this. I'm gonna go get Jenna, I need to hide these because I don't want her to even see the packaging, I don't want her to see that it's a golden Oreo, I want her to come in here actually blindfolded. Okay. Jenna, my sweet sister. We're here, Jenna's here, get in here. I've got you this nice little blindfold. - I saw that on your bathtub. - Yes, I brought it over here because you're gonna put this on and I have a taste test for you. It's nothing disgusting, I promise it's gonna be delicious. - Okay, it matches me, alright here you go. - Aw, it kinda looks like you're a little Jenna mouse. Is it a mouse? - Is it a mouse? - I'm not sure, what do you think it is? - I can't see it. - Oh, good point. - Oh, it's an Oreo, I know this packaging. - Oh my gosh. - I have a problem, I have a problem. - You're disgusting, you do. Okay. - That's Oreo. - Here you go, help yourself to one. Well, take a smell. Oh, so I guess you can't see, huh? - It smells like a waffle. - Oh, it does smell like a waffle. - Oh my god, is this waffle Oreo. (sighs) - It does smell like a maple syrup, kind of actually. - Have you had one yet? - I have. So I, you're licking it now. Here you are, wow you're really, this is an investigative report. (laughs) - You have called on the right person. - I tried it, I taste, I loved it actually. - This doesn't taste like a chocolate cookie. It tastes like the other cookie. Vanilla? - I'm not gonna say if you're right or you're wrong. (laughs) - So it doesn't taste chocolate. Did you miss your mouth? (laughs) - I missed my mouth, I can't see. - This is quality content that you come here and subscribe for. - Okay, it tastes like a waffle. - Well it's not a waffle, it is definitely not a waffle. - Pancake? - No, it has puffed millet pieces inside. - What the heck is a puffed millet? - I don't even know, let me look it up. - Was that crunch, was that a puffed millet I just tasted? - A puffed millet, what the heck is a puffed millet? It's like an all natural cereal. - Oh. Should I be thinking cereal flavored? - It's not really, I mean you can eat it for breakfast but that's weird that it would, puffed millet pieces. - Oh. - But that was their decision. Someone decided that. - I don't know what that is? - Like a puffed - Like a puffed millet? - Like a puffed millet. - Like puffed like a pop? - I would picture like a puffed corn. - Popcorn? - Shoot. No, I messed up. - It doesn't taste like, is it popcorn? Kettle corn? - I complete, oh my gosh. I went to say puffed rice. - A puffed millet. - Totally messed up. - That tastes, oh. - I completely messed up, I just basically gave you the answer. - Well I had a blindfold on, oh my god it's bright. - Popcorn. Let's do it over, we have to delete it. - No. - We're deleting this and we're starting over act like you've never seen this, act like this never happened. - It tastes like a waffle. - It does. - You didn't tell me I'm exposed. - Were you? - Not really. - Do I have consent to this whole video now? - Well I guess you're exposed. - Oh. - Puffed millet. - Puffed millet. - Hi Maddie, I ate a puffed millet. What the heck is a puffed - Look at the puffed millet pieces. This is a puffed millet, now that you have your eyes. Let me show you. - Kettle corn. - Puffed rice is what I meant. - Wow, I'm learning. - So it is, this is puffed corn. - It tasted like maple syrup. - I completely gave you the answer. - I love Oreos. - Aren't these good though, I really like them. This is, I love the golden Oreos. - Golden. - Is that what they're called? I think so, I think they're called golden. - My Oreo creation, vote for your favorite. - What's your favorite Oreo? (gasp) I love the birthday cake one. - Oh, those are good. - The red velvet? - I couldn't, the red velvet also good. I kinda just like basic Oreo. - Me too, I lik the thin ones so I can eat more of them. - Oh my gosh wait, they had something else it was like in a bag, it was Oreo bites or something, but they were the ones that were covered in the chocolate and the white chocolate but they were bites. - Huh? - And I was like no. - There's so many Oreo things. Like Oreo flavored, Oreo just, Oreo is a lifestyle. - It's a lifestyle, it's a choice. (laughs) - It is, and it's a choice that I like. Well I did really enjoy these a lot. - I'd like to see what the millet looks like. - Yeah let's give them a look at what the millet looks like. - I don't really see a good millet piece. Oh, a millet. - That's a millet. A millet, so that's a millet. You heard it here first. - I wonder if it has a taste. - I would like to know how many of you guys knew what a millet was. It's like a grain. 'Cause I've definitely, yeah it's a type of grain usually sold as a breakfast cereal. - Okay. - In condition, well it's low fat, it's also gluten free, it's making it a nutritious option for people who are gluten intolerant. - I can't stop eating sugar. - Puffed grains have been made for centuries. With the simplest methods like popping popcorn. - I have a sugar problem. - I do too, get these out of here. - No, like I actually have a problem. I love sugar. - Me too, it's an addiction. Thanks for watching, this was very very interesting. I can't believe that I gave it away. I ruined everything. - I mean, a puffed millet, I don't even what - A puffed millet, what? I don't know. Tell me if there's any other videos you would like to see me make, this is my sister Jena, I'll put her link in the description if you wanna check out her YouTube channel. - I'm the millet master. (laughs) I'm not. - Next on Justine and Jenna cooks. - What's that millet? - We should puff millets. No, I'm not doing that. - That sounds like something that's gonna get demonetized. - Whoa, demonetized? Okay, bye. - Our Postmates is here. - No, it's already here, the food is sitting on the floor. Okay. - Millet momma. That tastes like a waffle. (Justine humming off-screen) (light, bouncy music)",

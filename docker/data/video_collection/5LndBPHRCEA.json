    "transcript": "for today's video, viewers Bruce and Alfred the cat, very kindly sent over one of the legendary dustbin Mac Pros. Which considering that I was real impressed by one of its inbredOffspring I am super excited to check out but first today's video is sponsored by Deep Cool's new Mystique aiio cooler this 360mm Beast with its pre-installed fans is perfect for cooling even the most commanding CPUs and with its new digital display right on the pump you can always be reminded of the power of mistakes and if temperatures aren't your thing you can customize the display to show whatever your little heart desires so go and check out the Deep cool Mystique AI using the link in the video description oh no way it comes with a towel that is actually a really good way to ship stuff cuz once you're done using it as packaging you can dry your body with it oh cool they still had the original packaging I too am a box hoarder a yes the legendary dpen Pro not many people remember this but Apple used to wrap all their products in torn up bits of T-shirt oh W that's pretty cool looking it's got a bit of an alien artifact vibe to it I can imagine a thousand years after the great musk Zuckerberg war and civilization some archaeologist is going to dig one of these out of the ruins of mkbhd's office and they're all going to start praying to it cuz they think it's a mystical artifact but then it also somehow looks a bit like a dpin now the artifact that Alfred the cat very kindly sent over is a 2013 Mac Pro which interestingly aside from Apple eventually discontinuing the entrylevel quad core variant Apple kept selling the Mac Pro essentially unchanged until it was replaced in 2019 which means theoretically you could have spent $7,000 on a Mac Pro in 2019 based on Hardware from 2013 they didn't even update the generation of Zeon in it anyway I'm not sure what spec Alfred specifically sent over but we'll find that out once we fire it up it kind of feels like it's metal and looks like it's metal but it doesn't really sound like metal in terms of ventilation as far as I understand it there's a fan in the top that pulls air through the bottom of the case with help of convection which according to Apple is very effective but we'll talk a bit more about that later that is an absurd amount of Thunderbolt ports it just shows Apple's happy to give you Io if you're an oligarch it's a shame that all the io's on the back so you can't just pop a USB stick into it but I guess that would ruin the Event Horizon aesthetic so there's that there's also this little lock thing which I think is to pull the cover off maybe other than that physically not a whole lot to say about it until we open it up but before I break it it's turn it on in standard Apple fashion it's essentially impossible to interact with it without visibly soiling it I don't know how to power it on do you just kind of like no oh there's a you need to do all reach around I see okay oh wasn't expecting it to have a speaker in it I don't know why it's necessary for it to shout at me that's very gaming laptop of it oh an emperor penguin nice choice Bruce good animal cannot be identified and will not be usable until it's identified so we know Apple STS on immigration from that little little pop up there let's see so you go up here and you click on about this Mac see I know Apple things so this is a six core variant with 32 gigs of RAM and a firepro d500 ooh I'm excited to do some gaming on on this system now the thing that's nice about this Hardware configuration is that we can likely install Windows on here without much effort but I am going to try and game on Mac OS montere which is that like a new one it isn't damn Apple yoink support for their systems fat wa cuz it's Pro we got to try some cine bench on it which luckily I didn't have to pay for in the Apple Store very good and it's off look at the power not only is it tearing through R20 but unsarcastically it's remarkably quiet this's just this very quiet like that it's doing its mild manners may have been impressive but its result really wasn't o the poor old Mac Pro gets dumpstered by a 7700k oh no and that's with it running the multi-threaded test but don't worry the single threaded test was just as tragic and I think because of the older operating system the gaming section of the Apple Store is somehow even more depressing than I remember it to be oh that's a fun little problem I forgot about considering my game drive is formatted in NTFS and apple like with everything else is a huge pain in the ass about file systems my game drive is not going to work on it although never mind it's still found the games that's interesting next a process like digging for atine finding a steam game that'll actually run on Mac OS oh and don't worry those stop signs aren't nearly as useful as they look most of the other games also don't work oh see that's that's the problem that we're going to run into here is despite the fact that steam can find the game on the drive it can't write anything on the drive so so we can't play the games wow this has been a real roller coaster of emotions my word so DOTA should work once I physically downloaded onto the system one frame per second it is it is not starting off strong okay no things things have loaded in okay so now that things have kind of loaded in at 1080p low settings the game is borderline playable although the I I wouldn't want to play it like this it is very stuttery and it looks like garbage interestingly it's running pretty much as well as dodo is running on an M2 based MacBook which to me is really funny I mean I can like last hit and stuff but this is not usable for online game I was able to dumpster the bot lobby but that's just cuz of my mad gaming skills and the Bots really suck I then tried the only compelling game I could find in the Apple Play Store so even late game civilization runs pretty well on it I don't have a frame rate counter or whatever but it's a perfectly playable experience which isn't surprising considering that the game is as old as I am basically so with that let's install a Blasphemous operating system on this bad boy and see what it can do with that so apparently installing Windows on this is pretty straightforward you just go to finder up here and then you search boot camp assistant which is installed on here uh continue and then we can kind of choose this size of our petition so the iso needs to download and then we can make the partition and installation happens like it's it's very straightforward and we maintain our Mac OS install on here as well if this just works like this it's wild that I could install Windows on this without violence happening it's pretty cool this was the first time I've ever experienced people saying an apple thing is easy to do wasn't just a straight up lie once the boot camp install finished the system restarted windows installed and we were done oh no way it's got 2 d500s in crossfire in it cool now we have a little bit of an issue in terms of frame rate with our Mac Pro I can't get it to Output more than 60 frames per second at 1440p uh and I think it has to do with limitations on the HDMI port on the back so let's try and use the Thunderbolt port and see if that helps now we can set it ah there we go okay so the HDMI is an issue now Everything feels better and with our Windows install theoretically came much better game support it's not happy with the overlay it doesn't want us prying into what it's doing cuz not only is it flickering but there's like weird stat breed out happening but after relaunching the game a couple times the overlay just fixed itself it's just fine now although we still have no idea what the gpus are doing look at that we're getting 120 frames per second at 1080p low settings but it's running a lot better than I was expecting it to run I was pretty convinced this was going to be an unplayable dumpster fire at 1080p but it isn't what I am curious to see is how much performance we lose if we turn off the one GPU now I'm going to be brave and see if I can do that with the game running which probably isn't going to go great but let's see oh it just crashed we're getting about 80 frames per second with just the single GPU running so it's about 40 down which gives us what like a 50% performance increase with the second GPU uh which is not going to happen in newer games at all uh because there hasn't been new drivers for this GPU in a very long time and Crossfire is very driver dependent right so uh yeah I think this is probably best case scenario we're looking at here then when I tried to Benchmark the difference between the configurations the system started really acting up so on the bright side we do have proper usage information now but we have descended into the upside down so there is that this is with both gpus running and it's running very hot so despite it being really quiet and with very little load on it the temperatures are they're quite High so the only Benchmark information I could extract from the system was amidst all the weirdness but it did show a bit of an improvement between the GPU configurations I don't know if the benchmarked oh it just crashed okay for some reason the overlay refused to work with CS2 but subjectively the game felt fine at 1080p low settings and in every other game I normally Play Just refused to work on the Mac Pro presumably because of the 900-year-old drivers luckily DOTA worked so we could directly compare the gaming performance between Mac OS and Windows 10 okay so for some reason with DOTA when it's full screen at 1080p I I I'm not allowed a mouse maybe borderless window gives me a mouse cursor it does but then it's not full screen going back to full screen just deleted the cursor again that's so weird why but after switching between the two modes enough times I eventually got both full screen and a mouse cursor oh now it's worked yo this system has a weirdly syphilitic way of running Windows like it it is not like it very much things keep crashing a bunch of stuff doesn't work like just just weird things happening the whole time well it is already running about twice as well as it was running on Mac OS if not more than twice as well now with both gpus running which they are despite the weird readout we're getting a much less stuttery experience than we did with Mac OS but let's try just one GPU I've been having a whole bunch of stability issues I kind of wonder if boot camp doesn't deliberately install a really buggy version of Windows so that it like baits Apple people into thinking Windows is terrible because that would kind of make sense for them to do like I don't know it's like oh yeah you want to use Windows here look at how terrible this diseased version of it is that we're giving you and with my second stability rant out of the way DOTA didn't perform any differently with one GPU as opposed to two enabled and with that we get to the most exciting part of the video tearing down Alfred the cat's Mac Pro so I think how it works is we flip that oh yeah this is metal and without its metal forkin the Dustbin Mac looks a bit like a nuclear weapon to me straight off the bat it looks pretty pretty upgradable for an Apple product there are four Ram slots that you can easily upgrade you just push that little button and then when the ram pops out you just pull the stick out and then on this board there's an m.2 slot for our storage although it does seem like there's just one of these slots which is kind of shocking for a professional device of this price and then other than that I think to get deeper into the system we undo these hex screws and then we might be able to get just right into the guts of the thing we just pull that up cool then we have a ribbon cable that we need to deal with very awkward angle oh yeah okay that looks like that that is a very heavy duty cable to just power a fan although it is quite a wild looking fan and then I Al also want to pop up the antenna there we go wow that is a monster of a blower fan which was if anything too quiet as we saw from the temperatures which apparently leads to quite a lot of GPU failures in these I think Apple was too conservative with a fan profiles on this wao that's a cool looking triangular heat sink in here Illuminati confirmed although it's not very dense at all there's very little fin structure in here and the next to that pyramid shape is the power supply so this is a very similar layout to that MSI case it's almost like MSI copied this design but you know that's definitely not what happened so I think what I'm going to do here is I'm going to just undo all of the screws and lift the whole motherboard assembly out in one go is that a stupid idea I don't know let's give it a try oh it it's moving being too scared to talk any harder I decided to remove the gpus first and see what that does oh yeah oh it's cool I hope that Alfred the cat is not offended by by what Alfred sees happening here oh that's a cool connector as well okay so you pull that out this clean looking PCB is our d500 which is theoretically upgradeable to a d700 but in typical Apple fashion they very tightly controlled the supply so good luck finding a replacement PCB also as we mentioned before due to the high temperatures a apparently these have quite a high failure rate I love how Apple cheaps out on the thermopad it doesn't make full contact with the memory modules you can see here it doesn't cover the whole copper bit and then down here is the like ribbon connector they use to connect the graphics Cod to the rest of the system bit number two oh that's actually a SATA SSD oof it makes sense considering the age but compared to Modern drives this thing is a real loser wait but we still haven't really answered the age-old question of how do we go deeper but all I had to do is pull up oh the whole thing lifts out of the base and then there's a couple of screws on the base we have to undo here just lift okay there we go so this is the little daughter board thing that the rest of the components of the system connect through and then we have this pcie looking slot where these Central motherboard kind of slots in and then that is like a South Bridge esque chip over there now to get to the main motherboard you have to kind of bend the power supply up off it and then hold it at an angle that makes it feel like you're holding open a chest cavity while you unscrew the mounting for the CPU oh that oh oh oh wow that sucked and there is our big ass Zeon which is socketed with a whole bunch of power delivery for it and then the ram modules are on the other side of that interesting and to remove the CPU you just need to undo the bracket on the back you should just be able to pop that off and then here is our socketed Zeon CPU and with that tear down we've learned that apple had a product that was theoretically very modular and upgradable but then they just ignored it for 6 years and then replaced it with something completely different very nice this was almost cool Apple if only someone else made it and until the next video thank you for watching bye-bye oh",

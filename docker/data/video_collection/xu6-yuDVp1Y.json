    "description": "Dave2D review of the 2019 Razer Blade with RTX 2080 Max-Q. This is the best gaming laptop from Razer but RTX 20-series is very expensive. WAY Cheaper -   With configs starting at a RTX 2060 up to a RTX 2080 MaxQ, the new 2019 razer blades bring some strong performance but keep in the mind the 10-series GPUs from last year bring incredibly strong performance for 1080p gaming still. Competing with the Aero 15 and the MSI GS65 for the best thin and light gaming laptop for 2019  Background Music Fili - Dollar for your thoughts  If you want to support the channel, consider a Dave2D membership by clicking the Join button above!

    "transcript": "Last year, I crowned the new 15-inch Razer Blade as being one of the best gaming laptop you can get in that premium segment. And it's been updated this year with some new RTX hardware, with other nice features. Now, older generations of Razer Blades have often had issues with thermals. Because the company is very focused on making the devices really thin, and really nice looking And when you do that, it's just makes it harder to cool this thing properly. So I was worried that this new GPU, like the new RTX GPUs, will run a little bit hotter. But it actually doesn't. Even their top of the line--2080 MaxQ--runs at acceptable temperatures. It's clearly not the coolest running laptop on the market, but it doesn't throttle for what I would consider, like, average gaming. If you run it in like really warm climate, like if you're running it in South America, or places that are just ambiently really warm, then you're probably gonna have different results from me. I live in Canada. It's also the winter right now. But thermally, even the 2080 MaxQ--the hottest running GPU available--runs perfectly fine. Performance on this GPU is great. It's pushing an incredibly high frame rate, especially for a thin and light laptop. When it comes to pricing, or value, and bang for your buck, we'll get into that discussion a little bit. But I don't feel most people should be gettig top-of-the-line 2080 MaxQ specs. I'll explain in a little bit. When it comes to video production, however, the 2080 MaxQ doesn't give much of performance increase over the 1070. As it currently stands, i wouldn't pick up the RTX devices just for video productions. They're definitely more gaming-oriented. There are a few other differences between the 2019 and the 2018 model. The 2019 is fractionally thicker, but it pretty much imperceptible. Build quality still remains really good, and you can get a black finish or a silvery white finish--that they call Mercury. I much prefer the silvery white look Partially because it doesn't have that glowing green logo upfront but if you like the green snakes, you gotta go forthe black one. The webcam up at the top now supports Windows Hello. It's got an infrared camera, so you can log in to your computer with just facial recognition, which is nice. The keyboard has also had a little bit of a tweak. Previously, the Razor Chroma Lighting did not light up for the secondary function or function keys. Volume control, brightness control, you couldn't see that stuff in the dark. It's a little bit annoying if you want to adjust any of those things in a completely dark room. But now you can see all those function keys. The trackpad remains unchanged. The Shift button on the keyboard also remains unchanged. I've said this in previous videos, but if you're new here the right Shift key is in a weird spot relative to the arrow keys and question mark key. I'll sometimes hit Shift+Up instead Shift+?, but that's just a personal thing. I feel like people that know how to type properly don't use the right shift at all, but I'm just like that. I'm a bad typer. The rest of the device doesn't change much physically. The speakers are still pretty good, and the internal still remain the same. You still have access to the Wi-Fi card, RAM, and the SSD. The battery also remains unchanged: 80whr. Still getting around 5.5 hours battery life with the screen at 250 nits The question that I think is the most important with this particular video is whether or not you should get the new 2019 Razer Blade. I did a video recently that told people basically not to buy the RTX gaming laptops right now. Just because I feel for most of the market, is just not a good value compared to 10 series devices that are available at a relatively cheaper prices. And that same kind of message holds true for the Razer Blade, but I there's a little bit of adjustment when it comes to this particular device. The configurations of the Razer Blade are currently quite expensive, particularly the 2080 MaxQ. That is the model that is the top of the line, flagship device,",

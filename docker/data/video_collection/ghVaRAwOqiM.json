    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we're checking out the new DJI OM5 Ohm 5 Osmo mobile. You may know this line of phone stabilizers by many different things. Whatever you know it as this is the new one. This looks so cool. It looks so much smaller than all of the previous versions and I'm very interested to test out this little antenna feature. Like check that out. I've been shooting so much more content on my phone recently because I've actually been getting out of the house. I've been doing a little more traveling and I've been filming a lot of TikToks and sometimes filming vertical content, just shooting it directly on your phone is so much easier than getting out a massive camera. And the quality on phones these days is so amazing. And adding a stabilizer like this to your phone, whether it's an Android or an iPhone, it's just gonna set your content apart from anything else. Let's open this up, check it out and freaking go to Hawaii, baby. So some of the highlights we have shot guides. We have a three axis stabilization, Active Track, foldable and portable, a magnetic design and a built-in extension rod. Oh, Ooh. Look at you. Here we go. Here it is. Oh my gosh. This is so light. This is so incredibly light. Holy moly. Wow. Whoa! Dude Oh freaking, this is going to be so much fun. I cannot wait! My TikTok game and my Instagram reels and my YouTube shorts game. Like I'm going to be able to film in space Elon, hello? Yeah. You might have a rocket. Well, guess what I have, I have the OM5. Okay. Have you seen anything like this? No, because this is technology that you don't even know anything about. Even that feels lighter, it just clamps right on to the device. And then if you want to take your phone off, if you need to like send a text message or do whatever, like you just go like that, you can take it off. Got a little carrying string, which I love. Charging cable. Love to see that as well. Here's a little riser pad for smaller phones. This is great. This is a little tripod. And I love DJI, not only because they make really great products, but the software that goes along with them is what really makes these so powerful because they're able to really elevate and take advantage of these incredible products with their software. Ooh. A little pouch. Oh, hello. Say no more. Into the pouch you go. Look at that right in little bag. Oops. Forgot our cable. Okay, now we're ready to go. Okay, so this says phone, camera, directions. So here, on like, so there we go. Okay, I'm well I'm gonna turn this on and it's probably going to freak out. (device dings) Oh, look at that. You're already doing it. Look at you doing your job. I haven't even charged you or installed the app and you're already working. Look at that, look at this, look at this. (gasp) dude, this is so great! I can't believe it. I feel like I'm like in a a some sort of Pixar movie, like I'm, I'm Wall-E. I'm going to look like such a freaking tourist everywhere I go. And I am so here for it. Okay, let's go get some content. (upbeat music) Wow. This is squishy. Oh boy, I'm testing out the DJI OM5. I'm so excited about this because it's honestly so much lighter and smaller and slimmer than the previous version. So I'm out on this hike and it's like, I'm basically holding nothing. It's so light. (upbeat music) There she is! It's Jenna's birthday today! - It is my birthday (upbeat music) - The thing that I love so much about this is the iPhone is already so smooth and steady. So being able to add this additional stabilization to it, it almost makes it seem like a drone is following you. (upbeat music) (adventurous music) So you might realize I'm not in Hawaii. Because, uh my car got broken into and I lost the footage. Yeah um So we're in Santa Monica. Anyway, I'm really excited about this because obviously I'm such a huge fan of mobile filming and this just kind of gives you that extra little steadiness that you need. And the other thing that I really like, I showed you this in my unboxing, is this. Surprise! You can now get like a whole nother angle. Like look how high I am. I mean, I look like such a tourist in my own town. I am right now, the kind of person that gets made fun of. But you know what? I don't care. Look at this. This is great. If you guys are familiar with DJI software, then you might be familiar with Active Track. (upbeat music) So we did that. That's Active Track baby. Let's test out a pano photo here. And this is cool because it's going to take a bunch of photos and stitch them all together. There it goes. (upbeat music) Oh yeah, that looks cool. Alright. I really want to try the Clone Me pano. This is going to be cool. It'll basically stitch me together and clone me three times. I just have to physically move my body. I'm going to hit record. (upbeat music) It's beautiful. This, I think should be my first NFT. I'm going to do one more just because the lighting is better this way. And if I'm going to make this, my first NFT I got to have a follow-up. (grunting) (upbeat music) (countdown beeping) (countdown beeping) God that's art I might have to give that to like the Moma or something. I'm really an idiot. It's incredible. And so now I'm going to test out the story mode. I'm actually going to have Tyler help me film this, but it's really cool because they give you a ton of these little templates and then it'll show you the shot that you have, how many seconds you have to film it, and then it'll automatically edit you together a cool little montage. I think I'm going to do this one. It's called rhythm, rotate with beats. Tyler, You ready? I'm going to pass this off to you. The future of this is in your hands. Oh you flipped the camera. Yeah. Just careful that don't hold that there. Don't do that. Um, yeah. (upbeat music) This is great. It automatically edited everything together to music, to the beat. This is going to be my third NFT. I can't believe I got so many NFTs today. This is wild (beep) Hit record when you're moving in and then - [Man] (screaming expletive) - and you're moving, - [Man] Any white Christian (expletive) - moving out. - Any white American aw (expletive) (expletive) - Ah! Dyna zoom is another feature. You select your desired effect. You move out or move in depending upon which one you want to do. So we're going to test both of these out. First up, let's do the move out. (upbeat music) Oh, this is cool. It's just using the digital zoom. Oh, this one's super zoomed in. (upbeat music) Nice. That looks cool. So I have two more features to test out. There's a hyperlapse and a time-lapse. So this weekend I'm going to shoot a couple of those and I'm going to send those over to you Tyler. You just, put em right, here. (upbeat music) The sun has gone down, the moon is about to come up. But long ago, somebody left with a cup and I have attached this really cool phone Mount. This has a built-in light. I love this additional accessory that's available. It's a little phone Mount with a built in selfie light. It's really great because you can adjust the color temperature and you can even adjust the brightness by three levels. There's a button right here on the back to turn it on and to adjust the brightness and the button here on the bottom to adjust the color temperature. Oh, hey, welcome back from that really fun hyperlapse time-lapse adventure. I've been having so much fun testing this out, and I really love that this is so much lighter. I love that they added this extension pole, which can give you an all-new vantage point, Well I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I had a lot of fun making it. I'll put a link in the description. If you want to check this out to get more information or purchase it. And with that, I'll see you guys in my next video. Like comment, subscribe, hit the bell. Yeah. That's that's all the things. See ya later (upbeat music)",

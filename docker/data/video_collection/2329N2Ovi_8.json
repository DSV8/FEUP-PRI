    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and I'm so excited because today we have got one of the Mavic 2 Zoom here to test out. There are two new drones in the Mavic family. There's this one. This is the Zoom and there is the Mavic 2 Pro version. Now what's exciting is both of these drones are the first of their kind in portable consumer drones. The Pro version has a Hasselblad camera with a 1 inch sensor and this one has a 24-48 mm optical zoom. I cannot wait to try out both versions, but today we've got the Zoom, so let's un-box. I'm also excited about the upgraded flight time. It says we'll get 31 minutes, which is great because more flight time, means more fun. (upbeat techno music) So here it is. We have got the controller. Looks to be a little bit bigger than a previous version and here's our drone-you're beefy! It does have a little bit of weight to it. It does feel a little heavier than the previous Mavic and by heavier, I mean, barely. Another box, another box, and another one. So before we get started, I want to give you guys a size comparison. So this is the Mavic Air and this is the brand new Mavic 2. So it is quite larger than the Mavic Air and now in comparison to the Mavic Pro Platinum. The Mavic 2 is a little bit taller. It's slightly heavier, like really not that much at all, but as for controllers, this is the Mavic Platinum. So this is a little bit thicker. One of the feature in the Mavic Air that I loved in the controller is the removable joysticks. They hide in here as a nice little storage compartment. That makes it so much easier to travel with these. So that's very exciting. Let's open this guy up and just see what it looks like all out. This looks like a much stronger gimbal than our previous versions. Oh yeah, this is industrial. This also now has Omnidirectional Obstacle Sensing, so that basically will give you way more coverage if you are coming up on obstacles. It's not entirely 360. It has top and bottom, left and right, and front and back. The left and right is only available with active track and tripod mode, but for the most part this is going to provide you with some really great coverage as far as obstacle avoidance. Here's our battery. Let's take a look at this. Whoa, this is way bigger than the other Mavic battery is. Here's the Mavic Platinum and here's the brand new Mavic 2 battery and it is way bigger. So that battery's dead, so I'm going to need to charge those before we go out. It's got a cable charger, extra propellers, and of course the paperwork. So here's two different cords. There's a micro USB, so for most Android phones and also USB C version for newer Android phones and hopefully one day the iPhone. Extra joysticks and here's our gimbal and lens protection. So it looks like it's got an extra little thing on it now. Now that our un-boxing is complete, it's time to update the firmware as soon as this battery charges and we're going to head outside. So, let's go! [Techno Music] The Mavic 2 Zoom is all set up and ready to go. I've updated the firmware. So basically what we're going to do right now, is I'm going to take it for a flight and see how it flies. Later on in the video, we're gunna be going into a little more depth of some of the features and some comparisons to some other drones that are out right now. But right now, I just want to fly this freakin thing, so let's, let's just go! Wait, let me calibrate first. I don't want to get to ahead of myself. Do you guys like my hat? I don't care if you don't like it. I can't see the screen. - [Drone] Obstacle avoidance disabled. - So I may have turned off obstacle avoidance because I want to cruise through this little area right here. - [Drone] Take off. The drone point has been updated. Please check it on the map. - [Justine] Oh my gosh. - [Nathan] It really went for it. - [Justine] It really went up quick. Well, I'll see you later. [Techno Music] You think I can fly it back through there? Of course I can. [Techno Music] Let's test out the zoom. So here's our zoom. So you can use this little guy. Ah, it so cool. Let's zoom into those trees. Zoom all the way out. [Techno Music] Quick shot. So here's the Dolly Zoom. [Techno Music] So now I just switched it to 60 frames a second. So we're gunna get a little bit closer to the waves and see if we can get some really cool, slower mo shots. Slower-mo. [Giggles] [Techno Music] Now let's try 120 frames a second. I'm such a sucker for slow-mo. I shoot in 120 all the time when I'm using my Sony cameras. So now, we've got it in the drone. This will be shooting at 1920 by 1080, 120 frames a second. Let's go. [Techno Music] Look I'm not even that close to 'em, but it looks like I am. Oh my gosh, he giving him a-he was going like this, he was nudging-he was nudging the other seal. [Techno Music] So I just switched it to H.265. We're shooting 4K 30 and we're shooting it AFC. It's the, what is it, the Cinelike profile? So it's a much flatter color. So this will allow you to be able to color grade way more accurate to what you guys might have in mind. [Techno Music] So you guys, honestly if it starts coming towards you, just duck because... - [Women Yelling] Whoa. [Drone Buzzing] [Techno Music] - [Justine] It's the perfect drone and I haven't even flown the Mavic Pro 2 yet, so wow. There's going to be-oh gosh, I'm so happy. Now we need to go charge batteries because we only have two. Just a little diner charge. So I wanted to show Jenna some things we shot today. What's great is because some of these shots, especially some of the quick shot stuff, you can save it directly to your phone and it creates like a little mini movie. - So me the movie! - This shot right here. I am pretty sure I should have hit something, but I didn't. Are you ready for it? - I don't know. [Gasps] - We're at lunch. Taking a little break. Charging up our batteries and then we're going to go film some more. But my initial reaction of this thing is. I am in love. - So do I want a Zoom, or do I want a, what's the other one? - It has a one-inch sensor and so it will have better - Do they both have it? - Low light and you can shoot 10-bit. Which is basically unheard of. - So I like to do sunsets. So I feel like sensor would be better for sunsets. Right, because it gets like dark. - Yeah. - You can cut this, this is not content any more. - [Singing] If I had my little way. - This is bad. - [Singing] I'd eat peaches. - Now we're at the part of the video where we're going to dis aught four different drones. First, we have the Mavic Platinum. The Phantom 4 Pro, the Mavic Air and the brand new Mavic Pro 2 Zoom. Nathan is going to attempt to fly us on the same flight pattern on all four drones. [Calming Music] Now it's basically a race against time because the sun is setting. We've got to get a hyperlapse and we've got to do some tracking on the bikes. So let's see what we can do on two batteries and when the sun goes down. [Calming Music] Thank you guys so much for watching. I had so much fun shooting this video. It was a pretty quick turn around time. We basically shot this in a day and I'm now editing and it's 4 AM. There's so many more things I want to test out on this drone. I also can't wait to try out the Mavic 2 Pro. It's going to be really cool to see how that 1-inch sensor performs in different flying and lighting conditions. Hope you guys enjoy this. A huge thank you to Nathan for coming out and shooting this video with me. He's an incredible drone pilot. So it's really fun because when I'm not flying, I can be doing cool things and he can be getting cool drone shots of me doing cool things like riding a bike. Be sure to subscribe and hit the bell so you guys will see some more fun videos from me. Hopefully, very soon, but now you can go to bed. Enjoy. [Calming Music]",

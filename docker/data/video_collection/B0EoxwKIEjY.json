    "transcript": "I love what you posted on Twitter or X as it's called these days but the core switch has been online for 10 years I'm a rock star. The core switch hasn't been patched in 10 years tell us about this coalition that's been created or formed to solve this problem? Yeah so the Network Resilience Coalition was launched a few months back and was really the culmination I think of a recognition that networks are so resilient to our economic well-being now that we've got to start to put some focus on the security and integrity of them. We found so many customers out there that are running legacy end of life end of sale end of support they're not patching there's limited focus on things like credential management and credential security and the coalition is really about trying to surface some of those challenges and put some focus on okay let's talk about them but actually let's put some tangible things in place to remediate them. We've got to figure out how we solve some of this problem of of the legacy and the patching and so on and so forth. So that's what the coalition is really trying to focus on as across in this industry consortium.",

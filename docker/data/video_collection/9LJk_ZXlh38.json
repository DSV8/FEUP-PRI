    "transcript": "- I hate - No! - (grunting) Kickstarters. - No, you keep, you keep taking my intro. Can you hand me that knife that's over there? (screen beeping and crackling) Hello and welcome to This Is. Do you need to start with a good kick in the pants? Then we got the episode for you. Do you need to Indiegogo go to another video because this one started really bad? (Austin laughing) We're gonna look at some of the worst Kickstarter, dare I say, scams? - (gasping) That's my word. - And then we're gonna play a game where we're gonna learn about it, we're gonna give you some info, and then we're gonna try and guess how much they raised in their scam funding. I mean, Kickstarting. (screen whooshing) The Solar Freakin' Roadways. (Austin laughing) Everyone knows the swear jar spill us over if you say freakin'. This made absolutely buck wild promises about how it could replace existing roads with glass-topped solar panels, and basically give free energy to everyone. - So no. Roads are, even though they're using quite simple materials like asphalt, and crushed hopes and dreams, think about the logistics of this. Putting solar on your house can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and that's for what, like eight solar panels on top of your roof? Dude, do you know how expensive this would be if this actually was a real thing? This would cost like, more money than the whole - no, no- - World has, there's not this many solar panels. - Here's the thing, it could, like the glass was durable enough to withstand traffic and whatnot, really, the only reason this failed is 'cause it couldn't withstand the weight of your mom. (men yelling) - How much do you think the Solar Freakin' Roadways raised? - You won the last couple. - I did, actually, I have won, like- - So I gotta hold this to my chest. - Okay. I'm gonna say this raised $350,000 (text beeping) between both Kickstarter and whatever investing- - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going $1.2 million. (text beeping) (Austin screaming) (cash register chiming) - [Matt] Boom! - [Austin] Why, what? (graphic buzzing) - Almost 50,000 backers. What if, crazy idea, instead of making the ground the solar panels, we put the panels above the ground? - What, that's impossible, - Like - Matt. - Every high school that I've ever seen - What? - In California does. - Matt... They also raised an additional almost $2.5 million using StartEngine to put this at a valuation of $30 million. We need to move on, this is gonna go off the rails, off the road so quickly, (car beeping and whooshing) - Right? (Matt laughing) - The Fontus Self-Filling Water Bottle. Don't you hate it when you're outdoors, and you drink all your water, and then have a thirsty, thirsty, dry mouth? (Austin chuckling) Never fear, the Fontus generates water out of thin air. This uses a fan and, or your bike momentum, and solar energy to draw in air and condensates. - So the idea with this is that you are riding on your bike, - Yep. - There's a lot of air flowing in, - Yep. - And then a condensation - Mm hmm. - And drop, drip, drip, the little dribblings into your water bottle, and then you suck 'em all up. (guitar whammying) Theoretically, if we just purely assume that there, yes, is humidity in the air, using a little solar panel to, I don't know, (hands thumping) get that condensation ready to get excited and drop into your bottle or whatever, but I just can't imagine, unless you're riding for like 60 miles in a rainstorm or something, how this is going to be able to generate enough water for you to actually drink. - Well, rain. - As long as you actually start thinking about it for all of two seconds, you realize there's no way. There's no way that can be like, (Austin imitating water rushing) (gulping) I'm thirsty. (slurping) (water burbling and whooshing) How much did this raise? - I'm gonna say $300,000. (text beeping) - Okay, I feel pretty confident. My guess is going to be $27,000. (text beeping) - It's Matt. (cash register chiming) (clapping) Boy! (graphic buzzing) - No, no, (crew laughing) no, no, no. Ooh! - Would you say that money evaporated? (cash floating) The Cicret? - Cicret. - Cicret, ugh. (Matt laughing) - In 2014, this was listed as an Indiegogo, but it was deemed two suss, (graphic zooming) and therefore resurfaced on their own website, taking PayPal (clearing throat) non-refundable donations. Now, the way this was supposedly going to work is it is a $300 bracelet to project your phone screen on your wrist. Now, that actually is again, like most of these, doesn't sound like a completely insane idea. The problem though is that, first of all, I don't know how your arms are, Matt, but I will say my arms are not particularly reflective for a surface to be projected upon. - You don't want reflective surface, you want- - I don't, no. - You want a matte screen, (drum playing rim shot) so I'd be perfect candidate. (audience clapping) - I will actually give a little bit of props to Kickstarter, and a little bit of props to Indigogo for trying to get some of this nonsense off their platform. Clearly, this was it. I'm gonna go first again, - Yup. - Because I feel like it. - Well, I went first last time, but- - Okay, that's fine. I'm gonna say the Cicret raised $51,000. (text beeping) - Okay, so he's completely wrong. I'm gonna like play defensively, 'cause I think there's enough idiots out here- - If you say 52,000, I'm gonna punch you in the face. Do not \"Price Is Right\" me right now, Matthew. Do not \"Price Is Right\" me. - So I'm gonna go with $250,000, (text beeping) - Yeah, that's fine. - Which I think is low. - Okay. - Because I think there's enough idiots that think this would be a real thing. - I don't, I don't think so. (Matt cackling) (cash register chiming) - [Austin] Wait, what? - $640,000? (graphics buzzing) - You know what, the people who probably donated to this, they're probably the people who got beat up for their lunch money. - That's really bold coming from someone who was homeschooled. (Matt laughing) - [Matt] Gills, Triton Artificial Gills. - Frightening. - Looks like a movie thing. This claimed to be the world's first artificial gills rebreather. So this worked the exact opposite way of the Fontus. It would take all the, well, oxygen that was in water and rebreathe it into your lungs. - But the problem is it took all of two seconds for people to do the math, that if you did get literally 100% of the oxygen out of the water, it would require an insane amount of water per minute, something like hundreds of gallons of water per minute? - Yeah. - Like completely impractical. - I can drink that in 30 seconds. (rock music) (screen beeping and crackling) - With their logic being completely and totally blown, - Yep. - The company did the right thing. They closed their Kickstarter, they gave everyone their money back, and they said, \"Hey, sorry we didn't do our math right,\" or they said, \"Ha, ha, just kidding. \"We're actually just gonna sell you liquid oxygen canisters, \"because that's totally a brand new revolutionary thing.\" - Go ahead and guess, because you're gonna be wrong. - Well, okay, so this is, I'm guessing the pre-refunded amount, so like what this originally listed before they took it down? You know how in gambling, if you lose, the best option is to continue betting until you eventually win, or you have no house anymore? That's my strategy today. I'm gonna say that this raised (calm music) $74,000. (text beeping) (hand slapping) - I'm gonna go with, again, $250,000, (text beeping) and I think that's low, but I'm playing defensively, 'cause he's so wrong. (Austin screaming) (cash register chiming) (Matt cackling) - What, what? (graphics buzzing) - [Matt] Almost $1 million. (slapping desk) - Stop it, stop it. Stop it, Kickstarter, stop it. Crowdfund me, stop it! I'm upset, because I'm losing. I'm also upset that, not you, Tim, but you, Jeremy, wasted your money on this nonsense Kickstarter. You could have wasted your money on a free This Is subscription. I guarantee you it's 100% refundable, and $0 and 0 cents. - Invest now in This Is. For a mere $300, you can be an early bird backer. (Austin laughing and clapping) I'll go like this to you. (text rumbling) - [Voiceover] Wow! - On the street. So next up, we have the Skarp Laser Razor. - No, wait. - Laser Razor? Our editor, Aaron, doesn't know how to speak words. (Austin laughing) - And he'll be coming around and just be like, \"Can we get some lunchy-wunchies?\" And so now, like I'm just, if Aaron ever named a product, (cartoon walking) it'd be the Skarp Laser Razor. (anvil falling) (Austin laughing) This came out in 2015 for the mere, mere, mere price of $290. It was powered by a small laser which cuts through hair. It doesn't require water, or shaving cream, and, or lotion. However, lotion is nice at the end to, you know, get a little... (hands slapping) - You'll need it. - Yeah. - After you Laser Razor, you're smooth is a Skarp's butt. (laser shooting) (Austin exploding) - So last year, we had, it was the last year we had an update, and they basically said, \"Sorry, we're outta money.\" Razer should buy the Skarp. - Skarp? - So it'd be the Razer Laser Razor. (text punching) They did update a second model, a V2, - Uh huh? - That had a secondary function so it's a Razer Laser Razor Tazer. (text punching) (Austin and crew laughing) - (clapping) I'm gonna say this was $101,000. (text beeping) - Not even close, so this was $750,000, (text beeping) and again, I'm thinking low. (cash register chiming) $4 million? - What? (graphics buzzing) - I'll give you a consolation prize. - Yeah. - Like the equivalent of putting like a star on the fridge. - Cool, thank you. - Because you were closest to what they were asking for. (star farting) (bell ringing) (screen whooshing) The Crystal Wash 2.0 - I heard Crystal, I don't like crystals. Matt, you know what my thought is on crystal? If it's not \"Pokemon Crystal,\" I don't like it. (game screeching) - This uses no detergent, but uses the power of bioceramics from the earth. (Austin chuckling) - So this used, quote unquote, \"No chemicals,\" but it supposedly creates natural hydrogen peroxide to disinfect laundry, which is a chemical. - There was a social media - Of course. - App accompanying this. - Okay? - So every time you scrubbed, you got scrub points. You have to put it out in the sun every 30 days to recharge it. Your smelly cousin would've really benefited. - Okay, we don't talk about smelly cousins (siren blaring) on This Is anymore. When people actually got these, because they did actually ship some of them, although a lot of backers just simply never received anything. People put these side by side with the actual hot water without anything in there. It was basically the same, so AKA, your natural hydrogen peroxide was a complete scam. - Wrong. - I didn't even say it. - You're- - You gotta let me say the thing, Matt. - Wrong. - Okay, it is gonna be- - Nope, incorrect. - $42,000. (text beeping) - What's it like being a big dumb-dumb? - I'm about to tell you. - It was 700 (text beeping) - Oh my god. - Thousand. (cash register chiming) - Oh wait! I think I get the point. - [Matt] Austin gets the point. (graphic ringing) - $268,000? - The one time I don't (graphic buzzing) play defensively. - I just gotta pet my point. (graphic ringing) just, mm. - Mm. - It's a good point. - You should not pet your point on camera. The Dragonfly Futurefon. - Wait a minute, have we talked about this on a past This Is? Kenzie, this is looking awfully familiar. - [Matt] Right display detached and could be used as an Android phone and or tablet. - The idea is that you can do so much with a device like this. - It was a windroid. - What if... - This is where it gets a little dicey. - Uh oh. - The Indiegogo promo compared its maker to Rosa Parks. - Hmm. - And the Tiananman Square protestors. - And the CEO was convicted on 12 counts of fraud, one of which being poor taste. Hit me, how much was it? (screen booming) I, because I feel like we talked about this on a This Is. - $1.2 million. (text beeping) - Okay, I'm gonna guess less than that. I'm gonna say $522,000. (text beeping) (cash register chiming) - Oh! I think you win. (graphic chiming) - So $726,000. (graphic buzzing) So- - Oh! - Is this what we call a comeback? - Surprise, surprise, this came from the San Francisco Bay area. All right- - Well, Jeff Batio, I think is in jail right now, so... - Is that where the jail is? - What? - Alcatraz? (screen whooshing) - The iBackPack. - In 2016, this came out, and it was $150 for a non-wifi version, - Mm hmm. - And $250 for a wifi version. It had battery port, 16 USB ports, was bulletproof. - Wait, hold on, what? 149 bucks is actually not bad, because last time I bought a bulletproof vest, it was a whole lot more than that. - Why are you buying bulletproof vests? - When you're out here, opening up PlayStations, when you're evaluating DKOldies, - Ah, yeah. - You know, people get a little salty, man, and I gotta just be prepared. So supposedly, the founder was spending all this money that he was supposed to be putting into your wifi bulletproof (Matt chuckling) backpack, on Bitcoin. He was just taking the money out. - Kenzie's got some fun facts for us on this, and I don't care about it at all. The founder also claims he's only 5'8\", but that's because doctors amputated an inch of his leg. - This backpack seems like a good deal. - Kind of, actually. - Bulletproof, wifi? - How much do you think they made for the iBackPack? Which is just a dumb name. - $272,000. (text beeping) - 750. (text beeping) (cash register chiming) - Oh wow, that's good. - [Matt] Boo-yeah! - That's good. (graphic chiming) $721,000. (graphic buzzing) (screen whooshing) The Arist Coffee Maker. - Arist. - This is a, okay, sure. - Arist. - It was a Keurig-sized, quote, unquote \"Smart coffee maker\" that allows you to download coffee recipes and recommendations. Now, people were a little skeptical that that would all fit, and also, they did kind of imply that one of the stretch goals was that PSY of \"Gangnam Style\" would be doing a special performance. I don't quite understand why that makes sense in your coffee maker, but you do you. They did a second Kickstarter, because the first one was quote, unquote, \"Not good enough to meet their minimum order quota,\" before they just disappeared with everyone's money. - They were actually sued by an engineering design firm that they worked with for $715,000, and they lost, and then PSY had to perform for the engineering firm instead. (Austin laughing) - There's a very important little hint here that Kenzie's left, and a little nugget that I have uncovered. If they were sued for $715,000, then my guess is they probably raised somewhere in that sort of neighborhood, because how else would they have been able to give the money to the supposed engineering firm? (bell ringing) No, they didn't. - I'm going with $1 million. (text beeping) - No, I'm gonna say, $482,000 (text beeping) - One million. (cash register chiming) - Fuck off, - $855,000 - I... (graphic chiming) - Short of \"Gangnam Style\". (graphic buzzing) I'm just basking in how right I was. - You're basking in coffee juices right now, Matt - Is coffee juice? - Yeah, you're juicing the beans. (screen whooshing) - All right, last up, we got the Zano Mini Drone in 2013, for $210. You could control it with a smartphone, but you could also control it with smartphone gestures, so it would automatically track the operator or follow him along. It would avoid obstacles in a totally not faked video whatsoever. - The way they positioned this was that they had more features than drones of the time that were 10 times the price. They took over 3000 more pre-orders in addition to the campaign, and while they did ship out 600 pre-orders... - [Matt] Only four of the backers got it. - [Austin] They didn't work, and then they were bankrupt in 2016. - I just like, it looks like you're going, \"Oh!\" I'm gonna guess. - It's gotta be a lot. - I'm gonna let you guess. - All right, I'm gonna give up... I was hoping that one of these would be like $73, and I would win. $822,000 (text beeping) - 1.2. (text beeping) - Okay, we're both pretty close. 2.3 million pounds? (cash register chiming) (graphics buzzing) - 3.5 million US freedom dollars. - Oh my god, that's a lot of money, and they still didn't ship anything! (numbers buzzing and chiming) Besides the four people, and they didn't work. - It turns out that the only obstacles that they - Yay! - Were avoiding was giving stuff to backers. - Thank you very much for watching. Make sure to subscribe and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button here for always fresh content delivered straight to your subscription boxes. I'll guarantee you that (hand slapping) we will not be scamming you out of millions of dollars anytime soon, 'cause if we could, we would. (screen whooshing) - Like, follow, subscribe, and let us know what Kickstarter scams you want us to look at next. - Nope, don't do that. We've already done them all, there's no more. - We got plenty more. - There's no more. (calm music)",

Real Notepad: Notebook   3. Privacy Screen Guard   4. Sync for facebook -   5. Pocket Sense    [Apps that didn't make the list, but still worth checking out]   1. GIF Share Overlay -   Provides an overlay that draws on top of other apps and lets you quickly search and share GIFs without leaving your favorite app  2. Volume Key Cursor Control -  Control your cursor with volume keys.

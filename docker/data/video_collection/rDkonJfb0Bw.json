    "transcript": "Your iPhone is about to learn a new trick: StandBy mode. It's coming with iOS 17, and it basically turns your iPhone into a little bedside clock. All you have to do is start charging your phone and turn it sideways. You can pick from a few different clock faces, or have it show your photos. There's even a calendar view with widgets. Google offers some similar features for its Pixel phones, but you need to use their wireless charger in order for them to work. The thing I love about StandBy mode is that it works with any charger. Look out for StandBy mode coming this fall to your iPhone in iOS 17.",

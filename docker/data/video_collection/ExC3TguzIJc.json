    "transcript": "The Flipper Zero is a fantastic tool to learn about radio signals as well as other technologies. In this example I've got the Flipper Zero connected via USB to an Android phone and I'm going to demonstrate bad USB. So on the Flipper Zero, I'm going to load a script which in this case I've called Android make a call and I'm going to select that script and then I'm going to press run notice what happens on the Android phone I was able to get the Android phone to make a phone call by sending commands from the Flipper Zero to the Android phone. Now just because a lot of people ask this please note I have not enabled USB debugging or developer options on this Android phone it's running the latest version of Android at the time of this recording nothing special has been enabled on the Android phone. This is a great way to learn about rubber ducky scripts or bad USB scripts been available for a long time with tools from Hak5 but it's a great way to learn on a Flipper Zero.",

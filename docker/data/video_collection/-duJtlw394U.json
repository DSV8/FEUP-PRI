    "transcript": "A little over a month ago, I gave you guys the first look at our upcoming LAN gaming center slash badminton center. And I have some really exciting progress updates to share with you guys. Check it out. The server room is now one Dan wider. So Dan, here, here, here, show the people. Stack it, stack it. I am a server rack. Look at me being a server rack and watch this. Wow. Dan can go all the way around. This, this really would have sucked. Let's show them what it would have looked like before. Here's me, a server rack. Yeah, that's a real problem. Enough about that though. Let's talk about what we're going to put in it. Starting with, ah, yes. Ubiquiti's UDM Pro. We're going to have one of these for. Actually, we're going to have two of these. Oh God, Jake's not getting redundant internet again, is he? I don't know. I hope not. That's probably two lines. Sure. So we're going to have two because? They're going to be bonded together so that we have redundancy and failover. I mean, we're going to have 300 people here. So, you know, we kind of don't want it to fail, right? That's fair enough. And speaking of things we don't want to fail, our security system. We're going to have how many of these 48-port PoE switches? We're going to have 10 of these just to deal with all of the PoE that's going everywhere. Because remember that every single door needs like two of these. Every access point. Every access point. Oh my god, the speakers. Dozens of cameras. And, sorry Dan, we're going to have, I think it's two of these Enterprise XG 10 gig switches with 25 gig uplinks. So yeah, I believe these will be our aggregation between the downstairs and up here. And then on top of that, we're also going to have another two of these, but instead of ethernet, they're laid out with SFP ports, which means that we can do 10 gig everywhere. This is so overkill. Okay, so much more to show you guys, and this video is brought to you by Narwhal, featuring their Frio X Ultra combination robot vacuum and mop that will leave your floors looking spotless without you having to lift a finger. And look at that, it's got edge detection. These trenches were here before, but what's new is now they have the conduit that is going to house. power and cat6 and now these openings are much larger which was a costly expense thankfully not for us because they underestimated the size of these boxes and the reason i bet mr daniel besser knows is because power and networking don't mix don't mix and the boxes needed to be bigger fly even these are the ones i'm actually way more excited about each of these is going to have cat6 and an armored six-strand fiber actually those are just duplex receptacles but dan's still right we're going to be using this same style of conduit in fact you can see all of it is run up in the ceiling to run power cat6 and fiber for every one of these rows of tables that is so overkill you wanted it come on man we'll talk about that in a minute first let's have a look at that fiber dan assures me that this is armored so i can just go to town with this i'm kidding i'm i just love seeing the look on his face i know what you're like i'll be careful that's fine joe just relax dan we're gonna we're gonna cut it fiber doesn't need to be this thick well it's as easy to run six as it is one ah so we've got six strands in here even though we will be using two but that's for redundancy yeah well i mean they're going to be public in there and if they get kicked or damaged or broken then we can just keep terminating them instead of having to pull new stuff right for now why don't we just take a look at the inner guts can you yeah sure if I can cut through it the nice thing about having the armored fiber as well as you can see it's like corrugated tube it really protects it from that minimum bend radius as well it makes it really difficult to kind of go past that and because this is the the nice stuff it's pretty flexible too. Uh okay cut away from yourself. Thanks Dan. It's good stuff oh yeah yeah okay I've seen people do this. Hey there we go right we have our plastic sheath on the outside which kind of protects this from scratching other things then we have our armor which is this nice corrugated metal really really tough then we have our inner layer which is kind of the actual fiber part you can see it kind of moves around in there there's a really tough plastic sheath on top of that as well and then we have our pull cord so this wraps around the entire thing yeah you can really heave on yeah you can really heave on that when you get pre-made ones they tie it off to a big eye and then you can you can give her and then inside we have our six fibers beautiful and these these can go up to i believe it's 24 or 48 and again it's the same size no matter what you get so it's just as easy to do six as it is one and because it's glass and not copper it's not really that much more expensive doing this in copper would be like two or three times the price right speaking of copper we also have all of our ethernet all right let's go look at it two or three times the price oh on our way this is fun bonding adhesive hum and that is for this guy right here dan did you notice that um still pretty bad yeah this yeah is all of the spray-on acoustic treatment that is going to do the ceilings of both sides meaning that when you're on a cord or at a land party you're going to be able to actually talk to each other over a distance without it just turning into a bunch of standing wave garbage this right here is pretty much your bog standard cat6a solid twisted pair okay it always blows my mind how much of the stuff you end up putting into an installation like this it's really really hard to make sure that all the runs are done now to be fair because I think I'm getting called out right here there was still 90 runs that i had to do uh and then we changed it all no it's not you oh no no no this is everyone oh i thought you're calling me out because i ordered like 2000 boxes of this stuff and then only used four it's a very real concern when you're running ethernet cable because while you could take that half box and it'll probably make it if you waste the time of running it and you're two feet short that costs so much more than just grabbing another box and making sure that you definitely have enough these all came from Phantom Cables and what is the total damage? We got 40 so we have 40 000 feet. 40,000 feet. Can you imagine coming from that end of the court all the way back to the server room over there? Yeah it's a lot of feet and then there's two and everything there and then there's going to be aps and speakers in the ceiling and then it's a lot of runs I hope we're going to have enough. Dan's going to have all the runs. All of them. They're mine I did have food poisoning last week. I did not tell him to do that. We're going to talk about the paint splotches and we're going to check in with Chase who's working on a proof of concept for our giant screen gaming setup that we're going to have here but first we need to check in with Adam. Oh don't mind me. I'm just here filming our sponsor, Narwhal. We brought the Frio X Ultra here to the badminton slash LAN center to see how capable it is in an absolute worst case scenario and I gotta say while initially we had some concerns based on that it took about an hour to map out the room in fairness to it this room is a disaster area it did do it and it actually looks very accurate and we set it a zone to vacuum and then mop Not only did it figure it out get it pretty clean It has dirt detection so it went back to its base station rung itself out and it is now doing a second pass I mean, I think the before and after kind of speaks for itself here guys The Frio Ultra X is equipped with 8200 pascals of suction power that will make easy work of any large debris and Thanks to the cone shaped spiral rubber heads and 50 degree tilted bristles on the zero tangling floating brush the Frio X Ultra has an SGS certified 0% hair tangling rate. The dual spinning mops are made of microfiber to better absorb stubborn stains without scratching your floors. And I think the performance of them really does speak for itself. The all in one station where the Frio parks includes water exchange for both dumping dirty water and giving it fresh clean water, auto drying for the mops heads, auto detergent filling, self cleaning of those mop heads, which uses the same AI dirt sense feature that is the reason that it's doing a second pass on the floor. Super cool, so it makes sure the heads are cleaned and checked during the cleaning process using multiple sensors. And while the docking station doesn't have a container for dust, you don't need to worry about emptying your vacuum's bin all the time, thanks to a special dust processing solution that compacts the dust in your bin so you can fit more in without clogging. And it does this at a surprisingly mild 71 decibels. Now to answer your pressing questions about the paint. Chase, this is why we couldn't use this wall for our projector setup, because we had to do 1 billion paint swatches to determine the optimal color for the walls in here. We needed something that hopefully wouldn't impact the cast of the light too much, but we needed something that was high contrast enough that you'd be able to easily track a moving object against it. So what do you guys think? What's your favorite color? What do we go with? I like BWF blue. I think we should go with Toronto blue. Thank you. The decision is already made. And it's neither of those. It's gonna be this one. What, that blue doesn't even have a name. BWF blue when we mocked it up and I think he used Maya. It looks like cartoon land. Yeah, it's a lot. You want a serious blue for a serious sport. Yeah, and serious gaming. Absolutely, I get that. Speaking of serious gaming, we have the projector set up. Let's go have a look. Projector gaming corner. The point is, last time we did an update, Chase gave you guys an okay idea of what the console gaming corner is gonna look like, but we've got a more detailed view or that's what we're trying to figure out? That's what we're trying to figure out today. So we actually have the projectors, we have the screens. We don't really have the best equipment as you can tell, but we're gonna get there. This is a quality inflatable couch. I mean, it's gonna store so small. We really need that storage space. Linus happily kept that for like a month. I don't know if I was that happy about it. For our projector, we've gone with the Epson LS-12000B, which was recently liberated from my theater room when I replaced it with the world's largest television. It's not a commercial projector by any stretch of the imagination, but for a residential projector, it's pretty darn bright, it's laser, so it offers excellent contrast, and it is 4K, 120 Hertz, which, makes it fantastic for gaming. I just misaligned it, didn't I? Probably, yeah. I think we're gonna have to give some thought to our mounting mechanism for this. If you guys move the couch, then we can just go between us, yeah. So during the actual LAN, we're gonna have a much taller projector cart. That way it doesn't actually, no one's head is gonna get in the way. Plus we're gonna have it mounted to the wall using the typical mounting system. So what we'll be able to do is just get it a little bit higher, so it won't interfere with anyone. So it should be good. Kinda looks like ass, but I have an idea. Why do we have printer paper here? I don't know, I was gonna ask you. I think we were using it as a mouse pad. Oh, well, why did you ask me why we have it then? I don't know. All right, hit it, boys. Hey, that's more like it, man. Okay, biggest TV, a little better. This, pretty freaking awesome still. All right, let's go. Oh God. Oh, I just nailed everyone. Oh wow, just killed two of our allies. The only real reason that we designed the projector gaming corner around a 120 inch screen is because we happened to already have one, the one that used to be in my theater room. But it's possible that if we just didn't use this screen, it might look fine anyway, honestly. I'm not really convinced I see that much of a difference. Hey, do you mind hitting the lights? I mean, that's freaking awesome. Of course, throw them back on for a second. That won't be the case once the walls in here are all blue. So what we've got to decide today, Chase, is do we need to invest in bigger projector screens? Should we do a quick test and see if we've got the lumens for it? Yeah, we'll give it a try. Okay, lights off again. Let's see how big we can make this. Adam, you ready? I mean, Chase, let's get this table out of here. Yeah, start rolling, Adam. Okay, whoa, whoa, hold on a second. You know what? That's pretty usable still. It is pitch black in here though. It is, but that's, I mean, it's gonna be pretty dark during a LAN. Okay, question for you. This is not a lot of nits, but with your eyes adjusted to the dark, is this usable at this size? This is like super usable, especially since the LAN is probably gonna be a similar darkness anyways, so I don't think it's that big of an issue. How many inches are we? Okay, what are we at? Uh. 195. 195 inches. I think we can go bigger. Let's go larger. I mean, you saw the size of this wall, right? While we're going bigger, we're also gonna go with a bigger batter gaming system. This is packing, oh my God, is that a 4090? Yeah. Okay, all right, cool. Well, we've got that. They want 4K gaming, huh? Oh, that is a solid. Double the area we had before. I gotta say guys, still kind of usable in it. At this brightness, yeah. It definitely doesn't have enough brightness for convincing HDR at this size. Yeah, it's really, you can see it capping out with the highlights. It just like, everything's just kind of white as it can get it. But it's still pretty. Yeah, it's still pretty good looking. How big is this? Like 400 inches at this point? Probably about 300. It's not even completely dark in here. We've got the ceiling black, which we will. You're gonna get less reflections. Like if we wanna cast, you know, whatever's happening on the main stage or whatever, you're gonna be able to see this from the entire facility. I'm not gonna lie. I was really, really skeptical of this projector's capabilities when you were like, oh, we'll just use our home projectors for the commercial space. I was like, it's not gonna work, but. Laser. Yeah, I was wrong. Which doesn't mean that we can't amp it up a notch. I don't know if you guys noticed, but we kind of have two of them. Let's get brighter and bigger. The first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna try to go brighter by aligning the outputs from two projectors simultaneously. Without software and rigging, this kind of thing is honestly probably not going to work. But hey, I want to give it a shot. Do we have this sitting on anything or like? I brought pieces of paper. Oh, is that what the ream of paper is for? Yeah. Making fine adjustments. Icy. Hey, there we go. Yo, this looks like that time I got drunk. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. This is really bizarre. Oh, it looks like watching a 3D movie, but it don't have glasses on. That actually is so weird. It does have like an actual 3D effect almost. If we were professionals and we were able to align this thing, it could be significantly brighter. I mean, that is a lot better. Maybe even HDR, but we are not professionals and that looks awful. And it's funny 'cause this screen's so massive, but on this big wall, it doesn't really look that big. Oh, I think I see where you're going. Yeah. Ultrawide? That we can do. Let's do it. Let's scoot to the side. Oh, wow, okay. I mean, I guess when you have a 300 inch screen, you gotta move, you know, 300 inches to the right, freak. Okay, I'm working on it. Of course, the point of this isn't to watch the same movie twice side by side, but rather to use Envy Surround. For ultra widescreen gaming. This is by far the largest screen that I have ever played Doom Eternal on. Dude, this is surprisingly usable. Like it really still looks quite good. You know what I will say though? Is I think this is about as big as we can go unless we can go brighter. Oh, do you want to try it? Yes, absolutely. I'm just sitting here hogging it. Here we go. You know what this makes me think though? This is a fraction of the size of this wall. What if we could have a screen the size of the entire wall? That looks amazing. Okay. Okay. Holy. Holy. Now all that remains is to check in with our friends from Narwhal who sponsored this video. The Frio X had no issue mapping this room with those tri-laser sensors, as well as its bumpers. And you can learn more about the Frio X Ultra at the link in the video description or by searching them up on Google or Amazon. And if you take advantage of our link below, you can get $300 off the Frio X Ultra. If you guys enjoyed this video, why not check out the world's largest TV? Okay. It's not as big as those projectors, but it's still pretty big. You can sit closer.",

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here So this is a video that's not one of my regular hardware videos It's about something that has plagued Windows laptops for a really long time It's this issue that keeps popping up here and there, and it doesn't matter if your laptop is new or old, or... expensive or cheap, it doesn't matter, because you can still have this issue It's the trackpad There are Windows laptops out there, lots of them, that have really crappy trackpads, and that boils down to one thing... Software. If you have... great hardware like this one, glass surface, great button mechanics... But... It's got crappy software. It's running Elan drivers And, if you're one of those laptop owners that's running something with an Elan driver or Synaptics driver You're not having a good time with the trackpad At least, you can have a better time with the trackpad using Windows Precision drivers. bagaimana And this video explains how to put those drivers onto your existing laptop So first you have to figure out whether your laptop is running Elan drivers or Synaptics drivers, and to do that, you just go to Control Panel Check out the Device Manager and you'll be able to see what you're running And if you're not running either one of those two, you're either running Windows Precision drivers already Or you're running something weird that this video can't help you with Okay, once you have figured which one you have, either Elan or Synaptics, You download one of the two files that are linked in the video description One is for people with Synaptics trackpads, and the other's for the people with Elan trackpads, and depending on which one you have, you just download the appropriate one. But in case you're wondering Both of these files are actually from Lenovo; they weren't meant for this kind of \"hack\" that we're doing. They were meant for something else obviously But, it worked perfectly for this kind of replacement of the Synaptics or Elan trackpad drivers So, once you have the file, you extract it by either running the \"exe\" or unzipping it, and it will place all the files into a folder called \"Drivers\" in a route, and then you go into your Device Manager again, right-click your trackpad whether it is the Elan one or Synaptics one, and then you go \"Update driver\", \"Browse my computer\" Choose \"Let me pick\" and then click on \"Have disk\" Now if you have a laptop with Elan driver, you go for the \"ETD.inf\" file And for the laptops with Synaptics trackpad, choose the Synaptics driver. So basically, you're replacing the existing drivers on your laptop, whether they be Elan or Synaptics, and you're replacing them with Windows Precision touchpad drivers which are SO MUCH better, and the biggest difference you'll notice is, I mean tracking is smooth and everything Tracking is just much more accurate with Windows Precision drivers But the big one is gestures Being able to use the Windows 10 gestures both accurately and reliably makes the trackpad so much better Okay, before you run off to do this, I need to leave a couple kind of disclaimers with you First, you do this at your own risk I've obviously tested this on many computers Probably 40, maybe 50 laptops, and for the laptop that has worked on, they have been great But for the ones it didn't work on, they exploded. No, for the ones that didn't work on, the drivers just won't update. Windows will be like, \"Sorry bud, we can't take these drivers,\" and that's the end of that But the other thing you have to keep in mind is that, you can't let Windows overwrite your new drivers with like an automatic Windows update That's very, very annoying, because sometimes you won't even know that it is updated And all of the sudden, the trackpad's gone back to its old, disgusting self, and you'll have to figure out that Hey, it's because Windows overwrote it And you'll have to redo the process, so you just need to make sure that you're downloading the appropriate update You don't wanna download something that's like, the new Elan, or the new Synaptics driver. You wanna avoid those And, the other thing to keep in mind is that, If you want to, you should probably backup or find a backup of your old existing drivers In case if you wanna revert back to them, so go to your manufacturer Download that driver in advance before you do any of this stuff, before you try. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! I really hope this was helpful because... (sigh) This has existed for probably over a year Kind of, it's gone better over time especially with the new Lenovo driver that's just recently came out like maybe, two to three weeks ago, it's way better now. This works on a lot of laptops, enjoy. Okay, thumbs if you liked this video, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time!",

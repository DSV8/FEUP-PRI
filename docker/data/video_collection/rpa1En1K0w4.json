    "transcript": "today if you want to buy a new graphics card for about 210 Canadian Lira something like this thing is one of only a couple options which is pretty brutal so that's why in today's video I'm going to compare it to a used graphics card you can reliably buy for about the same amount of money [Music] the graphics card that I bought new for about 160 ish US dollars is this GTX 1630 a graphics card which is basically just a GTX 1650 with its limbs cut off let that sink in for a second a GTX 1650 with its limbs cut off I don't know about you but that doesn't bode very well for the budget graphics card space in 2023 but let's have a closer look at it foreign [Music] lead poisoning is conceptually problematic is because back when the 1650 was first launched around the same time humans first settled in the Indus River Valley people were rioting in the streets rightfully so over the price the performance of that thing and those ages ago and it was a better version of this card for the same amount this thing cost me now I I don't know I'm really hoping the used Market saves the day here but I I guess we'll find that out soon enough but with that let's drop this very promising graphics card in the system and see how it performs oh yeah that graphics card looks right at home in the H9 so tiny [Music] now this is always the case we're starting off with GTA 5 at 1080p but I've set all of the rest of the settings to normal which is like low for GTA 5 because you know budget graphics gone so let's see how it handles it oh would you look at that we have some high refresh rate gaming Happening Here I am actually unironically surprised that we're getting about 120 frames per second uh this game is older than I am at this point so it would be pretty brutal if at normal settings we got worse frame rate than this too bad I have seen GTA 5 run a hell of a lot worse than this but I guess that doesn't mean much considering what I do on this channel but still I think it's doing so well in fact that we can take the settings up a notch so I set everything to high in GTA 5 which I guess kind of counts as medium I don't know it's weird ah yes you see this is more along the lines of the kind of performance I was expecting from the GPU although I was expecting it at normal settings so I guess it's exceeded my very very very low expectation so far but again this is with no point of reference right so this result doesn't really mean anything but we'll provide context in a bit but before that let's try some more games CS go just isn't launching I've tried several times it pretends to be launching but when I do control alt delete not responding that's the the extent to which we can play CS go today so with Battlefield 5 at 1080p low settings we are getting a playable result out of this graphics card which again was better than I was expecting my bias going into this meant that I thought this graphics card was going to be like gaming using the flight computer on an Apollo 11 Rocket but it's not the case even a more demanding game like Battlefield 5 is playable at 1080p again there's no context here in terms of other gpus performance but still if you're trapped on some desert hell Island and all you have access to is a GTX 1630 you can still kind of play games with it and you wouldn't even have to Pedal that hard to power it but let's try something even more demonic now with cyberpunk at 1080p we've drifted a reasonable amount from that 60 frame per second Baseline that we're looking for this is with everything at low settings and yeah it this is not great which really does not bode well for other modern games coming out especially in the port Bend but now that we have a reasonable idea of how the 1630 performs let's see how it holds up to context now the used graphics card for today's Death Match Arena of death is this RX 6600 a graphics card that if you shop around you can find used for about 200 Canadian and considering the specs difference it seems like the 1630 is about to be curb stormed here but let's not assume let's drop it in the system and see what happens [Music] oh no context is not very kind to the new GTX 1630 is it a 1080p High settings we are very comfortably in the starter Zone with the RX 6600 I actually think the one percent lows for The Benchmark are going to be pretty bad because the game is running too well on the 6600 oh yes there we go there was some some of the good stuff right there maybe a different game will be more favorable to the 16th City maybe well at least CS go still doesn't work so I I guess that's good whoa at 1080p low the RX 6600 is going hard this is not faring better for the 1630 at all wow that's crazy we occasionally hit over 300 frames per second compared to 60. this wow I'm trying to think of a way to wisecrack here but there's no more brutal put down than that like I don't know so with 1080p High we're still almost getting 200 frames per second uh this is a relatively Barren map uh but I'll have some standardized bench benchmarks showing in a second so don't worry your pretty little heads about that oh cyberpunk is doing a lot better we were struggling in the 20s before whereas now at the same settings we're getting over a hundred frames per second let's see what happens when we Crank It Up to medium with medium settings we're getting 80-ish frames per second in cyberpunk oh no way I just stole like a fancy car look at that yay I finally replaced my tiny little crap box of a car this one barely feels faster than the other one though that it kind of drives as terribly oh with that let's have a look at the benchmarks [Music] foreign [Music] so for a similar price the used card's foot is so far up the 1630s ass that it's never getting its shoe back now you may be thinking David surely there are better new card options at this price point well you can technically buy a 1650 for the same amount which also humiliates the 1630 but stock at this price point is often not available the RX 6400 is also an option but these cards are just obscenely priced for what they are don't get me wrong they have their use but this pricing is ridiculous so at the end of the day the moral of the story is buy used and if you can't do that you just have to cry in a shower I don't know what else to tell you anyway with that until the next video bye-bye thank you [Music]",

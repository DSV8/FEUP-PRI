The attack. My death. Trapped in this endless cycle. Even death is no escape. Each time I awake, this planet seems somehow different. As if changing. This world is becoming part of me. Infecting my mind. My memories. The longer I spend here. The more I can feel my sanity slip away. But I cannot lose hope. (eerie instrumental music) (gunshots rapidly firing) (upbeat drum music) (gentle pop music) (playful instrumental music) Anyone, anywhere Do you see my flare Anywhere, anyhow Anyone, anywhere Do you see my flare Anywhere, anyhow 'Cause I'm over and out (playful screaming) - [Narrator] Welcome to London!

(intense instrumental music) (gentle whistling music) - You ever feel like you're just waiting for a sign? To do that thing you've always meant to do. Sometimes I feel like I'm just standing on the edge of doing great things but something's holding me back but if we've got nothing else to lose might as well jump. This is the end And when (eerie instrumental music) - [Narrator] You are no longer a slave, Abe. They believed, trusted, followed and it led them here. You may have escaped the murderous blades but the fate of your entire people is up to you. (mechanical and electronic blasting) (clock ticking) You must find your full voice.

He is to be shot on sight, henceforth in perpetuity. Your assistance is appreciated and mandatory. The real party doesn't start until he's dead. - [Colt] She is not making this easy. (shot firing) - [Female] Ready to loop? Die already! (screaming) - [Colt] Blasted. (gunshots firing) Die! Damn. (upbeat rock music) I prepare, my leader - [Mia] Long ago, a young girl went with her mother to go pick berries for her father. It was hard at work. But the forest greeted them with a dark, cold silence. Yet determined to find the berries, the rascal broke free of mothers grasp and vanished into the trees. Mother's worried cries faded fast as the girl ran on, over vine, under branch and into the forest deep. - [Ethan] What is it with that creepy story? - [Mia] It's just a local tale. - [Ethan] You're really into that stuff. - [Mia] Quit being so paranoid. (gunshot firing) - [Ethan] No, no, friendly, friendly. Who are you? Who sent you? What's going on? - Shh. They're coming. - [Ethan] Who is? (gunshot firing) (gasping) - [Ethan] Chris? - Sorry, Ethan. (gunshots firing) - [Ethan] Why? (gentle tapping) (gunshot firing) (electronic buzzing) (thundering) (electronic buzzing) (glass shattering) (intense instrumental music) - What is Earth? - [Astronaut] Freedom. Our freedom. (electronic synth music) The old ones. Perished a thousand years ago. Their great cities turned to graves. In their place came new life. I must find a way stop it. Or it will get worse and worse. There's nothing I wouldn't do to save this world. No depth I won't explore. No secret I won't unlock. This mission is mine alone. If I falter, if I fail there won't be anyone left to stop what's coming. (gentle strings music) (calming electronic music) - [Narrator] PlayStation.",

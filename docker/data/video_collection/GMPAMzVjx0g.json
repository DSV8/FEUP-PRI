    "transcript": "- If Tech News is spoken in an empty office building, does it make a sound? (sniffs) Classic philosophical dilemma. (host inhales deeply) There is no answer. TikTok has denied claims that its servers were breached over the weekend after a group called, \"Against The West\" said that they had gotten a hold of 790 gigabytes worth of user data. Data? Data? And source code from both TikTok and WeChat. \"Against The West\" sounds like a rage cover band. Against the West By then, said they've seen no evidence of a breach, while analyst Troy Hunt called the leaked data a \"bit of a mixed bag\" with some of it appearing to be junk, while other parts looking like it could be used for testing? However, some users in the data breaching community note that \"Against The West\" have been targeting Chinese companies and other entities perceived as being \"against the West\" for a while. You see how, that's their name works. And they have breached things before. Okay. It's not like they're just found a public Google Sheet and we're like, \"Ah, we did a big hack. Yeah.\" So time will tell. It's somewhat appropriate to note here that Microsoft just recently helped TikTok patch a one-click exploit that could have let hacker's scrape just about anything they wanted which they could have used to create the most powerful TikTok trends of all time. I don't even want to imagine it. Last-minute leaks have given us a look at some of these stuffs. Apple will probably show off during their \"far-out\" event on Wednesday. And according to Apple inside baseball leakerman, Mark Gurman, this one's all about the pros. By which he means people who are professionals at filling up Apple store bags like they're in the fricking bulk section. Watches are like sour watermelons to them. In addition to the iPhone 14 models, Gurman says we'll get treated to an Apple Watch 8 and Watch 8 Pro, which will have the new square or sides look that everyone thought was going to arrive with last year's models. I guess it wasn't hip to be square yet. Gurman also claims Apple will unveil new AirPod Pro's with an upgraded H2 chip, longer battery life and Find My support in the charging case. If you were hoping to see Apple's highly anticipated VR/AR headset though, you'll have to settle for bad renders based on speculation for now. But Gurman did say Apple release a few different models with the flagship of reality Pro headset launching in 2023. That one is for people who are already pros of reality. You figured real life out. So now you go hang out with Zuckerberg in there. And network infrastructure company, Cloudflare, has announced they have blocked trolling forum, Kiwi Farms after specific targeted threats we're seen escalating on the site in a 48-hour period. Cloudflare had been under intense pressure to drop support for the forum by the #dropKiwifarms social campaign, which highlighted the forum's contribution to online and real-life harassment and bullying which in some cases led to suicide. Cloudflare maintained that like their blocking of 8chan back in 2019, they had made this decision because of the recent escalation and specific threats and not directly because of the social campaign. Since they're not trying to police the Internet. Kiwi Farms has reportedly switched to using servers hosted in Russia, and we can only hope that leads some of them to have a... Are we the baddies moment? Now it's time for quick bits, brought to you by Vessi footwear, who hates wet socks as much as you do. Man, now that's a relatable brand. Well, say goodbye to squelchy socks with Vessi's lightweight, breathable and water-resistant shoes. They're Dyma-tex material not only keeps your feet dry but keeps them warm in the winter and cool in the summer. A spell may also be involved. I don't know? Comfort is at the forefront with our stretchy design and so is responsibility. Vessi makes cruelty-free products. So, right down to the glue their shoes are 100% vegan. Give yourself a little treat, click the link below and use code techlinked, to save $25 today. Now quick bits, they always make a sound. It's very, it's a- (person playfully singing) - Oh, no. Twitter is finally testing an edit button after years of users asking, \"Why that wasn't already a thing?\" In the coming weeks the social platform will roll it out to Twitter Blue subscribers who will have a 30-minute window to edit tweets a limited number of times. You'll also be able to see the edit history. Again, they could have done this so long ago like, even if it doesn't do anything you could just put the button there. I just wanted to see it. Android 13 has just rolled out on Google Pixels but the next version may hop on the bandwagon and offer built-in satellite connectivity, according to Google's Hiroshi Lockheimer. The news comes after SpaceX and T-Mobile announced they'd be bringing the feature to some phones and Tesla cars. And Apple is also rumored to be adding the feature to iPhones at some point. Satellite Internet is still pretty slow but I have to admit it would be cool to know that I just got a message from space. So someone is out there. Hmm. Everyone is losing their minds over this picture of an unidentified graphics card tweeted by leaker person, Greymon55, who says it's an engineering sample used to test in videos \"full-fat AD102 GPU\" That would mean it could be a reference board for the RTX 4090, or 4090 Ti which are expected to launch before the end of the year. But on the other hand, you could tell me this is literally any other triple fan graphics card. And well, I would've no choice but to believe you. I'm very easily persuaded. OpenEye has added a new function to its DALL-E 2 AI image generator called \"Outpainting,\" which allows humans to prompt the AI to fill in details outside the frame of existing images. So far, it's been used to expand some famous paintings and reveal what the painter didn't feel like including. (gasps) There was a whole another table of dogs? (gasps) that is even more unlikely and quaint. And turns out Bungie's canceled splitscreen co-op feature was already in the games code somewhere. Some astute players were able to trigger a glitch that got four players on the same screen on a Series X. Reports are indicating the feature works horribly on Xbox 1 though which may be the reason Bungie decided to cancel it. After all, if you spent the extra money to buy a Series X, you probably don't have any leftover to buy friends to play splitscreen co-op with. Pretty obvious logic. But it would be illogical to continue when the Tech News is over. So, you must come back on Wednesday for more. It's the only rational conclusion. And then cut. Don't include this.",

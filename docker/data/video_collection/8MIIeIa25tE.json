    "transcript": "- Have stolen about two and a half thousand dollars worth of hotel points. And worst of all, you have put me in a middle seat. - On a five hour flight. - Oh my gosh. - Do you have a first password that I found? Does that look familiar to you, Donie? - Yeah, that's a password I still, I use today occasionally. - [Narrator] This is Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder and former CEO of Dreamworks. This is Rachel Tobac, and she can hack just about anything. - The truth is that anybody could be hacked. The method that the attackers used against Uber, Twitter, nobody is 100% secure. There's always gonna be a method that a cyber criminal could use against us. I hacked into a bank. - Oh, that sounds good. Tell us about that. (techno music) - This is a hypothetical situation. Do not think that I'm trying to protect the president, work with the president, or speak on behalf of the White House. - Hey everyone. David Bombal back with a very special guest. Rachel, welcome. - Excited to be here. Thanks for having me, David. - So Rachel, you're really well known in the industry, but perhaps just for people, you know, who haven't seen your videos, or your interviews with CNN and the like, tell us, you know, what do you do in info sec? - So, my name's Rachel Tobac. I am a hacker. Sometimes people use the phrase, \"ethical hacker\". I just use the word hacker 'cause that's describing everything that I think you need to know. But I am basically focused on the human element of security. So all the ways that we hack companies and people through their human-based processes. And I'm the CEO of SocialProof Security and that's what we focus on. - So I think if you use this term before, hacker versus criminal. Can you, and other people use other terms, can you explain, you know, why you're very careful with the word \"hacker\"? - I think the media kind of demonizes hackers and says that they're always the bad folks. - Where's your hoodie? - No, I don't have it on right now. No hoodie. But the media focuses on hackers as if they are only cyber criminals. But a lot of us in the hacking space, we are helping hackers. We're the folks who are trying to figure out how to keep everybody safe. And we have to understand how the hacking process works so that we can protect you. And in order to do that, we have to hack. And so I think a lot of folks don't understand that there are good hackers out there, and the folks who are doing it for crime or they're trying to harm people, we call those folks cyber criminals. So hopefully that's an easy enough distinction. - And tell us about the company that you've got. - Yeah, it's called SocialProof Security. So we help people understand how to avoid getting hacked with the human element of security. So we have training, workshops, we have this new video training that is half music video, half spoken content, all about how to stay safe online. So a lot of organizations are using that for their security awareness content now, which is really cool. I mean I didn't know what folks were gonna think about that, but it turns out people want something different. - Yeah, you're singing in one of the videos I've seen. - I am singing in one of the videos. You might have seen my sea shanty. There once was a kid who's passwords laid Across all sites they were the same A criminal then found their fame By taking that data to go Soon may a criminal come To steal your pictures and data and run One day when the crime is done They'll steal your account and go - The sea shanty was kind of the first trial run just to see are people interested in music-based content? Are people wanting to hear security awareness content in short modules that are pretty different from maybe what they've seen in the past? And after we put out the sea shanty, the resounding answer was yes, we had 100 companies reach out and wanna use that. And then they were like, can you make more songs? So we did. - Yeah, you need to, I looked at your TikTok. I think you've only got that one video, right, on TikTok. - Oh, I'm not a big TikTok user yet. I gotta get up on TikTok. I've pretty much been using Twitter exclusively for the past like seven or eight years. But obviously with what's going on with Twitter right now, I should probably diversify that a little bit more. - I want to ask you about the interviews you've had with CNN because I think you've done some fantastic pieces like explaining some of the problems to a non-technical audience. And I mean we can get more technical in this interview, but can you tell us about sort of what you've been doing with CNN? - Yes, so CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, he reached out to me at DEFCON in 2019 originally. And he was like, \"I want you to hack me. \"I don't want you to tell me how you're gonna do it. \"I just want you- - Big mistake. - Yeah, he was brave. - Have stolen about two and a half thousand dollars worth of hotel points, and worst of all you have put me in a middle seat. - On a five hour flight. - Oh my God. - He just wanted me to hack him. So I was like, yeah, I can definitely do that. And there's two ways that I hack. So I can hack you by contacting you, or I can hack you by contacting your service providers. So I decided to do the latter for that first video with Donie. And I contacted his airline and hotel team, and all the different companies that he's talked about working with on his social media. And I was able to steal all of his personal contact details, steal all of his airline miles, put him in a middle seat in the back of the plane. I actually, this didn't make the final cut in the video, but I was able to steal his, we won't say the name of the company, but a very large coffee company. I was able to steal all of the points and shut down his account. I'm very glad that we had a contract that stated that it might be possible that I can't bring it back because that was the one that I was not able to bring back. That was very sad. - So the question is always, how on earth are you doing this, because don't companies use some type of authentication to make sure that, you know, you are not that person, or make sure that you are the person that you should be calling in. - Yeah, you would think, but we are definitely in the dark ages of phone call authentication. When you call into a company to try and get support, think about the questions that they make you answer to prove you are who you say you are. It might be things like mother's maiden name, your favorite pizza topping, your first band that you saw, right? These are pretty easy knowledge-based authentication questions, and we can fort those very quickly. So oftentimes it's things like your address, your date of birth, right? And I was able to bypass all of his knowledge-based authentication questions and get in and pose as him. And in most cases the call was only like 20 seconds long. - I think you've said this before, I'm assuming it's off social media. Is that how you, you know, find out the details of people? - In many cases it's social media. That's how I figure out who I'm going to contact on behalf of my victim. So which airline am I gonna call, right? I'm gonna find that because that person tweeted, \"I need my baggage, it's stuck in X location\", right? But if I'm trying to find the actual contact details of the person that I'm emulating, a lot of times I'm finding that on a data brokerage site. If you've ever typed your name into Google and you've seen your address, your date of birth, your family members, every place that you've ever lived pop up, that's a data brokerage site, and they sell our data. It's somehow legal, I don't really know how that's possible, but they sell our data, and it makes it easy for me to hack. - So basically you just paid to get access to someone's personal data? - It was free. I've never even had to pay. - [David] Oh wow. - Yeah, it's really wild. You can get a lot of that stuff for free just by making a free account. - I've seen you've used to make it like sound more authentic, you've done calls where you actually sound like someone else, is that right? - Yeah, I do. I have an app that we can use to spoof the phone number. So make the caller ID look like it's calling from somewhere that it's not. And I can change the pitch of my voice dynamically. So in the middle of the call, I can switch my voice and I can also add in background noise. So I'm gonna be doing these phone calls, I'm gonna be actually live hacking. So when I call, your phone number is gonna display on their caller ID. - [Caller] This is Donie O' Sullivan. - Who are you really? - [Caller] No this is Donie O'Sullivan. I can tell you my address, phone number, date of birth. - Whatever you need to know to verify that that's really me. - That's wild. - I think if I remember correctly, the first interview, or the first sort of demonstration with CNN, it was based on phone calls. But the second one, which was more recently, is that right, I think it was this year, you did something else. - That's right. So Donie asked me to hack him again at DEFCON. - [David] A brave guy. - Yeah, he's a very brave person. So he wanted me to try something different, and I said, \"Do you mind if I try \"and hack into your accounts with your passwords?\" And he was like, sure. He's like, \"I don't know how much \"you can really find on me.\" I was able to find seven of his passwords pretty quickly through data breach repositories that basically take all of the breached passwords that are out there about us and put them in one place that's easily searchable. So I can search up his email address, or phone number, or name, or address, and it will return passwords or hashes. Oftentimes I'm able to find plain text passwords very quickly, and these sites are available to everybody. It's pretty scary. - I mean you've highlighted, which I think is fantastic with those videos, you highlighted the problem to both a technical audience but also non-technical audience. But then we get to the big question, and this is where I really want to, you know, push you for, you know, what's the solution? What is the recommendations? And I saw you did a video with YubiKey. And just for everyone who's watching, YubiKeys are fantastic. I have, I use them. This is not a sponsored video so I'm not getting sponsored. Rachel's not getting sponsored to say this, but you did do a sponsored piece with them, right, explaining, you know, a bit about why YubiKeys are perhaps a solution. And I'm preempting this too much, perhaps Rachel. Take us down the path, what was that piece about, and you know, what's the recommendation with these things? - Yeah, so first and foremost, Yubico and YubiKeys are fantastic. Those FIDO solutions make it really hard for me to get into accounts. But I wanna talk a little bit about threat models first, because this is different for everybody. So your threat model is basically the likelihood that you are to receive a certain type of attack. If your threat model is super high, you're probably an activist, or a politician, somebody famous, maybe you're a big Twitch streamer or have an Instagram for your dog with 100,000 followers, right? You have stuff that basically other people want, like your money, or your access, or your data, or whatever. And people with elevated threat models, they have to be extra secure, extra careful, because they're really likely to get attacked more frequently. And people with lower threat models, maybe you don't have admin access at work, maybe you're not really in the public eye and you don't use social media too frequently, and you kind of like to keep to yourself. I would say your threat model is lower. And if you have an elevated threat model, you have admin access, you're a politician, et cetera, you're gonna want to move towards a multi-factor authentication method that's super secure, like a FIDO security key. And if you don't have that elevated threat model, just turning on MFA at all is gonna stop 70% of the attacks that are just bots out on the internet trying to credential stuff. So we know that from Google's 2019 research that basically you can stop a large percentage of the attacks just by turning on any MFA, including SMS, which gets demonized by the info sec population quite a bit. Yeah, I recommend for most people's threat models that you just use an app-based MFA tool. And a lot of them are free, you can just get them online, like Duo or Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator and those are really useful. But getting back to Donie, I would say, what do we do about Donie getting hacked with all of those passwords? I think he just needs to use a long random and unique password stored in a password manager, that's a really important part, so that he doesn't have to try and remember them, turn on MFA, and make sure he understands his threat model. You know, he is in the public eye, he's one of the most public facing people at CNN, and so he has to be extra, extra careful. - I think I've heard you say this, and I'm really glad that you're highlighting that it depends on the threats, the threat model that you're dealing with. I think you've said if you are perhaps just like a normal person, for lack of a better word, you could just write your passwords down and lock it in a safe at home or something, is that right? - Right, yeah. And this is something that I think a lot of people don't understand. So let's say your brother is like a nomad and he lives in a van somewhere traveling around New Zealand, sure. I think for that individual, doesn't spend a lot of time online, usually is hiking, his money's stored under the mattress, right? I really don't think that individual needs to have a YubiKey and needs to have even a digital password manager. If that person barely uses the internet, maybe once a week logs into an email account, making sure that they have long, random and unique passwords that are stored in whatever method works best for them to avoid reusing their password. So if your brother Gregory who does this is very resistant to using a password manager 'cause they don't even carry a smartphone, then you're probably just gonna want to have them write it down in a notebook and maybe store it in a lockbox somewhere. That probably makes the most amount of sense for Gregory. That makes no sense for me. It probably doesn't make sense for you, and many of the people who watch this, probably it doesn't make sense for them either. But for some people, they either think, well I'm never gonna use a password manager 'cause I'm not comfortable with that digital type of product and I'm much more comfortable reusing my passwords, so I'm gonna reuse my passwords, and that's the dangerous thing where we don't give people an out, an option that works for them. - Rachel, in the YubiKey demo that you did, why were you not able to get access to the account? Like why is a YubiKey stopping you as a social engineer actually getting access? - So the YubiKey, I'm not able to hack that person unless I am physically at their machine with them with the YubiKey. I'd have to be like standing behind them, forcing them to do it. And in most cases when I'm hacking, I'm never in person. I'm over the phone, I'm over email, text message. Most people are not bold enough to barge into somebody's office or home and get them to plug something in, and you know, force them to hand something over. And it's tied to their machine. And so I'm not able to gain access to their account. I don't have access to their machine, unless of course I am using malware to gain access to their machine, but we're not talking about that right now. And so I can't steal the multi-factor authentication token from them. It's not possible for me to steal, in a traditional sense. I can't convince you, I can't solicit it out of you over the phone. I can't get you to copy and paste it to me over text. And so it's really, really hard to hack you when you use a hardware security key. - Yeah, 'cause I mean in the demo that you did, which I thought was fantastic, the person that you were calling read their, well firstly you got them to go to fake website, they put their password in, so you got their password, and then you asked them to give you the code. And that's a problem with Google Authenticator, or SMS, or all these, you know, 2FA methods because that person can literally read you the code, whereas with the YubiKey, they couldn't do that, right? - Exactly. There's nothing to read, there's nothing that can be solicited. It's either I'm hacking you in person and stealing everything that I need from you and I have your computer right in front of me or I don't. And that's not how most hacks go down. - So for the more than slightly paranoid of us, we should be getting YubiKeys, and we use YubiKey as an example, but I mean there are others. But I mean that's like a strong recommendation, right? - If you have an elevated threat model, you wanna make sure that you match your multi-factor authentication to your threat model. So if you have admin access at work, if you're in the public eye, you're gonna wanna use something on the end of hardware-based MFA. App-based is okay, but it can be solicited out of you. So I do recommend something like a YubiKey, or Google Titan Key. - So I think most of the audience are gonna be more like the technical side and more worried about security. And I think it's, I'm glad you're highlighting this though because we can always say, you know, you must do this, which is like you must use fingerprints, you must use all kinds of biometric stuff, but that's only for certain individuals, isn't it? I mean the threat model for other people isn't that high. - Right, and so you really have to make the decision that's based on your threat model that makes sense for your harm reduction. Not everybody's going to do the same stuff, not everybody's comfortable with the same level of technology, or has the same digital literacy. So if you have somebody in your family or a friend who's really resistant to using like MFA, or a password manager, you can get them set up with the very easiest MFA, SMS two-factor if that's a match for their threat model, and maybe a password notebook stored in a lockbox in their house. And that's way, way safer than everything they were doing previously. - Yeah, 'cause I mean the problem is everyone's reusing their passwords, right? - Yeah, that's why it was so easy for me to hack Donie because that password, one of the many passwords that we found for him, he was reusing across multiple sites. So I could stuff it into all of those sites and log in as him, especially if they didn't have MFA on, I was just in instantly. - You mentioned SMSs, why does the security niche, if you like, or industry, look down on SMS authentication? - Yeah, because it is the weakest form of MFA. I can understand why they feel that it's not safe. And in many cases for many people, it's not the right move for them. Like for instance, if you are in the public eye, it's pretty easy for me to SIM swap you. Call up your telco, get access to your phone number and steal those two-factor codes. So we've seen this happen to folks who are in the crypto community, or who are really big streamers on Twitch, right? They lose access to their accounts because they reuse their password, and then they have SMS two-factor on there and I can just get into that account. So for many people it is not a good match for their threat model, but there's a huge difference between somebody with 350,000 followers on Twitch, and your brother Gregory who doesn't log into the internet more than once per week. - So I mean, it's a big problem though because a lot of banks say in the UK as an example, a lot of them still use SMSs. It seems to be like SMS is still very popular, even for, you know, sites that you wouldn't think. - I know. - Should use those authentication methods, right? - Banks move slow. So banks all over the world, many of them don't even have a multi-factor authentication option at all. We're still fighting for any access for that. But yeah, SMS two-factor is still unfortunately a huge problem in the banking community, which is a problem that I work on every week with my clients. - Can you imagine? So passwords, minimum length that you'd recommend? - It's actually not about the length. So I try to be, I try to avoid being overly prescriptive. I would say it's more about how crackable it is. So, let's say you have a 40 character password, but it is a very well known lyric to a Grateful Dead song, and all of your posts on Instagram are about the Grateful Dead and about this lyric. That's gonna be something that I add to my word list to be able to crack your passwords. So that actually, even though it's a very long password, would make it easier for me to crack. Now I recommend long, random and unique passwords that are generated by a password manager. So I think if you choose a 24 character password that is generated by your password manager, long, random and unique stored in a password manager, that's great. That's not a prescription though. You have to know what's best for you. If you're the head of state, I'd make it a little bit longer, right? You just wanna make it so that in a future state when quantum computing is a thing and everybody's able to take down all of those tools and use them very quickly against you, then you'd probably wanna avoid that. But for most everyday folks that should be sufficient. - I think let's picture us as people who are individuals but techies, and small medium businesses. And I mean you can also talk about like big businesses. So that's sort of like the threat model, if you like. A lot of people are trying to make their lives more secure. I'll give you an example, I have a YouTube channel and one of my editors got hacked. It seems to be like some other kind of malware going around affected a lot of YouTube channels and they were able to hack my YouTube channel. So I mean I'm obviously more at risk, and that'll come back to your example where you hack the billionaire, 'cause I think that's kind of tied together. So let's pitch it that way. So 24 characters is a good recommendation, right? - Yeah, but I don't wanna be overly prescriptive. So I would just basically make it as long, random and unique as you are comfortable. And if it's stored in a password manager, then it could just enter it for you and you don't have to remember anything or type in all of those characters. - I don't wanna put you on the spot, but it's nice to push on these kind of things. Any favorite password managers? - There's a lot of them out there. So I think LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden, KeePass, Dashlane, those are all fantastic. You just wanna pick one that's reputable, that's well known, and not just download any old thing off the internet. That's probably where the danger comes. - Yeah, I mean I use, well I'm scared to say anything what I use, but I know with LastPass, it got hacked, but it seems to, that didn't affect the credentials that people were using, right? - That's exactly right because everything in the password vault is encrypted. And we don't currently have the capabilities to break encryption right now. Maybe when we have quantum computing it'll be possible, but I don't think that's something that we're gonna be seeing in this year. And so a lot of times people will be like, oh well what if I store all of my eggs in one basket? How bad is that gonna be for me when that organization gets hacked? And I say use a long random and unique password for your master password. Make sure you have multi-factor authentication on. And even if the password manager does get breached, they still aren't gonna be able to understand what you have in there. But if you're still so politely paranoid that you can't use a password manager and you feel like it's keeping you from being safe online, then you consult your passwords and your password manager. So you can store everything in there, and then have like a little code that you put on the end, somewhere in the middle, or somewhere in the beginning. That way, even if it's possible for us to break encryption, which again, it's not, we're living in a hypothetical world here, but if we were able to get in there, it would still not be possible for us to see the actual passwords. - I used a term in, when you were explaining that, you used this term \"politely paranoid\", and I've heard you use that before. What does that mean? - I think a lot of times our organization, the info sec world thinks that we are so paranoid that we can't use technology, or we're so paranoid we can't use social media or even answer the phone, right? You'll see people say, \"The only way that I stay safe from phishing \"is I never check my email.\" I'm like, okay, well that's not very functional. You need to be able to do your job. So politely paranoid is the phrase that I use. It basically means you can still go about your life, you can still do all the things you wanna do. If you wanna use social media, go for it. Just be politely paranoid. If someone reaches out to you and says that they're your assistant's assistant, make sure you verify that before you go ahead and give away credentials or a deck that's sensitive. - I think the example I heard you use is if someone phones you, you should send them a message on Slack to confirm that it's actually the person that they're saying they are, right? - Yeah, it's basically like human-based multi-factor authentication. So a lot of times our technical tools are better protected than our human-based protocols, right? Someone calls you up, says that your bank and they're with loss prevention and they need to make sure that this charge from Florida is legitimate, and can you go ahead and verify your date of birth? It's like, actually no, let me go ahead and verify that you work at my bank, right? And so what I would do is I would hang up and call the number on the back of the card. That's one way to thwart spoofing. Or you can have them send a code to your email that you read out that's actually from the bank, right? There's all these different ways that you can verify people are who they say they are, so it's helpful. - That's great. I mean, so don't accept anything at face value piece. Politely paranoid that perhaps you need to find another way to verify that it's actually the person that they say they are. - Exactly. Just like you would use two-factor on your technical tools, you've gotta use two-factor in your human-based experiences as well. - I mean I've heard you say this before and you said it during this sort of interview that telephone is in the dark ages, right? - Yes, phone call authentication is 100% in the dark ages. Can you imagine if you could log into your Instagram with your address and your date of birth? Never. That doesn't make any sense, right? You log into your bank with your mother's maiden name and the spelling of your last name, that's ridiculous. But that's how it works when you call some telco, some hotels, hospitality organizations, it's just ridiculous, you know? It's ridiculous to be able to get into an account that easy. And I want people to really start paying attention when you call to get help with customer support, pay attention to the questions that they are asking you to verify you are who you say you are. 'Cause if they're easy for you to answer, they're gonna be really easy for an attacker to pretend to be you too. So you wanna make sure you use multi-factor authentication, not knowledge-based authentication. - But I mean, how do you, you can't dictate that to, you know, the big companies. Is that something that you're just trying to do with education to try and educate these big like telephone companies and the like that they need to change the way that they authenticate people, you know, on the telephone? - Well a lot of those companies are my clients, so I can kind of help them through that process of updating to multi-factor authentication from knowledge-based authentication. So when I speak like that in generalities, I'm kind of broadcasting to the world that this is probably what we're gonna talk about at your company. But you don't have any control as a consumer. All you can do is request to your company that they protect your data. So you can say like, put a note on my account that if I give you a call, you'll send a code to my email on file to verify that it's truly me calling and asking to change my SIM card or what have you. - Yeah, I mean the example of SIM cards or the SIM swap is a great one because I mean if someone's brave enough, or like you very good with social engineering, they could phone the company and get them to make a change using that method, and rather than trying to attack you online. I want to get back to the security online. So first thing is use good passwords. It's impossible for us as humans to have good passwords, because I think the example you've used many times is people just use variations of the same information. I mean it's difficult as a human to remember too much and use too much personal data in your passwords, is that right? - Yeah. A lot of times if we make people change their passwords super frequently, or have a million passwords on sites, they're just gonna put small variations, like an exclamation point at the end, a capitalization in the beginning, right? People listening to this right now are like, yep, that's what I do. Because that's what everybody does, right? And so we just need to make it less about the variation and more about having a long, random and unique password. Don't make small tweaks, make large tweaks to every password. - And the way you do that is to get a password manager. So that's the first step, right? - Yep. - And then the second step is to use 2FA. So if you can't do anything better than at least have SMS, but what's the next step? Is that to use Google Authenticator or some kind of app on your phone? - Yeah, an app-based multi-factor authentication tool is what I recommend for most threat models. But if you don't feel comfortable, like let's say you don't have the digital literacy to use something like Google Authenticator or Duo, then SMS two-factor is much better than nothing for most people. If you have a super elevated threat model, then I would say you've gotta use app-based MFA because I could SIM swap you and gain access to that. But if you don't have an elevated threat model, then it's unlikely that I'm gonna want to swim swap you at all. - But just do play devil's advocate. - Yeah. - A teenager managed to hack Uber, and I think it was a Twitter as well that they managed to hack by, is it called MFA fatigue, is that right? - Yeah, MFA bombing, MFA fatigue. It's where the attacker will just send you notification after notification hoping that you get so annoyed that you click, yes it's me. So in the case of the Uber hack, the attacker basically on WhatsApp said, \"This is IT support, \"we need you to authenticate so that we can support you.\" And the person was like, no, right? And over and over and over again, they're asking for them to gain access, and eventually they just said, we're not gonna stop doing this until you hit Yes. And then the person got fatigued and hit Yes. And so the attacker sometimes will pretend to be IT Support or just bomb your MFA over and over again until you say yes. Which is why a lot of these tools are turning on things like number matching, where you have to verify that the code on the device that you're requesting access to MFA from is really you. And you can only do so by seeing the number on the screen. But remember, attackers are always going to get smart, and they're always gonna outsmart the new methods. So eventually they'll build into their scripts, okay, and you should be seeing a number on your screen, can you go ahead and read those out to me? Or here are the options, right? And so we're always gonna be able to kind of one up that over time, which is why if you have a super elevated threat model, you wanna use something like YubiKey or a Google Titan Key. - So you did this piece with YubiKey, and that kind of highlighted the problem with social engineers like yourself, people with very good social engineering skills. - Right. - Because you literally got the person to read the code to you, right? - Exactly, yeah. So we were mimicking in that YUBICO video, the exact method that the attackers used in the Twitter 2020 hack. And Twitter was really open about what went down during that attack. They had a whole blog post that explained it. And so we reenacted that in a Superfund CSI style way, and showcase what it looks like when we're trying to steal those codes over the phone. That also happens in text messages, like what happened in the Uber hack. And we also saw that CloudFlare and Twilio were hit with text message based attacks. So CloudFlare didn't end up getting attacked even though three people fell for it and gave out their passwords because they had a YubiKey. And they weren't able to siphon out the MFA codes. So again, if you have admin access at a company, it's a really good idea to start a small test group of people who have that admin access to use something like a YubiKey. - I mean it's funny on YouTube, I always get that my, I always say this. My most common comment I get is, \"David, this is dumb, no one's going to do this\", like for basic hacks. But I mean you've, the example you've given is actually based on real world events because people fell for this. Uber, Twitter, et cetera. So is it fair to say that often these hacks are not that complicated, it's just someone managed to fool someone into revealing information that they shouldn't have given? - That's exactly right. There's a lot of debate about how people always use the word \"sophisticated\" to describe cyber attacks. Oftentimes the sophistication is a teenager calling up an employee, right? And so that's up to you. If you feel like that's sophisticated then you can use the word sophisticated. I would say most cyber attacks are not super sophisticated. They're as simple as making a phone call, sending a text message or email, and tricking somebody into giving over your password or your MFA code and gaining access to the admin access. So it's one of those things where it's up to the person to decide how sophisticated that really feels to them. - You did this interview with a billionaire, so perhaps you can just tell us what happened there because I want to latch onto that and on what happened with my sort of employee with YouTube. - Yeah, I don't know what happened to your employee. I'm not sure what type of malware they used, but we basically called up this billionaire who gave us permission, by the way, to hack him. And his name's Jeffrey Katzenberg. And he was like, \"You can hack me however feels right\". So we impersonated his right hand man, we gave him a call. Said, \"Hey, we sent you an email, \"go ahead and click that real quick. \"We need to verify something for our investment team.\" He did so and when he ended up clicking that, because his machine was out of date, the software had, you know, sees that little thing come in and he is just like, \"Nope, I don't wanna update right now\", we were able to use a Safari cross-site scripting exploit and gain access to his webcam, steal his photos, all of his email content, notes, all the things that were tied to iCloud. And I'm not gonna get into the technicality of that specific hack, but it was pretty scary. I mean, we were able to turn on his webcam and turn off the signifier, that little light that said, hey, you're being recorded. So he had no idea any of that was going down. And it was really fun to see his reaction. - He wasn't happy. - No, he was not. - Oh boy, Rachel, Evan, you people are bad people. - Yeah, the piece that was interested in when I watched that was I think Evan said that he was able to grab a whole bunch of passwords because when you connect to a website and you authenticate, it leave a cookie on your computer, and then you're not authenticated again. So if you've got access to the session, you can access a whole bunch of websites, or you know, different places. I think I understood that right, and I think that's what happened to my employee. They were logged into YouTube, and then the malware basically harvested the sessions, so the cookies, and they could just use that to log into various websites. - Yeah, that is something that we're seeing in the wild a lot right now. - Yeah, John Hammond did a whole piece 'cause I think they tried the same thing on him. I dunno if it wasn't the same malware, but they tried the same thing, and he went through a whole technical analysis of that, and I'll link that video below. - The truth is that anybody could be hacked. The method that the attackers use against Uber, Twitter, nobody is 100% secure. There's always gonna be a method that a cyber criminal could use against us. So it's really one of those things where it's really a matter of when not if somebody will be breached. And that's why it's so important to layer, like the Swiss cheese model, your MFA, and your long, random, unique passwords, and logging out of your sessions once a day, and you know, all of those stupid stuff that just makes us so annoyed to use our machines. But you have to layer them so that we can protect ourselves. - I'm glad you said that. I mean it's, in this case, it wasn't me that got hacked, it was someone working for me, but I think it was exactly that. The session keys were kept on the device. - Right. - And obviously if they had malware, they could do what they wanted, 'cause like Evan took control of the computer. - Exactly. - So you've mentioned a whole bunch of things there, and the cookie, the saving of cookies seems to be a problem. So are you recommending for high threat environments to log out of the session every day? - Yeah, that is something that most of my clients do at this point. So they'll have everybody reauthenticate in the morning for work, or they're really extra politely paranoid, they'll make people authenticate after lunch as well. - And I think you've mentioned this as well, is have a different computer for personal and work, right? - Exactly. Why is that a problem? Sorry, go on. - Yeah, it's important to segment your machines because if your personal machine gets popped, it's not going to affect your work and vice versa. So you wanna make sure that you use different machines for different workplaces or different experiences online. We see a lot of issues when people merge everything together in one device, right, and then they click on a phish from their personal email address. Maybe it was a coupon for something for Black Friday that's coming up, and boom, now their work machine is popped and that's gonna affect their livelihood. So we do recommend segmentation. - It's interesting after that, the whole thing about logging out, and I'm glad you've highlighted that again because the cookies are held for a long time, way too long. And it's great that you saying you're recommending to clients to log out. So Rachel, take us to the extreme. What should I do? So like a lot of the audience, really techy, really want to go to the extreme. Tell me, I'm not the president of the US, but let's say I'm a high profile person. Take me to the extreme, what would you recommend? - Let's say I'm working with the White House with the president. Okay, we'll go all the way to the extreme there. I would say you want a long, random and unique password stored in a local instance of probably KeePass on your computer, doesn't connect to the internet. And your passwords, let's just say they're gonna be long, random and unique and over 60 characters. We're gonna live in a world where quantum computing is possible and we're able to gain access to tools that can allow us to crack really long passwords. Then you're gonna have a YubiKey for every single site that you use, and you're gonna have backups of those YubiKeys. So you're gonna have two to three backups so that if you lose a YubiKey, you can still use the backup YubiKey to gain access to the account. That way you don't need to downgrade to a worse version of MFA. You can still use, you know, your lockbox stored in a skiff somewhere. You can use your second or even tertiary YubiKey if you lose your second. - So I just, I want to make sure I understood you. You're not saying one YubiKey per site, it's you have like three YubiKeys. - Exactly. - And that, so the primary is used for all those sites, right? - Yeah, that's exactly right. And one of the biggest gripes that people have with hardware-based MFA, is what if I lose it? Like how am I gonna get into my account? How am I ever gonna do account recovery? And that's why I say you want two, three. I mean if you're the president, you want 10, right, backups stored in a skiff, in a lockbox somewhere. And then from there, you want to make sure that all of your sites are trusted, that you're not logging into a site with a password, and you're not quite sure which site that is. Is that the real airline? Is that the real social media site? And then from there, I would say on your social media, never post any pictures of your workstation. So when people go in, let's say they're taking pictures of the president in the Oval Office, we'd want all badges, ID cards, CAC cards in the corner, anything that has to do with identification, any software that's in use, any router boxes, you don't want those in the background of any images so that we don't know exactly what version of software you're running. We can't tailor malware to work for your specific machines. Then I would say if you're the president in the United States, you probably want to reauthenticate your sessions every at least half day. So you authenticate when you wake up in the morning, and then you do so after lunch, and then maybe after dinner as well if you're still working at that time. That's probably what I would do. That way if somebody attempts to get persistence on your machines, or let's say they've hacked your browser, they're gonna be really annoyed 'cause there's not a whole lot that they can do. You're just gonna keep getting locked out. - The half day thing is when, I'll just use YouTube for like a normal person. So when I go to YouTube and I log in. Then as soon as I've, like twice a day or so and I log out of that website, is that what you're saying? And then I have to log back in again. - Yeah. And a lot of times it means that you need to put your password and your multi-factor in another time. You can also make sure that your cookies are clearing so that your sessions are not persisting on your browser for long periods of time. Another thing that I would recommend if you were the president, David, is- - Or just someone more than slightly paranoid. - Well, you're using a YubiKey for everything, so that's pretty extreme. You have a long, random and unique password. When people contact you, you use a second method of communication to confirm that they are who they say they are and haven't been compromised. So let's say someone says, hey, this is the assistant to the county clerk in such and such location, we need you to send us the private information about the election results of this thing that we don't know about in the public. You would verify that that is an authentic communication, that that person hasn't been popped. So okay, I'm gonna go ahead and call that person, my assistant's gonna call that person, make sure it really is them. Okay, we'll continue our communication and send the materials you want. That is one of the most frustrating elements to incorporate into your life, verifying that people are who they say they are. It can feel very manual, but it is a really big upgrade if you'd like to do that. I would just recommend doing that for every average person when they're sending money. So you know, someone requests a Venmo because they need support, and they're stuck in a foreign country, and this is your cousin, Mark. Verify that that really is Mark before you go ahead and wire him $500. Let's see, I would make sure that all of your machines are up to date constantly. So if there is a new patch on your phone, your iPad, your computer, it is completely up to date. - Can I just say there's someone's, people have recommended in other interviews that you don't do your internet banking on your computer, you do it on your phone. Do you agree with that? - I think it's a little reductionist. It depends on how up to date your computer and phone are. It depends on what type of machine you're using. It depends how safe your passwords are. Are they reused? Does your bank allow you to use app-based MFA? I mean there's like a million things that go into that. I wouldn't say one is categorically safer than the other, to be pedantic. - No, that's great. I mean, I love getting viewpoints and it's, you know, that's what I love about what I do is I just talk to different people and get different viewpoints. And it's amazing if you get all that information, it really helps you make your a decision for yourself. And sorry, I interrupted your flow. So what else do you think I can do to, for the viewers and myself to be like extremely paranoid? - I would call up all your service providers and let them know that you're high risk, and say, \"When I call you \"and I try and change the admin on the account, \"the email or the phone or what have you, \"you need to verify with another method of communication \"that it's me before you go ahead and do that. \" So let's say I, this is in quotes because of course this would be the attacker. Let's say I give you a call and I'm trying to change the email address on my telco account. I need you to go ahead and shoot a code. Doesn't have to be technical, it could be a word, it could be a series of numbers or letters to my phone or in a push notification to my iPad or whatever it is that they have available to you or even to your email address, and I need to read that out before you make any changes on my account. Now you could get yourself locked out of your account, but that's important that you protect yourselves. I would also lock down your SIM card. You can do a SIM lock for most telcos. I would use encrypted communication only. So I would use probably something like Signal to communicate with people, Proton Mail. I wouldn't put anything in writing that I wouldn't want to be read out in a court of law. - [David] Oh wow, yep, I like it. - So if you're not comfortable with it being read to you by a judge in front of all of your peers, don't write it down. Don't say it over unencrypted communication. I would salt my passwords in the password manager, so I'd make sure I have that code that only I know that if quantum computing was possible and they could break encryption, then they'd be able to get into the encrypted vault. I would make sure that the folks who work with me take all of these procedures as well, because a lot of times it's like you mentioned in the situation that happened with your YouTube channel, it wasn't you that got hacked, it was a team member, right? And so they also would need to use YubiKeys, and they would also need to implement the be politely paranoid method of using a second method of communication. They would also need to salt their passwords, you know, all that stuff. We don't go after usually the head of state, we would go after the executive assistant, right? - What was interesting with what happened with me is we were using 2FA, so we were using Google Authenticator, but they still managed to get past it, 'cause I think it was malware. Well it was malware that managed to get onto the computer, and then obviously it didn't matter, 'cause the credentials and the cookies were there. - They got into an authenticated session is probably what happened. - Exactly. - I don't know what happened. That's my guess. - Yeah no, that's probably what happened very based on what we've investigated. That's more than likely what happened. And it seems to be happening to a lot of YouTubers, and a lot of them are, it's either themselves or their editors. In this case it's like an editor that got attacked. It happens a lot. So it's like John Hammond did the, as I said, mentioned did this great piece where they tried to do it to him personally, which was hilarious, trying to do it to John, and he opened up the malware and had a look at what they were doing. But sorry, I interrupted your flow. What else can I do if I'm more than slightly paranoid? - I wouldn't post about the services that you use on social media, 'cause then I don't know who to call on your behalf and attempt to attack them pretending to be you. - So like don't, like your airline, right? - Yeah, like I would not say, \"Oh, I'm so glad we subscribed \"to this new makeup subscription box. \"This is fantastic and I love it.\" I wouldn't say, \"We in the White House use XYZ software, \"and we love this Chrome extension\", right? Because then I'm gonna think, okay great, the White House uses that Chrome extension. Let me see if I can find a vulnerability in it. It just makes it easier for us to figure out what it is that you do or do not use and what we wanna target. - And that's why you said don't, I think I've heard you say, people make the mistake of taking photos of their workstations, like it's a birthday or an event, and you can see in the background, is that right, what's on their computer screen? - That's exactly right. And oftentimes we'll see like, oh okay, they use that Chrome extension, or their browser's really out of date, or I can tell from the background of their computer that they haven't updated their operating system, because Macs often changed the background photo when you've updated your operating system, right, so we can tell, it looks like this person's running something that's pretty out of date. - Okay, so paranoia, Mac, Windows, Linux, or doesn't it matter? Just keep it up to date. - Just keep it up to date. You can use whatever tools you want, it just needs to be up to date. I would be careful where I am procuring my tools. So like I wouldn't buy a really cheap keyboard that plugs into my workstation, because that cheap keyboard might have been made overseas at who knows where. And maybe that could function as some sort of, my guess is they probably would not try and make your keyboard malicious, but you never know, right? If you're a head of state, you have to be careful with your supply chain. - Yeah, I think it's a, I mean the NSA did that, didn't they? They were in intercepting Cisco routers, and they were putting stuff into the routers. So it's not like out of reach, this kind of stuff happens. And I think for the audience, it's interesting to hear like what's the most paranoid way of doing it, and then you could just scale it back a bit for, you know, your own threat model. But that is a good point. I mean like if I buy something from Amazon, you know, how do I know it's what it's doing? And I mean just taking it a step further, like what about CCTV cameras? I mean there's this big problem in the UK where a lot of the cameras were bought, and again, I don't wanna get into the politics of it, but a lot of cameras are bought from a company in China, and now the UK government is like saying, okay, you can't buy these cameras anymore, they need to be replaced, because who knows what's happening. - Yeah, I can't speak to the CCTV cameras that you have there, but yeah, you'd wanna make sure that any infrastructure, any tools that you're plugging in anywhere are legitimate and they haven't been tampered with in any way. When I say it's unlikely, I mean for an everyday person. It is very likely for a head of state. So just to clarify my previous statement with the keyboard, if I were malicious, I would attempt to make the very best keyboard and sell it to a head of state. So that's definitely something I would do if I was trying to hack them. I would not probably try and do that to an everyday person. It's just more likely that you're gonna get found out, and then you've wasted all of this research and this work on creating something that maybe isn't gonna give you what you want as an attacker. - Let's scale it back to companies now. You do a lot of consulting, you have a lot of companies that you work with. What are the biggest quick wins that they have? Is it like 2FA, or is it YubiKeys? What do you find like really, like if I'm a small medium business, or I'm working in a company and I wanna make some recommendations, what are the best things that you would recommend I do, tell my boss or I implement myself to get a quick win? - If you're running a company, and you want a quick win, implementing a password manager at your company is one of the biggest changes that you can make. So implement a password manager so people can use long, random and unique passwords at work, and hopefully allow them to use it at home, or give them an instance that they can use at home as well, because home life affects work life, even if you don't wanna think about it like that as a company. And then get them set up with multi-factor authentication that matches their threat model, if they have admin access at work, they should move towards a hardware security key, or in the future, something like a passkey once that becomes a little bit more ubiquitous. But yeah, I mean the quick wins that you can get is password manager, not reusing your passwords, not storing passwords and sending them in Slack, et cetera, which is something that we see everywhere. - I was gonna say, wasn't that Twitter, Uber, all of them. - Everybody. - Fantastic security, and the passwords are going in Slack. - Every company, yeah, every company does that. I mean, most companies can be hacked the exact same way that we saw in the Twitter and Uber hack, because most companies do not yet use a password manager for every single site. And they oftentimes don't match their MFA to their threat model. So doing that plus updating your phone call authentication procedures, or your methods of verifying identity, if somebody calls up your team member and says, \"Hey, I'm IT support, \"I need to get access to your computer \"so I can update something for you\", what method have you already talked about with your team to verify that really is IT support? You have to make sure that everybody on the team's ready for that threat, 'cause that is the most likely call they're gonna get at some point in the next year, or text or email. - Rachel, do you have any crazy stories? I mean you've done these fantastic pieces with CNN, and I mean, you're well known in the industry, but have you got any like fresh stories or interesting stories that like are just outrageous, or that are, you know, notable to share? - I hacked into a bank. - Oh that sounds good. Tell us about that. - Okay, so I had this bank hire my organization to hack them, and they used a really interesting procedure, which I'm not going to spell out in its entirety, but I'll give you high level broad strokes. Basically if you want to change the admin on the account, let's say your family has changed, or the person that you'd like to be in charge of the bank account has changed, you have to go through a process of submitting documentation to gain access to the account. So the process that we went through is we fabricated IDs, fabricated bank statements, fabricated all of these documents that you need, and social security cards within a couple of days, got into two accounts, and were able to steal everything. So these banks that are often, and I don't wanna give you too much information, but one of these bank accounts, we didn't even know the email address on the account. We made a hard version of this attack that was so challenging, we didn't even know the email that was on the account and we were still able to take over that account within one day. By pretending to be that person saying that they got hacked, and this person's taunting them online and fabricating all of these communications, and sending in social security information, I mean it's really crazy. If you don't have a really good MFA method in place for your accounts, you have to think about how is somebody gonna do account recovery with us? How can we leverage multiple methods of communication? And I have another story for you too. A company in the service space, I guess that's all I can really say. They wanted to understand how much information was being leaked to the press about an upcoming merger slash acquisition. And it was my job to get an understanding of how do people protect information within the organization? Do they understand the methods, you know, the extent to which an attacker would go to get this type of content. So I pretended to be somebody who was applying for a product manager job at this tech company, huge company. And I'm not a product manager, I don't have product manager experience, but I studied for weeks to be able to pass this interview because I knew it was probably gonna proceed through. So I went through the whole interview process, I interviewed with five different people at the company. And during my Q&A portion, you know, at the very end of the interview, what questions do you have for me? My questions were things like, where do you see the future of this company going? - [David] Oh wow. - Can you imagine a world where this company has an exit? What does that look like, right? And a lot of people would say things like, \"Well I can't tell you exactly what's coming, \"but I can say there's good news\". Or you know, I'm not allowed to talk about it, but let's just say wink, wink, you know, there's things coming on the horizon. And then when you ask more leading questions, you can get more information. Now I did end up getting the information that I needed, but people were pretty cagey about it, which was good 'cause people understood that they weren't allowed to talk about it, they just weren't sure the extent to which they could. And so making sure your employees understand what types of questions an attacker might ask to lead that information out of you. The other fun nugget of that story is I ended up moving ahead with the product manager role and they wanted to offer me the job. So I went through this whole pen test and could have had a product manager job too. - I think that, I mean there there's a cautionary tale there because I think it depends how paranoid you are once again, people are worried about agents or whatever you wanna call it, people being embedded in companies that are actually there for other reasons. - Yeah, I mean there's a lot of talk of insider threats and what that can do to your organization. I would say these specific instances weren't insider threats, but you could imagine a world where somebody is working at a company just to leak information to the press. So making sure that people understand, like what are the rules? How do we talk about this stuff? And what are the implications of talking to the press, and what can that mean for the organization? - You had some difficult questions. You're a team, it's you and Evan, is that right? He's technical, like he does the technical piece, like Hashcat and all that kind of stuff, and you do the human part. In your experience of all these engagements, how much is techy, how much is actually human, like that gets you a win? - It's about 80% human-based and about 20% technical. So I would say the majority of the pen test is me talking with people on the phone, doing my OSINT, formulating my pretext, figuring out who I'm going to be, figuring out who to target, and who they are friends with from their Snapchat story. And then contacting them, actually doing the dirty work of befriending them, or pretending to be a customer and verifying that I really am that customer appropriately. And then so little of it is actual payload. That's just like the little moment at the end, right? - It's amazing, 'cause I mean I think a lot of people watching are more technical. And I think there's this misconception that, yeah, social engineering is easy, social engineering isn't that important. But from what you've said and what I've heard many, many others say, social engineering is like a key piece, and that's invariably how most companies are hacked. - We know from research that's come out recently that the majority of cyber attacks start with social engineering. So almost every cyber attack you hear about is someone getting tricked over text message, phone, email, giving up a password, giving up multi-factor authentication, or just sending money, sending data to the person that requests it. And sometimes is it simple as saying, \"Hey, can you share me on that deck?\" Then they shared it with you. - If I want to become a better social engineer, do you have any resources that you'd recommend? And let's just step back, how did you get into it, because I believe that's a really interesting story because you didn't, I think you were a teacher, is that right, in a past life? - I got my start in social engineering at DEFCON where we got into a glass booth. I ended up hacking companies live over the phone and I got second place three years in a row in that competition. The competition has changed a little bit now and it's under new ownership. So if you wanna go to DEFCON, you can even try and do a cold call where you have no experience, you haven't done any of the OSINT to prepare, and you just get in the glass booth during lunch and go ahead and do some cold calls. I highly recommend trying it out, because hacking in info sec is a very hands-on world. And you'll learn so much more from that 10 minutes in the glass booth than you would ever learn reading blogs or Twitter threads. - Yeah, I think the story was didn't Evan call you and say, \"You need to come to DEFCON \"because they've started this new thing.\" You were doing something else totally different. - Yeah, I worked in the tech space in community management, UX research, my background's in neuroscience. I used to work in a rat lab, I was a teacher for years. I have all these totally disparate things that I've done in the past. But yeah, I was still at a different tech company, and he said, \"I need you to fly out to Vegas.\" And I'm still at work at the tech company, and I'm like, \"Oh, I really don't wanna come to Vegas right now. \"I'm kind of like in the middle of something.\" And he's like, \"I'm telling you, you're gonna love it. \"It's not technical, \"it's just like whenever you call up the cable company \"and get them to lower the bill every month. \"It's the exact same skillset, you're gonna crush it.\" And I was like, all right. So I literally packed my bag and I flew out that night. I ended up catching a couple of those social engineering phishing attack calls, and I was like, yeah, you're right. This is definitely for me. I wanna try this. And then I went on to get second place three years in a row. - And that's how you started the business, and that's, you know, this new life, is that right? - That's right. After I started doing all of that, people would say, \"Hey, I saw you at DEFCON, \"can you talk to my company about what you did \"in the glass booth and show us how you hacked?\" And then they'd say, \"We want you to do a pen test of our company. \"Can you come and do a training based on that pen test?\" And that's how we just built out all of the offerings at our organization. - So let's say someone wants to become you. I could go to DEFCON, but perhaps I don't have that opportunity. Are there books or other resources, and then, you know, perhaps you can give some advice for new people, how do they walk the road to become you, or like start a business like yours? - I recommend going to a local hacker con If you can't get out to DEFCON. There's still a lot to be learned there. So a local BSides or a DEFCON group could be a good opportunity. Or you can watch a lot of that stuff virtually and participate online. But what I would recommend is if you really wanna get into social engineering and see how you feel about it, call up your service providers. You're you, you can consent to this because you're you, right? And you can call them up and be like, and be like, \"Hi, this is David, \"I need to change the email on my account.\" And they'd be like, \"Okay David, here are the pieces of information \"we need from you to get into your account.\" And don't verify the right way. Be like, \"Oh, sorry, I don't know what that is.\" Or, \"Oh, I'm not sure about that information.\" And they're gonna be like, \"Okay, well can you give us this? \"Can you give us that?\" And notice how do you feel when you're doing those types of calls? What information did they ask you? What information did you give them? And you can start to understand how social engineering is possible at the service provider level without doing any harm to anyone, not even the person who's answering the phone or your own account. So call up your accounts, don't verify yourself properly and see how the call goes. And then from there, if you're interested and you still liked what you did, start going to a local DEFCON group. I recommend reading the pretexting book by Jeremiah Talamantes, positive pretexting, it's essential. It really teaches you how to come up with who you're gonna pretend to be. Get involved in Infosec Twitter and Mastodon. There's so many resources online, and there's a lot of different YouTube channels like such as yours where people can learn about these tools. And if you're a woman in security and privacy, you can join WISP, which is, I'm the Chair of the Board for that nonprofit. And we give scholarships to help people go to things like DEFCON or local hacker conferences. So you can actually get out there and try that stuff and get some mentors and friends in the group. - Rachel, I really want to, you know, thank you for sharing, and you know, also giving people a way to get into this. I love that suggestion, you know, phoning your own companies and seeing what you can get away with. Do you have any advice or anything before we wrap up? And I just wanna give you the floor. So say what you like to the audience, or you know, new people, women in tech, whatever you feel is important. - The hacking and info sec community is very hands on. I recommend that you jump in there and you try it. You don't need to worry about failure. All of us have tried things and it didn't work. It's just really an opportunity for you to try your skills, see what you're good at, see what you like, and hopefully make some friends along the way. I do recommend DEFCON. I think that's one of the best places you can go. And there's a lot of groups that offer scholarships in addition to women in security and privacy WISP. - Rachel, I really wanna thank you. Thanks so much for sharing. - Yeah, thanks for having me, David. (techno music)",

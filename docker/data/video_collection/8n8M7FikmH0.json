    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   Here's an unusual tech relic... A Nixie tube clock! This thing uses Soviet made tech from the 70s to create a very unique piece of art. Search up videos on this nixie tube tech for more info. These tubes were used in equipment and control boards for data readout. They are no longer manufactured and will likely be impossible to manufacture in the near future.  FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

    "transcript": "*angelic singing* *laughs* They call it a \"Nixie Clock\" But you probably don't know what that means - At least, I didn't really until this thing arrived I did a quick search and I was like \"woah that's cool!\" It's like some old school tech that people are really getting in to... RIGHT NOW! So I'm watching some old Russian videos about these things being The original displays for information in these vast machines. I was like I can get in to that 'cause I like tech, and I like the history of it. This is a vintage nixie tube clock from a company called \"Past Indicator\" and as far as I know they are one of the few companies that are manufacturing fully functioning versions of these. I was not expecting this, but I am pleasantly surprised. Greetings Lewis! We are a small company from Moscow, Russia. This clock is a combination of old soviet nixie tubes produced in the 70s and 80s and the tubes are highly reliable, they can function up to 30 years! I'm feeling special right now Ooh look at those They're like... packing... those packing... what are those called? There's a name for those things Jack Packing foam! Anyway whatever Woah Those are the nixie tubes, those are the things that are no longer in production If you look closely in there you can actually see the metal components that will illuminate to show you the time There's a couple of buttons on the back I assume that's for setting the time and then a power port This one is finished in such a way that it just looks a little more refined Sophisticated, if you will! I need an adaptor Oh there's an adaptor in the box. Thank you, Russia! Shall we dance? Power brick plugged in ARE YOU READY? Woooaaahhh are you seeing that Jack? And what you notice- It's hard for you to see, but if you look closely you can see the illumination as it moves across the available digits. It creeps forward all the way to 6 and comes back, 7.. 8.. 9.. 0 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6 as it creeps up You know what's crazy about this tech is that you know that it's a relic. You're looking at it right now, you're enjoying it right now but you know it's a relic you know its time is limited. The whole point of tech is to displace itself The next thing comes out, gets rid of the old one and we just completely stop making it appreciating it for what it was but this is, I mean, kinda like a piece of art! This is what people were creating at the time, the \"cutting edge\" of display advancements. This is like a reminder that you can put on your desk as an indicator a past indicator like the name! Do you see what I did there?! It's pretty cool! Woo look at those babies glow A little tech history lesson with Lew. So look 'em up, it's cool tech, and it's a cool thing to put on your desk. So you can rep the past.",

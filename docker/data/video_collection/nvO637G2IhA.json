    "transcript": "- Yo, guys, Jonathan here. This is the Razer Phone 2, and if I'm being honest, I think it made it me like the iPhone XS just a little less. So last year, Razer kinda shook up the smartphone world and debuted their Razer Phone, which kinda made a name for itself for that smooth, delicious, buttery, 120-hertz display, and speakers that would blow your jean jacket right off of your face. So the Razer Phone 2 kinda took everything that was awesome about the original and amplified it. To soon, for real though, the Razer Phone 2 is kinda like that no frills, no holds barred, no gimmicks. If you ever wonder what phone Tim Taylor, Mr. T, and Chuck Norris rock, this would probably it because it is that badass kind of a smartphone. For starters, that RGB logo. Are you kidding me? That is so cool. Nope, your eyes are not playing games with you, that logo lights up and it is glorious, plus, on top of that, the beautiful thing is because it's RGB, you can change that color to whatever you want. So whether it's TLD Blue, that you're UrAvgConsumer, or Dave2D Teal, maybe you want that Linus Tech Tips Orange, you can rock that on the Razer Phone 2. So maybe I'm a little too excited for that light up logo, maybe you are as well, let me know. But I just think it's a cool way to kinda separate itself against the sea of smartphone notchland. Next in there, something you really don't see on any smartphone out there period, is that 120-hertz display, which is silky, buttery smooth. And honestly, it's kinda one of those things that you don't really, truly appreciate it until you use it, but once you do, you're kinda like, oh my goodness. That display though on top of that silky, smooth 120-hertz refresh rate comes in at 5.7 inches. And you'll notice Razer's kinda throwing middle fingers to pretty much every single smartphone trend out this year. There's no notch, there's no weird 18.5:9 resolution, just straight up 16:9, 2560x1440, and again, no notch to be seen. Now I realize it might be a little hard to see through a video, but last year, one of the complaints with the original Razer Phone was that brightness just wasn't quite enough, so this year, Razer actually upped that by 50%, which is pretty huge. From there, yeah, the display is great, but the speakers, those things will change your life. Honestly, I've heard some good things about the Pixel 3, I haven't heard that yet, so until I hear that, this is hands down the absolute best sounding speakers on any smartphone I've heard to this day. They showcase it with this really awesome demo, that I'll admit, probably plays and skews with your mind a little bit with the sound jumping, and bouncing, and ping-pong, and everywhere, but no doubt this sounds fantastic. So if you're someone who likes to listen to music, or watch movies, or ideally play games, and aren't the biggest fans of headphones and likes to experience that music and sound out there in the open, this is going to be next level. Just don't be that guy at the gym, in the sauna, playing Drake at full volume while everyone's trying to sweat and stretch. Put some headphones on. Keeping that thicc boi, beefy train rolling, something really impressive with that Razer Phone 2 is that it's packing a 4000 milliamp hour battery. So if you wanna play games, and watch movies, and listen to music, and be that guy listening to Drake out loud, at least you can do that for extended periods of time. What's that, more beef? I'm not done. Inside the Razer Phone 2 is eight gigabytes of RAM. - Great Scott! - So for everyone who's flipping out at that Pixel 3 and its measly four gigs of RAM, buy a Razer Phone 2 so you can make fun of the Pixel users. Don't do that, I'm kidding. The Pixel 3 is a great phone, I'm excited. We're in this amazing period of tech, let's be happy. Eight gigabytes though is a lot of freaking RAM. Remember the days when computers were maxed out with four? We got eight gigabytes on a smartphone. So you got the display, you got that battery, you got them speakers, I'm not done there though. The Razer Phone 2 also has micro SD card expansion. The base storage, it's a little weak at 64 gigs, but if you're a micro SD card warrior, get excited. You're gonna store all of them lossless music files up to one terabyte on the Razer Phone 2. From there, one of the coolest features of the original Razer Phone that made its way over to the follow up is the location of the fingerprint reader, right smack on the side, perfectly placed where your thumb is. One thing that was a little strange for me though, is as much Razer didn't follow trends this year, the fact that there is no headphone jack is a little puzzling. I realize that the headphone jack wasn't there last year but for being this high-end, premium audio machine that is designed for gaming, you would think a headphone jack would be essential. There is a 24-bit DAC available through USB-C, but again, experiencing something like that with a headphone jack on the V40, that kinda changed my mind and if you're gonna have a headphone jack on a smartphone, make that headphone jack sound really good with a DAC. Now I don't think it's a deal breaker or a reason why you shouldn't buy the phone. It's still going to be super awesome, but it's just something that I would like to see Razer go the extra mile on. Next, one of the weakest points on Razer Phone last year was without a doubt, the cameras. This year though, I'm excited. It's supposed to be much improved. On the back, you have twin 12-megapixel shooters paired with eight-megapixel shooter on the front. And even though on paper it's supposed to be better, it looks better, I'm going to reserve true judgment until I get this phone in my hand and test it for myself because again specs on paper are one thing, but I really wanna see how good these cameras are when I get the phone. Lastly, the Razer Phone 2 ships with Android 8.1 Oreo, but talking to Razer, there should be updates very, very soon. So if that was one thing that was holding you back with other smartphones out there. If you're worried about being stuck on the last version of Android, that shouldn't be a thing with the Razer Phone 2. So overall, there is a ton to be excited about. It's honestly a super exciting smartphone era right now. We got tons of great things out, I am stoked. Hopefully you guys are too. If you are like me, smash that like button. Maybe subscribe if you're feeling like it, that would be awesome. This is Jonathan, and I will catch you guys later.",

    "transcript": "I'll tell ya a thing or two about the good old days. We used to have wires on our headphones. Yes we did. Fully wireless earbuds Yes, the promise, it's been out there. Apple, even Apple, they're making their own AirPods. A lot of people are curious about them getting involved in the fully wireless earbud business, because to this point, it's been a bit of a disaster. Right now, you're like what is this fully wireless thing? Like Bluetooth? I've heard about Bluetooth Lew. No. This means that each little earbud is independent. It's on its own. This company came along, they're called Sky Buds. This is their crack, at the fully wireless earbud. \"Truly wireless earbuds.\" Now what they've done, as you can see on the back, is that they have included this cool charging case. Which will provide 24 hours of total playtime. So the case itself, is also a battery. It's also got water resistance. You're lifting weights, you're sweating. Three sets of silicon fit tips. So far so good, I like the packaging. Ohhh, it solid First time setup, this is where things start to get a little sketchy sometimes \"We recommend wearing the largest fit-tips possible, for the best fit and highest audio quality\" Now here's a little tip for you guys... A TIP ABOUT TIPS!!! *cringy drum set imitation*(bba dum.....tssh) Whether it's these earbuds or other ones If they do have interchangeable tips, you always wanna have the tightest fit possible In fact, the characteristics of the sound will change based on that seal within your ear canal Also, both of your ear canals might not be the same size So every time you get yourself some interchangeable tipped earbuds Try out all the different ear tips, and if necessary, have a smaller one in ear Like for example, my left ear canal, that's a little tighter than the right one. I become comfortable with it over the years. Jack on the other hand... I mean, this man's gotta get a custom order or something for those guys over there. Press and hold the button on each SkyBud for three seconds and then there's gonna be audio instructions to get it set up. You can see that this become and play pause button so, first things first right in the middle here. This is the little charge case and that's a kind of cool implement....OOOHHHH! Check that out Jack. That's special. oh boom To charge up this case, there's a micro USB on the bottom. These are the different ear tips. We have large, we have small and I'm assuming that the medium is pre-installed. The actual SkyBuds themselves, now they are labelled, I like that you can see which one is right. There's the contact points for the charger. Squeak in there and clip, and then that's it. This case is not just extra battery life but it also acts as your charger so you've always got it with you and when you wanna use them lift that up, pull them out and get to work. Medium is pretty good for me. Press and hold the button on each SkyBud for 3 seconds. Okay, here we go ... ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! oh! It's like your at the movie theaters. If it was like voooooooooom. She's talking to me. Check it there and you know you got to put them in pairing mode, open your bluetooth settings, and so on. Rather than just strictly being uhhhhhhhhh. you know, text based audio, it works a little bit better. So I'm gonna try this 3 times okay? 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 3 oooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh online! Lets go ahead and give it a little test. I'll boot up my sound cloud here real quick. Okay so listen. I've been used to trying head phones everywhere from like five dollars up to like 500 maybe even more than that fifteen-hundred no matter what you do with blue tooth it's never really gonna be on the level of a wired conneciton but that's not really what these things are about huge component here is the convenience of being complete... like look at me, look at me I can, these are all I'm over here. I'm over there. You're on the bike, you got the dog, you're walking a dog you better scoop the poop. Who's gonna hate on you for that? Who's gonna b, who's gonna be bothered? You of course know there are phones out there that don't even have head phone jacks anymore so everybody is going wireless to some extent. This is as wireless as you can get. Even the ones with the little wire, you kinda still know they're there you're probably listening to a compressed audio file to begin with on a sub par amplifier for those headphones. Convenience, that's the play here could be a podcast, maybe you travel maybe you're on an airplane like me. What I will say, compared to completely wireless earbuds... the voice guiding you through the setup \"okay, tap it three times, okay\" \"paired up\" and so on that's nice. That actually worked quite well it makes sense, it's an ear bud it should be audio, for the manual *smacking lips* Britle lear, dear, dear , dear , dear , dear , dear ho ho ho ho! These things are tiny. Look at those little guys. If you've been looking at the ear pods, the Apple Earpods, and those things got you motivated and you're like that's the future I'm looking for. Well this is probably just a step in that direction, with a slightly more substantial sound because of the in ear design. The airpod is not gonna do that, right? It fits just like a regular ear pod. It's kinda ... You can't get a lot of... low end frequency unless you get deep in that canal. C'mon kids, get deep in that canal!",

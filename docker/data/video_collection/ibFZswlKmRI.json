    "transcript": "- [Ken] And now for something completely different. That was Tumblr's original beta name, by the way. Adaadobby. Mojave indications? What? What? Just like Windows XP. - [Instructor] Thumbnails along the bottom. And you'll notice that the quick actions area is contextual. - [Ken] Mojave, my money's on Mojave. I love it how I have some fans saying that Ken is probably freaking out about Mojave. Craig. - Our next release of macOS-- (beeping) (upbeat music) It's WWDC 2018 keynote time, so make sure to have the essentials like your MacBook Pro, your cellular mobile with Twitter on it so you can complain about things, maybe some booze. You're gonna need 'em. A floppy disc drive coaster to put said booze on. And, of course, some corn chips, brandless corn chips, maybe some film set worthy Boritos. Good. You're ready to go. Good morning, developers. WWDC 2018 is here, and we can't wait to show you what we've been working on. Yeah, how about some damn quality assurance, huh? In all seriousness, I have heard that is going to be one of the big focuses for this year. We'll find out. All right. It's going with some copyrighted music, so we're just gonna mute that for now. Yes, we got some apps scrolling by here. They're actually playing some pretty good music. Man, I wish you could hear it. But yeah, as you also have noticed, I have infiltrated Jony Ive's secret white room again just to kind of change up the scenery for the special occasion today. It is kind of a bit of a change compared to the lair 10 stories underground I'm usually in. There's a lot more air in here. All right. So hopefully we're going here soon. Hey, Trello. I know those guys. Actually, now would be a good time to place some bets. So I really don't know much. I haven't been following rumors as closely as I usually would. I know, that's kind of shocking, right? But I do think QA is going to be a big focus on software for this year. In terms of specific things, I made a tweet a while ago saying my money is still on Mojave for the macOS 10.14 name, which would be funny because Windows Mojave was a test experiment back in the Vista days at Microsoft. - Today, I'm gonna show you a little bit about Windows Mojave, which is actually the newest version of Windows. - I wanna see it. - [Ken] So I'm still placing my money on Mojave for the macOS name, and I'm thinking feature-wise on macOS, we're gonna see Apple News finally be integrated. I would really like a dark mode. I know brainiac branch won't like that. He's not a dark mode guy, hope he doesn't see this. I just want some surprises. I'm cool with surprises, but, you know only the ones I expect. This is a really wide screen format. I just want Steve Irwin to pop out, right, so we're looking at a wild developer. I do love the graphics they're doing with the steam this time, really good. - The money that developers have earned through the app store-- - [Ken] Dr. Evil moment coming up. - $100 billion. - [Ken] $100 billion. - To tell you all about what we have planned for-- - [Ken] Craig. Craig. - I'd like to introduce Craig Federighi. - [Ken] Yeah! - Craig. - [Ken] Air Force One, bitch! This guy is the best. He is, like, the best presenter next to Steve Jobs. - All right. The iOS is, you guessed it-- - [Ken] 13th. Ugh, I thought they'd jump. - As a free software update. Now it's easy to forget-- - [Ken] Remember when they used to charge for those? On the iPod? - Slide over, split view, and drag and drop. - [Ken] Which was on the surface for a couple of years, but I'm not getting nitpicky. - World around me changes, thank you very much. - [Ken] Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much. - Many, many places. This is all we've done in iOS 12. I think it would be a great release. - [Ken] No. Getting a vapor wave aesthetic right there. - Abhay Parasnis. Their CTO to the stage. - [Ken] Abhay Parasnis. That's a fun name. Yeah, I'm cool with you, Adobe, but you killed Muse, and I'm not happy. I'm salty. - It's great to be here this morning. By far, the most-- - [Ken] Adaadobby. I'll buy stock. - Well, there it is. - [Ken] Oh, shit, that... - Check that out. - [Ken] That's pretty freaking awesome. I need to change my pants. - Yes. - [Ken] The sequel. The ARKit 2, Electric Boogaloo. I don't know, I'm not huge into AR, are you? I mean, I just don't like staring at a screen as I'm moving it around in space. It might be better with a headset? - With physical LEGO sets, brings great joy to millions of children and LEGO fans all over the world. - [Ken] But virtual ones will bring more joy. It seems just a little bit tedious. That just looks uncomfortable and tedious. I'm sorry. I do not see the point of AR being super useful in the long run in this case. Like, would you wanna play like this for hours on end? It just doesn't seem comfortable. I thought I was allowed to have opinions. - [Instructor] Let's take you over to the bakery. - [Ken] How about he walks himself to the bakery, the lazy pile of yellow plastic? - It's called For You. - [Ken] It wouldn't be an Apple app without a For You tab. - Sharing great photos with the people you care about most. - [Ken] Screw it. Just use a Polaroid. - Now, Siri is by far the world's most used digital assistant. - [Ken] But is it the most intelligent? Probably not. In fact, I've turned it off. - You can assign your own phrase, such as I lost my keys would be a good choice. And when you then say it, Siri will automatically activate-- - [Ken] Seems cool, but man, I just am losing a lot of faith in our intelligence as a species right now. The machines are doing everything, man. Terminator, like, we're gonna die. And I'm gonna be the first to go 'cause I'm white and pudgy. - ETA to the beach. - [Ken] That might be useful. I do stuff like that with the Automator in the macOS, so that might be cool. Yep, it's an editor. That looks just like Automator. - And I see all the details I need to confirm my perfect mint mojito, and it looks like I am running a little late for a rather important meeting. - [Ken] Good going. You were too busy drinking a mojito. - Travel plans. - [Ken] I'm sorry. I didn't understand that. - Travel plans. - [Ken] Downloading latest episode of where are my pants. - [Siri] You can check in after three p.m. - Isn't that cool? - [Ken] That is cool. I doubt it'll work, but that is really cool, actually. 'Cause I look that stuff up all the time manually. But I don't trust Siri with my child that I probably don't have. - [Siri] Heading home. - [Ken] Searching for Albanian restaurants. Siri is dumb as a brick though, and I'm not the only one that says so, so I'm scared. - I'm gonna hand it off to Susan. Susan! - [Ken] Susan. Who is Susan? - But without its spark line, those little charts-- - [Ken] Those are called spark lines? God, I love learning terms like that. Like, I think everything should have a name. I love nomenclature. - With iOS 12, we're bringing stocks to iPad. - [Ken] It only took them a couple years to do that. - So you can keep your eye on-- We're calling it Apple Books, a new name. - [Ken] I mean, they are killing the 'i' moniker quicker than George R. R. Martin kills characters, but that's okay. I mean, we're getting the Apple prefix now, which I'm cool with. They're probably battling that smartphone addiction issue that was talked about. - In the morning when you wake up, you're gently eased into your day, you can tap when you wanna start confronting those notifications. - [Ken] Nice. Now you guys won't get my YouTube upload notifications as quickly now. I am full of rage! - Grouped notifications. - [Ken] I think people have been, judging by the amount of applause, people have been wanting this for a long ass time. - Also by topic and thread. - [Ken] Mojave indications? What? What? - You can tap in and look-- - [Ken] Mojave indications? That was a typo, right? Is that hinting at the name of macOS that I bet my money on? Hmm? Illuminati. - You get a weekly activity summary. - [Ken] Ooh, our phones are turning into our parents now. I love it. - You tap in and-- - [Ken] Gonna need this. I don't know why I haven't cracked this open yet. That's actually legitimately cool, I think. That is actually really cool. - How often per hour you're picking up your phone and what's drawing you in. - [Ken] Okay, that's (beep) amazing. My iPhone E app usage would be, like, way out here. - When you're using the app, you receive a helpful notification letting you know time is almost up. - [Ken] It's like self-parental controls, honestly, I think that's okay. - Of course it starts with providing your kids with great information, so they get an activity report of their own. But as a parent, you get one as well on your device. - [Ken] So you can spy on them. - You have the option of creating allowances and-- - [Ken] Ooh! We are putting a little bit of Big Brother inside of everybody. I love it. George Orwell, mmm mmm mmm. I love you, man. - And you can also limit your kids' time in apps by categories-- - [Ken] That bible app didn't have enough time in it. That better be on top. - Tongue detection. - [Ken] What? I have great faith in this. - Memoji. - [Ken] What? Oh well. - Create your very own-- - [Ken] Craig! Your hair is amazing! How do you do it? It's like a thing of toothpaste, like, on the packaging, just dabbled on top. There's me right there. White. Totally white. I'm sure the me tonal people won't be upset. - He's so cute. - [Ken] It's a she. - And now my personal favorite, the koala. - [Ken] That's actually pretty cool how responsive that is. Even with the follow through animation there and everything? That's impressive. - [Woman] All right. Nope. This is the one. - [Ken] I feel like Jimmy Neutron. You know, in the intro sequence where the robot is, like, adjusting his hair? Yeah, this, getting some major flashbacks. - [Woman] I'm gonna come over to iWear and pick out some frames. - [Ken] Is there a contacts option? - [Woman] I think I need two lenses. - [Ken] Oh, yes, quite. You need two lenses. I feel like communication is gonna slow down massively now. - [Woman] That's how simple it is to create your very own Memoji. - [Ken] Wait, they're just waiting for a reply. Yes, I like croissants. But I just spent 10 minutes making a new head, so. That croissant is cold now. Your fault. Croissant. - This wasn't even in Craig's lives. - [Ken] Oh. - We're bringing fun effects into the messages camera. - [Ken] You weren't supposed to show those! - Right here live. - [Ken] Whoa. Okay, that, I wasn't expecting. That's kinda cool. - Now this year, FaceTime is gonna take a big leap forward. - [Ken] Group FaceTime, group FaceTime. Please. You had it in iChat. - Group FaceTime. - [Ken] Yes! Years later. You had it in iChat, you got rid of it, now you're bringing it to mobile and FaceTime. Thank you. That should be cool. I have no friends to do it with, but it'll still be cool. - Up to 32 simultaneous participants. - [Ken] Holy shit! Are you kidding me? That would be hell! - Of group FaceTime-- - [Ken] Who's he gonna call? Phil Schiller? - I can just dive in-- - [Ken] If he can get Steve Jobs on here, I would be very (beep) impressed. - Actually, they're going right in. - [Ken] Oh no, it's that Craig guy. He's joining us. Gosh, his hair is awesome. I just wanna see Phil Schiller drink some tea upside down again. Those were the days, man. - [Craig] Now this is the future. - [Ken] Remember when Photo Booth was, like... Sorry. Oh my gosh. But remember when Photo Booth was, like, new and growing, and Steve Jobs was messing with it? - Yeah, it's me! I signed up to-- - [Ken] Oh, his complexion is amazing. But no, this is kinda like the new version of that. The new version of the Photo Booth stuff. - Next up-- - [Ken] MacOS, come on. - Apple Watch. - [Ken] I knew it. They're saving macOS for last. They're gonna milk it. I still got my first gen, like, before series one even existed. - Which brings even more ways for you to stay active and connected. - [Ken] I care about zero percent of those things. - Or you can add an air quality complication to your watch face. - [Ken] I wonder how well that works in China. Air quality, it's black. - To tell you all about it. Jen! - [Ken] I just want an operating system that isn't so touchy with a touchpad, and something that actually loads content when I click on it. That's all I want. Oh, and Piction picture. And a clock. Please! - Dolby Atmos! - [Ken] Yeah! What does that mean? - That flows all around you. Puts you right in the center-- - [Ken] Without special hardware? You gotta need some kind of hardware to do that, right? Or am I just dumb? I mean, I know I am. - In France, we're working with Canal Plus. - [Ken] Canal what? - Canal services. - [Ken] Canal Plus? That's French, right? I would've said Canal Plus. - In Switzerland, we partnered with Salt. - [Ken] Salt Plus. That was Tumblr's original beta name, by the way. - And I'm really excited-- - [Ken] Oh! - Here in the US, Charter Spectrum will be coming to Apple TV-- - [Ken] Finally! Like no service I use works with Charter Spectrum. Like, I've tried. Like, it's, like, here's a list of supported cable providers. Spectrum is, like, never on any of those lists. I'm on Cartoon Network and the game show network. That's, like, all I care about. I see 50% of those on here. - All of you have seen that six-digit code. You have to go online-- - [Ken] Oh yeah. That's annoying as (beep). - Well, last year, we introduced-- - [Ken] Single Sig. Oh, Single Sign-on. - With Zero Sign-on. - [Ken] Yeah! Zero is better than one, bitch. - It just works. - [Ken] Hey, that's a Steve Jobs line. Careful. He'll come back from the grave and sue your a-, oh wait, you still work with Apple, sorry. You're good. - And Charter Spectrum will be the first to support Zero Sign-on-- - [Ken] What? - Adding more providers over time. - [Ken] That is bizarre. Charter normally doesn't support anybody or the other way around, but. Crestron Plus, Savant Plus, Control 4 Plus. - And today, I have an incredible, new location to share with you. - [Ken] Detroit. - Earth. - [Ken] Where is this? This thing is kicking that thing. Wow! - This is the Northern California Coast heading South-- - [Ken] Oh, there's a jib going in for the attack. No clock or Piction picture? Just that? Okay. It's okay. I'm okay. I'm fine. I'll be fine. All right, let's get to some Mac stuff now. You know, like what I'm using right here? The Mac is my baby. Let's do this. Mac. What do we got for Mac? Oh, it's 10.14, Tim. Mojave. My money's on Mojave. I said that earlier. - New features inspired by pro users. - [Ken] Really? - But designed for everyone. I'd like to bring Craig-- - [Ken] I was not expecting such a pro focus. Like, I knew lots of cheers, I am ready. I am excited. I mean, I knew they were gonna focus on QA but not really a lot of new features. - We began offering our macOS updates free for Mac users. - [Ken] And now we're charging again. Go to the desert! Go to the desert! Mojave! Come on, man! - Is macOS Mojave. - [Ken] Yeah! All you Twitter peeps owe me shit tons of money! I called it. But it was kind of easy. - But what really captured our imagination-- - [Ken] We actually have viewers that live near Mojave, which is pretty cool. - At night. - [Ken] Dark mode. - And this inspired one of our most-- - [Ken] Dark mode. - Distinctive new features. - [Ken] Dark mode. - And I'd like to show it to you now. - [Ken] Dark mode! God bless America! It's dark mode! - So here we are, live, in macOS-- - [Ken] I'm gonna faint. I'm gonna pass out. - I'd like to show you a new side of Mojave. - [Ken] Craig. - We call it dark mode. - [Ken] Yes! (beep) yes! I've been wanting this for years! Oh, I don't know what's so good about it all the time, but I, I don't know what the big deal is, but I want it! - Dark mode is not just-- - [Ken] I'm crying! Oh my gosh. That's hot. Oh gosh, oh. - That's a quick look at dark mode. - [Ken] That's honestly the only feature you need to add. I will be happy, Craig. - But now we've added an all-new view called gallery view. - [Ken] Just like Windows XP. - [Craig] Thumbnails along the bottom. It makes it easy to preview images. And you'll notice that the quick actions area is contextual, so it shows me create pdf as an option. I'm gonna click pdf-- - [Ken] Oh, that's-- - [Craig] And it's gonna assemble all-- - [Ken] Dude, that's hot! It's hot! I like it! I love quick look. Red eye. You need some clear eyes. Clear eyes is awesome. - [Craig] I can just drag out my signature like this-- - [Ken] 14 documents is now easier than ever. - [Craig] Added screen capture for video right-- - [Ken] Ooh. Nice. You don't have to do it through QuickTime, I guess. - [Craig] Now you notice I have this thumbnail in the lower right. Well, I can actually pick this up and drag it into a new space and incorporate it right into a document. - [Ken] Oh, hell, naw. Oh! That is cool. - Continuity camera. - Say what now? - Show you how it works. - [Ken] What? Oh my gosh. - Ready to take a photo. - [Ken] I mean, there's a beautiful FaceTime cam built into your Mac if you want. - [Craig] And when I do-- - [Ken] You can hopefully use that. - [Craig] Photo and it appears directly in my document. - [Ken] That is cool. There's a camera built into your computer too. It's maybe not as good, but you paid thousands of dollars so. - [Craig] Again, my camera lights up. This time, right in my document scanner. - [Ken] Okay, that's sexy. That's sexy. That's freaking awesome. Gotta push save. There you go. I love it how I have some fans saying that Ken is probably freaking out about Mojave. Yes, I am, and you're gonna see in this type video log that I am! You are correct, sir. Oh, Voice Memos is back. I always use QuickTime to record audio, but having a dedicated app for it, would be super handy. Oh, I can't afford any of the crazy gadgets that work with Home, but that's still very convenient. Safari is 20% snappier. I just hope it's a little more compatible. There's a lot of websites I've been going to lately that are like, sorry, we don't work on Safari even though Safari pushed a lot of standards. It's just like, it doesn't work with anything anymore. Facebook will just go into your dreams and serve you up ads. It's freaky shit. - Well, it turns out these can be used to track you whether you click on them or not. - [Ken] Those bastards. I'm gonna write a letter to the president! I'm sure a lot of landing page people are gonna be super happy about more of these features. A lot of squeeze page people, advertising people. - Data companies are clever and relentless. And in addition-- - [Ken] Would Apple know anything about that? - We're presenting webpages with only a simplified system configuration. We show them only built-in fonts. - [Ken] (beep) you, bitches. Bob is here to kick your ass. - It will be dramatically more difficult for data companies to uniquely identify your device. - [Ken] Ooh. BI people and analysts, I bet they're so happy about this. I bet they're just, like, thank-, yeah, no, they're gonna be shitting their pants. They're gonna work around it, I bet somehow. - Let's talk about the Mac app store. - [Ken] Yes, let's. - I'd like to invite to the stage-- - [Ken] Redesign. With a For You section. Okay, next. - We're turning our attention to the Mac app store. - [Ken] Good. Whoa, that guy. Give that guy some, like, Robitussin. - Developers can distribute their apps to 155 countries and get worldwide payment processing. - [Ken] That's, like, 105 more countries than we have, right? I'm starting to notice Apple is doing a lot of sidebar stuff now. They used to do a lot of, like, horizontal, upper toolbar stuff. They're doing a lot of sidebar stuff now. On the Mac. But on iOS, I think it's still, like, positioned horizontally at the bottom. - Who will bring Office 365-- - [Ken] Whoa! Shit! What? (beep) yeah, that's awesome. - Now Metal is the technology to get the highest performance graphics and-- - [Ken] Yes, and that was very evident with the high C era upgrades, especially with the window manager. Isn't it nice how that notch just covers up the hud? Isn't that just beautiful? Ooh, volume metric light ray is hot. And that's the end of the game. - Are you merging iOS and macOS? So I'd like to take a moment to briefly address-- - [Ken] Say no. - No. - Yeah. - Of course not. - [Ken] I was just talking with someone about it. It's not in their best interest for the strategy to do that. These are not three separate devices. - [Narrator] He stayed in his bedroom making games while the other kids were outside playing. - [Ken] Yeah, and they used to make fun of us for that, but look at us now. - When I watch him code, his eyes move in a weird way, and he's, like, totally focused. - [Ken] And then he starts coding. - Let's have an incredible week together. - [Ken] Yes. Let's do that. You are welcome, Tim. Well, that was amazing. Lots of good stuff. And goodbye, sir. So if you wanna see more, feel free to check out the recording of the CCL episode where I kinda like an after-action report about this thing in a little more of a serious tone. And I'm sure I'll have some other content about this coming out later, but I appreciate you guys sticking with me. And you guys on Twitter owe me money for calling Mojave! Yeah, that was me. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat music)",

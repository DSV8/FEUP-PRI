    "transcript": "I am an enormous virtual reality enthusiast and have made several videos about VR spanning YEARS that nobody has watched because nobody else seems to care about VR. Prophesied for decades as a market disruptor, head-mounted displays were supposed to change the world. But 8-years have passed since the first modern VR headsetthe Oculus Riftand it seems VR is headed in the way of the 3D TV rather than the iPhone. Even as a VR evangelist, I have trouble recommending headsets to anyone other than niche gamers with deep pockets that dont mind spending money on pricey hardware and a shallow software catalog that starts and ends with mostly short game demos. Try as they might, nobody has been able to target general consumers beyond that limited gaming segmentand even then, the venture is seldom profitable. So, the idea that Applea famously cautious companyone that hasnt announced a new product segment in nearly a decadeplans to enter the HMD space in 2023 with a headset many times more expensive than the industrys priciest headset, seemsin a wordbananas. Despite that, rumors suggest its certain to happen this yearso lets talk about what we know concerning Apples Reality Pro headset, what we dont yet understand, and if itll be a black swan or a black eye in the companys legacy. We know the headset will resemble modern VR goggles like the Meta Quest Pro; not a pair of thin, Google Glass-eque AR glasses. From the outside, its expected to look similar to AirPods Max with an aluminum, glass, and mesh cushion constructionthe headband is alleged to house speakers. Much of the internal workings are rumored to be constructed of carbon fiber and lightweight polypropylene; important to curb weight where possible in order to maximize comfort. Last thing regarding the exterior: reliable leaker Mark Gurman also believes there will be a curved display on the outside of the headset that can outwardly show a wearers eyes to those *not* using the headset. That seems bizarre to mebut so has Animoji for the last 5 yearsso maybe there will be emotive Animoji visible when the wearer is using passthrough modemore on that feature in a minute. The headset would be able to outwardly show a wearers eye positioning thanks to built-in eye trackingsimilar to that found in PS VR2 which uses the feature for foveated rendering. And foveated renderingthat is, rendering in higher detail where your eyes are actually lookingmay be necessary for Apples headset because rumors agree that there will be two Sony OLED MicroDisplaysone per eyeat 4K each. If you havent heard of MicroDisplays, youre not alone. Sony is the only producer of OLED MicroDisplays which areliterally, tiny screens. Theyre used in camera electronic viewfinders, AR, and other niche applicationsbut not only are they small in size, theyre uniquely using a technology that allows them to put CMOS circuits right on silicon substrates giving them the ability to drive smaller, brighter pixels. How small? Reality Pros displays are projected to use a pixel size as tiny as 4 microns10 times teensier than a high-density smartphone display. The technology Sony is using, OLED on Silicon, is often branded by LG and Samsung as microOLED which is expected to come to larger displayslike smartphones and TVs in the next few years. So these Sony OLED MicroDisplays are also microOLED screens. Super simple, right? The 4K-per-eye resolution Apple is targeting is very high, but not unprecedentedly sothe (surprise) Sony PS VR2 also offers 4K per eye. Now, its often said that refresh rate matters more than resolution in VR and thats somewhat true, but also not. As weve explained previously on this channel, you need a sufficiently high pixels-per-degree value to get rid of the screen door effectthe visible black gaps in between individual pixels. Older headsets like the Valve Index and Quest 2 did this by ditching OLED which was used in the very first VR headsets in favor of fast-switching, higher-density LCD panels which solved the screen door and latency issues, but ruined things like dynamic range and true black levels. PS VR2 is the first headset to return to OLED with a high enough pixel density and response time to best out any LCD-based headset, but retains the fresnel lens technology used in VR headsets before itsomething Apple is boldly moving away from. Fresnel lenses used in VR headsets are just scaled down versions of the ones found in lighthousesusing terraced, concentric, beehive-like circles to maintain a high-aperture, letting lots of light in with a short focusing distance, but without the weight and thickness of a traditional convex lens. They work well, but theyre not perfect. In high-contrast scenes youll experience glares called god-rays, theres chromatic color aberration once you move your eyes away from the center of the display, and the sweet spot is typically very narrow and any movement of the headset on your noggin will throw off focus entirely. Apple is expected to use expensive pancake optics which use many folding lenses on top of each other in a curve. The end result is a much shallower z-depth making Apples headset much lighter and much thinner than conventional VR headsets. Pancakes also benefit from a wider sweet spot, no chromatic aberration, and no lens distortion correction processing for your GPU to deal with. They also have their own flaws though: they dont offer as wide a field-of-view. Apples expected to have a 120 deg FOV which is better than the PS VR2 and Meta Quest 2, but not nearly as good as something like the Valve Index and a huge, monumental far cry from something like my old Pimax 5K which pushed 200 degrees FOValmost as wide as my eyes can handle. The Reality Pro will likely feel very dive-maskybut thats par the course for VRthe much bigger issue with pancake lenses is light transmission efficiencyrather, inefficiency. You need a significantly brighter display to get the same perceived brightness value vs fresnels. Metas Quest Pro is the only headset on the market to use pancake lenses, but it retains a conventional, lower-resolution LCD in order to output sufficient luminance. Itll be interesting to see if Apple can pull off pancakes with microOLED which are known for their brightness, but also their high costsame with pancake lenses themselves. Apples expected unit cost on these pancake lenses is $40 USDabout 30 times more expensive than comparable fresnels. As for the displays? Oh, boy the largest microOLED screen Sony currently offers is 1/3 the size that Apple would need, its only 1080pnot 4K, not sufficiently luminous to run pancakes and it costs $240. For one eye. Its very possible the displays in this thing would be pushing $1,000wholesale. And thats not where the expensive components would stop either Bloombergs Mark Gurman has stated that the first model will ship with an M2 chip and a secondary ISP to combine camera and sensor data for tracking and also to handle mixed-reality camera distortion. Gurman also states that the original plan was for the first headset to be even more powerful featuring a separate hub that would do external processing and then beam data to the headset wirelessly but former design chief Jony Ive vetoed the idea. Still, an M2 is quite powerful. Perhaps too powerful. If youve ever used a Quest 2, you may have noticed how uncomfortably warm the headset gets after just a few minutes of playand thats a headset with a lower TDP SoC, significantly more thermal mass, and a processor much further away from your face thanks to fresnel lenses, so what is Apple to do? I cant believe Im saying this because it sounds so un-Apple, but apparently theyve moved on from the idea of a self-contained headset to the idea that at least the battery packbut perhaps even the SoCwill be external to the device with a cable running from your pocket or belt up to the headset itself. The battery pack itself is said to be largeabout the size of two iPhone 14 Pro Maxes stacked one on top of the otherand that even a battery as large as that is only expected to power the headset for about two hours. Holy smokesthere much be some serious sensor magic involved sucking a lot of juice. So lets talk about that sensor suite Its expected that 8 camera modules will be used for see-through mixed reality and six of those modules would be used for innovative biometrics. What could such a thing be? Well, all rumors seem to be in agreement that (a) no iPhone will be required to use the headset, and, (b) the headset will not support any physical controllersrather, everything will be done with hand tracking. The Information goes so far as to say that all body movement will be at least somewhat trackedlegs, arms, and even facial expressions. Two LIDAR modeulesone short and one long-range will help with movement tracking and also room mapping. There were allegedly sensors to track eyebrow and jaw movement but those have been replaced with machine learning. In addition to eye position tracking it has been said that there will also be an iris scanner for biometricsFace ID. So thats the hardware but what on earth is Apple going to do with this frickin thingbecause you may have noticed that not once have I said Augmented Realitybecause this headset will do no such thing. There will be a dedicated VR mode and using a knob in the shape of a digital crown, the user will be able to transition to a mixed reality mode wherein they can see their surrounding environment but using passthrough camerasnot transparent lensesa feature found on basically every VR headset since forever. Now, theres no doubt Apples passthrough cameras will be best-in-class, but they cant beat actually seeing your physical surroundings so the software library better make up for it. Yeah, this is where the rumors get spotty because supply chain leaks are much easier to identify than leaks inside of Apple but this is whats rumored to be coming: the internal name for the operating system, xrOS, is a fork of iOS and is said to look nearly identical to that of an iPhone with a grid of app icons on a springboard. Some rumors even suggest youll be able to run existing iOS apps in 2D in VR. That sounds like a really awful experience to me and I cant imagine that becomes realityespecially considering a very different navigation method. To operate the device, you will simply direct your gaze towards an item displayed on the screen, such as a button, app icon, or list entry. Then, with the pinch in of the thumb and index finger, said item will trigger in the user interface. What will you be able to actually navigate to? Eh thats a great question. Its said that one of the big revel demos will be FaceTime. The M2 will apparently realistically render a users face and full body in VR which would allow you to videoconference with another Reality Pro user in a virtual roomnot dissimilar in concept from Metas Horizon Worldsbut Apples is alleged to create a photorealistic version of the individual rather than the cartoonish avatars found on Facebooks platform. But, its also stated that due to the immense processing power of this feature, itll only work initially for one-on-one FaceTime calls. Group calls will display users as Memoji. Um okay. I mean, thats cool, but thats hardly what Id call a platform sellerespecially given that essentially zero companies are using FaceTime for work where this could actually be useful. But of course thats not all it will do! Apple is reportedly focused on video consumption for the device at launch having worked with Disney, Dolby, and others to develop VR-specific content for the headset in addition to, in Gurmans words, update its own Apple TV+ material to work with the headset. But I dont know what that means I have to expect its more than throwing a 2D video player on an artificial projection surface in a virtual movie theater. I mean that concept was done by BigScreen VR back in 2016 and copied time and time again by others since then. So, perhaps theyre talking about 3D? But weve seen behind-the-scenes content for multiple Apple TV shows and no such cameras have been on set. Are we to believe people at Apple in addition to thousands of crew members, suppliers, producers, and actors contracted by Apple have kept it a secret for several years? Thats also unlikely. Maybe theres a special episode of Ted Lasso in VR where you can walk around the locker roombut is that going to sell people on a platform when Steam is filled with dozens of really good interactive storytelling games for VR? Perhaps not, so lets talk about games Its widely been suspected that gaming would be a big part of this headsets value proposition and that seems pretty logical given gaming is the only niche thats really embraced VR to date. Apples ARKit has been available to devs since 2017, but Cupertino has allegedly created an underlying engine to power VR-specific titles. Presumably this will be launched at WWDC this year when the headset is expected to be unveiled, but its not like games are going to pop up within weeks or months of announcementeven if the headset doesnt ship until end-of-year, thats a really tight deadline to make a game thats any better than the shovelware for VR in Steam already. Its not a game-changing (heh) selling point. So what would be? Perhaps the rumored ability to use the headset as an external monitor for a Mac. Being able to see one huge virtual display or a triple monitor setup from your airline seat could be a potential game changer for several fieldsespecially if Apple does passthrough really well to put your real-world keyboard and mouse into virtual realitylike the Immersed app for Oculus. It does seem youll need the keyboard from your Mac because the mid-air virtual keyboard Apple was hoping would be ready at launch is said to be still rather buggy and text input will be done primarily using Handoff on an iPhone thats passed-through the MR cameras. Getting down to brass tacks, this is a project that has been underway for many yearsheck there have been leaks and rumors of its existence dating back to 2017. Apple has been consistently mocked for failing to innovatefor coming to the market years behind everyone else with mere refinements on existing technology. Now I dont really believe thatI mean look at what AirPods did to the true-wireless buds industrybut this is a fascinating product to me because it seems very un-Apple. To not only venture into a market that hasnt really been fully developed, but one that consistently FAILED to capture a wide market. At 62, Tim Cook is getting older, and in an interview two years ago he stated he wouldnt be CEO of Apple ten-years from thenbut that he still had a few things to do at Apple before it was time for him to leave. And if you put yourself in his shoes, hes viewed by Wall Street (and quite fairly, I think) as one of the most successful CEOs in history. His influence on Apple has been inarguable, but influence doesnt equate to legacy. The Apple Watch released under Cooks purview (though its development was already well underway when Jobs died), weve gotten AirPods, Apple Silicon, and a few other cool services and knick-knacks, but nothing like the iPhone. Nothing you can point to and say that changed the world. And Cook is certainly not Jobs so maybe he doesnt care about that, but a recent report released suggests he and Jeff Williams (chief of operations and Tims likely successor) are pushing hard for Reality Pro to release this year despite the behest of the design team that Williams oversees claiming more time was neededthat technology needed to progress further so a true AR product could be releasedsomething that wasnt a pair of ski-goggles. Maybe the sudden departure of Evans Hankey, Apples former VP of industrial design was the result of a rift between design and engineeringor product development and management. We wont know, but what we have been led to believe is that this product is going to be a huge departure from Apples Pro Forma. Gurman suggests an eye-wateringly expensive $3,000 retail price for the Reality Pro headset but even at that price, will not only fail to meet Apples typical gross margin expectations, but that the unit cost will exceed the sales price. That Apple will actively and willingly lose money for every unit sold. Why do this? Well, at $3,000 its not going to be a mass-market product. Apples exclusive manufacturing partner, Pegatron, is expecting to sell fewer than 1 million total units in the first year. Compared to the iPhones 200 million annual production run, its peanuts. Even compared to the Meta Quest 2s 20 million units shipped, its nothing. Shipping units now allows programmers, enthusiasts, and others to start developing, creating, and doing things with this headset thatll instill desire in regular consumers once Apple can finally produce a lower-end, more cost-effective headset in the future. Itll be feature limited and content starved, people will laugh about it being overpriced, the hardware will seem archaic just a few years from now, and Apples predictions about what itll be into the future might be wrong, but another product was just like that and it changed the world. It was the iPhone. Legacy cant be built without risk, and Apple has been mighty cautious for a long time. This is the first time weve seen Tim Cook acting like Steve Jobs and I hope itll pay off.",

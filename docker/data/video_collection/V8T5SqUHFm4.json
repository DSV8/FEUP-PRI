    "transcript": "It's been a while since we've touched on my personal rig the one that i use for all of my video editing these videos here that you're watching are all edited on this machine i also game with this machine i do tons of stuff with it and without it i'd be pretty lost specifications are pretty straightforward i've been using a RYZEN 9 5950x for several months now and i've got to tell you folks it is a freaking beast not only is it excellent for content creation video editing more specifically in my case but also gaming intel's always kind of had an edge just because they've had stronger individual cores the ring bus latency was always super low but with zen 3 unifying eight cores to a single ccx it is just so snappy it is past intel in a lot of gaming situations nowadays and i really see no need in converting back to team blue for what i do that may change at some point here soon but for now i've been sticking with this and i have no regrets i have paired the cpu in this case with an x570 board from Asrock i've got an RTX3070 in here i believe it's a 3070. is that there yep 30 70 from gigabyte i've just got 16 gigs of course they're don platz i i should really be using at least 32 given what i do but i really like the way that these dom plots look these are the old school silver uh heat shield dom plats and they just look fantastic and for cooling i've got a z so the z73 i think it's a z73 kraken aio which has the digital display here over the cpu block looks really nice i've got a 4k60 pro elgato capture card for a lot of the on-camera uh stuff that you guys see when i'm filming from behind the desk and the power supply i've got in here what is it i don't even know oh it's the century 800 or 850 watt this is an 80 plus gold unit and i really like the sentry power supply because it's very compact this case is not very long so i've got a bit of breathing room in there for extra cables and i've got custom cables here that are actually pretty cheap you can find these on amazon for like 20 or 30 bucks if you want to build this exact setup i will have it linked below and then underneath that i'm gonna have all the new stuff that we upgrade in here uh starting first with the case you guys read the title i'm sure you're wondering where the heck is the nzxt flow so let's get into it stay with me phallus if you're in need of proper grooming get set up with manscapes performance package 4.0 you'll find their lawnmower 4.0 included which boasts a sleek waterproof design wireless charging and advanced skin safe technology for a smooth trim pretty much anywhere and as nice compliments you'll also get their weed whacker for ear nose trimming deodorant and toner for keeping fresh and much more get 20 off plus free shipping at manscape with code salazar at this link which you can also find in the video description so here she is in all her glory i went for the white model i'm kind of this is kind of an awkward camera angling so like this i went for the white model because um well my old rig was using a black case so i figured let's change things up a bit and if you're wondering what the heck the flow designates in this h510 model it's the fact that ncxt has finally prioritized excellent airflow so the front panel is now largely perforated with the exception of the lower third or lower fourth here it's got the nzxt logo just slightly baked in there looks really nice and this is actually removable so if you want to mount fans on the front side of this piece of cake these front panels also include a dust filter very fine mesh and if i can get this one out of here it's just magnetic so it's super easy to remove i'm actually going to keep this removed for my personal rig because well i clean my system quite a bit if you've been a fan of our pcdc series you know that i'm a clean freak and yeah if i clean every you know a few weeks or so especially after you know having so much dust float around in this office i'm not too worried about dust buildup long term so i prefer ideal airflow in this case you see these large perforations they're going to be plenty for allowing air to pass through and cool off our components elsewhere though this h510 remains relatively the same and i'm okay with that you still got the large cable bar for cable routing you still got the basement with perforations up top if you want to flip your power supply fan side up you could do that here but you've still got a dust filter down at the bottom pretty standard stuff but yeah nothing else is really different so if you saw our original h510 review from a few there's a few years ago wow time has flown by i've got that linked below if you haven't but much of those things are pretty much the same here so i'm not going to cover too much of that in this video those opinions are still how i feel about the case and look you know the only real issue i had with it to begin with was airflow so the fact that they have only changed that is why i'm okay with it because that was the only real gripe i had the cable bar can be a bit frustrating to work with at times there are a few other you know small things i could nitpick the fact you only get one usb 3.0 type a port at the front of the case is kind of annoying but you know i'm willing to work with those issues for the sake of having such a beautiful looking case a lot of people are kind of polarized by this design it's a bit too boxy for some people but i quite like it okay i guess there is one other thing i could complain about the fact that you still only get a single top mounted fan you can't mount two side by side and the reason for that a lot of people ask is because of this cable bar it does protrude quite a ways from the motherboard tray and because of that i mean you'd be hard-pressed to even fit a thin 120mm fan up there so that's why we're stuck with this actually the aio we're going to use is a quite large 280 mil radiator you can't fit 360s up front either because this area is closed off so that's the only hardware stuff you're going to struggle with in this build if you're okay with that single fan up top you still get your exhaust and you can still mount two up front i think you'll be i think you'll be fine personally because you've got so much more breathing room through that front perforated panel hi pepsi say hi to youtube now a few other things i want to use from nzxt just to keep the theme in check this beautiful n7b550 motherboard i'm gonna pair this with the 5950x you're probably thinking greg why are you pairing such a powerful cpu with a b series motherboard well for one we still get overclocking support for two we don't have an annoying fan granted a lot of those you can tweak now the fan curves of and three it looks so freaking sexy and to be honest i was never much of a hardcore overclocker anyway so i'm not really gonna miss out on any potential overclocking benefits associated with x570 boards and some of those still are equal to their b450 or b550 counterparts so i'm not much of an argument there in my case i just think that it looks really cool and it still has features i'm looking for it's got integrated wi-fi it's still got obviously type c support it's got plenty of usb headers we're gonna need one of those for our kraken for sure and uh yeah i mean why not and speaking of the kraken i've got a z63 rgba out here this has the digital screen that we were just talking about i have the z73 counterpart in my current rig but this one is white which i think is going to look really cool when paired with our white b550 motherboard and our white case so to kick things off we're going to be removing this graphics card i'm not sure if we're going to be taking this one over into the new build maybe maybe not i don't know if the color is really going to work there definitely taking the uh capture card the only other things we'll need definitely the 5950x possibly the power supply depending on power supply clearance uh in the 510 and then the storage drives those definitely we want to migrate over we shouldn't have any driver software conflicts uh migrating these to the new build because we're still sticking with the same cpu or just changing chipsets i'll be taking this thank you very much gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme and there we go empty case again let's put it in the box and then we'll get started with this thing hey again pepsi girl so this is everything going in the build including new stuff here to the right we've got the z63 the h510 flow and a 30 dti eagle variant from gigabyte this can be a pretty sweet card i have not personally used a 3080 ti in a rig of mine ever so it'll be cool to see how powerful this thing is of course the n7 motherboard my two 500 gig samsung evo drives that i usually run in raid zero although i think that volume is going to be toasting so we're migrating it to a different motherboard we will see i have a 1 000 watt p2 power supply that i'm going to pair with some sexy cable mod custom sleeve white cables with beautiful silver these are actually metal cable combs look really nice it'll blend with the theme nicely i've got two 140mm fans from fractal i'm actually going to recycle these and use these in the z63 just because i don't really care about the rgb it's not really going to be seen very well anyway through the mesh front panel and uh yeah the 5950x the nvme that's my boot drive and the elgato capture card so let's get to assembling the platform easy does it now gently slide her in and lower that retention arm boom that's simple get this nvme installed it's got kind of an older thermal pad on it but uh i don't have any replacements it'll do for now oh and i almost forgot i've got corsair dominator platinums in white these are so sexy eight gigs per dimm 32 gigs in total 3200 megahertz frequency and i believe 16 18 18 36 timings uh that is super tight considering the frequency here you're gonna get some of the best dies as well in these dom plots easy does it we've got one two three and four there we go aio prep isn't too complicated just need to remove these brackets i'll take that and torque down these standoffs love me some adult lego and it's time for the merge beautiful hardware combination here this ncxt case and this nzxt motherboard i'd expect no less now with the board tightened down we can start focusing on front i o wiring start with the small wires first it makes it easier later on by the way wiring front panel is super easy in this case because nzxt integrates everything into one connector we'll move the first of two included fans up top to make room for our aio and we'll get this gorgeous aio installed what a tight fit this is really like right on the edge of clearance i think i think we can get it to work oh yeah and of course i would expect nzxt products to work to work with your cases assuming you're not obviously going for something that clearly isn't supported a 360 ml like i said won't work but a 280 will and that's almost just as good if not better from a cooling performance standpoint they're very similar at least in our testing but using two 140mm fans instead of three 120 mil that means that we could theoretically get a lower operating acoustic profile with this because the larger fans don't need to spin as fast to displace an equivalent amount of air hand tighten this aio and wow it is looking so good already i just you know this isn't me it's nothing that i'm doing it's just this combination of hardware is so sweet let's peel off this plastic coating oh yeah that is that is satisfaction folks get these two ssds installed two there we go and we can lock these in with one screw a piece and we connect their stated data cables here gonna load our beefy power supply in from the side here this one's going to be kind of sort of a tight fit but we can actually keep our hard drive cage in here along with this longer power supply it's a bit more room in this h510 tighten things down and wire things up and quick side note check out how sexy this rtx 3080 ti eagle is from gigabyte such a good looking card very beefy it's a tad bit scuffed up here on the plastic lining around the eagle logo not sure if this was a used card when it was sent to me but anyway it looks freaking beautiful i'm actually not sure if this behemoth is going to fit in the 510. i guess we'll find out so we'll get the capture card in here first populate the lower full length slot and there's a train buzzing by outside sorry if you can hear that oh my gosh oh it like almost actually i think let's see cool this is super tight wow if i can angle it up a tad and then squeeze her back down oh yeah look at that that is as snug as it gets folks it looks like this card was made for this case check out that clearance folks we've got less than an inch we're talking maybe maybe one and a half centimeters of clearance between the edge of the card and the front of the radiator connects supplemental pcie power pretty easy and last we'll straighten things up here at the rear again pretty straightforward nzxt makes it quite easy with the 510 in my opinion let's get the right side panel on shouldn't be uh shouldn't be too difficult let's see we can slot it in there and then i'm just going to tighten things down it's a bit tight but she'll fit no problem and here we are wow this is i mean this is a beautiful build and i'm not trying to toot my own horn here i just think that the combination of hardware worked out so well better than i even anticipated yes we have an nzxt motherboard and ncxd case and an nzxio so yeah i mean you'd expect those components to play well together but everything else just worked out so nicely these cable mod cables are the icing on the cake i think this graphics card though it is a bit contrasting in color still works because the interior of the 510 is black despite having a white exterior so the contrasting colors work well we still got a black lcd when the computer is not on and it just it just works it really works i'm i'm i'm blown away by how good this build looks now there are a few cons things you should know going into this i think that the 510 flow despite having a noticeable bump in airflow which i'll show you here in a second is a bit pricey and nzxt cites the the just increased cost on their side to produce and export these cases to the united states and elsewhere so of course that cost has to be offloaded uh to the end user as well to some extent nzxt is not a charity they're not just gonna you know eat that cost and hand these out basically for free with zero margin so that's one of the things that's keeping this a bit costlier than i would have hoped granted everything at this point is more or less going up in price so i can't be too critical there i think that for what you're getting with respect to other things out there the meshify 2 is a really good case um the trying to think of what else is out there fantex makes some really good mid towers in this kind of size and form factor there's a lot to choose from i think that the 510 won't let you down in really any department apart from maybe hardware support so if you really are dead set on a 360 mil aio you're not going to get that support in an h510 if you really want dual fan support up top you're not going to get that in the h510 and if for some reason you want two or more usb type a ports up front you're not going to get that with the h510 so some cons the way yes but you should know that going into it so i wouldn't really say that this would be all that much of a letdown i mean you should again do your research before you spend this kind of money on a chassis but those things aside and of course taking price into consideration i think that the 510 is still a worthy contender especially now that we've got airflow prioritized finally thank you nzxt for finally doing the thing that we have been asking you to do for what seems like a freaking decade okay you got you know the s340 was great closed off front panel s340 elite was great closed off front panel h510 was great closed off front panel it was always your achilles heel and you've remedied that with a very simple solution that i think looks really good some would prefer the glass yes but i think when it comes to uh usability at the end of the day the h510 flow is the way to go dang i i should be paid for that nzxt guys that that's that's a good one right there okay h 510 flow it's the way to go that that's marketable i'm just um i'm gonna collect my royalties at the end of the month thank you very much now in terms of cooling potential with the left side panel on of course i wanted the aio to stabilize reach thermal equilibrium before i started running the temperature test that you're seeing here there is a noticeable improvement by including a mesh front panel over completely sealing it off of course though i'd say that this test isn't necessarily apples to apples with respect to the previous h510 because the new h510 flow doesn't have those little side grilles that the original 510 does obviously it doesn't need those anymore because the entire front panel for the most part is mesh it is largely perforated uh but i i still think that it's something you'll notice and and that's a good thing it would be a shame to have this finally reach the market and for it not to really have any impact at all on cpu temperatures so the deltas definitely look good and if you're into a positive pressure profile i think you can definitely get that set up here if you have a front mounted aio those who are concerned about the way i positioned this oh you got barbs up top that's horrible just come on okay i've had to say this so many times and i feel like i have to keep defending myself because people just don't understand what they're saying or what they're watching for that matter barbs up is fine so long as the pump is positioned below the barbs okay if you're hearing gurgling and things like that it might be because your area is not totally filled up and they're designed to have a bit of air in them so that the fluid can expand as it heats up the water doesn't really expand that much in this kind of setting it's still nice to have that breathing room so you might hear some gurgle but you're not going to have air continuously flow downward with a weak acetech pump over and over and over again right you might hear it initially but after a while once that loop stabilizes the most you would hear in this configuration is a gargle but you should not um look at this as like you know being severely detrimental to your pump so i feel like i have to say that every time i mount an aio like this now after yeah after the whole thing on youtube the gamer's nexus great video but i feel like a lot of people are taking it out of context and um it's kind of just it's really starting to annoy content creators at this point so enough to where a lot of us have made like rebuttals to that video which i didn't really feel like was even needed because the video from gn covered all of this but people watched that video and took things out of context i feel like and so i always have to clarify my position here i don't think this is the ideal situation but it is still nowhere near as bad as if i had taken the radiator and placed it down here over the basement if i you know assuming i could do that and have the pump be the highest thing in the loop that is bad there's no way you're gonna convince me otherwise but in this position here it's perfectly fine okay and it looks really darn good imo in this setting so with that i hope you enjoyed this video i'm not really trying to convince you one way or the other as to whether or not you should buy the h510 flow i mean if you're in the market for a high airflow case you know what's available you know what this thing competes directly with like i said the fractal cases and fantex cases that come to mind that are in very similar price points i mean this is one of the better ones i will say that in my experience especially with the airflow testing that we've done here i don't have five or six different cases to compare with all at the same time because this is a totally different platform that i usually use to test case temperatures i can say that that front panel is not very hindering at all one of the few ways you can actually test this i'm just going to pull this off here is you can place your hand behind the mesh itself and you can just blow through the mesh you can feel a lot of that air reaching your hand if it's not very obstructive now there's some panels out there that are pretty bad at this but you don't feel much of that air at all compared to just blowing directly into your hand right obviously this is ideal but that's basically an open air test bench and the point of a case is to kind of keep things enclosed and away from the elements now if you put the mesh dust filter in here as well actually doesn't hinder it too much more than just having your hand straight up behind the grille itself so this is one of the the quick tests you can do if maybe you're shopping in micro center and you're concerned about airflow just take the front panel off and just blow through it and see how much of that air you can feel on your hands if you feel a lot of resistance that front panel is probably no bueno so in zxt you did a good thing you finally caught up with your competitors and created a case in the mid tower segment that prioritizes airflow and it really shows temperatures look great and i'm excited moving forward uh to use this my personal rig just to walk into the office every morning and see this beautiful thing it is um it really is a thing of beauty i'm super impressed with the way all of these all these components gel together and if you're interested in building something very similar to this again you can find my previous build down below but also this build some of the components are shared so you'll see the same link twice but some of these aren't so if you want to build something similar again with the graphics card being the one exception because um yeah you guys know at this point good luck um yeah you can find those in the description i appreciate that thanks for watching this far into the video as well if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up consider subscribing if you have not already and i will catch you in the next one my name is greg thanks for building with me",

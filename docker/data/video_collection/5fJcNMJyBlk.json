    "transcript": "Have you ever wanted to pay with your Android phone? Now is the day to pay with Android. Tap your phone - it's all you need to do. Buy those things you know they're good for you. * maybe I do better next time* *Sponsored by Google* Alright so Android Pay. You know I made a few videos about it. You watch them. They were exciting, they were fun, I went down in New York City, I got into all kinds of mischief. *Want to get nuts? Let's get nuts.* I was purchasing Doritos, I had a couple of meals and survive 24 hours using nothing but Android Pay. But in that video I might not have given you the whole picture on Android Pay paying for things with your phone in general. Lot of people nervous, lot of people walk up to the cash to start shaking a little bit to get all jittery they're like Can I please.. with my phone? I... aarrgh! That's not the looking wanna do. You wanna confidence - that step one. You can see that I have a credit card attached. Now the simplest way to add a credit cards your Android Pay is by using the picture function. So right here you can see, you can add a credit card, debit card, store gift card or even a loyalty program. It was simply place the car down, Jack can't probably see that right there see that check? Line it up with in there and then it will be added. Alternatively here's the add manually button this will allow you to put any card number in. One of the benefits here is security. Believe it or not, your entire credit card number is not fully transferred to the store that you're buying something from in the same way that it would be if you were just swiping the card so there's an added layer of security there. This phone features NFC and that's the technology the Android Pay is going to take advantage of it. When you're out there in the world, you're gonna run into a variance in the pay terminals that exist out there. Some of them will be marked as Android Pay, others maybe not. You might see a terminal like this with a tap portion which could have the logo on it. It will often be supported something that looks like this, where you can just tap on the screen. So there's something at play here when it comes to the security is referred to as tokenization. When you tap it on one of these devices, it's actually sending a token in order to verify that that's legit, instead of transferring your complete number over to that store and then having on file *and will you bring up. That, that's a magnet! When it's strong so, you can't really tell it's a magnet.* Another misconception that people have is that: they need to go into their phone, unlock their phone and then launch the app and select something. But in reality especially on a phone like this, with the fingerprint scanner right on the back, you pull this out of your pocket, unlock the device and even though you're not in the app or anything you would then just hold this up to the pay terminal, it would launch Android Pay and then complete the transaction. So it's really one tap. *Two terabytes, I gotta have two terabytes. I got a lot of stuff to carry around, men!* So you're obviously going to need an Android device in order to use Android Pay. You're gonna have to have KitKat or newer from an operating system perspective. And the Android Pay app installed which is readily available in many cases like the Pixel is pre-installed. So as you saw in my previous videos, the number of places, retailers, and so on that are starting to accept Android Pay - those are expanding. In the 24 hours in New York videos I was at FootlLocker, GameStop, McDonald's. We even did the Lift ride, oh and of course B&H! We did the entire video B&H. B&H also accepts Android Pay. Get the app. Add a card. Check it out! Try to a few your favorite retailers and see where you 're at. Actually not that complicated, he doesn't need to be that intimidating! I push the tech forward that's what we do here. Unbox Therapy style. Tap your phone!",

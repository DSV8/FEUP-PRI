    "transcript": "- WWDC 2019, oh my goodness. (upbeat music) This keynote was so insane. Sitting there in the audience and trying to take pictures as things just flew by, it was almost impossible. Things were happening so quickly. First of all, the shock to me was the fact that they announced a Mac Pro. (gasps) What? Out of all of the things that I've predicted, that was one of the things that I predicted them to never do. (smooth music) But they did and I'm so excited because we got a chance to see it. Not only did we get a chance to see the Mac Pro, we also got to see the new displays they announced. Being able to see it up close, in person, it really was wow. This is the first 32-inch, 6K Retina display. This obviously isn't a display for everyone and this is geared towards the professionals. I still would like to consider myself a professional with the amount of video that I edit is probably a lot more than some people would ever really imagine. So for me, this is something that I definitely would invest in. Although I'm not coloring feature films or anything crazy like that, it is really great to be able to see true colors and seeing this thing up close, it definitely makes me want to step up my game and I think it may be time to start shooting in 8K. Because now, with this Mac Pro, it is so powerful that editing 8K footage is just gonna be like editing 720p footage on my MacBook Pro. It's gonna be like, hm, don't worry. We've got this. For editing, they announced this graphics accelerator called the Afterburner. So with this thing installed, in Final Cut, you can have three streams of 8K pro-res, raw footage, 12 streams of 4K pro-res footage, and up to 16 streams of 4K pro-res. That's so amazing and I'm definitely not creating anything here on YouTube, right now, that would call for that, but again, maybe I need to. There was also this really cool 8K workflow that they had in this little hands-on demo station. They're taking this footage, sending it over here, compositing it, and then we have, over here, another workflow to go into the editing, and then over here, you've got your coloring station. So, obviously, the Mac Pro and the displays were an incredible highlight for a lot of people but they also announced so many other things in the software realm, like iOS 13. Finally, I mean, we've been talking about this for a while and a lot of the things that I predicted and a lot of things that the internet predicted, yes, it came true, and number one being dark mode. I mean, look at this. It looks so great. I know it's not new technology and it's not a new feature, it's kind of great that Apple has finally caught up to that trend. From text messages, look how great that looks. After using the dark mode in Mojave, this is something that I'm so glad that they finally have. iOS 13 will have 30% faster face ID recognition, so that's a plus. It'll be able to launch apps two times faster. Man, there are so many things. Oh, this was really cool, Siri now has a new voice using this neuro text-to-speech. So they showed a really cool example on stage of what she sounded like before, but here's one that she sounded like after, 'cause I kinda forget to film her before. But you guys all know what Siri sounds like. But this is what she can sound like in iOS 13. - [Siri] Absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, the state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled, ideal gas reach their minimum value, taken as zero. - Apple sign-in, you guys always see these things all over the internet where it's like, okay, sign in with your Google profile, sign in with your Facebook. And all of that is is collecting your data. Privacy is such a huge concern and it's really great to see that Apple takes that seriously. So this is pretty neat. You can sign in using your Apple ID. Now, what they will also do is they will give you the option, because a lot of these sites need your email address, you can say, no, I don't want to give you my email address and Apple will create one in the cloud for you and that will then forward to your email address. So you'll be able to make new email addresses for every single site that you sign up with but they won't actually have your real email address. I love this so much that I'm thinking about going and un-signing up for everything that I've ever signed up for and re-signing in with my Apple ID. That sounds, actually, like a lot of work, so I probably won't do that, but from now on, Apple sign-in, that's the way to go. I'm excited to see who actually starts adopting this, which I feel like people are gonna be crazy not to. Some people might be a little bit upset with that, like companies, because you're not gonna be actually getting people's data anymore, so I feel like there may be a slow adoption for that. Mostly just because those companies want all of our information. And Apple's not gonna give it to 'em. They're talking about HomeKit cameras, so securing your cameras and security footage. I was hoping that they were gonna actually announce a HomeKit security camera made by Apple but they didn't. They're also talking about HomeKit-enabled routers, so those'll be coming out some time in the fall, I believe and they also said that Spectrum is on board, so that'll be coming directly form your cable company. New Memoji accessories. I think this is definitely something that I predicted, I did predict they were going to have them be a microtransaction, so thank you for not making us pay for these. What's cool about this is you can take your Memojis and you can turn them into actual emojis. I love emojis, so this is something that I'm excited about. They have a new Photos app, so they have this new layout for Photos so you can have it organized between day, month, year, and it's cool because they will take a little snapshot of your day, so they won't show you all of the photos, but they'll make it all nicely laid out so you can get a better shot of the good shots that you shot that day. So I take so many videos and pictures, mostly of my dog, so it'll be great to kinda have a little snapshot of those. They also updated the photo editing. I really like the photo editing in here already, so since they're taking that same tech and kind of making it better, that's gonna be really cool to play around with. But in the demo that they showed here, it all looked like it worked pretty well. Also really excited to be able to edit video a little bit easier. You can add filters and you can also rotate the video. I have been waiting for that for so long. Like, I don't know why that is such a simple thing that it took 'em that long to do, but doesn't matter, it's here, iOS 13, dun, dun, dun! You can rotate video. - [Jenna] You can pinch to zoom! - You can pinch to zoom. Jenna's in the bathroom right now because I'm shooting this video. - [Jenna] I'm hiding. - She's hiding. This looks like a really professional production here. She's actually editing on the toilet, like I need to show you what this looks like right now, 'cause you're not gonna believe me. Yep. - Welcome to my editing space. (Justine laughs) - You just need a Mac Pro now. Yep. Oh my gosh, that'd be great, it would fit perfect. Okay, bye. Uh, anyway, where did I leave off? Jenna editing in the bathroom. There's also an update to AirPods, so in iOS 13, you'll be able to share the same audio stream much like those headphone splitters in the past that I'm sure all of you have seen and have used, you can use two pairs of AirPods and listen to the same thing at the same time. They'll also be doing an update to Apple Maps, so making everything much higher quality. There's also this really cool feature called Look Around and as you're looking around, you can click on buildings or different establishments, and you can add those to collections or favorites for things things that you may want to visit in the future. I was hoping for some more updates to HomePod, but there really wasn't much. The main thing that they did say that will be in iOS 13 and in the latest HomePod update is HomePod will be able to recognize different voices so if, for instance, I go in and tell a HomePod to play me some music, it will know to play music that I like, and if my sister goes in and says, \"Play me some music,\" it will play her some music. It'll play music that she likes. I think having a multi-user HomePod experience is something that you're gonna have to have in the future because having just one device and many people using it, that'll completely throw off your algorithm. As you guys know, I love my Apple Watch so much, so there were some updates to WatchOS 6 that are gonna be really fun and for me, as a woman, and other ladies out there who have to deal with that monthly visitor, there's a new Cycles app, so not only will you be able to track your menstrual cycle on your Apple Watch, it will also carry over into the HealthKit app. So even if you don't have an Apple Watch, this is something that you can use on your phone as well. They announced some new watch faces. They looked pretty awesome, I love the gradient one. So you'll be able to customize that to any color so it can match your Apple Watch bands. There was also some new Apple Watch bands that they announced. I didn't really get a chance to look at them too closely 'cause they kind of brushed past it pretty fast but there was a pink one and you know what I will be getting. There's now an Audiobooks app, there's a Calculator app, and Voice Memos. I don't really use Voice Memos that often but I know a lot of people that do, so having that accessible just right on your wrist at any time is really cool. It'll then sync to your phone Voice Memos so it'll be super seamless. They also announced the Apple Watch App Store, so you'll be able to download apps directly from the WatchOS store on your wrist, you won't need a phone or anything else separate, you can just do everything right here. They also updated the watch activity and that also transfers over to your phone. They have activity trends, so all of the activity data that I have on my watch from the past several years, it's kind of insane, because it'll be able to take all of that and it'll be able to analyze the data from the past 90 days and tell me how I'm doing. So using those different kinds of trends, it'll be able to say, you were doing a little bit better 90 days ago, which, yes, I know I was, but now I actually have that data right in front of me to make me feel even worse about the fact that I haven't been working out as much as I'd like. They also announced iPad OS, which this brings so much more functionality to the iPad. So we did get a chance to check out some of the features here on iPad OS and it's really cool because you can see here, you can have all of these different slide over features, so you can rotate through windows very easily. They've also added some new gestures, so there's the new copy and paste gesture. For copy, you just kinda do a three-finger pinch and then to paste it, you do the same thing, so it's kinda like you're (vocalizes) throwing it down on the page. And then if you want to undo and redo, so it's just three-finger swipe to the left, three-finger swipe to the right. That's so much easier than shaking your iPad to undo. They also have a new cursor, so if you're trying to select text you will actually have a cursor on the screen, so you'll be able to see what you're doing, so if you want to copy text, this makes it so much easier to see what you're actually selecting. Apple Pencil latency is now being reduced from 20 milliseconds to nine milliseconds and I don't really draw or do that much with my Apple Pencil, but that's a pretty significant decrease if you ask me. They also were talking about this other thing called Sidecar. You can now use your iPad as a second display. This is really great because I travel a lot and I edit a lot of footage on the go, so being able to have that second display to maybe just organize footage or anything, it's gonna be really cool. You can also use the iPad as a tablet, which, yes, it is a tablet, if you're using Photoshop or Illustrator or whatever it is that you're doing, you can actually go in and you can illustrate on it, so this is a cool example, like they're showing here illustrating in Illustrator using the iPad as a display. They also made an update to the Files app, which is something that really, desperately was needed. It's also cool because if you are using this in the iPad, you can have SD card and USB support. If you have a flash drive with some photos, you can plug that in and those will automatically be imported into the Files app. So you can just open it up and see what's on the card. They also showed a little demo of if you have a camera, you can plug it in using USBC to your iPad and get those photos directly off of the camera and import them right into Lightroom. This is gonna be really great because you can use all of your Lightroom presets and just have everything right there, automatically on your iPad. They talked a little bit also about Apple TV and having Apple TV across all platforms is really great. Being able to watch Apple TV on your Mac, that's gonna be really cool, especially with the Apple TV+. They did show a trailer of one of their shows called For All Mankind. I was hoping that they were gonna show a little bit more about some of the shows that they were working on, but I figure they'll probably have an entire separate event for that. And they had so much stuff to cover in this that there probably wasn't time. One of the saddest things but we all knew that it was gonna happen eventually is the death of iTunes. iTunes is no more. It was no replaced by three separate apps: TV, Music, and Podcasts. Oh, they also showed this really great example of being able to search podcasts, and not just search the titles of podcasts or the description, but actually search the things that people are talking about in podcasts. There's over 700,000 podcasts in the podcasts store, which is kind of crazy to think because that is now all searchable. So you want to search for anything, you can. They're also now bringing Screen Time to Mac, so you'll be able to know how much time you spend doing what on your Mac. They're also gonna have this really cool thing called Activation Lock, so if you do, by some really awful chance, lost your computer or someone steals it, you'll be able to add an activation lock, so no one will be able to reset that computer unless they have your iCloud account and password. They also talked about the new FindMy app. So you'll be able to find your iPhone or your Mac now and it doesn't have to be connected to wifi. So, using Bluetooth and using other devices around it, it'll be able to triangulate where that item is. So we're about to try out some of the new AR demos and right now Marques and I are gonna play this game called Swift Strike and they asked who was gonna win, I said, \"I'm not competitive, so we'll see what happens.\" (crowd clapping) Wait! - [Man] Give it a shove! Go ahead and push it. - Push it really hard! - [Man] Oh, there you go, there you go. - Nice! (crowd cheering) Yes! - With the ARKit 3, there's gonna be a person inclusion, so you'll be able to put yourself into these augmented reality environments. They also showed a really cool demo of motion capture. You'll be able to mocap yourself. It's just crazy to see how far technology has come, like, these things that once could only be done in crazy, Hollywood film studios, you're able to do on a phone in the palm of your hand. Well, there's so much more that I'm gonna talk about, but I really wanted to try to get this video out quickly for you guys. This day was just overwhelming. We saw so many great things and especially with the announcement of the Mac Pro. I will probably be talking more about that in a later video, but for now, I just want to know, what did you guys think? What was your favorite part? What do you guys think of the Mac Pro? What do you think of the displays? What do you think of all of the iOS updates? Leave all of those in the comments below and I will see you in the next video. (upbeat music)",

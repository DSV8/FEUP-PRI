    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This is Austin. Is the PC killing the PS5, the Xbox, the Nintendo Switch, the Philips CD-i, the-- - Are you out of consoles? Is that all you got? The Game Boy. - I feel like I went too far, going from Switch to Philips CD-i. I feel like I jumped too far. - You think? Is that really the wrong way to go? So here's the thing. The PlayStation State of Play just wrapped up. And while I think most people will call it underwhelming as they showed off 10 games, I think eight or nine of which we'd seen before, some new trailers, a few more release dates. But the thing that really struck me about all of the games with really, I think, one or two exceptions is the fact that while yes, they're on PS5, they're also in a lot of cases on PS4. They're also in almost all cases on PC. Some of them are on Xbox. It's weird to think that we're now, what, six months into the PS5 lifecycle, or so. I'm still playing PS4 games on my PS5. There very few PS5 exclusives or even games I would prefer to play on PS5 compared to something like PC or Xbox. - Which, to be fair, I'm doing the same thing with my Xbox is I'm just replaying a lot of games. Because the new console generation just improved all of those experiences, faster load times, improved textures, all that stuff. This is something we've been talking about since before the PlayStation came out, since before the Xbox came out. The exclusives just don't really exist anymore. I'm not saying that none do because there are some. - Returnal. - Returnal is one of 'em. Which looks great, don't get me wrong. But I don't think I'm like, I still don't have a PS5. I'm not gonna buy a PS5 just for Returnal. Everything else is coming to PC. If I wanna play those games, I'll play 'em on PC. - When you look at what we've got on deck for PlayStation Five and Xbox Series X games, almost all of them are coming to PC. There are a lot of Xbox games like Forza and a lot of the first party titles and stuff that are PC as well as Xbox. And pretty much all of these PlayStation games are only console exclusive. Returnal, I think, was one of the only ones we saw today that didn't actually have a PC version. Most all of these have PC versions. Many of them have Switch versions and everything. It's very interesting to think that before the PS4 generation really was a big generation that was full of games that you had to have a PS4 for. - And that's why a lot of people said the PS5 is just gonna win this generation because, okay, they have all the exclusives. We don't know if God of War will get a PC port. - Gran Turismo. - Yeah, Uncharted. Obviously we don't have any information on stuff like that yet. So those are gonna be the real big, I guess, qualifiers for this. But right now, it's like, there is no reason to have an Xbox over a PS5, if you have a PC because all these games are coming to both. It used to be Xbox versus PS5. Right now, it's consoles in general versus the PC and PC is winning. - Well, I think, the PC has the best of a lot of these worlds. Because, I think, from a monetary side of things, there's no way the developer can develop a game just for PS5 or just for Series X, or whatever, without Sony or Microsoft giving them a giant pile of money to substitute what they would've made on PC. And if you're Sony, you're looking at it and go, okay, well you know what, I'll pay you X number of dollars to keep it off Xbox. You wanna sell on a PC by all means, go ahead. And I think any developer who is making sound financial decisions is probably gonna take them up on that. If you give some console exclusivity you get a fast stack and return, but you're still able to sell that game on PC. Now that's a good thing for PC gamers. As a PC gamer, not only do you have access to stuff like Xbox Game Pass, now you have access to, of course, Steam and all the various different stores where you're getting tons and tons of games. In fact, even some games that used to be PS4 exclusive, with Days Gone, for example. It's rumored, at the moment, to come on PC. - No, that's confirmed, that was already confirmed. - Oh, it's already confirmed. - Yeah. There's a bunch of older games that are rumored. But so, a few days ago, I don't remember the guy's name. So they said that a bunch of PlayStation titles would be coming to PC and a lot of people really freaked out about that. But that was also PS4 games, specifically. - Which makes sense. Okay, so imagine a game comes out for PS4. And two years later, it comes out for PC, or a year later, or whatever. - Well, that's a no brainer because it's an older game that people will rebuy for a new platform. It's basically printing money, if you're Sony. All these games that have have already hit their end of life, as far as on the console side of things. Because if you bought a PS5, you can just port over your PS4 version of it, even if it doesn't have a patch. Put it on PC, you're gonna make that money again. - So here's the question. Does the PC and all of the games that you used to have, pure PlayStation exclusives, now moving more and more over to PC. Does the PC kill the PS5? Now, before you drop the dislike and unsubscribe and unring-a-ling the ding-a-ling bell, hear me out for just a second. This is a hypothetical-- - I think that right there is the thing that people will most agree on, is that PC will is like-- - Okay, so if we all take off our critical hats for a second and just open your mind and think for just a second. There's always a market for consoles. I'm not gonna deny that whatsoever. No PC can match the idea of having a box that you plug into your TV. It just works. You don't have to deal with downloading driver updates. You don't have to deal with Windows. It's just simpler. - Which is why I like consoles over PC. - And on top of that, when you look at the PS5 and the Series X, the Series S, as well, the value propositions are unreal, especially now. When you're struggling to build a $500 gaming PC that is remotely usable. Whereas, if you can get an Xbox or a PlayStation for close to retail it's gonna completely wipe the floor performance-wise. So there are certainly advantages to consoles. Don't get me wrong. However, if you look at the amount of games that are available on the PS4 and the Xbox, there's certainly a lot of older games. Specifically on the Xbox, they do a great job with backwards compatibility. If you look at new stuff. And yes, there are games that are getting patches. Yes, there are, of course, these PS4 and Xbox games, which looked fine. In fact, they actually showed what was the, it looks like Fortnite dodge ball. What is it called? - It's Knockout City. - Knockout City. - Knockout City. Knockout City looks really fun. - [Commentator] It's a PS4 game. It's not PS5 patched, which is very strange. - That one makes sense, because again, it looks like it's targeted for a younger audience. It is a free-to-play game. They're going the exact Fortnite route, where they want to be in as many hands as possible. So I'm sure there will be a PS5 patch at some point. But the goal, right now, is to get it on as many hands as possible, which is by far the PS4 versus the PS5. - Yeah. So if you look at the environment that we're in for 2021, obviously, next year, they have a lot of other games, like Gran Turismo, which is now been delayed, but will come out next year. There certainly will be more hardcore PS5 exclusives. But what's the point if you are a gamer? If you own, literally, any of these consoles, if you own an Xbox, if you own a PS5, you own a PC. If you own one of the three, why would you need to buy any of the others? If you have a PS5, you're playing a lot of games. If you have an Xbox, you're playing a lot of games. But if you have a PC, you're playing all the games. - You're playing all of them. Which, we're in this such a weird limbo of gaming right now. Because you don't need to have every console anymore. I remember, growing up, I used to try and have, like, I need to get my PlayStation for this, I need to get my Xbox for this. And then, all my Nintendo consoles. I don't have that anymore. You get your PC. But now, no one can get a PC that's worth a damn for playing any of these games. I can see it over there, but we can't reach it. And I do feel like a lot of the announcement last week, to have all these PS4 games coming to to PC, is largely driven by what we talked about in our last PS5 video, that Sony's not making any money right now because there's-- - Well, on the PS5 specifically. - Yes, but, so they're losing money on every console sale. Just recapping the old video. And the idea there is they make all their money back on software and buying new games and stuff like that. However, all the PS5s are sitting in scalper's hands. And so they're not making any money on games on those PS5s that they would have sold. - I do think by middle to late this year, so give it another three to six months, console supply should be better. Not perfect, but I do think you should be able to, without a ton of work, be able to buy a lot of Xbox and PlayStations at retail pricing. - And that's the argument I'm gonna make for consoles right now. Because right now, I don't see light at the end of the tunnel, right now, for PC parts. - Yeah, I don't either. It's gonna be a while. - You look at the whole mess with the 3060s that just came out, which, oh, we've made these miner proof. And then immediately, people found a way to mine with the 3060. So those are already out of stock. - I think this could be really interesting as we go forward for the next few years, before we get our PS5 pro and our Xbox series triple X, or whatever. I think it's gonna be really interesting to think about what makes the most sense as a gaming platform. If you are someone who wants to sit down on the couch, play on your TV. And certainly if you're someone who doesn't want to spend $7,000 buying RTX 3090s from scalpers, a console makes a lot of sense. - Yeah. So let me ask you a more philosophical question. - Go for it. - All right. Like I said, God of War will be like the big tell. I think it will be PS5 exclusive, at least for a while. - I agree, yeah, I agree. - If PS5, if you knew it was eventually gonna come to PC, would you buy a PS5 to play God of War when it launched? Because that's really what it's coming down to right now with, Xbox has already said, look, we want our games to be on Windows from day one. That's why you can get Doom. That's why you can get Halo, whenever the hell that releases in 20 years. Because it keeps getting delayed. That is their overall strategy. We want it on both platforms so you can play wherever you want. PlayStation is kinda dipping their toe in the water for that. So it comes back to, do you buy a console for day one exclusive, or wait a year or two to play a game on PC and then only have one console? - I feel like the answer is somewhat yes to that. Mostly because the strategy that Sony are taking at the moment is that, yeah, the game will probably come to PC at some point. But then again, okay, are you playing Last of Us 2 three years later than everyone else? It's certainly possible. There's nothing against waiting a couple years to play games. And obviously, that's always been a great move on the used market. When the Xbox One came out, everyone goes out and buys an Xbox 360 and a hundred games for $2 each, or whatever. And you get to experience an entire generation of gaming. But in these days, when you might want to play a game, oh, I don't know, in the same decade as when it first came out, it does make sense to have the hardware. But what I look at is just, look, I love the Xbox. The Xbox is clearly a very powerful platform. But if you own a PC, unless you're attached either to the value proposition or the form factor of having an Xbox that's just gonna work underneath your TV, it doesn't make a ton of sense to buy an Xbox at the moment. When you know that you can play all these games that typically, as long as you have a decent PC at similar settings or potentially even better. On the PlayStation side, it's a little bit more defensible. I think people who are trying to scream that the PS5 is dead, the PC is gonna kill it, or whatever. Clearly, that's complete hyperbole. But there's certainly some truth to that. There's something underneath the surface of that argument that the clear reason why you buy a PS4, for years and years, were the excellent exclusives and the fact that it was the most powerful console. And that made sense. But now we're seeing not only most games that are coming out that are not straight first-party stuff coming out on PC as well. And then even the first party games that are typically coming out a year, maybe two years later on PC. I mean, I'm not gonna say that that makes the PS5 a bad deal. I think that's wildly overstating it. But there's something there to the idea that the value proposition between consoles isn't quite what it has been in the past. - No, and it's even, one of the things that is understated for this generation, which didn't exist when the last generation started, was cross play. - You don't have the tie, you have the lock-in effect. - A big part of the PS4's success, in my opinion, is all right, how badly the Xbox One launched at. That was garbage. So then a bunch of people bought PlayStations. And then, when six months down the road, if you're not a day-one adopter and you're trying to decide between Xbox and a PlayStation, you say, well, what do my friends have? Because without cross-platform, if I wanna play with my friends, I need what they have. So what did people do? Their friends had PlayStation, so they got PlayStation. And then it just snowballs. That doesn't matter right now. - Everyone's on PC and Discord. Those are the platforms of the future. - And from the viewpoint of Sony and Microsoft, they don't care at all. Because again, they make their money not on the actual hardware but on the games that they're selling. Remember-- - But they do need to sell those games on their platforms. - No, they don't because look at Death Loop. Death Loop is a Bethesda game. Which is owned by Microsoft. And a Sony exclusive, or a console exclusive. - But that was a deal that predated Bethesda purchasing them. - But they could say, oh, we're gonna have that come over to X-Box after a year of exclusive, or whatever. But they're not. They straight up said, we're just gonna honor that deal. Because again, it doesn't matter to them. They're making money on people buying it on PS5. So that's all that matters to them. - It's gonna be interesting because that is one of the unforeseen circumstances of what's gonna happen here. Microsoft owns a lot of studios now. They've purchased a lot of studios over the last few years. But I will be shocked if any of those studios are making games that are Xbox exclusive that are also not on PC. I don't see that happening. - Again, we have it right from Phil Spencer, who said, we don't wanna do that. We want it to be Xbox as just an extension of Windows gaming. - Yeah, so I'm very curious. What do you think is the future of the PlayStation 5, Xbox, PC, mnage trois, if you will, of gaming systems? Let us know in the comments below. Please subscribe and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling bell. Otherwise, I will say more French words and no one wants to listen to that. (upbeat music)",

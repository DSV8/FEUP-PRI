    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today's video I'm gonna show you this app called Descript. Now many of you may have heard of this app before, it's been around for quite a while and a lot of people use it for podcasting. So it's been really incredible for turning audio into transcripts. But recently, Descript has started working more with video. Now this is really, really cool because if you know how to edit a Word document, hit deletes type a few keys, you basically are now becoming a video editor using Descript. So a huge thank you to Descript for partnering with me on this video to show you guys this. They just had a massive update with a lot of new features, and it really feels like after you see this if you've never experienced this before, that anybody can become a video editor within seconds. So I wanna give you a little overview of how the app works but also show you some of the new features that they've just added, like being able to add stock footage, AI background removal, making social clips from longer videos and using scenes to edit. So to get started, we're gonna go to new project. What makes it so different is you're basically gonna upload your video and it's gonna transcribe it automatically for you. So you're not gonna be using this normal timeline editor that a lot of us are used to. You're gonna be editing with scenes with text and there is a timeline editor at the bottom, which you will sometimes have to reference, and you can actually use it and edit in there as well. But this is made to be edited with text. It's so cool. So this is gonna be quitting caffeine. Now we're gonna choose our file to transcribe. I have already have this video shots, so we're adding the file in. It's uploading it to Descript, so it's preparing. And now we're gonna add our speaker name. Justine, that is me. There's so many features that Descript has to offer and I'm probably not gonna get to all of them, but one thing that I really like while this is preparing is, you're able to overdub your voice. Basically making VO but not having to go and actually record VO. Like you can type the words that you want it to speak. And because you already have this full script this full transcript of your voice, Descript is able to use AI and basically make VO for you. This is the entire transcript. That was pretty fast. Thankfully I do have very fast internet. So this video did upload pretty quickly. So to get started editing, you'll see over here on this side, we've got just one little image here and this little slash. Using slashes is how you're gonna separate scenes in Descript. Instead of making cuts, you just delete text. I know, I know. Hey guys, it's Justine, and you may have seen me talking about this on Twitter a little bit or-- We can type a slash, or you can click here to add a scene. I like typing a slash. Now, I love doing jump cuts and punch-ins. So this right here is separating everything out by scenes. So if I want to take this, I like punching in, so I'm gonna zoom myself in and-- Everyone's like, \"Wow that's so cool of you\". That's it. That's all. I just, I typed a slash and it just magically happened. You might also be curious why a lot of these words are underlined. Well, I'm glad that you were curious and I'm glad that you asked, because these are filler words. I have a terrible habit of saying, like, um, us, random words that I don't want in my video and you might not actually see them very often because I edit them out. But with this, you can remove all of the filler words automatically. 70 results of kind of, I do say kind of a lot, you know, like, that's a lot. So we're just gonna go ahead and delete all of them. So we're gonna remove the media. I don't wanna replace it with gap clips I just want them all to go away. We're now deleting every single redundant word. So this whole section I kind of messed up on. So you can see, I say long story short, well guess what? I also say it down here as well. So we're just gonna delete it. So now that has made this whole entire thing-- Caffeine you may have seen I got a blood clot at my shoulder-- Another scene. Now up here you'll see there's a little bit of space. I don't like that. So down here you're able to drag this and you can basically remove that dead air. Drinking caffeine, you may have seen I got a blood clot in my shoulder. It's so cool (laughs) Seems like it did a pretty good job of seeing like where I'd kind of want those breaks to be. But now is where the really fun part comes in. This is kind of a boring video, I'm just sitting here talking. Let's spice it up with a little bit of stock footage. So here I wanna find a blood clot stock image. So let's go into video, and we're gonna search for blood clot. I don't even know if anything's gonna show up. Okay, this is actually perfect. It's downloading the media. It automatically has added it. In caffeine, you may have seen I got a blood clot at my shoulder. I'm talking about quitting caffeine. So let's do... Oh yeah, that's a good one. Little coffee, dude, this is great. I'm gonna have so much stock footage in all my videos. Now you guys are gonna be like, \"Wow, have you been going out shooting all day long \"to get all of this B-roll?\" Nope. As painful as that was, all of the needles and all of the surgeries and all of the things that I had to go through. Caffeine withdrawals, let's put something here. We also can add gifs, stickers. Let's do shock. Here we go. Oh my god, here you look so perfect (chuckles) Through caffeine withdrawals. Oh my god, it's so good. Now I'm gonna take out the background of this video. We're gonna do green screen. Obviously this isn't a green screen, but using AI it's able to obviously detect I am a person. I wanna remove everything except me. While the green screen is adding I'm gonna find a background. This looks good. I'm gonna add that to here. Now this clip is on top of our green screen clip so I'm gonna right click here and I'm going to send this to the back. Now this is gonna bring me to the front in my green screen glory. And I could also resize myself which we're gonna do. Like this is so easy, it's like hurting my mind. Something's wrong. Like I knew that I was addicted to caffeine, but I didn't realize how bad it was. You can also had sound effects. We can add music, we can do all sorts of things in here. So let's add a sound effect. (subtle music) Okay, yeah, that sounds great (laughs) Let's add that on right here. I knew that I was addicted to caffeine but I didn't realize how bad it was. We can also add music to the entire track. So we're gonna do music. Let's find a little song, shall we? Oh, that's nice. (upbeat music) And you'll notice I haven't really messed much in this timeline. But yes, you can also make edits and adjust things in the timeline as well. Return that audio down a little. No, but April 1st I-- Titles. I love titles. There's another cool thing here that you can do. You can obviously just add some text. There we go. About this on Twitter a little bit. So you can actually make your own templates but they have some intros, annotations, overlays, frames and audiograms, which we'll talk about in a second. So let's just use a little intro here already. Hey guys, it's Justine, and you may have seen me talking about this on Twitter a little bit. We're gonna add a little annotation. Follow me Instagram, TikTok. And I kind of want that to be a little longer so I can drag down here and that'll automatically adjust it up here with the slashes. Or wherever else that you follow me, Instagram, TikTok, I don't even know. Now, my video was shot in a studio so my audio is pretty decent. I am wearing a microphone but a lot of times when people are making videos they may just be shooting them on their computer. This gives you the ability to go in and add some audio effects to repair the audio and add studio sound. So this actually does make a pretty big difference. So I'm glad that they do have this available. Now, inside of the effects you could also change and adjust the color. Thankfully again, my color is pretty decent but if I wanted to adjust this, I can go into the color adjustments, adjust the exposure, contrast, I can adjust the highlights, shadows, add some saturation and adjust my color temperature. Don't judge that. It was just for the sake of showing you how it works. Something that I've been struggling with a lot as a creator is you have all of this content. Now how do we export that for various social platforms? So Descript can make it super simple to take chunks of this video and re-export it out for social media. So we've already got a couple little things edited. So I'm gonna take this whole section here, and I can click duplicate to new composition. So this is adding it to a whole new composition. Now I wanna make this vertical for TikTok. So we're gonna do portrait. So you can resize all of these clips. I'm gonna pop myself here. We're gonna add the doctor footage below. Surgeries and all of the things that I had to go through. Now we've got our video all formatted and something that I like to add on a lot of my social clips is captions, because a lot of vertical content is viewed without sound. So being able to add these captions not only helps people who are hard of hearing but it also helps those who don't have sound on, when you're probably scrolling in a place that you shouldn't like work. We're gonna go into shape, we're gonna click Waveform. You can change the style, put our lines here, and we're also gonna add some captions. So you know how you see those really great social media videos where they have the text that pops up automatically? Well, guess what? We can do that too. So we're gonna add the captions, and we're gonna have it set up so that it highlights the word that is being spoken. All the needles and all of the surgeries and all of the-- We're gonna have these captions actually be on this entire video. So we're just gonna drag that all out. Because that experience in the hospital as painful as that was on-- And that's it, we now have a really fun social media clip. It's vertical. We have little waveforms to show that there's actually some speaking and sound happening, and you can have the text at the bottom so you'll be able to read them instead of having to listen to it. Now, once you're done with your video, you can hit publish, this will give you a couple different options. So you can actually just export this video or you can hit publish. So you can publish this to a web link, to YouTube or a bunch of other various media platforms. So I'm just gonna export it, and we're gonna export this 4K. I want this to be in high quality. Let's export. This is the video that we just made. It's about quitting caffeine because that experience in the hospital-- Now showing how to shorten the word gaps manually, but you can also go in here and shorten word gaps automatically which is such a time saver. Sometimes you may want a little bit of pause in between your words. I don't like that. So I'm gonna apply this to all of them. It shortened 11 word gaps and that has saved me so much time in my video. So sometimes there are words that it doesn't get correct. So this is supposed to say Yerba Mate. There it is again. We're gonna need to correct that. So now I wanna add a little bit of VO here. So I'm going to write overdub this. We're gonna assign a voice, new voice. Justine, record your voice ID. Voice training has started. Okay, let's see what it sounds like. - [Justine Voiceover] Hello, I'm writing this in post. This is what it would sound like if I had to rerecord something and-- - That's my voice, but it's not my voice. I mean, it is my voice, but it's not. This is the future everyone. Can't hate on AI too much because if I don't have to go and get this whole setup and re-record all of this stuff, and I can just do this and it sounds that good, sign me up. Another thing that I really like are these audiograms. So basically, I did make this little template already for myself in the vertical format, but I can add a template here that's already made and I won't actually have to do anything. It'll automatically make it for me. So that was a look at Descript. I am so excited about this app, and I think it's so much fun, and I think it's gonna be a huge asset to a lot of video creators, podcasters, basically anyone that's creating content, because it gives you this whole other element and a way of editing that has not been there before. I would love to hear what you guys think of this. If you wanna check it out there is a link in the description.

    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome! This Is, yes I just stole Matt's intro because we have a very spicy topic for you today. Tim cook, our best friend is got something cooking for us. - Apple is getting into the console game! - Asterisk maybe because we have some patent filings that seem like they're highly sus. - So a couple weeks ago, Apple filed for a patent for multiple game controllers. - [Austin] Yeah a lot actually. - Which yeah, like several, several different ones. So what we've done is we looked at these patent filings and we have our good friend Preston who does a whole bunch of our thumbnails and whatnot across multiple channels of ours. We had him mock up what this might look like in real time. The first one up is like a Joy-Con style system which goes on the sides of either like an iPhone or an iPad. Now what's interesting about this is that the patent only shows a couple buttons, which is mainly just the directional button so couple thumb sticks and a couple deep pads. So what I take from that is that with this controller they would still very much rely on touch screen. - Oh absolutely, - For a bunch of these. - But I mean, one of the main things is if you played any kind of real games on a mobile device, one of the things that I always find lacking are the controls, and there are lots of different third party controllers. Razor makes them, Backbone, lots of other things you can like snap your phone into it, whatever and typically those actually work fairly well. The downside is they're pretty much always big and bulky and you have to kind of put the whole thing together. Knowing Apple they'd probably be magnetic, you just go like snap snap on the side of like your iPad or your iPhone or something. To me, it would make gaming on a mobile device much more useful. - [Matt] You know what's interesting about it is that it can be in either orientation for either landscape or vertical, which is kind of cool - [Austin] Snap on the side of an iPad, on the side of an iPhone. It does seem like it would be roughly the same height as an iPhone. That's one of the things that with the Joy-Con specifically really important the reason why we don't have a mega size or a smaller sized switch is because it has to be the exact same height for the rails. Otherwise you would lose Joy-Con compatibility. And looking at this patent filing it looks like it would be the same height as say probably like an iPhone, like 13 pro or something. Which means that by default it's gonna be really small, meaning that probably that's the reason why you only have just like a D-pad and a couple of buttons on the actual device. - Well like and if I'm looking at something like the backbone, which is what I consider to be like the Cadillac of the mobile controllers they're able to fit full buttons on there. - But to be fair, those are bigger, right? Like that's not like a little slim line Joy-Con that you would attach. So that's actually like a big, almost a case style- - But would you want something too small? - To me, the size is the most important thing. The main reason why I don't wanna play games in my phone is because I don't have any nice controller. The main reason I don't keep a nice controller with me is it's huge and if I can't fit in my pocket I'm probably not gonna carry it with me, right? If I'm gonna carry a big controller in my pocket I might as well carry an actual dedicated game console like an analog pocket or something, right? - Yeah. - But if there's Joy-Con things are tiny and easy to like maybe put on the back of like a magnetic case like Magsafe style or something like that I'm actually probably be a lot more inclined to actually carry them with me, especially because Apple continuously pushes things like Apple Arcade. The fact that there is an enormous pile of money made on all kinds of free to play and paid games that are on the iOS store. Like people are always saying like, \"Oh I can't wait for Apple to make a game console.\" They're making unbelievable amounts of cash on in-app purchases and games and whatnot. So I think there's a real advantage to Apple for them to lean into making that gaming experience better with I'm sure a very affordably priced new set of JoyCon style controllers they'll just go. (Austin's fingers snapping) - One of the other things that's gotten it going on is Apple recently won a patent to have a version of like a thumbstick controller- - [Austin] Which looks exactly like, if you look at the patent files specifically, it's like, I'm surprised they got away with this actually 'cause this looks like they just- - They won this patent. It shows that they are actively trying to research this. Now the last control they show in the patent is almost like a folio one. - That's super interesting because the folio, like I mean, I'm using one right now on the iPad, right? Something like that especially if it was built into the phone right? Where you can flip it open you have like some basic controls and then you just sort of like unfold it and just sit there and play some games. It's a cool concept, maybe more so for something like an iPad compared to an iPhone. But I am very excited that Apple are starting to put some real effort into fixing the physical controls on devices. I know I feel like I'm an old man here but like touchscreen controls just aren't as good. And I know a lot of kids have grown up playing Fortnite on I guess not an iPhone, but on like touchscreen devices and are incredibly good. And look, if you've got that skill all the more power to you, but for me having actual physical buttons that tactile response especially the sticks, it's very difficult for me to kind of get around that because I've gotten used to the superiors or sort of motion capture method. Now if you actually take a closer look, it looks like just a dual sense but if you zoom in it actually, they're talking about more about the actual specific design of the thumbsticks. One of the things Apple's done really well is integrate sound and haptics. If you play it played with the dual sense controller, one of the things that that controller does phenomenally is the motion sort of experience, right? It's not just like a rumble motor, all of those things make a huge difference to me, it's part of the reason why I think the dual sense is now clearly head and shoulders above the Xbox controller, - Oh yeah, absolutely. - And if they could start integrating that into something which was small, thin, lightweight and portable and very expensive, they could go onto your iOS device. I think that would make a ton of sense cause that seems like something that's right up Tim Cook's alley. - Here's what I think is gonna happen. - Okay. - The Apple TV. (Austin exclaims) You know what Apple has loved to do over the past couple years? Put an M1 chip in literally every one of their devices. So if they came out with an Apple TV with an M1 processor in that, that is a really powerful machine. It has the power to run a lot of triple-A games, like main modern triple-A games, probably not. If they kind of go the Nintendo switch route, of having some of like these older ported games... - They have kind of tried this when the Apple TV the sort of iOS or the TV OS version came out a few years ago they did pitch it as a device that could be for gaming. The thing though, that I think completely erected, was that all games I believe when that Apple TV first came out need to be compatible with the Siri remote which is a terrible remote and absolutely 0% useful for gaming right? So I think a lot of initial devs who maybe bought into the Apple TV gaming platform were like, \"Oh, this sucks.\" Now mind you, it now works with other controllers, I don't think you have to use it with the Siri remote. The other downside is that unlike every game console ever it doesn't ship with a controller. So for this to work, I think at a bare minimum before they even put an M1 or an M2 or anything in, they need to sell an Apple TV gaming edition that comes with a dual sense or one of these new fancy controllers. But it needs to have a controller in the box. - And in the box part is the only thing they're actually missing here because you can do all this right now. You can go and pair a dual sense, you can go and pair an Xbox control. - All Apple Arcade games work immediately with a controller? - So you have like, they have an ecosystem of games. And they have been very quietly, but steadily increasing the amount of decent indie games on Apple Arcade. One of the big titles that they just grabbed is Blooms, Blooms Tower Offense six. - Oh really? - That's a fairly large game for a subscription service to have grabbed. It's one of my favorite games, I'll be honest with you. Do I see Apple making a console that's gonna replace an Xbox or PlayStation? Absolutely not. But I do see this as a place to have like a very solid casual gamer experience. 'Cause like, I wanna remind you, Final Fantasy One through like nine are on the app store right now. - So there's so many games. - There's so many old PlayStation games like Square NX loves to put games on there. What Apple would need to do is work with the developers to actually standardize that. Because anything on Apple Arcade has to be able to be played on your phone, on your laptop or Apple TV. - Yep. - That is a requirement to get on there. I don't think there'd be like a crazy amount of work in order to get some of these other titles that are on that have been iOS for years at this point. In order to get those up to be able to work on like an Apple TV. - Well, and some of them do right now, right? Like I think most people just don't think- - But spot, if they work with some of these games that are on there, which are at, when they are released, triple-A titles, it's a cheap casual way to game. - So looking through, I actually have not checked out Apple Arcade in a while. They actually have a fair few fairly high quality looking games. That is SpongeBob game, they have 2K, they have Construction Simulator, they have Goat Simulator, which is apparently gonna be dropping here in a couple of days, but there's a fair few games that are on Apple Arcade. And just to remind you, this is a $5 month subscription or it comes bundled into Apple TV plus One. - Yeah so I have the, they changed the name, I think it's like Apple... It used to be Apple one and now I think it's like Apple, like I forget what it is, Apple... They changed it recently I don't know, but it's $30 a month and it includes pretty much all of their services. Considering you'd be spending like 10, 15 bucks on Apple music or Spotify anyway, that's not bad. - Here the thing is Apple right now sell an enormous amount of devices and they make billions and billions of dollars of profit with those devices. However, what they're starting to make more and more money on pretty much every quarter are the services. Getting you to subscribe to all of these different things, whether it's Apple TV plus, whether it's Arcade or whatever the case is. And to me, I think it makes an enormous amount of sense for Apple to focus on gaming as their next wave. Obviously you've got like the AR headset and all this kind of other stuff as far as what things are working on maybe like an Apple car or whatever, but the gaming part of this is already making them so much money. If they can invest in making the gaming experience better with something as simple as a controller, which I'm sure again they're gonna charge you big money for, but if it's a well designed, magnetically attached, tiny little easy to store controller attachment, I think it's gonna make a ton of cents and if they can maybe either make a version of that controller or a beefed up thing altogether that would work with the Apple TV. Those are two ways that I think without a ton of investment, a ton of time, for Apple to go from being a big player in the space to being an absolutely huge one where they're making a console and they're making the phone in your pocket, every bit and Nintendo Switch competitor. - I think the biggest hurdle that Apple's gonna have right now, is actually the software side and getting developers on board with this. They have to just throw money at developers right now in order to get them on board. - Much like Netflix is doing, check out that video if this is. - Right here. So imagine like Apple managed to get like Grand Theft Auto on like it just takes one game. This is where things kind of fell apart for them because iOS was the number one way that people were playing Fortnite. And then over the contract disputes and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and we saw how that like just kind of epically melted down. If they can get some developers on board to develop for M1, they can shove an M1 into literally every one of their devices, which is they're already doing. We already did a video on the iPhone 14 but let's say they had a M1 version of the iPhone 14 and then suddenly, (Austin exclaims) I know right? And then suddenly they have an M1 Apple TV and now you can play triple-A titles natively on every one of your devices. That would be huge. - And they're already doing it. I mean, even if they don't shove an M1 in a phone, which would be fair, I think firmly would be difficult. But the devices and the actual chips and stuff get more and more powerful every year. And again, it's easy to be like, \"Oh Apple to have some apps or whatever.\" They make billions of dollars a year on the gaming apps and free to play and all different things that are on the app store right now. Like this is already making them probably more money than a lot of more established gaming companies do. And it's just because they have the app store, right? For them to be able to invest a small fraction of that profit into making the gaming experience better for everyone on Apple devices, to me feels like an absolute no brainer. - And the reason I enjoy Apple Arcade so much right now is because the whole point of Apple Arcade is that there are no micro transactions, there's no ads in them. Now that I have a way to play Blooms without getting harassed for micro transactions then to unlock new new heroes and stuff like that, I'm gonna switch over to Apple Arcade version of it. If Apple can start dominating the mobile gaming space and make all their money through the app store that way I think they are poised to just skyrocket. - Well, you know what? That's a great point, right? I think a lot of people are upset at the idea in this sort of state of mobile gaming but if you think about it from the perspective of, yeah Apple is charge you five bucks a month but just like how game pass gives you an enormous amount of games for a fairly low monthly price. Apple's kind of doing the same thing and they're delivering games that are high quality. It almost feels like if you're a real gamer and you want to help support mobile gaming that is not full of nonsense. This is something that you should get behind but let us know what you think in the comments below. Let Matt know how you feel about his future balloons. (Matt making popping sounds) Subscribe Ring a ling and we will see you next time friends for Matt's Balloons adventures. (upbeat music)",

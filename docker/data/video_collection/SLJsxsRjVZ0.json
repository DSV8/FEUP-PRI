    "transcript": "these couple last passes let alone up know that you that puts up guys I'm Dimitri and we're going to our first meeting of the day these last couple days have been absolutely chill we're taking it easy this time around with the port the really strange part is that we only have two meetings today and normally we're like I have to sick bay yeah somebody on Twitter said that like this yes feels kind of eerie because there are no lineups for vents no lines from cabs it's true it's good the way but it's also it feels odd and there's nobody here nobody where all the people but first huge thanks to our sponsors Thermaltake Razer MSI Corsair and Phanteks for making CES as possible gigabyte there's on the same level of jail as us get some classical music in the background as we get some beer oh I'm gonna stop it so we don't get copyright strikes for this music so the hilarious part is that Hebrew has relocated all the RTX 2060's from gigabyte from you know this name where they were so he could for some reason arab this room and not use it ever explain yourself I'm gonna do that I'm gonna replace them I'll put them back in their order after this so the thing is we have lost Mike to a briefing so enjoy this b-roll sequence from gigabyte so eBrush shooting this tiny little thing and it is an RGB M de tu nvme SSD what have we come to what like come on I know so interesting fat guys this is essentially I asked him ok so how are you powering this and he said there's little connector on the SSD that plugs in and then it's not powered via it's basically powered by N ba n daa' - you know it's a heat saying for the SSD but it also has RGB that's hilarious it just needs Tory by the way what happened is I was a full master I was distracted by Dimitri almost said and I placed my finger literally underneath this portion and so I just tried to unmount or unscrew this port and this whole thing just slid down and I cut my hand so yeah all right people so inside this room Aorus has a really interesting monitor what they're calling ad27QD the specs on that thing are actually pretty insane for the price points of $5.99 we have HDR 400 basis specs so it's not too bright but HDR with DCI p3 at 95% Adobe RGB space which is impressive we have 144 Hertz we have 27 inches at qHD resolution really nice little encompassing spec and free sync not freezing to unfortunately just freezing so it is IPS and this Aorus tactical display is not all about specs because they're introducing a new software driver level OSD customization so not only you're gonna have to go in and fiddle around with a joystick to change all your settings for brightness and you know different gaming profiles maybe because all that is now built into the software driver which is awesome so you don't have to fiddle around there so from the software directly you can add your own crosshair you can actually draw it yourself as well little customization element you can add a timer if for spells for example so if you're doing a spell that resets in 90 seconds you can hit a macro key and it will show you that timer which is cool you can also add a counter for example they give us pubG if you see a drop in the distance you can add that and know how many drops have continued throughout the game you can change everything about the color the brightness the different gaming profiles directly from the software which is great so we have the brightness slider no longer you have to go in there and fiddle around with joystick which I find you know really good and the entire layout is pretty intuitive easy to navigate and all the customization is there now of course this would not be a gaming monitor without some RGB goodness so there are RGB illumination elements in the back that you can customize but you know more interesting kind of like feature about this or as tactical display is noise cancellation so it has an IC built in so you can plug in your headset directly into the monitor and you have different noise cancellation profiles for your microphone which is interesting so most motherboards do that already but if you're like the lower-end motherboard that has no software for your drivers and audio then this could be a really good way to utilize noise cancellation so that it will actually cancel out all the keyboard strokes if you have any music playing in the background we've listened to it and there is you know it is heavily compressed but can you choose the different profiles between high and low compression so it's a cool feature built in for a gaming panel that we have not seen yet in the past all right so that is the oars tactical gaming monitor let us know what you think and then $5.99 it sounds like a pretty damn good deal it sure is all right so this is an interesting revelation that every time we come to gigabyte at CES we normally try to come at lunch yes look at this I just want to get food in his belly oh no ahh the classical music we've been fed with more East and watered watermelon water by the way yes very very good all right guys let us know what you think about the things that you just saw with Aorus and yeah thanks for watching we'll see you next video it is by the way still completely empty check this out there goes Eva that goes now that was more eerie than the have a Lone Ranger than living the way here",

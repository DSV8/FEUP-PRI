    "transcript": "Hey how's it going, Dave2D here so this Is the Doogee Mix 2. It's a $200 smartphone And the company hit me a couple months ago, and they were like. Hey, do you want to check out our new phone. I went on the website the pictures looked good. The specification list looked awesome, we're looking at 6GB Of RAM, a big AMOLED screen, USB-C charging, Expandable storage, so on paper there's alot of good things going for it And it's built well, it's not going to win any awards or anything for design. But it is built well, and it feels solid. It's a little bit heavier and thicker than a lot of phones in that $200 price point, But i like the way it feels in your hand. Now they include a bunch of accessories Which I guess is the norm for inexpensive phones like this, you get A case, 2 screen protectors and a USB-C to headphone adaptor. Ok, let's talk about the actual usage of the phone The fingerprint sensor they have is not bad, It's pretty quick, obviously not the quickest one out there. But they also include a feature that gives you face unlock. And this face unlock is terrible, I don't know why it's so bad But even in ideal lighting conditions it would often fail. And we're talking 30% failure rate and I tried setting it up multiple times. So I wasn't expecting Face ID from the iPhone, I wasn't expecting that but I thought it should at least work, most of the time. But it doesn't, I wouldn't rely on that. I wouldn't buy this phone for face unlock features. Let's talk about the CPU, it's a reasonably fast processor, bumps out decent benchmarks. Now obviously it's slower than the big flagships out there. But the overall performance is good playing games Multitasking, it feels fast I mean the 6GB of RAM it's going to be nice, but i'm not super impressed Not that it's not good, it's just that there's so many cheap Phones right now that are just as fast as this so It doesn't really stick out as being an amazing performer or anything like that. But it's good. The screen is awesome. I'm really impressed by it, it's an AMOLED panel 5.99 inches so basically 6 inches, it's big It's bright it's colourful, it's one of the best if not the best Screen i've seen at the $200 price point, that being said I feel like I need to give some kind of disclaimer of warning. If you go on the website, the renders make it looks like this is a completely bezelless phone I mean look at this thing, what are they doing? They're using these white highlights or these reflections To disguise what the actual screen edge looks like, those images Are so heavily enhanced that when I got this Thing and I pulled it out of the box, I thought they sent me the wrong one, I was like This looks like nothing like what the images on the website looked like So be aware that it still is a decent looking phone but the renders Are lies. Okay, the battery life is good its a 4060 milliamp hour battery It's, bigger than a lot of other phones, but the battery life is just good, it's not amazing or anything and this thing does not support quick charging of any sorts So it's a full 3 hours, actually a little bit more to charge this thing up from zero to full which is a long time The speaker's on the bottom, its a mono speaker and it doesn't sound particularly good. And there's also no headphone jack. But there's 3 really big things about this phone that bug me a lot. The first one is the camera, I was expecting a pretty crappy camera, because its a $200 phone, and the Doogee mix 1 had a pretty bad camera. This one is, well it didn't disappoint. It's a bad camera. The Daylight photos are okay, you need to have a really steady hand though because there's no image stabilization but the lowlight photos are basically unusable. We saw stuff like this in the Doogee mix 1 And they haven't really changed all that much. The thing I find really weird is that there are two cameras on the back but the second one isn't used for telephoto, or monochrome or anything that I could find. I'm not even sure what the second camera is here for I hope tell that its not some kind of dummy camera. But regardless image quality is not good on either of the cameras in the front or the back. Well the front camera has a wide angle, which is kind of neat If you're into wide angle selfies, but again image quality is not great The other thing that really bugs me about this thing, is call quality and that's something that's pretty important for any kind of phone it's just.. not good call quality. Just bad speaker quality bad speaker volume, it's not great. but the thing that kills me the most about this phone, is the Wi-Fi signal. So it doesn't matter how good everything else on the phone is if it doesn't have a good Wi-Fi connection, it's just crap. Because i think a lot of people at this price point are using Wi-Fi connection on these phones. And, it is bad. You need to be right beside the router to build to get any kind of solid signal. If i'm like 15 - 20 feet away from my router i'm already starting to see signal loss, and that's just bad regardless of the price point of this phone. So, here's the deal, This phone, has one really impressive feature it's the screen, it's a really really nice looking screen and that's all you care about, then... sure, go for this. But i think for most people, there's better way to spend $200 on a phone. Okay, hope you guys enjoy this video. Thumbs if you like it, subs if you guys love it, see you guys next time. You know what? I'll put some suggestion for other phones that i've tested out. I did reviews for them, but other phones that i've tested out, in this price range i think are a better pickup. Okay, i'll link those below.",

    "transcript": "(gentle rhythmic music) - This is not \"Mystery Tech,\" this is \"Real Life Mystery Tech.\" Do you see how much \"Real Life Mystery Tech\" is in here? Not only are we taking a look at how you can 3D print food and use X-rays to see inside of tech, but we also have a look at Google's multibillion-dollar quantum computer campus. And of course, all of this is thanks to our friends over at Toyota for loaning us the RAV4 Prime to check out all of this amazing new \"Real Life Mystery Tech.\" See, it's not regular \"Mystery Tech,\" it's in the real world. So, what I'm about to see is something that's kind of hard to describe. This is the world's first quantum data center that Google built here in Santa Barbara, California. So, I mean, I'm looking around- - We're surrounded by quantum computers. - Oh yeah, so are these actual like actively running, like this is actually a real setup? - [Erik] Yes. - To wrap your head around the potential of a quantum computer, a couple of years ago, Google published a paper where they were able to solve a complex math problem in about 200 seconds. By that same token, the estimate was if that was running on a \"classical\" supercomputer, that would be something like 10,000 years. Some recent advancements, even in just the last month or so, have gotten the classical computers a whole lot closer. But, the potential of a quantum computer is impossible to understate. The potential is just not there yet though. - Classical computers fundamentally, single bits, right? They can be either zero or one, and you can build up great classical logic with that. Quantum computers, you have quantum bits, or qubits. And these qubits, in some cases, what we do here at Google is we actually fabricate those atoms out of superconducting metals. - These atoms, once they're provided with an electrical charge, have a massive amount of states between just the traditional ones and zeros that a classical computer works with. Which means that for certain types of problems, they're uniquely well-suited to really sort of emulate the way that the real world works. If I hold a plant in my hand and let it go, just the amount of calculations that would need to be done to correctly simulate the way that exactly it's gonna fall, it's gonna interact with the natural environment, is very different than the way that a classical computer works. The computers that we have today are very good at certain things. But, emulating the real world, emulating the way that nature works, this is all based (laughing gently) on the way that quantum physics work. What's really crazy about all of this to me is that these chips which are being designed here are running at almost absolute zero. The actual operating temperatures we have at the base plate where the quantum processor's actually mounted is 10 millikelvin. So, let's figure out a little bit of what that even means, right? So, we're enjoying 300 kelvin here right now. Very nice, right? If we go down to like 273 kelvin, water freezes, okay? Now, we go to like 77 kelvin, that's when nitrogen becomes a liquid. Maybe you've had like liquid nitrogen ice cream, okay? You go to four kelvin, four kelvin is when helium becomes... The gas typically becomes a liquid, right? That's typically the temperature of outer space. Like, if you were hanging out and you weren't in direct view of the sun, about four kelvin. - [Austin] Okay. - [Erik] So, we get a couple orders of magnitude colder than that inside of these systems here. - I don't think we're gonna see quantum computers in your desktop in the next 10 years, right? But, just like the mainframes of the 50s and 60s were eventually shrunk down and developed to the point where they're in everyone's pockets for $100 in a smartphone, I too think that quantum computers have an enormous amount of potential. (bright rhythmic music) This, my friends, is a Toyota RAV4 Prime, which Toyota's very graciously loaned to me for the week so I can go and take a look at some of the cool tech in \"Real Life Mystery Tech.\" Let's take it for a spin, shall we? Can I get in the car? I walked the wrong direction. Let's take it for a spin, shall we? So, stepping inside the RAV4 Prime, you're gonna find basically everything you could really want. So, not only do I have heated and cooled seats and a heads-up display, there's also the nine-inch Toyota audio multimedia screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility and a digital rearview mirror. Oh, and I've got room for everybody in the back too, and all our gear, which is probably gonna be important to this one. It's easy to forget that Toyota pretty much pioneered electrified vehicles and has put more than 20,000,000 electrified vehicles on the road, more than all other automakers combined. The other advantage to the RAV4 Prime is performance. Because you have both a gasoline engine and an electric motor working combined together, this thing is properly quick. (engine revving rapidly) Next up, let's take a look at Creative Electron, the people who do some of the coolest stuff with X-rays I've ever seen. But while we're inside, what a lovely opportunity to take advantage of some charging for the RAV4 Prime. You can easily charge this battery by plugging its included charging cable into a standard electrical outlet too, which is a great option for those with short commutes, but also works really well for road trips since you can switch to traditional gas. Now, why don't we go inside and take a look to see exactly what Creative Electron are all about? What you're looking at here are X-ray wizards at work. They make machines specifically designed to give you a non-destructive look inside almost anything you can think of. For some reason, Creative Electron trust me to actually run an X-ray machine. (laughing nervously) Bold move, but we'll see it goes. Goodbye, Z Flip, nice knowing you, I'm about to find out what's on the inside. Closing it up. Activate X-ray. Oh, whoa! Whoa! - [Creative Electron Employee] You actually placed it perfectly in the center. (laughing amusingly) - I mean, I knew exactly where I was gonna put it. So, this is the hinge. What we can see here is that that hinge is actually very, very large. And also, you can see some of the batteries too because there's a battery on the top and a much bigger battery at the bottom. No one's in a rush, right? I wanna spend a few minutes. Okay. Look how dense the layers of the PCB are, and all of the individual little chips, and all of the individual components you need. So, now that the expert is running the machine... Whoa! (laughing impressively) - It's kind of a cool view. - That is so cool! - Realistically, what this is doing is we're just tracking density with height now instead of black and white. - [Austin] Uh-huh. - About like where these frame rails are and these springs and everything. - I just wanna X-ray stuff all day now. What Creative Electron do is incredibly cool. But, after we ran about every piece of tech we brought with us through the X-ray, the next stop on our tour was to see exactly how they build these machines in-house. Alright, walk me through. So, this is what a unit looks like as it's being built, right? - Correct, correct. This is a system that's gonna be used for \"armor plate\" inspection. We're gonna have a robotic-actuator here that's gonna come pick up the plates, it's gonna set them in between these two laser sensors here to do thickness measurement to make sure that it's uniform thickness across. This will be the one and only of these that's in existence. The first time doing integration of this sort. - How long does something like this take to build? - From start to finish, a few months. - You guys are wild, you guys are wild. So, this next machine is a little bit meant for Ecommerce, essentially? - Correct, correct. So, the idea here is this is a high-volume, high-throughput type of system. - It's almost constantly running, basically. - Absolutely. You load that conveyor belt full of packages. So, you'll have an operator here kind of running the system. - Uh-huh. - It'll pop up and allow you to choose \"pass\" or \"fail,\" depending on whatever that product type might be at the time, and then automatically turn the conveyors back on and send it out for a another operator downstream to be able to sort good and bad product. - If you're a big Ecommerce company, and you're processing millions of dollars of returns a day, something like this is gonna make sense almost immediately. Normally, when I get a suspicious package from Wish, I just open it and inevitably get scammed. But, Ecommerce companies have to be smarter. Even if a package weighs the amount that it is supposed to when it comes back as a return, using this, you can see if there's something a little bit more nefarious inside. What's the deal with... I'm supposed to X-ray a box? Is there a secret in the box? I gotta find out? - [Production] You have to find out. - Alright. (laughing amusingly) What, what is this, is this sand? Inside, we have... (laughing amusingly) Next up, we're heading to something which legitimately blew my mind. Sugar Lab are a company that 3D print food. Yes, you heard me right. They are printing food. It's pretty good too. So, I am here with Kyle, and we're gonna take a closer look at what Sugar Lab is all about. So tell me, first and foremost, how did you come up with this, like where did this all begin? - Yeah, so I was a graduate student in architecture, and I was fascinated by rapid prototyping. And so, instead of building houses for my thesis and focusing on that, I focused on 3D printing, and especially digital design and how digital design would influence rapid prototyping and 3D printing. A kind of 3D printing that I became really fascinated with was binder over powder. So, that's when you spread really thin layers of powder, and you add water at each layer, and that bonds the new layer to the previous layer. And the really cool thing about powder printing is it's pretty easy to add color into the system, and add color at every- - You just add color to the powder. - Exactly. Well, you could color the powder, or in our case, you can actually color the liquid binder that gets jetted onto the surface. And if you do that, you have control over color at every pixel across the surface of the object. And I saw other 3D printed food products and projects at the time, but I was really surprised that they didn't incorporate color and that they weren't very precise. And I thought, \"This kind of technology, this 3D printing engine, could really be the system that makes the most beautiful, complex, tasty, incredible, 3D printed food.\" - So, Will, walk me through what you have here. So, this is the software to actually 3D model and print? - So, as you can see, this is our chocolate covered strawberry. You can see all the little seeds that we have in there. - So, each of these is an individual layer that the printer would slice in to print down? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, we made it like the size of a bonbon, it's like a bite size. So, once we have the model prepped and ready, we can put it into our software here and it shows all the color. When you bake a full rack of cookies, this is pretty much the same. You can bake all that at once, we can print all this at once. - Alright, we gotta go look. Can we go take a look and actually see this printer in action? - Yeah, yeah, let's go to the kitchen. - Awesome. So now, we are finally in the kitchen with Chef Victoria. So, these are the actual 3D printing machines. - Yes, they are, absolutely. You're looking at it in all of it's glory. So basically, I'm gonna fill this side here. I make sure according to my print here that I have just the right amount of sugar. - Oh, I see. - And then, level it out, and then we're good to go. So, there's 280 cans, 1,500 layers. So, each time it passes over, it is a layer. So, the very first thing we do is take out these two little bars at the edge. These guys basically just prevent any excess ink from going where we don't want it. So, those guys get pulled out, and then you can see these guys are revealed. We give them a nice little tap and there they are. Would you like to try? - I will try, alright. - So all you gotta do is find one, give it a little tap, and flip it over. - So, like that? - Yeah, there you go, perfect. - They're certainly a lot kind of firmer than I thought. - Yeah, exactly. - You'd think something with sugar, it would be like really thin and brittle or something, but it feels fairly solid. - Exactly. - So, how long did it take to print this batch? - So this particular batch, because it was a full bed, it took about nine hours. - Oh, that's still pretty fast though for printing. - It's not bad. For 280 pieces that you definitely couldn't make by hand, nine hours is is not bad at all. - So, I'm about to attempt to use the compressed air to depowder. Do you have... Can I just apologize in advance for making a mess of your kitchen? - Absolutely, you're forgiven already. - Oh, that's a lotta air. (air blowing rapidly) Wow, that really brings the color in. Look at that! Did I get a passing grade? - Beautiful. It does, absolutely. - Alright, I'm gonna do the full one. - Alright. - Ready? Oh! (everyone laughing amusingly) I got scared! I'll maybe leave the kitchen to you. I feel like I'm not respo... I don't know what I'm doing. - You're fired, get out. (laughing playfully) - Is there anything I can actually test? 'Cause I've been staring at a lot of delicious looking food all day. - Oh my gosh, absolutely. I am going to have you try our strawberry, which is a tamarind/elder flower strawberry in a ginger shell. So, gimme one sec. - That's wild. And at the office, we got to see the 3D model of this, and I saw a ton detail. I'm like, \"Oh cool, that's awesome.\" But, to actually see it in person, that detail really is there. - It really shows. - It's incredible the fidelity of what you've got here. - Oh my gosh, yeah. (gentle rhythmic music) - Whoo! - Beautiful. Alright. - Just dive in? - Dive in. - You made this one, so there's pressure here. - No pressure at all. - Oh. I wasn't expecting the texture. - Yeah. - Especially, it's nowhere near as hard as I would've assumed it is. Oh. - Yeah. It's got just a little bit of crunch, but otherwise, it kind of melts in your mouth. - I was about to say, that is delicious. - Thank you very much. (laughing happily) (laughing happily)",

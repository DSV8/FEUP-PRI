    "transcript": "- Oh, well, it's about time. I was about to leave. I'll take the dry aged tech news, medium rare, hold the caprese. I tell you, this neighborhood is going to (beeps). It's been about two years since the RTX 30 series launched. And even though many of us haven't been able to get our hands on one, you can't stop progress. It now appears that the RTX 40 series will be released earlier than expected. I've tried to stop a GPU release before, did not go well, straight to jail. Well known leaker Kopite7kimi has indicated we'll be getting the new generation of GPU's in either July or August of this year. Kopite said in a separate tweet that the RTX 4090 will be twice as fast, as the 3090, and that we should expect products further down the product stack coming with significantly boosted amounts of VRAM. - [James] That's what you like to see. - That's what James, you love VRAM. - [James] Stop replying to my heckles. - In recent years, Nvidia has waited until September to make their new GPUs available. Hopefully, this means, production is ahead of schedule. Although, you know who else said their new GPUs were coming this summer, - [James] Elon, sorry. - The other, Intel. And I still haven't seen one of their GPU's. Over to CPU land now where it's looking like AMD's upcoming Zen 4 architecture is going to be a significant improvement over Zen 3, not just the incremental boost that we've become accustomed to with each new CPU generation. - [James] Can be huge. - It's gonna be big. Big moves, leaks say a Zen four chip believed to be the Ryzen 7000X, indicate that its single threaded performance could be up as much as 37% compared to the 5,800X, thanks to a combination of higher clock speeds of up to 5.2 gigahertz and more instructions per clock, while we shouldn't be expecting more cores, many applications are still affected more by single threaded performance. So it's not surprising to see team red focus more on that, instead, especially since they've already proved they can put a lot of cores in. It's like those clown cars with like 30 clowns inside. Digital only consoles without an optical driver becoming more popular. But what if you got a big library of games on disk that you wanna keep playing without giving them their own room in your house? They're not your teenager. Microsoft might just have a plan to help you out as they filed a patent to allow gamers to verify ownership of a physical game and then be granted a digital license. - [James] (laughs) It's happening. - Considering their own Xbox series S is a digital only console. This solution could be a heck of a lot better than forcing gamers to buy the same title twice if it comes to fruition. - [James] But do I still own it? - Google does (chuckles). There's no word yet on what equipment a user would need to go through the verification process. Like do you need to prove that you're a real gamer? How would you do that? Describe a game, it's angry birds, different shirt time. Now it's time for quick bits brought to you by Pulseway, the platform that gives you the power to remotely manage all the devices in your network with just your voice. It's more powerful than you think, use your diaphragm. We're talking central control of all your desktop servers and network devices through pulseway's intuitive and easy interface on both desktop and through the mobile app, which now has support for, voice commands. You can run a script, remotely, connect to a system reset a password, build an automation workflow and more. So what are you waiting for? Try pulseway for free and secure a free year of service when you sign up for a multi-year plan using the link below. Quick bits will sometimes come to you in the night, do not open your eyes, no matter what you hear. Cause on my voice... Do you like your graphics cards in brown and beige? Great news, Noctua and Asus are making another one this time, it's an RTX 3080, previously, the 3070 was the only card to come in a Noctua edition, but due to crazy demand Asus decided to partner with the Austrian based cooler manufacturer. Once again, - Austrian based? - Austrian, Austrian based? - Austria based. - Austria based, and they're Austrian. Look out for its launch sometime this month and turn all your lights off when it arrives. It does not like bright colors. It will freak out. If your graphics card can push 480 frames per second, you're in luck as LG and AUO optronics are reportedly working-- - [James] The O stands for optronics. AU, AU. They're reportedly working on displays that can support 480 Hertz for both desktops, and laptops. The company showed off demos of the displays this week, although they're still very much prototypes. So don't expect to see these on shelves anytime soon. I don't even know why you'd want for in 80 frames per second, makes 'em so much harder to count. Uber is expanding its offerings to include more options for folks who don't just wanna get from A to B, users can now rent a party bus, through its new Uber charter service and selecsivities. That's what I call them. - [James] Selectivities. - Along with slightly more boring, regular buses and vans. Uber is also rolling out a feature called Uber travel which hooks into your Gmail to schedule rides to places like hotels, airports, and restaurants, where you have reservations, pretty convenient, but you also have to be cool with letting Uber catch a ride through your inbox. There are some sites to see. - [James] I just want an Uber driver who's a great conversationalist. - He will be 'cause he's read all your email. Batteries are expensive. So how about powering your gadgets with, algae? Researchers at Cambridge have been using a device containing blue-green algae, to power an arm cortex M0 plus CPU core with nothing more than ambient light and water for over a year, in the future, this could be a viable alternative to batteries in low power IOT devices. As long as you don't drop them, doing an algae carpet thing, squishy. And you can finally catch a glimpse of the super massive black hole at the center of our own Milky way galaxy. Astronomers released a composite image from the event horizon telescope of the black hole, dubbed Sagittarius A-star and the bright ring of accreted material surrounding it, was that right, James? - [James] It was a black hole, an A-star. I'm getting a lot of butt hole vibes here. - It should be a B hole at least. Although it just looks like a blurry photo of an onion ring at first glance, scientists can compare the image's data to a 2019 image of a different black hole, at the center of another galaxy, to gain insight into the fundamentals of how our universe works. - [James] It's an onion ring. - It's just all onion rings. It's onion rings all the way down. And it's time for you to learn that this episode is over. Come back on Wednesday for more tech news or sooner. I'm not making any promises, but I am doing one of these.",

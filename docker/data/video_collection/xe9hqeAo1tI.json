    "transcript": "Okay We need to talk Me, you, you, me, Jack I started a challenge ambitiously.. .. a few days ago \" Giving up my smartphone challenge \" and the challenge was only seven days A week long, that's how long the challenge was.. ... is But I'm quitting I'm quitting the challenge I can't ! I've realized how much a smartphone has become an extension of your mind and how you really do feel lacking, inadequate ! without having access to that thing Not that I know that already but, like to actually do it there's this overwhelming fear. To this point right now, this moment right now I have been using this \" intentionally dumb phone \" instead of my smartphone. And the first couple days I'll tell you Sunshine and lollipops ! Rainbows and.. Here I am standing in the line at Subway and I'm paying attention to what's going on around me and I'm not on my phone the whole time. When I wake up in the morning I'm not grabbing my phone and laying in bed with my neck cranked up against the headboard for 48 minutes when I have other things to do. But there was still this nagging feeling It's the way we are now man It's the way we are And it truly is an extension of our consciousness whether we like it or not and that little drift that you get every time you engage with it and all those e-mails that you can't see and all that information and data that's flowing that is so hard to turn off So I'm quitting this dumb phone challenge I'm not saying it was a bad idea How can i get behind something and successfully complete something that I know so obviously part way through is simply not gonna stick The rest of universe is moving along! I mean, you're getting text messages and you're getting, even on here with the text I'm like \"What am I doing I am not resp...\" What am i doing I was getting texted links What good is a link without a browser but I'm on the fringe to begin with in what i do for a living I'm engaging and interacting with the latest and greatest stuff I'm on social media This entire business this sculpt The reason you see me and i see you is social media it's embedded in this relationship Does a phone like this have a place Yeah I think so Like i said there were those glimpses those moments where... I was happy to have my time back and where I I realized that i was watching things around me instead of a screen yeah That..That stuff did happen that promise is real Maybe this is a device that you could take with you on vacation take with you to special events where you don't want to be absorbed by your smartphone and i think it is probably a good idea to unplug whenever possible and this entire speech sounds really intense and maybe it is but we have ventured into a realm an unexpected connection that we now have to this... This virtual space and for better for worst that's the direction we continue to move so the stuff that this technology has enabled for me on a personal level on a business level that would otherwise be unapproachable if it weren't for devices like that not just in front of me but in your pockets too and when you take a moment like this to run what happened to be a shorter term experiment that i originally wanted you really start to appreciate those opportunities so I quit this dumb phone challenge and I'll be putting my SIM card... back into my Nexus 6P Love you guys",

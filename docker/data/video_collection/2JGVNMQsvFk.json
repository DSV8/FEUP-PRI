    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and I am so excited to have you guys here in my kitchen with me. And today, I'll back up a little so I'm not too close and in your face, because this is a 180 video. It's also in 3D. So, if you have a headset, go grab one, put it on. I won't wait, but you can restart the video. This is going to be super fun, because today I'm going to make you pancakes. The pancakes that we're going to make today are very special because they're 3D pancakes. Have you ever seen somebody make pancakes in 3D? I don't think you have, but today you will. So, we're going to be using this. This is shake and pour. So let me get my ingredients ready. Which is just water. It couldn't be any easier. I put some water in here and I dump it on the pan. ` First up we have our Bisquick shake and pour. Now, we shake and we pour, but first we have to add some water. So, the first step is to add one and a half cups of cool water to container. (cabinets opening) One and a half. I need a measuring cup. Oh, look here's my phone. So, this is a dry measuring cup, but I clearly- doesn't really matter to me. Cool water. Do you think I'm going to spill this? (water spilling) Oh shoot I did. So, how much water did I spill? (intense music) Like that much? Oh, I made such a mess. Goodness. Time to shake. Turn bottle upside down, tap lid, shake container 30 seconds. (taps on the lid and shakes container) Something hit the camera. You know what's crazy about a 180 video is normally I can hide all of the things around here. But over here, this is all the stuff that you normally wouldn't see, because this where I actually usually have my camera. Oh god no! That was an accident. Okay, let's get this thing all turned on and ready for baking. Grilling? (liquid sloshing) 30 seconds. I think I've probably shook this for about 30 minutes at this point, but now I need to get something to spray the pan. This things bulging. Look at that. You guys can really see this in 3D. I know you guys are super close right now, but I wanted you to really feel like you're a pancake. Who's a pancake? Me and you. Ready for the spray. (cooking spray spraying) I'm spraying a lot just because I want to make sure this is real greased up. God, I want to spray you guys so bad, but that's not a good idea. All right. (pancake batter slams onto floor) Oh my god! (Justine laughing in a panic) That was absolutely, I did not mean to do that. (Justine laughing) (quirky music) Oh my god. You guys are going to think that I planned this for the video, but I said no, I will not make a mess, because I don't want to clean it up. (Justine laughing) oh no. Oh god. Okay, well there's still enough in here to make a pancake. So I guess we'll just, just leave that there for the time being. I cannot believe it. Oh my gosh. Here we go. I wonder if this is hot enough. How big of a pancake should I make it? Matty, mommy made a mess. Matty, come here. Uh-oh. That's going to be a square. (quirky music) Should I make one more? All right. I guess I'll put another one here. (quirky music) who needs half the batter on the floor? (quirky music) These are getting crispy I think. Oh my goodness. I need a spatula. Oh, my phone. Need a bigger spatula. Oh yeah, look at that. Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. Okay, spatula time. Are they ready? They're bubbling. Okay, so you guys, I like to flip spatulas a lot. Oh my god. Okay, I'm just going to flip the freaking pancake, because at this point I'm going to completely destroy my kitchen. That's a perfect pancake! Have you guys ever seen anything more perfect? Oh my goodness. These are so perfect. Look at this color. The consistency. Maybe the secret is you have to spill half of it on the floor. (quirky music) It smells so good. I should probably get some plates ready. Oh, we also have to heat up some syrup. Maple syrup. Gosh this is probably expired. I haven't used syrup in 14 years. Looks Canadian to me. Let's heat this up a little. Like 15 seconds. Let's do another flip here. (drops spatula) Oh god, okay. Okay that's not ready yet. Maybe I need to turn up the heat a little. No, I don't. I should just leave this be. I should just leave this be. (microwave beeps) Hot maple syrup. How do I know when they're done? Matty, look what I did. I made a pancake mess. What did I do? I know. It's pretty disappointing. Let's check out these pancakes and see how they're cooking up. It's looking pretty good. I think these are almost ready. Oh no! Who? I think this is backwards. I probably should have this facing me. Okay, I think one's ready to be plated. Plate number two. Yeah. And, oh come on now. Cool. Time to eat. I need to get myself a chair so I can sit down and really enjoy these. Oh, I need a fork. You know what I also need? (pantry opening) (pantry closing) In case I want to cut them up. Oops, forgot the fork. But let's be real. I guess I really don't even need a fork. Let's just dunk this. Oh, look at that. Look at that maple syrup goodness. (piano music) Oh my gosh. Why do I not open a brunch restaurant immediately? This is really good. (piano music) You guys want some? Here you go. Eat up! I'm going to go eat this in the privacy of my own off camera.",

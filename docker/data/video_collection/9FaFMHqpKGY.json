    "transcript": "- I'm so excited. I'm soaking wet here, ladies and gentlemen. I'm out in the rain. What were you thinking of? Earlier today, I spent all my money and not on some kind of dumb influencer, flex garbage. But on a testing lab that is going to completely change the way that we test computer hardware, consumer electronics, and pretty much any other technological do dad that you can think of. - Did you bring the keys? - I didn't. Thankfully the cavalry just arrived. - Okay. We got keys. - Yvonne's here. We're ready to show you guys. The inside of lab two where we are going to have a team of over 10 testing engineers. - You know, the writers are moving in here too, right? There's gonna be like 25 people immediately. - And there's gonna be our sponsor, Cause we got to pay for this thing. - Zoho Marketing Plus. Manage execute and collaborate on your next campaign with a unified marketing platform designed to keep customer and marketing data all on one screen. So try out Zoho marketing plus today using the link down below. - Welcome everyone. This is gonna be the entry lobby. One of the staff kitchens. And then I. - I think it's actually going to be the staff kitchen cuz James wants to put writers on the other one. - Really? - Well, we haven't decided yet, but the room that was labeled lunch room on the floor plan, I actually think would be better for desks. - So we're gonna have a second lounge. - Yeah, I'm thinking more like maybe two dining room tables and maybe a foosball or something. - I got the quote for changing all the interior lighting out. Do you wanna know how much it was? 20,000. Just for the office space. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if that's happening anytime soon. - But these fluorescence. - Okay. Who takes their paper towel dispenser? - Oh are you serious? - Yeah. What happened? - Really? You guys, at least they left the toilet paper dispenser. Thanks guys. - This room feels like it's two big for activities. - Wait. There's a shower in here. What is this room? - I don't know, but they used it for storage. - That's for killin. - But why is there a shower in here? The toilet's here and the shower's in a completely - Can this be the server room? There's water cooling. - [Linus] Oh my gosh. Hey James. I found your office. Aye. - Right now our networking and hold on that's the wrong door. Right now our networking and server is in one room, but I think it might be in two places in this building with this being the networking closet. - Yeah. Unfortunately there is absolutely no cooling whatsoever. Oh my God. There's no light in here even. This is all Cat 5e. Super cheap. It might not even be a problem. This might just turn into a regular closet and we just rip all of this out. I think in the long term. - Seriously. - I do intend to put writers in here. Probably Riley, tech link squad and Jonathan, Mac address squad. The only problem is those doors right there. They don't block nothing for sound. - How's it going? How's this blocking for the noise? Is it doing? - It's not bad. I thought it was gonna be a lot worse than it is. - I mean, I can also clearly hear what you're saying from out here. - I know. I know. - The next question is if this is the server room, does that mean that this is gonna be closed and soundproof and no one will walk through? - Yes, we are going to put soundproofing in. - Crap. Can I open that again after that closed? - Oh James. - What about the fact that the networking is in the middle of the floor here? It kind of pigeonholes you in terms of where you can put desks. - Okay. Um. Well, that's interesting. There's also some networking here and Oh, and up there. - Look up in the sky. - I don't know what this video is guys. It's half management team meeting about how we're gonna use the space. Half tour. - Half getting locked out of your own room. If you wanted to see the server room, this way. - And then we'll see the we're not gonna have lunch anymore because James canceled lunch room. - You tell me if you wanna have lunch in this room. - I thought that little kitchen area was actually in this space but - No, it's not. - The fact that it's separated like that I think that's fine to have off this be office space. - And this sad little room, no one is going to have lunch in here. No matter what you call this room. And we used to have a dark lunch room in the other building that no one really used. - Okay. So now you're gonna make it their permanent desk space. - That that's why I'm asking for a coat of paint. - What's interesting is that over here, they've got outlets top and bottom. So it seems like for the original owner, this might have been set up as some kind of a workshop space. - Wait is this plumbing? Maybe this was a counter. Look at the edge on the wall. - This is plumbing. Yes. Maybe they did have a kitchenette in here. That's actually a sharp observation. Sherlock. - Just look with your eyes. - Why do they have power and not one but two network ports in this corner. What am I doing here? And then again, around this corner. I feel like I'm in iJustine's house. Oh, now one of the most exciting things about this building is power. This is just one of many sub panels. And we're gonna take you and show you the big fat power that we've got upstairs. Which ones are they? Let's find out what they had there. It's a portable heater and a water cooler plug. Wait 32 and 34, \"our server room.\" So is that server room? Like what was the intended usage of this? Wait, did they? - I don't understand. - Did they take their doorknobs? - The deal's done baby. - When we did our original walkthrough, they did have doorknobs, right? - Uh yeah. They had door knobs. - I'm not crazy? - No. Well... - The good thing about this room is there's HVAC already in here. It's already kind of privacy frosted and we are directly below where the main power comes into the building. Any additional power we needed to run here. Bob's uncle. No problem. - Is this gonna be quite enough if there's offices on either side of it? - I already talked to Jake about it and he is like, your solution was actually very good. We're gonna take shred it up denim. We're gonna staple it to the wall and it's gonna be as good as it was at the old place. - [James] What about the ceiling? - Oh. - [James] Does that wall go all the way? - I do think this one stops here because if you look the ceiling tiles, keep going on that side. So I think this one does go all the way up then this one doesn't. - I mean we could find out. oh, was Yvonne right? Oh, Yvonne nailed it. I've gotten completely disorientated. I was gonna say, I call this room the aquarium, but actually I'm out in the warehouse. We're not ready to show you that yet. Do not dump mop water in here! And this is what I call the aquarium. Where are all the bloody light switches in this place? - It's because you came in the wrong side. They're very intuitive actually. - [James] Clearly we need motion sensors. - The thing I like best about this room is that you don't just feel like you're being watched. You feel like you're being watched from all sides. My plan for this is I would actually like to have the development team in here. Including Luke and Gary, who's gonna be the lab's lead. So these guys are gonna be essentially at the very center, the heart of the building. - The tip of the spear. - Looking out over the entire testing lab and then with quick access to the stairwell up so that they can talk to the LTT writers and quick access through there to the rest of the writing team. I want them serving as the beating heart of the lab. - I have one thing. I envision this as the main thoroughfare for people who are over there who want to eat lunch over there. Is that gonna be okay for these people working in the fishbowl? There's also a bathroom over here and some lucky person gets to sit near it. - Yeah. There was a sign on this bathroom door before that said no pooping. - They took the towel dispenser from in here too. - Seriously? - Yeah. - What the heck guys? Oh my gosh. These light fixtures are horrible. - Well, $20,000. - Where are you supposed to find a bulb for this? - [James] I like the mood lighting. They should keep that one. But only if pooping is allow. - I noticed ceiling tiles were missing and there ceiling tiles that have stains. - Yeah. Random holes punched them. - kind of looks like a pig style right now. On that note, it's raining pretty heavily today and this stain actually looks new. - Yeah, it does. - Nope. It's dry. - [James] There's another one behind you Yvonne. - Oh yeah. They were supposed to replace all of these before we moved. - Have we retained anything? - No. I'm going to let the lawyer know. Honestly, with these deals, sometimes it just is what it is. The amount of time the lawyer spend doing that versus us just replacing ceiling tiles. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see how many things we find. - But at least I have this great Adidas wall art. - We should get people in the office to pose and we'll just put them up. - Oh. I love it. - Chop their faces over. - Yeah. Just put faces on them. - I love how girthy this stairway is. This is gonna be super handy. - This is a good stairway. This is gonna be the writer's area for LTT. We asked the writers, what would you prefer? Open floor plan? Cubicles? Offices? and nearly unanimously they said we'd like to have offices. Well that was never gonna happen. In fact, I think we're moving over exactly what we have to this place and setting up basically the same stuff the same way, because we just spent all our money. - But it's still gonna be a big improvement because now most of the writers are gonna have their own window. - Yes. - In their station. And most importantly, I am gonna have a line of sight from my desk to your office. - Okay. You know, you have no networking. Right? - I don't care. I use wifi. - That's fine. You don't do any real work anyway. - That's exactly right. - You know, what's really funny though, is create a warehouse. Everyone asked to be by the windows and then the minute they moved in, they all asked for window blinds. - What there isn't out there, is a good amount of parking. If you guys have been paying close attention, you probably already saw enough space for like 50, 60 people. We have a grand total of, I believe it's about 25 parking stalls. We're gonna have to get pretty creative about packing in the number of people that we're gonna want working. - Well, there is street parking. - Yeah. - I think it should be fine. - There's also not as much of it. - There's also not an outdoor eating area. Like the picking cable we have in the other building. But I have a plan to donate a bench to that park across the street. - I have bad news. I know the city's development plan for that park. And it does not involve being a park. - I'll set up my lawn chair. - I intend for this to be my office. - It's significantly smaller than your current one. - It's actually way smaller than my current office. But it's a corner office. - Your office now is a corner office. You, you feel good about this. It's okay. It's Good. - I I'm not even gonna be able to have meetings with people in here. This is stupid. All right. - What do you mean? Of course - I'm moving this wall over. - What are you talking about? If you put your desk right here, you'll be able to put - Yeah, but I wanna have beanbag meetings. - You will have room. Your desk is like 24 30 inches which is here. - Wait, you're gonna have me facing that way? - Why not? - Privacy. I actually can't face that way. Here's the macarena office. This one's totally bigger. - Is this one bigger? - I think so. We do have a plan for these offices. I plan to take one of them. Two of them will be dedicated meeting rooms for the writing team or labs people. And then one of them, the smallest one is gonna be for Luke. He finally has an office again, ladies and gentlemen. And this is it. Honestly, I expect him to spend most of his time with the labs debs downstairs. - This is what I don't understand. My understanding was that it was just another call room. And when he wanted to be in here, he had, he had. - That's what I understood to you. But then he just said something different. - He has first write of refusal. - But he also has an office down there. - That's where he'll work most of the time. - So if Luke doesn't step foot in this office in two months, then we should be able to take it back. - You guys take it up with him. Did we miss anything up here? - Yeah, the bathroom. - Oh yeah. Wow. There's big hump in the floor there. - [Yvonne] Yep. - [James] Oh, I can see that. - You guys notice that it's like more, If was practicing my putting down this hallway, I'd really need to bring it out to the left a little. - I really didn't understand their HVAC system. Why is this dot - Yeah what the heck is this? - midway between the tile? - I don't know. - I don't think this was like this when we saw it. - There's two bathrooms here. I have a proposal. - One of them is your office. - Ass Man. I propose one is designated, whatever you want, and the other one is peeing only. The reason is, then all the bathrooms are occupied. You can count on one of them not being occupied in like 30 seconds. If you just wait. - This building has a lot of bathrooms in it though. - Yeah. But they're far. - You're counting on people to read labels and obey them. When we have people who still pee on the floor. - The, the words that I use to describe my team that I think are best hands down, world class. Totally world class team. A world class, video production team. The people who work here are world class employees. World class. Absolutely world class. - We should just get one of the whole wall urinals like at a sports facility. - Yeah. Trough with ice. - Here's the back stairwell. Finally headed to the really cool stuff. Ah, you hear that hum? That's the hum of performance ladies and gentlemen. We have about in the neighborhood of 300,000 thousand Watts of power. Originally this building was used as a sheet metal fabrication facility. Kyle, from our engineering department, was super excited about the way it's laid out. We have 600 volt pipes throughout. We have, I believe it's 480 volt in various places internally. And then we've also got 208 volt kind of scattered around in the warehouse. - There's also storage up here and the roof access is also up here. - Wow. Cool. (loud bang) Boy! - In here you can kind of oversee the entire warehouse. - Or bring a forklift up. - Or bring a forklift up. - (screams) - [James] What are you doing? - [Yvonne] What are you doing? - I'm going on the roof? What does it look like I'm doing? - [James] Why? - Because I wanna see the roof. I just bought this thing. I wanna see all the angles of it. Hey, I should wave to you guys through the skylight over there. I'll meet you in the warehouse. - This is the most like what's the, I still don't know the word for it. - Dingy hallway. - [James] Yeah. - Yeah. - Up here on the roof. Scoping things out. One of the coolest things about this place. See this building right here, just over on the other side is our existing office. We should be able to hit that office with a microwave dish and do high speed wifi and get anywhere from 3 to 10 gigabit per second. Hopefully, we won't even need a separate internet connection here. Wow. I don't think they're gonna be able to see me through here. - Okay. Linus is knocking. All right. Let's go find this skylight. - Yeah. That's a very plastic skylight. I guess I'll just go meet up with them inside. - I think he gave up. - Did he? - Oh, got a couple of HVAC units. Those are only for the office space though. And because we're gonna have people working out in the warehouse, we're gonna have to do warehouse air conditioning. Which is gonna cost a pretty penny. - [James] Linus, you okay there? - I can't figure out how to close it. - [Yvonne] Do you need help? - Yeah. So the skylights are not very clear. (Burps) - But what is really cool about the skylights is that there's a little button over there that you can press and they actually open. Bad for filming though. - [James] Uh, not great. - Empty space always looks so much smaller than when it's full of stuff. - To be clear. It's really big. This is somewhere in the neighborhood of 18,000 square feet. A lot of it's gonna be taken up by testing apparatus. I still think that this should be enough for us to hit pretty much every major category for consumer electronics. - Not only that, but we have to bring over from the other building, the logistics department or most of it. - They are future proofing their plan. So they currently occupy about 2,000 square feet. And they're asking for about four. And this tiny little area here is what they've designated for camera land. - Why don't we make camera land upstairs? We haven't actually shown that yet. - The main camera land is still in the other building. This is only for the rare shoots that we're gonna do over here. - I don't think it's gonna be that rare. It's gonna happen pretty often. And upstairs is not necessarily the greatest idea. If you have rolling light stands that you need to bring. And this is why I'm in charge of planning. - Hey, don't bother to sweep or anything previous occupants. This is just a small kind of storage area. This is access to power. If we wanted to put in something like an air compressor. The hoses terminate here, and it's pumped basically throughout the building. - Do you know what they did here? So to take out their air compressors, they cut this railing instead of taking it out properly. That's why there's no safety railing here. We're not gonna pass code. - Oh, these are starting to add up. Aren't they. - Absolute Jack asses. - Did we take any pictures of our walkthrough? Because there's a lot of stuff now that I've seen some of the crap that they've done. I'm wondering if they've messed with other things that we're just not aware of. - It's hard to tell though, like how fresh is it? - [James] Yeah, I don't know. - [Linus] Uhg. - What about that hat? Did that hat get left here? Pacific Headwear pro model. Thanks for the hat. Actually. You know what? Forget it. I don't even want your hat. I'll get a better hat. lTTstore.com - [James] Hey, this was included. - [Linus] Oh no. They thought of that. - Oh my God. It's like a breaking system almost. - Do you know what happened here? - I know that there's a neighboring building adjoining this and that it used to be open. - The original owners who created this actually have that lot over there. So they built that, created these holes. And then when they sold the buildings, they sold them separately and just concrete blocked it back up. - Yeah. - So Linus is already talking about how he wants to approach them. And. - Well, it's just an investor that owns it. So I figure with an investor money talks. Right? We don't have any right now. - Yeah. I was just gonna say. - But if this goes really, really, really well. - Mr. Sebastian knocked down that wall. - Thanks. That's good. I like that. - It's Reagan. - I told James the quote for the cellulose in here. Have you heard what it is? - How much is it gonna cost? - Anywhere from 75 to 150,000 thousand dollars just to do half up. - Halfway up? - Yeah. And I actually don't know if that includes the ceiling yet. I have to find that out. - That's insane. - [Yvonne] Yeah. - [Linus] Cellulose is the material that we use to spray on the ceilings and walls to make it stop doing this. (clap echos) Given that we're going to be shooting in here and we might have to build rooms that are sound deadened for, you know, acoustic testing. The more we can do to quiet the base building, the better. This is really loud. Unfortunately, these are really expensive. So. - What about the prospect of building more mezzanine in here? I'm I'm from this vantage, I can see the office base and how it could be expanded. - We can't do that because we're limited by parking. - Sure. We could potentially build this place out to almost 40,000 square feet and stuff 200 people in it. Where would they park? - We get our own bus route. - How much did they charge us for the racking? - About $6,000. - For this? Is that even a market rate? Wait... this isn't even bolted down. - Okay. This is a problem. - Feeling a little bit of buyer's remorse, James. Not, not gonna lie. Once we've got the place all set up, I know that I'm gonna be singing a different tune. Because it's going to be awesome. You can see from the original owners there and there are set up for like Mondo Fume extractions. And I believe this one still functions. I have no idea how to use this. Can't say I know what that means. - Ouh, that's bright. - Do these like open properly at least do. Oh man. One of my favorite features though, is this green belt right here. It turns out it is continuous all the way to the back of our other office. So what Jake and I were thinking was armored fiber cable. If was sitting in there. Would anybody really notice it? That'll definitely be a future video and I'm sure there'll end up being some behind the scenes shenanigans. We do tons of behind the scenes on Floatplane.com now by the way. So you guys can check that out at link down below. - There is so much work to be done at this building though. It's definitely in rougher shape than I originally thought. - Yeah, I should have looked at it a little bit I mean, okay. It's big enough that we can actually meaningfully expand into it. Unlike the other spaces that we got that. Hey, anyone wanna buy lab one? Ah, ah? I mean, we tried to find a much larger space where we could just consolidate everything and one fell through. Then another fell through, then everything fell through and meanwhile, the costs are going like this. - It's Okay. It'll be good. We'll make it good. - Yeah, we'll make it. - It's just gonna take a lot more work and money. - Money from our sponsor. - Micro Center what can I say?

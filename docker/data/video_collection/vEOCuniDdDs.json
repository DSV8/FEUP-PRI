    "transcript": "What's up guys Lew here back with another video and as you can tell I got a giant thing on the desk here today this my friends is a very premium piece of equipment the new ultra wide monitor thunderbolt ultra wide monitor 21\" x 9\", 34 inches from LG now... If you have seen my setup video in the past than you know I love these ultra wide monitors this one makes some tweaks to the version that I have three of one my desk power brick, power cable (laughs) The stand that's the cool thing the stand has actually changed some height ajustments, some tilt look at that guy, right there put that down you've got this little look at that semi circle, I really like that aesthetic HDMI, display port OH!! OH!! OH!! OH!! a very nice look specially with the curve on there oh maybe I should've done this before, eh? find me some peanuts and crackerjacks so it's rude, rude, rude for the home team ooh yes that was easy ooh that loooks insane on the camera HELLO! ANYBODY HOME? and as you can tell we're now height ajustable here and quite a bit too so if you're like... maybe you're on a desk you'd like to uh... stand and work some times one of those standing desks look the size of this guy 99% sRGB color coverage here IPS is important on something this wide because you don't really wanna stress the vieweing angles too much on other display technology (plastic wrapping off) Ho! Ho Ho! there's nothing like fresh gadgets you know... I have to believe this is probably the most comprehensive set of inputs and ouputs... 2 thunderbolt ports, 2 usb 3.0 charging ports, a usb 3 input, display port in 2 HDMI ins, a headphone out, and of course your DC now with thunderbolt... thunderbolt 2 might I add, you have the opportunity to daisy chain this monitors together if you choose to or to have other thunderbolt peripherals that need high speed connection every sticker have it's own removal sound just notice this little guy as well that's for some extra cable management it fits on to the back here... clips in and... keeps everything neat and tidy you're thinking right now... I've heard of thunderbolt, thunderbolt 2... I understand, ok, it's cool connector, this cable has an enormous amount of throughput right? If it send a wonderful 3440 by 1440 image to this display but at the same time have enough left over bandwidth for high speed storage connected right to the display thunderbolt over here on the laptop... connection activated so yeah... you can see your input selections here OOOOOOOOOH!! look at this beautiful image of the toronto skyline taken by your favorite... Jack! you've gone from this little thing here to this entire real estate (beeping noises) an ipad pro the big enchilada Mr Burrito OOH! charging... I don't know maybe the ultimate setup if you're for like a single monitor setup... huge field of view expandability through the ports the ability to interface with you peripherals whether is a desktop or a laptop that you are connecting to it... this might be for you",

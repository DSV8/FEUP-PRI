    "transcript": "this here is a viewer's recent pc build it both the ryzen 5 5600x and asus 3060 ti and i believe 16 gigs of ddr4 in a month case with airflow prioritized now you might be wondering what on earth am i doing with this build well first off the owner happened to live in the orlando florida area which is nice i could meet him in person he's having issues he just built this system right and it's not posting and if it does post that he got a post one time but then he wasn't getting any video out and his motherboard was throwing the vga error oh the vga air is an awful one to deal with so i told him i would give it a shot try to troubleshoot i have tons of parts here that i can swap out with it always it's always nice to have extra parts to swap because that'll pretty much narrow down what the issue is at least at large there might be a specific issue on the board of said component that is actually causing the problem that you're experiencing but at the end of the day i can at least narrow it down to the part so which part is the problem which one do you need to rma or you know file a warranty claim for whatever so i told him i would do that for him we're going to figure out what is wrong with this build in this video also want to take care of a few cable management issues just a few things i mean i'm being kind of picky here he actually did a pretty good job but he told me that behind the motherboard tray that's where it gets messy so we're going to tackle the posting problem what is causing the system not to boot properly then we're going to tackle cable management all right stay with me to get rid of that annoying activation watermark hop on over to vip std key and purchase a windows 10 pro oem key for fractions of the price of retail just use a secure payment method like paypal receive your key in seconds and activate your os here bye bye watermark and be sure to use our new offer code skgs for a sweet discount now the first thing you'll want to do in a situation like this is replicate the issue especially if you're not you don't have personal experience with what's going on here which i don't i've only just heard what was happening to the system i have not seen it happen in person so we're going to power it on and we're going to see what happens so the system is lit up checking for picture because he said that was the most recent issue he was having right before he dropped it off yep we're not getting any picture that'll be a bit difficult to see with this camera angle i understand that but there are series of leds over here just to the right of the dimm slots and the led that's lit up right now is uh for vga and that is obviously our video cards referring to the video card video out and that's the problem um the thing is i don't think that this 3060 ti is dead so it is lighting up here so it is receiving some power i'm not sure if it's receiving power through the eight pin supplemental cable or not but it's definitely receiving power through the pcie slot the fans i'm looking down below the fans aren't turning but i think this is one of those zero rpm cards or if it's not under load the fans won't turn now interestingly enough down here at the bottom of the board doctor debug code a a indicates that the system should actually post it should be showing something on screen right now so there's no inherent issue with the way the system is set up but we do have that conflicting led again at the top right of the board uh signaling there's something wrong with the video card so based on what i've seen so far the next thing i'm gonna do is swap this card out with one that i know works i'm gonna pull it from a working system i'm gonna power the system on with that new card in here and see if we get a post if we do then we've narrowed it down at least to the graphics card might be an issue with the hdmi cable based on the other indications i'm getting from this board um so we'll try different ports once we kind of narrowed it down to this piece of hardware so we're going to disconnect this eight pin here and slide this old card out when you're doing this by the way you want to make sure that your system is fully powered off disconnected from the wall and that you've drained any capacitors by holding down that power button after it's been disconnected for about 10 or so seconds leds should all be shut off that's when you're good to work on your system so we've got the old card out i'm going to slide this new card in here and this is actually a gtx 1660 from gigabyte uses a similar supplemental 8 pin so no wiring conflicts there i'm not even going to bolt it to the case we just need to connect it real quick power the system back on and see if she posts what is going on with this cable and we're going to power it back on see if we get any leds up top that's interesting we're getting the exact same vga led up top card's lit up fans are spinning the card itself is fine i know this card works so i think that's good news i mean in light of how expensive a lot of these newer graphics cards are nowadays i think it's it's safe to say that this 3060 ti here is not the problem and this is probably the most expensive component in this build so that's good news i'm i'm concerned now if it's this graphics card maybe this uppermost pcie slot i mean the card is in there now the next thing on my list with the original card back in the system will be to reset cmos so maybe maybe there's some motherboard software conflict some just weird juju that's getting in the way here i've seen clear cmos buttons fix the strangest of problems so we're going to turn the system back on and hold this bios button down okay and i decided to reset the system one more time after that bios reset and the led indicator has changed it is no longer lighting up next to the vga line it's sliding up next to the dram line suggesting that there's now a problem with dram you know i i really hope it's not this motherboard it's gonna be a pain to take everything out of this so we've powered up the system i'm gonna pull these sticks of ram out i'm just gonna leave one stick in slot two and that's it and we're gonna see if we can get around that dram problem dram is lit looks good all right moved on from dram and we're back to the vga ladies oh no back to dram again what is going on what is oh no i guess that's just training memory i think that it freaked out when i swapped modules so dr debug down at the bottom right 9c right now a zero you know it's cycling through still no picture on screen should switch to aa there at the bottom oh no we've got a light that says boot what is this wait so why don't we have a picture then where's our picture that boot light wasn't on before why is there no picture look just so you guys are seeing the same thing i'm seeing that boot light up top that's a green light whereas the vga light is white so we're still getting that white vga light which isn't good we're not supposed to get that i don't think but that green light up top there that wasn't on before so switching to just one dim fix that that's that's weird but okay that there that code shouldn't be there as far as i know zero two indicates an issue with i believe storage device so i'm going to go to the back of the system i'm going to double check all of his connections his power cables and the like i'm kind of surprised that we're getting so many conflicting signals from this board but uh yeah some something's fishy okay so i checked all of his connections back here they look pretty solid this power supply is non-modular so there's really nothing i can do on that end uh but the one thing i did notice is that his hard drive is powered via sata but it's not sata data cable connected which means that his hard drive is getting power for some reason but it's not actually doing anything so i'm going to connect the sata cable i'm i would be very surprised if this was the issue but i've seen weirder things in this industry so let's give it a shot no more zero two code so that's cool we're back to doctor debug code aaa which means the system should be i mean it should be posting i'm running out of ideas i mean i gotta swap the motherboard that's all i can think of at this point swap the motherboard reseat the cpu um what else is there we're also missing that boot led now i'm gonna try taking out that second dim again and see if that fixes that all right there's only one more thing i can think of before we resort to it being a motherboard or cpu issue and those troubleshooting steps are going to be a bit more time consuming i'm going to slide this thing into the bottom i guess this will kind of narrow down the slot issue i'm moving this into the next highest 16 lane actually i mean no it's only an eight lane slot but it's a full length pci slot i'm gonna reconnect here this is really cringe i apologize i know this is gonna like it's gonna bother some folks but i've got to do it just to just to narrow down these i'm going to hold the card up too because there's some cables underneath but i don't want to get snagged in that graphics card span shroud and reconnect reconnect and power on just to see i can't even see dr debug now no way no way that was it are you serious it's a dead it's a dead pcie slot why else would it work here but not at the uppermost slot what the heck is that on camera i mean look at that we get a post this thing is freaking out because we've reset it so many times but this is the first time we've actually gotten a display out like an image on a screen from this build since we started troubleshooting now i sure as i don't want to hold this card up myself and i think it looks really stupid down here at this lower full length pcie slot so what i think we're gonna have to do is swap motherboards now just for a sanity check i'm gonna swap back to his kit of ram his kit's actually better than this kit here so i definitely don't want to swap them out if i don't have to i'm gonna put these back in their original slots yep there we go so definitely not the ram it's not the dim slots themselves it's not the graphics card it's not the cpu we're getting a post here it is that uppermost pca slot the full length slot the 16 lane slot what the heck now feel bad because in order to test this i had to remove these two lower pcie slot covers normally wouldn't be a problem but these are the ones that are like fixed in position and if you remove them you can't reinsert them so he's going to have a weird gap down there i could have used a riser card but i didn't have one on hand most of those are in systems currently but i do have a solution i think it'll kind of make up for this here i'm going to get a system fully working because i have the exact same board as the one that's in this build so if you guys remember a few months ago i released a video about how to update your amd builds bios without an amd cpu installed and this applied to those who maybe wanted a i don't know ryzen 5 5600x maybe like this person here bought a b550 board but that b550 board doesn't have the the native bios needed to get 5600 x's to post um you can actually flash boards like this you can update the bios's without cps installed which means you don't need a zen 2 or a zen plus or original zen cpu install to do that and most don't have multiple cps laying around so that video actually was super helpful for a lot of people i'm glad i uploaded it and this is the board that i use to demonstrate kind of good the tutorial um so yeah i'm just going to swap this one out with with the one in here and i believe it's the exact same board so he won't even know that i changed anything i'm going to tell him that i swapped the boards but i got this sent from asus um a while back and it just kind of sits in the closet so uh more than happy to give him this swap here so at least he can use his beautiful rig so for this process we have to remove not only the cpu and the ram but also the m.2 ssd he hasn't he told me he had one of these don't want to forget that's the only drive in the system so first off gonna remove this stock cooler always kind of sort of a pain give it a little wiggle system really couldn't heat up too much and there we go you know now that i've had a bit more time to think about it i'm just looking at the slot on both of these boards i don't think the slot itself is i don't think there's any real physical damage here i think this goes back to possibly a setting in the bios i've run into this once before and i don't know why just now i'm thinking about it but there there have been issues reported where the board will default to pcie gen 4 or vice versa pci gen 3 for a gen 4 card and the fix is always to swap to the opposite of that so if this board has pcie gen 4 enabled by default which might have happened when this viewer updated this bios that i've read online and i've actually witnessed this once with one board that i have that can prevent your card from properly sending out video signal so i'll probably follow up in a separate video with that um i'm still going to swap boards because i know that my board which is again the same as his uh but this is one i've used uh for a few other videos i know this works with gen 4 and gen 3 cards the way that it's set up now so even with you know it i don't really know case in point you know if i really wanted to be picky here and dive even deeper i could probably figure out what's wrong with this board you know on the software level um but just looking at the hardware i mean we know the motherboard's at fault but what specifically about the motherboard is wrong that is the ultimate question i just don't really have time to diagnose all that this viewer wants the system back tomorrow so i kind of have no choice there i i want to you know i want to give him a working system so i'm just going to swap boards for now i'm going to keep this board though his board and i'm going to see if i can fix it might swap cpus around and then if i can get into the bios which apparently i can if i put this card in the lower 16 or well the lower full length full size slot i should say because that's only an 8x slot or x8 slot then then if i get in the bios i think i can change the 16 lane generation from three to four or from four to three i think that'll fix it but uh yeah separate video for that just want to get this guy's system ready to go he just built it i feel bad that it's not working for him so i'm glad that we found at least a quick fix for him and with everything swapped over slide the new board back into this build try to keep it out of the range of a lot of these wires i've left in here motherboard swaps are the freaking worst they're just like the most work all across the board and all right now for cable management a couple things i did right off the bat that really make a difference here because he had his fan cable just kind of like hanging here plugging straight in not routed at all same goes for the rgb cable so i took that fan cable very easy to do especially if i cut out up top for eight pin eps for cpu power just run that fan cable behind there and this one's long enough i could run it behind the motherboard tray connected to this fan header down here so that fan cable is totally out of sight now looks a lot cleaner as for the rgb cable this one is it's a bit tricky to deal with these uh thicker cables here that come with these amd stock coolers what i did in this case was run it actually kind of along the kind of heat sinks i guess this is the chipset heating here and then you know the mm.2 heat sinks both of these actually ran the cable underneath the bottom one you can see it just passes if i can get out of the way the light here passes right underneath this bottom m.2 heat sink which works out especially on these newer boards have a lot of heat sinks you can kind of play around with uh get those cables running underneath there going to look very subdued especially once the graphics shirt is in you won't even know that cable's back there looks totally hidden much cleaner cable management overall and as for right side cable management this is more or less what it looked like before just kind of a rat's nest didn't use any zip ties or anything and this is what it looks like after i mean it's it's not like you know the perfect cable management setup ever in a case like this it's kind of difficult and with a non-modular power supply okay these are excuses at the end of the day it still does definitely look better than what it looked like when it first came into the office and that's pretty much all i was going for last thing we need to do then is throw the graphics card back in wire it up there we go much better and now we just need to see if this thing posts i will look like a mega doofus if it does not swap the motherboard for nothing everything's letting up dr debug showing up there all right it is looking good yep there we go vga light is gone we have the green boot led got my keyboard here let's go ahead and press f1 and what i'm going to do is reinstall the operating system for me told me that he was in the middle of doing that when everything kind of screwed up on him so i'm going to reinstall it on his m.2 drive just to be safe so that when he gets a hold of it he'll just be able to log in with his credentials and have a fully functioning system so see this is a screen here that i'm kind of worried about i think this may have been what went wrong with his motherboard again i'll confirm this in a separate video so stay tuned for that but there is a window in the advanced tab of this uefi that allows you to change pci generation so the uppermost 16 lane slot you can see this one here if i click on it and swing down i can select gen 4 manually or i can select gen 3 manually or i could just keep it on auto this board is set to auto and everything appears to be functioning fine so i'm curious if his board has the same setting set to pci4 or maybe set to pci3 these are pci4 capable cards even though the 3060 ti is not going to fully saturate gen 4 bandwidth it is still a gen 4 capable card so uh there could be conflicts there and again i've run into this issue with only one board of all the boards i've tested in the amd uh am4 lineup but uh i will look into this further i'm gonna leave things as is for his build uh because it's working as is i don't wanna change anything and screw it all back up so yeah operating system reinstall that and we'll be good to go finally well that was fun and holy crap do i need a haircut sorry about that uh this was fun it was um a bit a bit odd this kind of problem i've only seen like i said once or twice before um and that's probably why it took me a bit longer to diagnose this issue than than otherwise would you might be watching this thinking oh well you should have swapped the graphics card in the lower slot before doing anything else well it's easier to suggest that when you're watching it hindsight is always 20 20 and i really didn't think that would be the issue very rarely do you see software conflicts with that top 16 lane slot and even more rare than that i would say do you see physical defects in those uppermost 16 lane slots that prevent cards from sending video out what's weird though is that the motherboard tried to post and that was what was really throwing me off so this is a very unique problem i understand totally why this viewer was was confused and worried but um i yeah i'm glad i'm glad it's fixed and i'm glad that i could give it back to him in working order i did tell him up front just in full transparency here with you guys i told him that i cannot guarantee that i will be able to fix the problem i said at the very least i can look at it i can tell you what i think it is um but uh you know i i can't guarantee that i'll fix it what i can do though is not charging anything just give me a day or two to make a video about the troubleshooting process that's all i ask and uh so i appreciate uh this viewer for uh for being patient with me there and uh glad to deliver the good news so i'll meet him tomorrow drop the system back off if you uh live in the orlando florida area i guess i'll go ahead and suggest this too you know depending on how well this video does i think this could be a really cool series um a lot of people are sitting on older hardware hardware that they wish they could upgrade but can't because of the current climate economic climate pc industry climate um so you know that's why i started the pcdc series i wanted to clean systems that people have been sitting on that they can upgrade just to kind of get them by for the next few months next few years maybe um while uh while they wait for prices to come down or for new stuff to come out that's not going to be price gouged but yeah maybe we can also do that with just troubleshooting issues if you have a problem with your system and you live in central florida or willing to drive close to me to drop your system off and then again to pick it up a few days later i will happily check out whatever issues you have if your system is not posting if you get a black screen maybe your fans don't turn on whatever you happen to diagnose i can't guarantee that i'll be able to fix it but i can at least tell you with all the hardware that i have here i can swap a bunch of stuff out i can tell you what the problem is and then that'll narrow down you know the the choices you have in terms of rman warranty claiming uh or if you just want to outright buy something new to replace it you don't have to you know buy tons of parts and swap them yourself i can do that for you so if you're interested in that um rather than emailing my wife because she's very very preoccupied with the pcdc stuff right now um i would suggest that you guys tweet at me if you just tweet at greg salazar yt and then send your problem the issues you're having in a tweet uh i will see that that's what david did here that's how i found him um he was very quick to let me know that he would live in the area he'd be willing to drop system off so if that is you and you're having an issue and you're willing to drive to me around the orlando area in florida um yeah i'd like to give it a shot at least and i won't charge you a dime i would just you know hope that you'd give me a day or two to diagnose it that's all i ask and then i can make a video out of it and kind of a win-win for both of us at the end of the day so thank you all for watching this far into the video uh thank you david for giving me a chance to fix your system i'm glad i was able to it's a coincidence that i have to have the exact same motherboard that you have in your system here so that worked out but i had other b550 boards that would have swapped worst case but uh that was really cool really fun to troubleshoot and i'd like to do more of these in the future if you guys like this video a lot sure to give it a thumbs up i would appreciate that consider clicking the subscribe button that'd be cool thanks for listening to me ramble this far into the video my name is greg thanks for troubleshooting with me",

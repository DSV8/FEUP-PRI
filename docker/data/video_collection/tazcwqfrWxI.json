    "transcript": "What's up guys! Lew here back with another video and today we are checking out something called the MCam which is an attachment for your iPhone, in this case, the iPhone 6, but is also available for the 6 Plus, and what it allows you to do is to have an interchangeable lens system along with external sound so you can turn your iPhone into more professional camera, or, at least, that's what it promises. As you flip the flap open here-- #FlipTheFlap You heard it here first. Learn how to #FlipTheFlap. [laughs] [laughing] As you #FlipTheFlap--that doesn't even feel right. Flipping the flap op-- [laughs] Opening up this flap on the box-- \"flap\" is just a bad word. Just, \"flap.\" [chuckles] Opening the top flap on this box, you'll see how those lens adapters will change the capabilities of your iPhone. wide angle comparison iPhone on it's own with a wide angle lens and then the micro lens comparison which will you bring you into much closer to an object even closer than the regular iPhone camera is capable of focusing and it also comes with a silicone case to protect your phone when you insert it into the adapter. Lets go ahead! Jump inside the box never got his little bag here it looks like a cap or cover a little cleaning cloths and.. external microphone this is pretty cool so if you use your phone as your main camera for video are you know that the audio that comes out of it is not fantastic so this will be interesting to test the external microphone Whoaaa this thing is heavy it's completely made out of aluminum entire body feels like a real camera A little bit of information of here in quick start guide \"How to insert your iPhone\" how to mount this thing on a tripod and over here we have some accessories including A 35 mm SLR adapter .. Whoa mini cart, tiny little dolly action card, flash bracket Film Maker Pro Pack, Okay this is if you want to get really serious with your phone so on the front you can see that the unit is dominated by the lens portion which is covered by this cap that is a huge lens so this is the wide angle converter lens 0.45 X and I assume you unscrew it. And then the macro lens lives below that. So it screws into the wide-angle converter, but, if you want the macro close-ups you just remove the wide portion and leave the macro installed. Now, the main component here for installing your phone is this silicone case Here is an iPhone 6 right here Lets see here There you go Ok, so its just a friction fit But its pretty solid when its in there And it still gives you the exposure you need to access your different buttons On the bottom of this unit, you have 3 different mounting points for your standard quarter thread And then on the top here You've got another one, followed by a cold shoe adapter So, you can see how the lens pokes through there And then I'm going to go ahead And install The macro lens first and open up The camera app just to see what the effect of that is WHOA So yeah, so immediately Your able to focus Super close You can see my entire fingerprint infact WHOOAA Ok, now I'm going to switch to The wide angle real quick And of course thats totally different Now we are getting a super wide *Wow* Thats cool, now you guys know I'm a big fan Of wide angle lens's In-fact, I'm speaking into a super wide now I should just show you real quick how the microphone works Plugs in here The bottom Then, you point it in the direction your shooting Right, say your shooting like this But your the one talking You can just have it pointing at your mouth But if you want audio from the people that you are shooting, you can bend it out the other way So overall a fairly robust package for people who want to take their phone photo gain to the next level and don't want to spend a ton of money but I think for some people this might just be the perfect solution for a slight improvement for there iPhone photo and video gain Alright, guys That wraps this up, thanks for watching give me a thumbs up down below if you appreciated this content otherwise, i will catch you very shortly on the next episode. Later guys *Is this pretty cool* *Noise*",

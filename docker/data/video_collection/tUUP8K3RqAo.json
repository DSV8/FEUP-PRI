    "transcript": "It's sexy it's small and it doesn't make a single noise. It runs Mac OS Mojave Oh and it's fast like really fast What is it? And how did we make it? Well, let's travel back to 1985 and find out or I mean like last week So this model of a case that is completely passively cooled There are no fans whatsoever is really really neat But we need to put a computer in here and the computer that we're going to use the computer that this case is designed for Is, of course, the Intel nuc now we have done one Hackintosh build already with an eighth-generation Bean Canyon Intel nuc, but that was a really low-end kind of i5 variant. This is the higher end. i7 variant It's a quad core processor With eight threads and it has a base clock of 2.7 gigahertz with a turbo frequency of 4.5 gigahertz So it should be actually really really fast and it's not a hexa core processor like the i5 Mac Mini Which means it probably won't out bench that but it should be relatively close this whole system build All in max price is going to be about 850 dollars out the door and Apple charges 1100 for basically that same computer So hopefully we can out bench it but we've got a power supply here in the box It's kind of large but even still with the power supply the entire system is significantly smaller than a Mac Mini Which is no longer really all that small And then we have the little tiny nuc right here Now if you get an i5 variant or an i3 variant one of the lower end options, there are two model designations there's BEK and BEH, this is a BEH. It's a little taller and it allows you to fit a 2.5 inch SATA drive inside So there you go. We're going to pull this open and Basically remove this computer from the case so we can stick it in the large one Now that we have this cute little motherboard removed from the original case we ditched the original case and the antennas that come with that case and we basically only salvaged the little dual microphone cable assembly and Of course the motherboard itself now we have the CPU cooler on the top and it's kind of a interesting arrangement We have one screw that comes off right here and then two captive screws And of course our fan header, this is a blower style cooler. So you have fan You have a fan on the top here and ear there's an air intake air gets sucked into the fan and then it gets Exhausted through this radiator on the back of the nuc so if we unplug this little fan header right there We can pull this assembly right out and you'll see there are a couple of copper heat pipes that are touching the actual CPU die heat is transferred into these copper pipes They go to this radiator and air blows it out, but we don't need any of that so we're removing this entire assembly and then you'll see that there is thermal compound on this main die and not on these two extra ones when we put this into our new case we actually are going To apply thermal compound onto all three sections. So let's clean it up and do that now This case is actually pretty simple to work on you remove this bottom cover by removing these four screws and when we pull this open You'll see that it's actually really simple. We have a heat spreader our little Heat block right there. I would not expect it doesn't look like copper It may be nickel plated copper But my guess is that it's just aluminium, in any case, it should be well sufficient for the dissipation that the Nuc puts out it's a pretty Power efficient nook. The TDP is quite low and that's why we can do this entirely passively on such a small form-factor There are much larger cases. I've done a hackintosh build in the past with a mini ITX Build with an intel core i7 that was a 90 watt CPU 90 watt TDP CPU puts out a lot of heat and it was able to handle it just fine But it had these massive massive walls and it was quite a large case This one is very tiny which works for the Nuc's tiny size and heat output So we're going to first install the dual microphone assembly and you should have enough adhesive on these to just stick them back in If you don't want to put your microphones in that's fine, but you know what? They say smoke them if you got them and now it's time to install our thermal paste a casa Which is the company that makes this case includes some thermal compound in here I can't imagine it's excellent But the best and worst thermal compounds usually only have a variance of a couple degrees and this isn't some ultra high performance machine So I don't really care. This is also the most crude application you've ever seen of thermal paste and people are gonna freak out It's fine I think about thermal paste is that you really have to go over the top to use too much and When you're applying directly to the die when there is no heat spreader It's actually better to have a little more than you think you might on a standard desktop CPU so once we've got that applied we are going to flip it upside down and We are going to place it inside the case. So We have to orient ourselves the right way Which is this way and you will notice that you lose your microSD slot in the process. Oh, what a shame Everyone loves the micro SD slot Nah that doesn't matter So we're going to kind of just insert that into place. It might take a little wiggling to get there But we. I can feel the thermal paste slipping around and there we go We just screw this in and then we're almost done Okay. Now it's time to install our remaining components there really aren't that many left we have the Microphone header which we're going to insert now and then we have our RAM and our SSD Now these don't come with the Intel nuc kit You have to buy them separately and that's kind of why the price of the machine is quite low You can buy pre-configured machines but it's generally not quite as good of a deal and Given that it's super easy to install you might as well just do it yourself. So we have here 16 gigs of Memory from Kingston. This is just Kingston's value line of memory. It's not super high-end The clock speed is quite low. I believe it's 2400 megahertz, but it's super fine for what we are doing And it should not really in any way impact our benchmarks at all. So we're gonna insert that push it down and we're done now The SSD is a little different. These SSDs can get extremely hot nvme SSDs, especially when there's no airflow and so what we're going to do is we are going to add a heatsink to the top of the SSD to kind of Absorb some of the heat so that it doesn't stay all inside of this tiny little form factor It's still going to run a little hot but it shouldn't be hot enough to shorten the life of the SSD So let's do that now Subscribe And Like!!! All righty now, we install the SSD in the slot quite simply we just remember our little M2 screw right there. We insert the SSD in And then push down and that's all there is to it and we are pretty much done all we have to do is reattach the rear panel i/o and the top panel and That's it. Pretty easy Okay, so now we've got it assembled and we have to make a decision but we want it vertical or do we want it horizontal The case can operate in both directions and there are these cool Art Deco looking end plates that you standoffs They look really really nice either direction is supported I'm going to do vertical just because I think there will be more heat dissipation that way as hot air rises So it should be a little bit better for cooling but either orientation should work Okay, so that's all done and it looks pretty cool the question is does it stay cool Well, we'll find out once we get Mac OS installed and run some benchmarks compared to the Mac Mini speaking of Mac OS How would you do that? Let's find out. A lot of people ask me why I haven't created a step-by-step Tutorial on how to make a hackintosh. There are a few reasons, but one of the major ones is that there is no one-size-fits-all Hackintosh installation. The reality is that it depends greatly on your hardware and your BIOS on your motherboard There's several factors and so when I do a hackintosh build on my channel I try to do ones that someone else has already done and created a Tutorial for so that people who are less experienced know where to go to find exact instructions on how to do it But if you know how to do a hackintosh if you know how to make one They're generally pretty easy and they all operate on the same principles first You need a version of Mac less and you use a real Mac to get it So you download the operating system from the Mac App Store and then you use create install media Which is a command that you run on a Mac We're here on Apple's website and they tell you how to do it and it basically sticks the operating system on a bootable USB Drive Bootable to a Mac now. We need to modify that bootable installation to make sure that we can boot it on a PC and so we use this piece of software called clover efi and clifford efi replaces the mac OS bootloader with a UEFI boot loader the UEFI basically is a firmware interface what allows the bios of the Motherboards bios to communicate with the operating system and the hardware that's mixed in between so clover is very frequently updated It's open-source. There are updates. There was one 18 minutes ago So it's very frequently updated supports a bunch of hardware and it's open source, and it's excellent and it's free So you download clover efi and then you modify your install Drive by making it bootable on Mac OS Once you've done that you're going to need a couple of different drivers Mac OS uses drivers, but unlike Windows They're kind of built into the OS. Sometimes you need new audio drivers or Ethernet drivers or Drivers that have been built by the community or sometimes by apple but are Longer supported that allow you to use all of the hardware inside of your Mac If you don't have the right drivers some stuff won't work You can boot into Mac OS it will it will kind of work but your Ethernet your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi may not work So you download the correct texts you place them on this drive and that's it. You're ready to go now I do typically what's called the vanilla install I download all of these parts separately because I'm more experienced and that's how I do it, Tony Mac is a community that makes tools that are kind of plug-and-play They find all of the drivers that you need all of the text that you need and install them Onto this USB Drive that it makes for you the hackintosh pros don't really like Tony Mac because it's not open-source They use closed source software. They're a little bit spooky sketchy sometimes and so most people recommend a vanilla install But Tony Mac is a great resource for finding step-by-step tutorials on how to create a hackintosh if you want to go one step further and this gets really spooky you can go to well really popular hardware configurations Like the Intel Nuc one that people build a lot is such a popular piece of hardware that there are people that will create Pre-made itched ISOs that you basically write to a USB Drive. So it's alright it includes the operating system This is a great option. If you don't have a Mac, it includes the operating system It includes all the modified files that includes all the the qex and the drivers. It's completely ready to go You just download it you put it on the USB Drive and you're set the problem is is that You have to trust the sources You're getting them from this is one that has been recommended several times on forums all over the place. It's from this website That's completely in Chinese. It could be safe. I don't know I generally would not recommend downloading some random operating system where you don't know where it comes from Stick with the open-source tools that are tried-and-true and I'll link to a couple of guides that tell you how to do it step-by-step And are really logical and simple process Now that we've got the system up and running we got to see how it performs and I must say I'm impressed Now the goal is to perform comparably to the i5 Mac Mini Which is a hexacore 6 core processor our little nuc Hackintosh is only a quad-core processor so as you might surmise it doesn't quite agile the i5 Mac Mini, but it does get quite close and it absolutely Brutalizes the base model. i3 Mac Mini the best part Is that while the Mac minis fans start screaming for air with CPU core temperatures reaching nearly 100 degrees Celsius our little nuc hangs out at a perfectly chill 60 degrees C The case is hardly even warm to the touch Sadly this means that while we theoretically have the thermal overhead to squeeze a lot more performance out of this little machine There are no overclocking options inside of the nuc's BIOS I'd assume that this is a result of the tiny little external power supply Not being up to the task of even sustaining very high turbo frequencies. Let alone overclocking furthermore The machine is kind of a prebuilt purpose-built config, and I don't think Intel ever imagined people Jamming this tiny little computer into a much larger case with exponentially more thermal overhead But while no overclocking capabilities is a bit of a bummer. That's still okay because it performs extremely Closely to the i5 Mac Mini which when SPECT identically is more than double the price tag our little nuc only has one Thunderbolt 3 port unlike the Mac minis four But it works perfectly in Mac OS so as long as you don't hop plug devices, you can even run an E-GPU Which is pretty sweet if you're looking for some extra graphics overhead, although you might want to do that on a system That isn't completely silent. Maybe the nuc in its stock case on the plus side The nuc does have four USB ports and the Mac Mini only has two now not everything is rainbows and butterflies While most stuff like iMessage find my Mac and the App Store worked excellently Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Do not so handoff continuity That's a no-go unless you buy an Apple supported wireless card which isn't that hard but it is an extra step and Expense and even though Hackintosh are about as easy to build and maintain as they've ever been they're not plug-and-play Tinkering is required and you should expect to need to do more maintenance when updating than you would with a regular Mac Now is a couple hours of time a year worth $800 to you I don't know that's up to you to decide most people would probably say yes But regardless, I think it's a pretty neat machine and as a completely silent computer I think it's a prime candidate for a hi-fi home theater or office setup in an area that Apple doesn't even really serve speaking of prime this prime ad space is occupied by Nobody look I know ad bricks can get fatiguing And so I try not to do them all the time, but I sure would appreciate it If you would like this video subscribe and share it with your friends. Thank you so much for watching and as always stay snazzy Yeah, well we're a pretty bad Channel so",

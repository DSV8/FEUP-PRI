    "transcript": "- Ooh, it's actually an impressively thin box. And inside is the AORUS FV43U 43-inch monitor. This video is sponsored by AORUS. So I'm gonna give you a tour of things you can see when you unbox this product. And it's gonna be really fun. Come along! (James grunting) Increase the gravity. It comes with two feet, television style, and these are actually... (foot clacks) Metal. Boom, that's that side. Couple screws. I'm gonna need a screwdriver. As George W. Bush once said: \"Now watch this drive.\" Eh! The back. What kinda stylings we working with here? Definitely gamery, more gamery than a TV. Got some plastic. We got some peels. Oh. Excuse me? This never happens, I swear to god. I can see a 200-by-200-millimeter base mounting system, if you don't dig the wide feet, which could be a problem if you're working on a smaller desk or something, or a TV stand for that matter. DisplayPort 1.4, which is the good one, but more importantly, and what makes this thing feel actually new for a change, is HDMI 2.1, you get two of them. Headphone jack, and then you got your line out, so you can just go directly from this to your, probably, big bookshelf speakers. Let's be honest: if you're putting this on your desk, maybe your desk is big enough for, like, just some chunguses. And then USB-C with 18 watts power delivery. You can could charge your phone, not like a MacBook Pro, but, meh, trickle maybe. Then you got some USB 3.0s as well as the Type-B for uplink to power all this hubbage. Ah, wait, there's one more hole on the back of this thing. That is the integrated power supply right there. And there's a Kensington lock thing. Once you start peeling, you're not allowed to stop, but this is really awkward for me. Unfortunately this PC has a 20-series graphics card, not a 30-series, so I don't have HDMI 2.1 on this machine. So I'm gonna plug in DisplayPort, but it's just an unboxing, guys. It should be enough for our purposes. I'm sitting here using the nipple navigation like a chump, even though that is my preferred navigator. I'm gonna use this remote. You can see it's a very simple remote. It's almost like a Samsung TV or a Roku remote. It's got AORUS branding on the bottom. Really tactile buttons. Very lightweight. Satisfied. All right, so this is a VA panel, so it should have dark blacks. As long as you're on axis, you should be okay. But it has quantum dot enhancement film, which is nice, and I guess that is why they are claiming over 97% coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, which is pretty dang big. I mean, usually 90-plus, 95-plus, but 97-plus. They also gave me this little calibration report from the factory where the biggest Delta E is around three, which you probably could discern with your eye, but on average it's a lot lower than that. The average is 1.25, which is quite low. You know, it's just crazy how much you can get in a monitor. This is a 4K monitor, 144 hertz over HDMI 2.1. Plus it's color-accurate enough for color-critical work, professional work. And it's HDR 1000, it's VESA display certified. You can just get everything in one package now, it's insane. I should clarify these Delta E numbers are for sRGB, not DCI-P3. Yay, we're in here. Look at that. Yeah, it's 4K, it's very clear. Looks awesome. Let's check out the NVIDIA control panel. Okay, we came out right at 4K and 144 hertz, didn't have to change anything. Output color depth, I can choose 10-bit, but this actually is an 8-bit + FRC panel, it's not a native 10-bit panel. I just put that on. And now, being VA, it may not have the fastest pickle, pixel response time, especially when you go from black to almost black, like a medium gray. But this isn't a review. I'm just saying VAs are known for that. This is so much, so much easier to use than any kind of interface that's on the machine. I like having a remote. Starting with the gaming settings. We have an Aim Stabilizer Sync. Then we got Black Equalizer, which is gonna help make buddy hiding in the shadows easier to see. Super Resolution, which is supersampling. Overdrive, okay. So instead of low, medium, high, you have Smart Overdrive, Picture Quality, Balance, and Speed, which is just gonna be overdrived AF. And then Adaptive Sync, either on or off, and of course that is your variable refresh rate, G-Sync compatible, FreeSync, whatever you wanna call it these days. Got some picture modes. Display. Now, there's a built-in KVM, which is cool, which means that you can use the same keyboard, mouse, and monitor to have two different machines going. It supports picture-by-picture, picture-in-picture, and all that good KVM stuff. This is really cool, when you're in the picture settings, it's nice to be able to go in here and change the values of red, green, and blue, and not every display exposes that. But this gives you not just R, G, and B, but also cyan, magenta, and yellow. If you wanna calibrate this manually, you can. I like that. User defined color temperature. And you got your RGB settings right in there. This is awesome. Color spaces, you've got sRGB and DCI-P3 like we mentioned, but you also have the Adobe color space, which some people work in, it's nice to have that. And local dimming, auto or off, your only options. Oh, and you can save all your settings to profiles. Nice to have, and you can reset everything. Cool. Very nice onscreen display experience. All right, we're turning HDR on. There's actually three different HDR modes. You've got your HDR-1000 mode, which I think is gonna be the most accurate, but then there's an HDR mode just for gaming. Then there's an HDR movie mode. So each of those are gonna differ in the way that they interpret the transfer function. I'm skeptical of it, I think I would recommend just keeping it in the HDR 1000 mode. (engine rumbling) Oh! Onboard speakers, baby. Let me just turn that down. Oh no! You can't hold the volume button down. You gotta click it. I'm going backwards. Yeah, it definitely has speakers, and they're pretty serviceable. I mean, you got a big chassis like this. They don't need to be that bad, right? Especially if you're close. I mean, this is only at 17% volume. Probably goes really loud. I'm not gonna say it sounds great when it's loud, but if you're this close it doesn't have to be that loud. Well, that's super immersive and huge. It's a 4K monitor, 144 hertz, 1,000-nit HDR, what more could you ask for? Personally, I'd wall mount this thing. It would look a lot cooler. So thanks for watching this ShortCircuit unboxing, guys.

Thanks to AORUS for sponsoring this video. Did I say that already? I said it three times. - Say it again. - Thank you!",

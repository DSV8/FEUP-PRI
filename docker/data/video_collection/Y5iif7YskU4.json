    "transcript": "- All right, welcome to your unboxing and first look at the new green colorways for the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro. I didn't think this was worth an entire video because there isn't that much to say, but this is worth a short, so here we are. So this is the mid-cycle-refresh, new iPhone color and it's two different greens. For iPhone 13 here, it's a solid green which is pretty dark. I'd describe it as like a forest green. Still glossy, still everything you know and love about the iPhone but a new color to get it back in the news. Then for the iPhone 13 Pro, it's a little more effort. This one is called Alpine Green, and thanks to the matte finish, it's a little bit lighter, and the stainless steel rails are a very low saturation but that's the 13 Pro's green. And then, yeah, not a whole lot of other green stuff in the studio to compare it to, but I'd like to think the color correction in our videos is so good that you now know exactly how green these phones look in your hand. For more shorts like this, subscribe to the MKBHD shorts channel, link below, see ya over there. Catch ya in the next one. Peace.",

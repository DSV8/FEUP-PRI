What is this about? This is called the BlackoutBuddy Kind of a weird name *laughs* Anyway, you get it Always ready, water activated emergency light - what?! The water powers... the flashlight? How?! Don't ask me how it works, ok? But apparently a few drops gives you up to 72 hours of flashlight Uh, let's see here eco-friendly. Yeah, of course, uses water. For light whenever and wherever you need it, it works with a few drops of liquid Okay, that's what it looks like, so... Remove tab to add liquid, there's a little plastic covering on the bottom here I've got some water Convenient water There's like this little... kinda grill at the top over here Let's uh, I don't know. Let's pour a little water in here Now what happens? Do I do a little more? Few drops of water you say... Okay, it's absorbing in there now. Get the water on the table. Maybe it takes a moment? Where's that liquid going by the way? Is there like a sponge or something in there? Oh! Jack! Huh! Wow... That's too cool! You see that?! You can see that there, yeah... Should we kill a couple lights, Jack? Hello! It's working! It's like, it almost appears to be getting brighter as I leave it here Now, you have some water on the table, as you can tell Something's going on here I can hear it! *sparkling sounds* Wow, very cool There you have it guys.

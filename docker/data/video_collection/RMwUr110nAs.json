    "transcript": "this is a weak pen tablet which is the kind of thing that art professionals use to do art with but in today's video we're gonna figure out how to properly game with this bad boy in a recent product Roundup video I did feature the veg and tried playing some games on it which went very well no that has that has not helped but in the comment section of that video people were saying that there are software tweaks you can use to effectively game with one of these So today we're gonna try and figure it out now of course there's no way we can game using our pen peripheral without these sexy drawing gloves now with GTA 5 when I started in the previous video we were getting some crazy movement with any kind of input from the pen which was really easy to fix all I had to do was change Mouse input method from raw input to direct input and now it just kind of functions like a normal Mouse but in pen form but it is still a bit weird because you can see that the movement is quite jumpy and the other thing is that the weak pen tab thing can read where the pen is even if it's not touching the surface but when you do touch the surface it's like clicking right however if you hold in and then move around it it it's more controllable in my opinion and then you don't get like accidental clicks by by bumping the surface uh and you can still click without having to lift off by just using the button on top of the pen which you know it it it does have its downsides causing some really weird some pretty weird bouncing around artifacts but we'll see if we can deal with that a bit later driving actually works very well with the weak pen because it doesn't require that much movement to to fully turn you know uh the biggest problem is just actually straightening the car out once you've finished your turn it's a very Hit or Miss process as you can tell but because it's driving we don't have to use the pen to steer and all you need to do for this to work is lift the pen off the surface then it just kind of works as free look all in all I'd say GTA 5 with just minor settings tweaks is actually surprisingly playable with a pin although I wouldn't be trading in my mouse or Gamepad for it anytime soon with that let's try another game foreign ly the way that the weak software reads the surface is that this is representative of the monitor so if I move down to this Edge it goes to where the bottom point was when I'm looking forward that is the top Edge where the pad makes you look is determined by where you're looking when you initially spawn so if I go over the edge and if I move the pen over and put it down in the middle it just shoots me back to the middle when I spawned and it's no surprise that having your entire range of movement determined when you spawn makes you a bit of an easy target in Battlefield 5. oh they're next to me and I can't shoot them because you can't look around okay so this is what we need to solve I then tried enabling Mouse mode in the weak drivers which was also recommended by a bunch of the comments it's the same problem look it it doesn't reset but it doesn't allow you to move past that boundary and after not being able to figure it out after spending ages playing around with mouse settings in the game I decided to try something else straight off the bat with Half-Life 2 I decided to turn raw input off Half-Life is having a seizure what in the world is this movement wait maybe I do need raw input no never mind raw input still does that uh so maybe let's drop the sensitivity without raw input on oh I guess that's more useful oh it never oh it's not it's not I made a mistake but after dropping the mouse sensitivity even more and with some practice I slowly started figuring it out so with the pen in the center of the pad the camera is steady and then whatever Direction you move the pen in from the center the camera looks in that direction and the further you move it from the center point the faster you look around it does make it feel a little bit like I'm playing the game after I did my own frontal lobotomy but I guess it's kind of usable and to prove its usability I'm going to effortlessly kill these two two Baddies yes finally that was very easy everywhere I looked for information about gaming on a pen tap I saw a bunch of people commenting seemingly very buttered that a thing called OSU wasn't mentioned so in an attempt to quell all the angry comments I decided to investigate now initially I thought OSU was software used to set up a pen tab for gaming but no apparently it's a game people play using pen tabs so let's do some OSU and see how that goes and first impressions were interesting oh wow OSU is very pink now I'm gonna try on some easy with a mouse first um there's an onigiri in the background for some reason there's an Oishi onigiri to oh oh it's so fast oh this is hard am I doing OSU correctly apparently not because I only got 36 into it how is this easy mode as far as I can tell it is like a beat thing so maybe I need headphones because I don't have audio at the moment okay I have sound now and the sound was interesting nothing could have prepared me for this music I was so shell-shocked by the music that my performance got considerably worse okay sound has made it way worse because not only is the music wild but I feel like there's no connection between the music and what I'm supposed to be doing and when swapping to the pen tab didn't help at all I realized I needed a tutorial which quickly cleared up how the game works ah but even with my newfound understanding of the game mechanics it was still real hard this is the hardest thing I've ever had to do but that didn't stop my desire for Domination hell yeah okay there we go we did some OSU on the pen tab now meaning no offense to the OSU Community it's been a long time since I've interacted with something as clearly not meant for me as those but uh apparently a bunch of people enjoy doing this so there you go foreign the final thing I did to try and fix FPS gaming on the pen tab was to reinstall the drivers which I tried because of a video by star rain on the topic and it worked the driver reinstall actually did fix it it is responding like a normal Mouse now oh but there is some serious learning curve to this again I think if you are good at using a pen tablet it would be fine you'd be able to do this no problem but I'm not good with a pen tablet unfortunately despite the driver reinstall Battlefield 5 still behaved like when we last left it off in the video which I guess means Battlefield 5 is out of the question maybe maybe unfortunately is a strong word anyway until the next video thank you for watching maybe consider watching another one if you liked it and subscribing to the channel and until the next video bye thank you",

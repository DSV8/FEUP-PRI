    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. - And I'm Jenna. - We're doing a freaking podcast. - I cannot believe it. - Yeah, I do, because this is the 15th time we've done this intro so-- - Oh, get out of here! No. - I'm pretty sure that we're doing it. But I'm pretty excited. We don't know what this is gonna become or if it's ever gonna be anything, or if we're ever gonna do it again. Do we even have a name? - As I said, do we even have a name for this podcast? - I mean, like, I had one that I was thinking in my small mind. - And that would be? - Do we say it or do we maybe let them pick, or do we just pick or do we just, - We can always, like, talk about it and see if they like it and we see if it sticks. - Yeah, we were thinking Same Brain. - Same Brain. - Well, I was thinking it and now you're thinking it because a lot of the times we'll do things, like the other day you tweeted something about sweatpants and I picked up my phone to tweet the same exact tweet, and thankfully, I saw your tweet before I tweeted the tweet. - Yeah, I tweeted, \"Oh, I wonder what sweatpants I'll wear today? 'cause we've been bored in the house and in the house bored. - In the house bored. - Wearing nothing but sweatpants. So I'm, you know what, there's been a lot of times when I'll tweet something and then I'll be like, \"Oh, you tweeted this one yesterday.\" I know. And a lot of times we'll shoot video. Are we gonna be editing this? - Light editing. - Light editing. - So don't mess up. - Don't mess up. - Don't mess up. - Okay. - Yep. (upbeat music) - I don't remember doesn't matter. - The same thing. - This is a memory test because I wanted to test out what would be like to record a podcast on an iPad and I think this is probably a setup that we have right now which would be better for like one person kind of recording on the iPad there's probably some ways to do multiple inputs into the iPad but so-- - Maybe you need like another dongle. - There's definitely a way to do it but I just wanted to make do with what we had and I really wanted to try out this new magic keyboard for the iPad. - Wow. - It is so awesome, it is way cooler than I thought it was gonna be. - It is pretty cool you're kind of flexing on us a little hard there. - I'm flexing, I mean, I don't know look at this you can't because this is audio unless you're watching the video - Wow she's flexing her muscle. - I can't lift up my other arm because I hurt myself (both laugh) after doing two years of Jiu-Jitsu I never hurt my shoulder guess what I did in quarantine, hurt my shoulder. - My shoulder has been injured for 12 years since my volleyball days, so any time I'll do like any like presses it's like does this like popping and it kinda sounds like when you snap a rubber band like that's what it feels like so-- - You know what we can do we can insert a sound of a rubber band snapping. - Oh. - Did you guys hear that? - I felt it, I felt it. So one thing that Justine said that is an essential part of a podcast are mugs. - We have to have a mug. - So we don't have anything to put in our mugs and for the people who are watching the video we here have our mugs but the problem is we usually drink these yerba mate drinks so I was like well why don't we just put you can inside the mug and this will be... - But you guys missed the biggest dilemma that we had because the dilemma was which side of the table we're gonna sit on because I wanted to know what side Jenna's, well okay wait which hand Jenna would be drinking the mug from so (laughs). - Oh my gosh. - We don't know how to do things. (laughs) - She was like, \"Okay walked to this mug and pick it up like you're gonna pick it up.\" And I was like, \"So you want me to pick it up like I'm gonna pick it up\" But then-- - Yeah, but you gonna pick it up, but like pick it up. - Then I kept thinking and am like which hand would it be, and I'm right-handed so it just kinda felt natural to pick it up with my right hand. - Also there's a lot of echo in this room and I'm well aware of it. This is honestly just a test so, this is version one, this is a beta. - It is for sure. - It's a beta test of Small Brain. - It is, we're learning, I thought of Same Brain. - Same brain, what did I just say? (laughs) - My brain is quite large, okay? - Your brain is large? - My brain is large, I am an intelligent human being so-- - Listen. - Check yourself. I just wanna go outside and every time I go outside even just to walk to the dog, it feels like I'm doing something wrong. It feels like I'm committing a crime even if I'm not around a single person it feels weird. - It does feel weird like I went to the grocery store like waited outside in the line which I actually prefer, because it was like what three to three weeks ago, I was waiting in a line where is backed to the back of the store. And you're just surrounded by these people. So I actually think it's interesting now, is this gonna be the new normal for when things do go back to normal. Are we gonna be waiting outside grocery stores in line? - Maybe. - 'Cause it makes sense. I saw that Delta is now allowing passengers who are at the back of the plane to board first, because it makes sense. - It does make sense. - It makes sense, so I'm just wondering like what is the future gonna be like after this are we gonna go back to these not so smart ways and I don't know. - I think that it'll never be the same ever again, or at least as long as like we're around because we know what it used to be like, but obviously people that are born now they're never gonna know what it was like. - Well that's like we don't know what you know like the Great Depression and things like that were like we don't know but-- - Researching that and reading about it, don't do it -- - No. - If haven't already because a lot of the things that have happened in the past are kind of going to definitely resurface, but either way I don't wanna talk about that because it's depressing-- - Yeah, I don't really know what happened. - And it's hard not to talk about. - It is. - Because it's such a huge part of everything that's going on, it's completely changed all of our lives, and honestly, the reason that I've been using my iPad, I feel like it's because I have like this whole new kind of way of life I guess, because I'm used to traveling and I thought that I use my iPad a lot when traveling. I've been using this thing so much. - It is nice, it's very nice. - It's so great, like I love it anyway-- - I don't own an iPad. - What? - I'm not sure, I'm gonna be allowed on this podcast anymore but, I'm sorry. - Well, you can use this one. - Am I allowed to talk about something else or no? - What do you mean? - Well, cause I have the Surface Pro X that I've just been using now like to carry around the house to watch Netflix and different shows. - You can do whatever you want Jenna. - Because I mean, it has a little Trackpad, which is why, when I went to do this older keyboard not having a trackpad really threw me off. - Yes iPad has a trackpad. - I love the iPad I just-- - Didnt knew iPad Magic Keyboard. - My stomach has rumbled I am hungry. - But didn't we just eat? - Three hours ago. - Here's the thing, I'm eating dinner and I'm already thinking about what I'm gonna have for breakfast. - Exactly. - And if I'm having dinner, like I will be thinking about dinner tomorrow like 'cause I don't want to eat the same thing that I have dinner today. - I had an incredible dinner last night. It was risotto and like roasted cauliflower so I need to give you my cauliflower recipe. - Okay. - Apparently now and this pandemic I've become a chef. - Because we have a Bravo oven. - Okay, it's true that's kind of like cheating. - It is cheating. - Yeah. - But its not. Its like this cauliflower it's the florets that I get from Whole Foods and I put some olive oil in a bowl I put some garlic powder, some paprika and some salt and I just mix it all up and I put it in the oven and it is perfect. - Do you like jalapeno at all, do you like spice? - No. - Okay well. - No. - I got some jalapeno olive oil I'm 95 now it's absolutely incredible I was making some eggs with it I also toasted a little toast in a frying pan-- - Oh, host did a little of a toast into the frying pan. - I am learning to be... Oops I hit the table, oh god, okay. - She told me to not touch the table. - Don't touch the table. you're touching the table with your leg. You're touching the table with your leg Jenna. - But my life hasn't been... - You touch it but it doesn't matter. - I have a running nose. - Oh my gosh. - Oh goodness. Okay so this is going moderately well. - Its going well. How long have we been recording? - Part of it feels like five years. - Does it feel like five years. Where's the timer that tells me how long I have been recording. Hey iPad, I don't wanna touch anything because I might mess it up. Normally if I did this on a MacBook I would record in logic but I really wanted to try to do this as simple as possible we plugged in the microphones and hit record. We did have to do a couple of takes. So you wanna do it with the right hand, huh? I can't, okay. - I think that mugs should have this on both sides like the handle on both sides cause like what if-- - What if? - What if I wanna just really-- I don't know. - Hold on I have something for you. - I had a sniffle, I'm so sorry. - That's okay. - Allergy season is well and my allergies have been just a nightmare. - Are you sure it's allergies? - Yeah I'm positive it's allergies. - Hold on. - Because I've lived with allergies for 30 years and every time in the spring-- - How old are you? - 30. - Where's my marker? - I'm getting up, Jesse has stood up. Which makes me very excited to talk about a new Dyson air purifier for my allergies. it's not here, no - Did you get that? - No and to forgot I may have put my address wrong so I should call them. - I also ordered a Logitech camera but I can't find the information of what email I used anyway hold on. - For the viewers who are just on the audio Justine has come back into the scene she has a sharpie marker. - Is this what I wanted? I don't know if this is what I wanted I'm not sure but we're gonna try so Jenna has a hashtag mug - I do (laughs). - Yeah, so this is the reason that I asked you what hand you write with oh no are you write with which hand you would use your mug with. - Right hand. - So that I could write your name on it. - Do we need mugs? There is nothing in the mug. - So-- - Have you spelled my name wrong? I didnt but this is smudging because this is not good, so don't touch the the front of it. - Okay. - This is really quality content, I promise no I'm not gonna promise I was gonna promise I mean... Set the mug down. - You said I had to be gentle (laughs) so this is being very gentle. - I was gonna promise them for... The next one would be better but honestly let's just-- - I've talked about very very interesting things I've talked about technology I've talked about current events I've talked about-- - How's your eyesight? - Okay (laughs). You know what? Another relative, relative? - Relative? - Relatable? - Jenna's relatable. - Another relatable topic, vision, I have been doing nothing but staring at screens I'll wake up, I'll look at my phone I look at my Nintendo switch, I'll go to my computer, I'll go to another tablet, I'll look at my TV before bed same thing, so in the gaming gaming monitor. My eyes have been hurting. - I had a migraine the other day like it was so terrible and it was definitely because I've just been on screen, - Exactly. - All day long. - It's really, really bad so on phone I have one of the invisible shield screen protectors that blocks out the blue light but I'm like-- - Get to put them on other screens. - How do I put this on everything else? I know. - Well a lot of the phone like even the new OnePlus one has the blue light blocking and the monitor that I have also has a blue light setting as well. So-- - Does it? There's a lot of-- - Which one? - It's the the Razer one. - Oh, that's smart. - I love this Razer. So this monitor is so cool, because I have three inputs, I have a USB-C going into my iMac Pro I have it going into the DisplayPort going into my PC and then I have the HDMI for Game capture so that goes into my Xbox or Nintendo switch. - Wow! - It's so great. - That's pretty aggressive. - People love multiple monitors but I don't. - Well now that I'm a streamer-- - Jenna is a streamer from - I have done stream, thank you very much I have been using the one LG monitor for the games and then the other one for like monitoring the chat and then I had my MacBook which is powering it all through the Elgato and then the but... It was a lot to look at so not only am I looking at one screen I was now looking at three different screens so. - I guess if I was doing streaming and stuff it makes sense but on this monitor you can also do the picture-in-picture. So I would have in the corner I would have like my Mac or my PC in the little like one of the corners so that I cud see if I had to hit record or stop but now I also have the iMac kind of sitting next to my computer it's like kind of recessed down. My little setup looks like a spaceship. - It does. - I sit down I like push one button in the light Elgato - The lights. - The lights come on, - Its magical. - I'm like am here. - I know you on some Zoom or conference calls together well I was in my space and you're on yours and I was like, \"Whoa, she looks cool.\" - What else should we talk about? - Well, what can we talk about? - Do we talk about the weather? It's been finally very very nice in Los Angeles. - Its really hot in this room right now. - So hot. - I'm a little sweaty. - I'm super-sweaty but the weather's been weird we had like a week full of rain it's been chilly but now it's a nice. I went outside yesterday and I tried to go for a run but it's really hard to run with the face mask. - Yeah, that's a problem. - And then I thought, am I gonna get a tan line from the face mask. - Yeah, it doesn't matter, no one's gonna see it. Who actually then, got make Youtube Videos - Yeah I was like wait a minute. - That's also a thing I've quit caring as much like you know what I don't think I'm ever gonna get a manicure again. - Oh, I'm gonna do my nails later. - They looked so bad. - They're really bad, I'm gonna give myself a manicure and I bought that like gel kit. - I don't think I'm going to. - You're not because I have it - Oh that's true. - You're not gonna do it. Yeah I definitely went, \"Go ahead whatever there's some gray hair here. That's hard thing to say. - Yeah let's not talk about it 'cause I don't you talking about mine either. - Don't look. - I am a natural blonde. - Yeah, okay. - But now I'm not, like people who've seen my hair color be like light and dark. I would like to talk about Animal Crossing though (sighs) for a minute before we close out our first podcast that we just basically are saying something. oh look I have an email. - You have an email Hi Justine... No, no this is my iPad now sorry. (laughs) She has given it to me. Animal Crossing, how hours have you logged? - I don't know, but the thing is I don't think that I have the ability to make these crazy beautiful islands like everybody has. Have you seen? - Just looks insane. - No! - I came over this morning to sell my cherries and I'm like, \"Has she done anything else?\" - No! - You have like these paths were those like custom stone designs? - So you unlock Terraforming after KK Slider comes in performance at your Island. - I just got KK Slider mentioned by Tom Nook. Oh my god, I hit my microphone (talks over each other) I need like a-- - Protective bubble? - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, Tom Nook just said. - So, Tom Nook. - We have to set up a camp site. My first visitor just came today. Am I supposed to say hi? - To the Campsite? - Yeah my sister say hi. - Did you use the Amiibo? - No. - No you have to talk to them. - Though I didn't, they've been here all day I haven't talked to them yet. - So everybody didn't make fun of me when I was obsessed with Amiibo. - Okay will you have 500 of them you don't need 500 Amiibo. - Yeah, but guess what people can't get now you can't get the Animal Crossing Amiibo cards and they're extremely expensive but-- - What about the other 450 ones you have? - Those don't work with the game but you're right it's completely unnecessary. - My gosh. - I don't wanna say that I have an addictive personality but I'm gonna have to say I do. - You definitely, I mean it's I get it 'cause I'm addicted to sugar. - Me too, that's the one thing that I'm trying very hard not to be. - I'm not trying very hard at all. But I love Cookie though. - So going back to the Amiibo you take the Amiibo and then you can invite those Amiibo characters to your Island - But only the Animal Crossing ones. - Yes. - Like I can't have Mario come to my Island - No but I think that you can actually invite them, maybe no 'cause... Have you gone to Harvey's Island yet? - Yeah, I didn't, it was weird. - It was a little strange. - I felt like I was about to be violated. (laughs) - I'm like this is like a me too story I felt super uncomfortable and I left. - He's like come into my room for photo shoot. - He's like, hey I've got this setup right here sit on the couch. - It was a little weird. - I was like absolutely not, I'm a strong independent woman and I'm gonna leave. - So She left. - I felt uncomfortable and I've never returned. - I never returned either but I've seen a lot of really cool stuff because you can basically use any props you can invite other amiibo you can invite other friends there. - Yeah that's what he was telling me and I was like you want me to bring my friends? you want me to subject my friends to this behavior? I was like I'm not coming back. I'm into it, I never came back though. - See, same brain but some of us make better choices than others. - Yeah, anyway I'm sweating. - Me too (laughs). - I'm starting to see floaters I think 'cause I feel like I'm gonna pass out. (both laugh) - Could you tap on my shoulder it feels inflamed now when I touch it. it's hurting. - We'll stop touching it. - What do you think it is? Did I hurt myself? Yes? - Well, as you get older. - Shut up! - Sometime injuries are more prone to happen. - I mean I was just doing a yoga class, what? - Don't I wouldn't admit that. you say you were like-- - Well it was just a sculpt class with weights. - Okay that's like a more intense yoga class. - Yeah. - I just bought boxing myths and boxing gloves and pads so you have to heal up so I can fight you. - I'm so into that. - Jab! - You guys are doing Muay Thai? - Jab, jab cross. - Please let the audience know I am jab, jab crossing. - Jenna's jab, jab crossing jab, jab cross, okay. - Oh no my shoulder. - Sure. Did you ever see it's called FightCamp? - No. - Have you seen that? It's like app boxing basically but it has like a big like stand-up punching bag and they're sensors in the gloves. - This is something I could have in my home? - Yeah. - Do you have it in here somewhere? - No, I don't have it but I've been looking at it 'cause I want to-- - App boxing? - Well there's an app but there's also like a big stand so it all connects together. - No way! - It's pretty cool. Should have been-- - I'm gonna be tweeting someone later sharing about App boxing. - Sliding into the Dms. - I have to become a fighter because Jne we don't know what's gonna happen the apocalypse is basically happening what if this turns into like fight or flight? I don't know how to fight. - I've ground fight you can start striking. One day, this is a funny story - Oh no! (both laugh) - Jenna was sitting at the desk I was setting up the lights and stuff and I turned it on before I said striking-- - I go, what does that mean? As I look up and then I get flash banged with like the brightest light ever I'm like okay I learn with that man. - You go, why didn't you tell me you were gonna turn it on? I said-- - Said striking - I said striking, hello! - I was Justine like saying, I'm turning the lights on, yeah, that was a mistake I will never forget. Now I'm traumatized every time you're like striking, I'm like please no, don't get me, don't get me. - Streaking? - Striking? - Striking. - Streaking? God, just wanna be playing Animal Crossing right now. - Me too I'm looking at my switch Its taunting me. - I can see it, I know it's like I'm salivating thinking about it. - I sold turn-ups see other day, our friend Howard's Island for what was like 480? Here's the problem. - Oh! - Don't even get me started on the Turnips scam - That drippy nose. - I have a drippy nose right now. - what is the-- - What's the name? - I can't even think okay anyway either way walking around sneezing and nose drips selling the Turnips. - Raid up Hugh life and I bought them for like 100 and something bells and then the rest of the week on my island they were like 40 bells, 38 bells 50, bells 98 bells. - Did you see the ants? - No I don't have ants, I'm clean I put my trash I recycle it. - No, no you leave the the rotten turnips out and then you get ants. - If I don't want ants? - Because it's so cool. - They caught a snapping turnips yesterday. - I'm so jealous - Have you gotten one? - No I've not. - Oh my gosh, it was one of those moments you feel like do I really want a fish? And I was like no, but it was big I'm like I should get it and it was a snapping turtle I was like oh my gosh this is incredible. - I am so glad that the egg day is over bunny day, the first couple of days, I'm like this is so cool and then if I have to shoot down one more freaking balloon and it's all furniture and it's a freaking egg I was losing my mind. - No, and I was doing the fishing tournament and-- - Oh, What did you get? I kept getting eggs. - A fish? No, an egg. - This is crap! They should have at least have it set so like if you're doing a fishing competition, no eggs. Very, very easy to put into-- - I don't wanna talk about it, I feel traumatized. - Me too. - All right, I think we're done now. - I'm sweating. - Honestly I could keep talking probably for quite a long time but since this is just a test to see what this looks like what it sounds like I know there's audio things that I need to do but I'm not doing it now 'cause this is a test this room is echoey I need to put maybe like some felt on the bottom of this cup - My nose is runny from my allergies. - We're also getting a lot of cross audio on each mic so there's some things we need to do and I'm aware of it so feel free to leave us any comments in wherever I don't know if you're listening to this how you'll send us, like tweet us if you're watching this on youtube you know how to use it (laughs). - I feel like I see most things on Twitter responses. - Me too. - @JennaEzarik. - @iJustine. - 'Cause I just scroll through Twitter all day long. - I get all my news from Twitter. - I like Twitter. - I don't know something else that's interesting is now that everything is sort of shifting to digital like I have a lot more time from not having to like drive to meetings everyone just does it on Zoom or does a call like that's a lot more practical. - It really is, one time we had a meeting in Burbank and it literally took me eight hours of my day for a one-hour meeting because it took me like an hour to get ready 45 minutes to get to your house an hour and a half to get to Burbank an hour for the meeting and then took me three hours from Burbank to my house 'cause it was like traffic. so I don't know if that was actually eight hours but yeah it's kind of crazy how much time we're saving and how much time I'm wasting playing Animal crossing - Animal crossing. You have to play War Zone with me. - I want to. - It is time of my life I've been playing every night with my friends for the past three weeks. - I'll play and then I start getting tired or hungry and then I have to go eat or I have to like harvest or something I don't know I keep getting emails. - This is what we do, we eat dinner and then we all meet up around like seven o'clock and we play for a couple hours and then we go to bed. - Oh, all right. - So you're invited, now they have quads so we've got space for you.

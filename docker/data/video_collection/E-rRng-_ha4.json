    "transcript": "- [MrMobile] If you live in the United States, you might know ASUS by its popular line of laptop PCs. But you might not know that the company also makes smartphones. Smartphones with their own visual identity. All original. Not at all inspired by anything else. I'm MrMobile, and this is a ZenFone 5 Hands-On from Barcelona. (music) If you're already clackin' out a comment about how not all notch phones are iPhones, I get it. From the essential to the week-o, plenty of devices out there need a gap in the display to accommodate the camera and the earpiece. And sure, there are only a limited number of ways to design a pocket-sized rectangle. But plenty of other companies manage to kick out their own designs, despite that reality, and when you put the ZenFone 5 next to the iPhone 10, I'm just sayin', it's hard to ignore all of the similarities. So, why cover it at all, right? Well, appropriated or not, the design is striking. And ASUS actually does build upon it in interesting ways. The secondary camera on the ZenFone 5, rather than being the more common telephoto or monochrome, is actually a wide-angle shooter. One of the rarest designs around and my personal favorite. ASUS is putting a lot of emphasis on the software driving that camera with scene detection and automatic calibration based on the lighting, but frankly, everyone's doing that. I'm more encouraged by another corner of the software. The company has finally gotten in line with so many others and removed the majority of pre-packaged bloatware that used to gum up the works on its earlier phones. Also, it's running the latest Android Oreo. The speakers have been redesigned to be much louder. The display brightness can crank all the way up past 500nit, and the processor is top shelf. And here's where I'd usually say to wait for the full review to see how the performance shapes up, but look, there's a lot of great phones out on the market already. And a ton more were just announced this week. With an exact launch date not yet hammered down at press time, and a history of thin availability in the US, the only reason you'd have for paying attention to an ASUS phone in North America is price. Half the price of an iPhone 10. So, if a $500 iPhone 10 running Android is the kind of thing that sees your saw, well, this might be worth praying to the US carrier gods for. For everyone else, it's probably not your next smartphone. This video was brought to you by Thrifter.

    "transcript": "- So, I dropped my iPhone 11. (laughs) - Oh, God! (phone crashes) (gasps) - So, in this clip, Sara was talking about how she had just dropped her phone in the forest playing laser tag. - I dropped this in the forest playing laser tag. - [Justine] We're here at Camera Cam, so there's a ton of creators here. There's so many fun activities and we've been having so much fun. So the fact that she first started with talking about how she dropped her phone. - Had to use Find My iPhone, and it was like, under grass. (leaves crunch) iPhone, come here. (iPhone pings) - [Male Voice] It's right here. - [Sara] I must've lost it when I was running, then. (iPhone pings) - [Male Voice] Boom! (Sara laughs) Miracle of miracles. - We took some slowfies, and then she decided to take a slowfie as well. And in this slowfie, I was like, \"This'll be great.\" You are running, - [Sara] Oh! - And then, I'm running behind you. - [Sara] We'll do like a \"Baywatch\" scene. - I'll just be chasing you. But little did I know that I was wearing these Lululemon leggings that just will not hold a phone in your pocket if you're running full-speed. And, not only did I have one phone, but I had two phones. - Chase scene! Oh, God! (phones crashes) (gasps) Oh, God! (phones crashes) (gasps) - [Male Voice] I guess take your pictures! - (laughs) Oh no! (gasps) - [Sara] Did you, is it cracked? - [Justine] I don't know! No! My old one! I made it over a year! Oh, my! Everything is so sad right now! - [Sara] Oh my God it's all my fault! - [Justine] I mean it's just like a small little scuff, and honestly I think I could probably like... Mm, I mean it survived the concrete. It didn't shatter! I haven't even had it for 15 minutes. - Let's blame the slowfie. So sorry, I'm so sorry! - I can't believe it! No, I mean, I do believe it. But yeah, I thought you guys would enjoy this because I feel like most of the iJustine memes are any time I have anything, most of the comments are like, \"I dropped my...\" insert whatever it was that I was talking about here. Anyway, this was a short little video. I've posted so many iPhone 11 videos, I hope that you guys have enjoyed them! And I'll probably have a few more coming up soon. But in the meantime, I'm going to finish up editing this video and finish up that bigger YouTuber roundup so look for that very soon. All right, I'll see you guys later, bye! (dramatic music)",

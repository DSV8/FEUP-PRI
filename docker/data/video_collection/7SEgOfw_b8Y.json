    "transcript": "So the problem with most giveaways is that there are too few phones and not enough countries represented. Today we're going to solve both of those problems. Let's get started. [Intro] The last time I did a giveaway, you guys were super funny down in the comments... each, you know, kind of individually crying in your own countries. I thought it was hilarious. Far too many giveaways are limited to just the United States. Or, you know, if they are international, the person winning has to pay a bunch of complicated taxes, which I don't think is fair. And I hate to say it, but some giveaways are even fake. But worst of all, is when there are too few phones being given away. That's definitely not the case this time around. So dbrand and I decided to buy a bunch of brand new phones, you know, unscratched and undamaged, to give them away to you guys. We've already applied the cool Teardown sticker on the back. You know, the one that has the insides of the phone exposed to the outsides, so you can see how it works without actually opening up your own phone. I'm going to be applying these stickers for days. We have 50 Pocophone F2's. And 50 iPhone SE's...the new ones. And each one of these are going to have the same stickers applied to the back. And both of these are extremely fairly priced phones that are very powerful. And yes, I did call the iPhone SE a fairly priced phone. Way more fairly priced than Apple's usual devices. Anyway, we're going to keep the giveaway super simple. Dbrand's really good at organizing these kinds of things, and the giveaway's going to be open worldwide, any country, and the winners will not have to pay any import fees, taxes, or duties. All of that will be paid by us. And most importantly, all of the winners will be verified and posted publicly in the link right below this video so there's absolute full transparency, and you know everything is legit. You know, kind of like how a government should be. All you have to do to enter the giveaway is follow me and dbrand on Twitter and Instagram. That's it. If you're already following, you're already entered. There's no crazy sign ups, no spam emails, no hidden steps, just a fun little giveaway from dbrand and I to 100 lucky winners. I'm pretty excited, 1) because this is the biggest giveaway I've ever done. And 2) these phones are taking up a lot of room on my desk and it's time for me to get rid of them. I'll leave a link for both of our Twitters and Instagrams down in the video description. And let me know down in the comments what country you're watching from, I'm curious. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

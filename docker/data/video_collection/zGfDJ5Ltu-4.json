    "transcript": "When you open the new Pixel Fold, there's kind of a stop before it gets to 180 degrees. You have to force it a little bit to get it all the way open. This is the new Pixel Fold, it costs a whopping $1,800, and it's Google's first foldable phone. The phone has a 5.8 inch outer screen, a huge 7.6 inch inner screen, and it's even IPX8 rated, which means you can dunk it in water if you want to. When you close it, it fold flat like a book with no visible gap between the two halves of the phone. That's something Samsung hasn't quite figured out yet. But I don't know, there's something about this extra push situation that makes me kinda queasy. It's an $1,800 phone. Would that make you nervous?",

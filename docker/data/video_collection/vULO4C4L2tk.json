    "transcript": "What's up guys? Lew here back with another video... ...and today I am checking out something...small. This is the Swiftpoint GT mouse: precision, ergonomics, ultraportable. Apparently, this thing is a C.E.S. Innovation Award winner. What does it have? O.K., so ergonomic, yeah... Scroll wheel, yeah. Ooh! \"Magnetic palm rest mat keeps your mouse close at hand while typing\". Bluetooth 4.0 or U.S.B. Windows, Android, Mac, iOS. Wow! Look at it, it's... ...look how small it is! Unbelievable. Do I need a knife? *mumbles* the ol' little knife Whoa... Comes in a nice little case as well. What's this? Ahhh this is your magnetic- your magnetic deal. Sticky pad on the back, you can put that on your laptop lid, ...and it's a place for your Swiftpoint GT. Ooh, that is...what? Look how tiny that is, Jack. Actually... More comfortable than I expected. This is your scroll wheel. Click...click. Alright, I get it. This is the receiver...where does this go? O.K., stores right alongside. Magnets again. Big magnet theme here. Ahhhh, I see. You can go \"Parking Spot\" as they call it. You can go with the palm rest mat. Put that on the palm rest of your laptop... ...and then you get a little folding mouse mat. *mumbles* probably something to peel off there. Interesting, yeah it is sticky but not... Let me see here. It's kind of like a friction-stick. Ahh, so there's a little stylus nib I guess that helps with the tracking. The tiny little nib there Let me ask you a question: *Directed offscreen* Nibs? Or regular licorice like Twizzlers? REALLY!? So I'm going to go like this... Ahh! That is...very strange *chuckles* Am I used to it? No, not yet. The little Swiftpoint GT, little mat. I'm gonna put it here. Whoa. This is the kind of thing where you're gonna have to adapt. Essentially your standard mouse click. What does the other one's gonna' probably be... ...right-click. Yup. That's a right-click. Let's try out the scroll-wheel real quick. Oh yeah, she scrolls. My hand feels like it's cramping already. *pained sound* Somebody with a smaller hand than mine? Or maybe I'm holding it... Oh, maybe it's more...Ohh, maybe it's more like... How was that guy holding it? Ohhh...you hold it like a pen. You know what that feels better. O.K. Hmmmm... Not bad. I don't know. What am I gonna to say? It's very hard... ...to adapt... ...to something...this miniscule. I don't know. If you've got a nice trackpad on your laptop... ...you're probably doin' just fine. That's my opinion. Does it suck? I mean it does the job. It's not for me. It's cool that they were able to fit it all in this tiny, little package. ...but... ...what can I say? It's not for me. \"O.K. we've got a photo.\" Ooohh! Oh my god! Oh my-",

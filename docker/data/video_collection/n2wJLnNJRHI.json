    "description": "Show Anker some love for making this iPhone 8 drop possible! Anker KARAPAX Shield+ Case for iPhone 8 / iPhone 7:  Anker KARAPAX Shield+ Case for iPhone 8 Plus / iPhone 7 Plus:  Apple claims that the glass on their New iPhone 8 is the Most durable glass ever on a smartphon. Thats a pretty bold claim!  Since apple is one of the largest smartphone manufactures on earth Its important that their phones can handle abuse.   This iphone 8 droptest, even with a small sample size, will give a general idea of what to expect if you were to ever drop your iphone on the ground. Will the iphone 8 survive a normal every day drop situation? Is the glass on the iPhone 8 more durable than on another type of smartphone? Like samsung?  One thing to take into consideration is that if you were to ever crack the glass on your samsung smartphone... the repair is very simple, and would only cost about 15 or 20 dollarsl for the replacement glass panel.  With the iphone... the glass panel does not come off. The glue is permanent. So the repair process will be MUCH more difficult.   iPhone 8 Durability Test video:  iPhone 8 Teardown:   Awesome iPhone Tool Kit:  Green Pry tool:  Metal phone opening tool:   The camera I used to film this video:  Wide angle lens:  And this Metabones adapter:  This is the drone I use:   *Follow me for updates!* Instagram:  Facebook:  Twitter:  Snapchat:  GooglePlus:   JerryRigEverything assumes no liability for property damage or injury incurred as a result of any of the information contained in this video.

    "transcript": "So I don't normally do drop tests on my YouTube channel, one is because they are super unpredictable. It's hard to make a drop test scientific unless you have multiple devices. But, they are still interesting. So when Anker reached out to me and said, Hey Jerry, we want to sponsor a drop test. We have a new case coming out called KARAPAX. We want to put it on one of your phones and see how the iPhone handles a drop. So today that's what we're going to do. We're going to drop test two iPhones. One's going to have the KARAPAX case from Anker on it, and one is going to be naked. And we'll see how durable Apple's new iPhone glass really is. Let's get started. [Intro] So just like with the Essential drop test, I have both phones over here, plus the case that we're going to be testing. And then on this side I have this phone recording in slow motion. This is the Galaxy Note 8 the clear version that I made a couple days ago. And then on this side over here I have the Galaxy S8 Plus also recording in slow motion. So I'll do a couple different drop tests. One, sliding it off my knee, seeing how it handles the concrete. And then from waist height, and then chest height. I did a poll on Twitter a couple of days ago actually, asking what the common height distance was for a drop when you guys drop your phones, and waist height seemed to be the most common. So I'll probably do a couple different drop tests at that level to get a good idea if the iPhone 8 will survive a normal drop. So this is the KARAPAX case. It has two layers to it: an outer hard plastic layer, and an inner rubber layer for impacts and drops. And it looks like it has the dual protection where it counts, on the corners and the sides. So both of these phones are fully functional and brand new. Both of them are in very pristine, out of the box, condition. The gold one's going to be falling naked, and the silver one is going to be falling with the KARAPAX case from Anker intact, protecting it. If you remember from my durability test yesterday, everything underneath this glass is solid metal, so it gives it a lot of structural rigidity. But there is a circle right here in the center for the wireless charging port. And that's a hollow point where there is no metal behind the glass. So if, hypothetically, your phone drops on a rock in this center panel, it has a lot less protection and structure than it would if the rock hit somewhere up here where there's a metal backing to it. I know it's impossible to plan how you drop your phone in the future, but if you can avoid this circle in the center, that would be ideal. One more thing is that if you look at the back corner right here along the edge, there's a plastic ring around the inside of the metal, and this will give it a little more cushion against drops and impacts. Apple paid a lot of attention to this design. There's also a little bit of plastic right here along the edge of the screen, and that will give it some cushion because glass is really hard and metal is really hard, but plastic has some give to it. So as long as there's a cushion layer between the two hard materials, it should last a little bit longer in a drop. But I think we've done enough talking and it's time to get dropping. Alright, so both cameras are rolling, and we are just going to stand up. [The sound of dreams being crushed] Take a look at this one first. The screen is fine. The metal is fine. The back glass is fine. Alright, we're good to go. Looks like the KARAPAX case is fine. Looks like all four corners are good, just a small little divot in the plastic right here. But the screen is still functioning. Let's do it a little bit higher up. So now we're going to do it from waist high and this is where most people said that they drop their phones from. Probably when they are pulling it out of their pocket. [The sound of Hearts being broken...] So it looks like the back panel is fine so far. We have some small dings up here at the top of the corner, but the screen is still fine, which is good. And the back glass is still fine. With the KARAPAX case, the front is still fine, obviously. That's probably the only part that's not protected. So as long as there are no rocks that penetrate the glass, I think we're still good. The corners are still good. Having a case with a hard plastic corner and the rubber underneath with the two layers of protection is a good thing. Let's do another waist high drop. [The sound of buying college textbooks] Alright the front is still working. There is a little damage on the corner there. The glass is still good. And on the KARAPAX from Anker, a little damage on the plastics, but that's probably normal, you know, concrete and plastic don't mesh well together. But it's still better the plastic of your case, than the metal of the phone. Let's go again from waist height. We'll do it two more times. We'll drop it directly on the side like this. [The sound of homework on the weekend] [... a holiday weekend] Oh dang it. Right there. Right there on the corner of the screen we have some damage. The screen still functions though, but it cracks all the way from the home button over here to the edge of the glass. The metal is a little bit scuffed up on the side. But the KARAPAX is still fine. The screen is still working and that's about what we expected. A case is going to protect a phone against drops way better than no case. So since this phone is already broken, let's do it from the back, face down, and we'll do it from about chest high. [Watching the 2017 USA Presidential Election] Looks like the KARAPAX, the front screen is still working. We'll take the case off really quick and check out the back cover since it hit really hard on the back. The back is still 100% fine. Let's check out the gold one. We have a lot more damage on the screen but that's probably because the glass was already compromised on the last drop. And then the back also roasted. I don't know if this is the most durable glass ever on a smartphone. It only took a couple drops to destroy the back and the front glass. I would say treat this like any glass phone and don't trust it with any kind of drop at all. Or better, if you're the type of person who's ever dropped your phone before, or might drop it in the future, a case is a fantastic idea. I'll do a couple more with the case just for kicks and giggles. Alright we'll try from head height. [The sound of Glorious protection...] Head height everything is still good. So I'm about 6 feet tall. I'll lift it all the way above my head and drop it from there. That gives us about 8 or 9 feet of height. Woo! [The sound of NOT stepping on a Lego.] So we dropped it from about 9 feet. The back of the case is pretty hashed, but the point of the case isn't to have a pretty case, the point of a case is to have a pretty phone. And the back is still fine and the front is still fine. Let's see if it still works. It's pretty impressive. I give a thumbs up to Anker for sponsoring this video, as well as having a fantastic case for the the iPhone 8. I'll put a link in the video description for this case if you want to get one for yourself. Obviously we've seen that is works. It protects the front and the back during drops from chest and waist height. So Anker did confirm that this supports wireless charging and you can tell the cutouts are perfect for the camera, the mute switch, the volume buttons - they still feel pretty clicky. And down here at the charging port as well. I'm sure if there was a headphone jack there would be a port for that as well on the case, but there's not. Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you around.",

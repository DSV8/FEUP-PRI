    "transcript": "in this video I'm going to show you how to use airmon-ng to discover Wi-Fi networks around you and then de-authenticate clients connected to a specific Wi-Fi network so that we can capture the four-way handshake I'll show you how to open up the capture in Wireshark and look at the four-way handshake and see the Wi-Fi password but probably the part that most people are interested in is I'm going to show you how to crack the Wi-Fi password may this be a warning to you and your family why you should use good Wi-Fi passwords I'm going to show you some of the issues using WPA 2 and why you probably want to use WPA 3 today if at all possible you also want to make sure that you use good passwords don't use weak passwords don't use passwords like I'm going to show you in this demonstration don't use passwords like your telephone number it's amazing how many people still use bad passwords today I'll also show you how to use Wifite to crack the Wi-Fi network Wifite is basically a script that combines a whole bunch of tools together to make it much much easier to crack Wi-Fi networks but I'll show you in this video how Airmon-ng and Wifite can be used to crack a WPA 2 network but fails to crack WPA 3 use WPA 3 if you can also look at using Wi-Fi 6 use 5 GHz and 6 GHz far fewer devices support those frequencies however but they give you more bands so better WI-FI and it's less likely that someone using a basic adapter like this will be able to crack those networks because this only supports 2.4 GHz I'll also show you in this video how you can use Mist to download packet captures from an access Point's point of view so when there's an authorization failure wrong password is used what do the Wireshark captures look like so I'll show you those as well in this video so for this demonstration I'm going to be attacking a Mist Wi-Fi network this is an AI powered Wi-Fi network but if it's badly configured hackers will still be able to attack that Wi-Fi network so I'll show you later in the video how you can improve the Wi-Fi security of a Mist Network or even just a standard home network a lot of the principles still apply I really want to thank Juniper for sending me their Wi-Fi access points as well as sponsoring this video to help you learn the issues with poorly configured Wi-Fi networks and how to better secure them. Now that's enough talking let's get started now in this demonstration I'm using a alpha network adapter the problem with this adapter is it only supports 2.4 GHz you do get other Wi-Fi adapters like this this supports 5 GHz as an example and Wi-Fi 6E Alpha not sponsoring this video I purchased this adapter myself but Alpha did send me this adapter and other adapters I really like the alpha adapters very very good adapters recommended by a lot of people so what I'll do is plug this Alpha adapter into my computer and on my computer you can see it says new USB device detected connect to host or connect to Virtual Machine what I'll do here is connect it to my Kali virtual machine and click okay now for this demonstration I'm using Kali Linux within a virtual machine in this example it's VMware workstation Pro which is now free on a Windows 11 computer now you could use Kali natively question that always seems to come up is people ask do I need to buy an external Wi-Fi adapter that really depends if you're using a Virtual Machine like I am then you're going to need an external Wi-Fi adapter but if you install Kali natively as an example you may be able to crack Wi-Fi networks just using the built-in Wi-Fi adapter the reason I'm using this and the reason why there's always a caveat or an issue with Wi-Fi adapters is Wi-Fi adapters need to support monitoring mode and injection mode so you need a Wi-Fi adapter that supports those two things monitoring and injection so your built-in Wi-Fi adapter can be used if it supports packet injection and monitoring mode so in Kali I've got a terminal open and if I use the command cat/etc/os-release you can see that for this demonstration I'm using Kali version 2024.1 now depending on when you're watching this video there may be a newer release of Kali Linux just use the latest release uname -a also shows me that I'm using Kali Linux here do you have to use Kali no it just makes it a lot easier to do these demonstrations Kali has a lot of built-in tools that you can use for ethical hacking now it's really important that I say this only attack Wi-Fi networks that you own or have permission to attack I have given myself permission to attack this wi-fi network Juniper have given me this access point so this is an access point that I own and I've given myself permission to attack it now my team has created an amazing PDF that you can use if you want a nice reference so I'll link that below it shows you what you need so as an example VMware or virtual box so Wi-Fi adapter that supports monitor mode and your own access point that you can attack as an example the commands that I'm going to demonstrate here are available below this video so the commands and other information are available in that PDF but I'm going to run you through the commands here let's see if the Wi-Fi adapter is discovered so if I type ip addr in Kali you can see that WLAN 0 is shown there are different ways to do this another way is to use iw dev this shows you your Wi-Fi adapters you can see the interface is WLAN 0 and what's important to note here is it's in managed mode if you're used to Old the commands IW config may still work it works on Kali Linux notice WLAN 0 is in managed mode we are going to turn this into monitor mode to attack Wi-Fi networks we're going to use Airmon-ng to enable monitor mode but before we do that I'm going to kill any conflicting processes so put in my password you can see the WPA supplicant was killed be careful when you turn a adapter into monitor mode it'll kill your internet connection so in this case it's not a problem because here I've actually got an external Wi-Fi adapter that I'm doing the attacks on and I've also got a built-in ethernet connection which is basically the connection from VMware to Windows which gives me internet access so I could as an example ping google.com from this virtual machine but just be aware that if you don't have two adapters if you enable monitor mode on your adapter you won't be able to connect to the internet anymore okay so with that being said let's enable monitor mode by using sudo which gives us root privileges airmon-ng start wlan0 so previously the interface name was wlan0 now if I use the command iw dev as an example notice the interface type is monitor and the interface name is now wlan0mon old command IW config shows something similar interface is wlan0mon the mode is now monitor mode so the interface name has changed in Linux there's always different ways to do things so you could just use the command airmon-ng as an example to see that the interface is now wlan0mon just use whichever command you prefer iw dev is the new command okay so we want to discover Wi-Fi networks around us so we're going to use the command sudo which gives us root privileges again airodump -ng wlan0mon press enter and a whole bunch of Wi-Fi networks are displayed I'll stop that now by pressing contrl C this is the network that we're going to attack so on this access point I've created two SSIDs demo Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz WPA3 and WPA2 and I want to show you you how I can attack WPA 2 but won't be able to attack WPA3 so what we want to get here is we want to get the BSSID name so copy that we want to get the channel information so that's Channel 11 and the name of the Wi-Fi network so grab that information and store it somewhere so I've stored it here in a text file as an example BSSID channel number and the ESSID now it's really important that you actually understand what you're doing rather than just being script kitty as some people would say so let me explain some details here the BSSID is the MAC address of your access point the power is the signal strength so notice this number -38 is showing that this wi-fi network has a much greater strength than say another Wi-Fi network at the top here being -86 so in the attached PDF notice we've got signal strength information as reported by the Wi-Fi adapter so around -40 is a good signal around 55 average signal 70 is a week signal 80 to 90 lower limit of signal strength this is the channel number 2.4 GHz we're only going to see a small number of channels many more channels available in 5 GHz and 6 GHz as an example here we can see the encryption used so WPA2 using CCMP as the cipher here we can see a network using WPA that's really bad and here we can also see open networks that aren't using encryption ideally today you should be using WPA3 so notice this demo Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz WPA3 network is using WPA3 CCMP as the encryption much better again to use WPA3 versus WPA2 okay so that's interesting but let's actually launch an attack because that's probably what most people interested in we're going to use the command sudo for root privileges airodump -ng we're going to write the output to a Wi-Fi capture file so this is just a name of a file you could change that to something else the channel That We're attacking is channel 11 which we previously discovered the BSSID is the MAC address of the Wi-Fi network that we previously discovered and this is the interface that we're going to use so running that command now we can see at the moment that no clients are connected we can see the ESSID and at the top here we're not seeing a capture of the four-way handshake so what we're going to do is we're going to open up another window and we are going to deauth clients on that access point so sudo for root privileges aireplay -ng deauth 0 we're going to deauth all clients and we not going to stop deauthing so continuous deauthing of the MAC address of the access point make sure that you substitute this with your Mac address so the MAC address that you're attacking and then the Wi-Fi interface wlan0mon okay put in my password and as you can see deauth also being sent to the access point so to make sure that we get a capture we're going to connect to that Wi-Fi network so I'll connect to the Wi-Fi network and what you can see here is a WPA handshake has been captured so what happens is when I connect to the WPA 2 Network notice a handshake is captured on Kali but my client keeps getting bumped off that Network so the connection is failed to WPA2 and it actually ends up connecting to WPA3 because it's knocked off WPA2 so the client was knocked off the network and we captured the handshake and that's what we need to crack it okay so now that we've captured the handshake we can stop the deauth attack and we can stop airodump -ng type ls here notice we see the capture so there's the capture cap file and we can simply use Wireshark now to open up that capture and I'll use & so that I can get control back so in Wireshark there will be a lot of information here but let's filter for the handshake so notice here we can see Mist authenticating the client we can see our client EAPOL message message 1 or 4 here's two and that's going to be a reply back from the client to the AP so that's what we're interested in so if we look at the 802.1x authentication and we scroll down notice WPA key data and here we've captured the key from the client to the AP which we now can decrypt so what's really nice here is you can see all the communication between the client and the AP and then capture the four-way handshake okay so let's go back one thing you probably want to do is stop monitor mode so we use the command sudo airmon -ng stop wlan0mon so now if I do iw dev notice the network interface is back to being WLAN0 and is managed so we've changed it from monitor mode to managed mode if you don't do this you won't be able to use this interface for normal internet surfing as an example okay so that's nice but we probably want to crack this password found in that file now there multiple ways to do this you could use a dictionary attack or you could use brute force I'll put a link to a video below that shows you how to use GPUs to do a brute Force attack against a Wi-Fi password but all we're going to do in this example is use a word list Kali has a bunch of word lists so if I search for word lists a whole bunch of them are shown here and I'm asked whether I want to extract the rockyou dictionary or word list and the answer is going to be yes this file is using gzip so that I can use it to crack the Wi-Fi network and to do that we going to use the command aircrack -ng the capture file which is that the word list we're going to use is user word lists rockyou so just to make that clear I'll clear the screen the capture file that we've captured that would be the name of the file that you have and the word list we're going to use is rockyou and I mean that took seconds notice there's the command it's reading the packets it's decoding them and password used here was spiderman really bad password don't use bad passwords even if you've got an amazing wi-fi system this is a missed AI system if it's badly configured people will be able to crack your network use strong passwords use uppercase use lower case use special characters make it long 20 characters in length or longer 25 30 if you can don't use simple passwords like this you saw how simple that was to crack now that's an example of a really poorly configured Wi-Fi network on the the Juniper Mist interface I can go and look at my network so here's the demo Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz WPA2 Network and here's my password really bad idea once again to use psk with such a poor password you in an enterprise are going to want to use 802.1X with a radio server to make your network much more secure but let's have a look at the other network which is WPA3 so I've also got a WPA3 network configured with a really bad password of spiderman let's see if we can crack that one so back on Kali let's first demonstrate the sudo script kitty way of doing it so I'm going to use wifite to attack the Wi-Fi network wifite basically does a lot of the work for you it enables monitor mode it's already done that it shows you the Wi-Fi network so here's the demo Wi-Fi network using WPA2 here's the network using WPA3 what I'll do is I'll attack the WPA version 2 Network just to show you how easy it is to crack using wifite so I'm not going to use pmk ID I'm going to continue attacking in this case looking for a handshake so this is very similar to what we did with airmon-ng what I'm going to do is get this phone to connect to the WPA2 Network and as soon as it did that notice the password was captured and it's using the probable word list here to get the password which is spiderman so if you were doing this as an attacker you would just wait for a client to connect to the network obviously here I'm speeding things up by get the client to connect to the network straight away notice how easy it was to crack that network again by trying to crack the WPA3 network so I'll stop this and in this case it's going to be Network 2 so this WPA3 network I'm going to stop the pmk ID attack and press continue and now on the phone I'm going to connect to the network to WPA3 and notice here it says failed to crack handshake did not contain a password so if I type ls and go to the HS folder here type ls notice there is the capture for WPA2 here's the capture for WPA3 here it's attacking that Wi-Fi network if I search for EAPOL it's got the capture so the forward handshake has been captured here but it's not able to crack the password let's try and do it the old fashion way so aircrack -ng the file and we'll use the rockyou password and notice it says unsupported version key encountered WPA3 not yet supported so it tries to attack it but can't crack that not support it so I've now shown you two ways to crack a WPA2 Wi-Fi network we used airmon-ng the hard way then I used wifite which basically combines a bunch of tools together and makes it much easier I was able to crack that password when this access point is using WPA2 but I'm not able to crack it when it's using WPA3 so in the real world look at WPA3 the only problem with WPA3 is not all clients can support it so what you might have to do is put your older clients on a separate network so put them on a WPA2 Network as your insecure Network and put your important clients on a WPA3 network and look at using 5 GHz and 6 GHz this network adapter can't see 5 GHz or 6 GHz networks as an example so someone would have to invest in a more expensive network adapter to attack you the whole idea was ities just put up barriers make it harder for an attacker to attack your network look at using WPA3 look at using 5 GHz 6 GHz look at very good passwords strong passwords don't use passwords like spiderman in Juniper Mist's portal going to monitor service levels we'll be able to see things that are taking place so as an example notice here Galaxy S22 Ultra authorization and Association that's happening a lot in a very short amount of time something's wrong here notice de-association authorization and association a whole bunch of messages like that and then the client was able to successfully access the network so I'm going to run the deauth attack again on the client I'm going to try and connect to that Network and what's happening all the time is it's getting disconnected connection failed on Juniper Mist system we can see this happening a lot time is 12:57 about and notice all these authorization and association messages have happened in the last few seconds a whole bunch of them taking place the client can't connect to the network under badge here we can also see where there's been an authorization failure so the pixel 7 had the wrong password as an example and what's nice here is we're told that there's been an authorization issue psk failed so wrong password and what's really nice is you can download a packet capture and look at that and you'll be able to see association request association response and other messages so what I really like about the Mist system is you can download packet captures very very easily for example for authorization failures or association failures you can download those packet captures and see what's going on okay I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please like

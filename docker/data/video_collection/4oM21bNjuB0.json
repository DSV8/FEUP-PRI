    "transcript": "This one goes out to all my wired headphone lovers. Why do the mics on Bluetooth headphones sound so bad? You're hearing my voice through the second-gen AirPods Which look identical to the first gen AirPods. That were revolutionary because well, Bluetooth. But that technology is also incredibly limiting because Even on the third-gen AirPods Bluetooth has to transmit a lot of data in real-time. Which sadly it's not incredibly good at. So whether you use these AirPods or you're using... The second-gen AirPods Pros. Well, your mic quality it's going to be downgraded. That's because all of these AirPods they use the same Bluetooth codec. A way of compressing and decompressing or packaging and unpackaging your audio data. Though some headphones, as you just heard, are a little bit better at this process than others. But regardless, A wired connection, at least for now, is going to sound a hell of a lot better. So your friend that loves these, they may be onto something. Anyway, I'm Becca. I'll see you in the next one.",

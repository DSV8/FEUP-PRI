    "transcript": "- I'm picking up a frequency right now with my hat. Oh, it's, it's, conspiracy time. Hello and welcome to this is, we're on the same wavelength. Same wavelength. - You shouldn't, no, we shouldn't be able to be on the same wave. - Touch hats. - No, ew. - Touch my hat. Yeah, there we go. (laughs) - Did you just steal my intro? Hello and welcome to This is, today we're going to be talking about the biggest, not biggest, because these are kind of whatever. Put the conspiracy theories that have plagued the tech world. - No, no, no, that's not how you do this. Do you know what the man's not telling you? Have you ever wondered exactly why my tin foil hat has a very weird curve on the top? Have you ever wondered where 5G comes from? Why your iPhone loses performance? Or why everything you know and love is a virus? (laughs maniacally) You're going mad with power Matthew. Mad I tell you. All right, hit me with the conspiracy. This is a video, before we even get started. And of course you've already rang-a-lang the ding-a-ling bell, all that kind of stuff, right? Before we get started, this is a video that we've talked about for a very long time because conspiracy theories have been around for as long as theories have been around. - Yeah. - Right? People have ideas. Almost all of these ideas have some kind of basis in reality, right? Get a little kernel of truth and you spin it out into whatever you want, right? - Yep. - Today, we are going to do our best to get demonetized by YouTube because we're going to cinch up our tinfoil hats and take a deep dive down conspiracy alley, featuring tech. - So while you guys were actually working, like you and Ken were shooting videos and stuff, I was just browsing the internet, like I normally do. - Don't do that, Matt. Don't get on the internet, it's a bad place. - I love going down the Reddit rabbit hole. And I found three tech conspiracy theories for you. - Okay, hit me, what you got? - The first one is: planned obsolescence. The idea that a company would be so nefarious, - So nefarious. - so cynical, - Cynical. - that they would put a little timer in your device that, when the clock strikes zero, it just falls apart on you. - That's actually not a conspiracy theory. That actually has happened on multiple occasions. - Correct, correct. - So there's actually, I was listening to an episode of Planet Money recently, which yes, I know I listen to NPR because I'm an old guy. - No, that's like the millennial thing to do now, is his watch. - Planet Money, I got to know where I got to put my bonds in the market and other things like that. Essentially HP, a few years ago, had a timed bomb inside a firmware update for the printers. Essentially, if they detected that you were using non authentic ink, it had like September 16th or whatever as the day that every one of their printers that had the firmware update, which it automatically downloaded, it went, \"Oh, I'm just printing garbage. You need to replace me.\" And they're essentially using it to sell more printers. Now, to be fair, they did settle the lawsuits. So we'll never know exactly how much they - I mean. - ruined your device. But it's true. That's a real story. But there are also slightly more realistic examples of planned obsolescence. There has been a pretty much constant stream of lawsuits against Apple for this very thing for many years. Now, I will actually say, if I move my tinfoil hat up to a more presentable angle, I actually don't think Apple is a particularly bad offender when it comes to this. Now the big thing was definitely the battery gate conspiracy. Essentially what happened was, when the batteries started to lose performance, iPhones were crashing. Now, this is not a crazy thing to think about, right? So essentially the processor inside the phone would spike up when you load a webpage or you do something that's a little more demanding, it would spike up and ask for the full amperage of what the battery could sort of provide. As the batteries got older and older, sometimes those spikes would be more than the battery could handle. The processor would shut down, the entire phone would crash. This was the thing, especially if it was the iPhone sixth generation, a lot of people when you had slightly older batteries, the phone would just randomly crash a lot. Now the way to fix that was essentially pushed a software update, unbeknownst to everyone, right? Unbeknownst to everyone that when it detected a used battery that was below whatever the threshold they had set, it would limit the power of your processor. So essentially, instead of being able to throttle all the way up, it would instead hit 80% speed or 90% speed or something. Which would be fine, as the way they do it now because you have a little like battery health thing and iOS app and it will tell you exactly what's going on. But when they first pushed this update out, you had no idea. All you would know is that your geek bunch score was a little bit slower. You were losing some performance but there was no actual reason behind that. Which, kind of shady. And they've been sued many times about that. So I guess the difference is Microsoft releases Windows which runs on basically everything and even systems that ran Windows 7, as long as you upgrade, it still works. But most other devices, I mean, once your Android phone manufacturer stops giving you updates, which is 15 minutes after you purchased the phone, unless you're willing to route it and to find a custom rom, you're not going to get updates. Apple does a better job. On the Mac side, Macs are usually not supported for more than seven years or so. - That's, yeah. Well, that's, that's what I just like always found fascinating with the, 'cause people are pissed off about Apple because of this, like, of the battery thing. But Apple's also really the only company that says we're going to update these phones for the next five years. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So on the Mac side of things, you don't have the same flexibility as Windows, right? If you're running a eight year old Mac or whatever, you're probably not able to update all the way. You may get a security update, very rarely, but that's it. On the phone side though, Apple does do a good job of supporting their devices for much longer than pretty much anyone else, right? I mean, you will get full day in date updates on an iPhone that could be five, six years old, right? I mean, I think the 6s still gets updates and that phone came out in 2015? - Yeah. So that's like, it's also like technically saying, \"We're going to support this for X amount of, you know, how many years.\" That's technically planned obsolescence. - Sure. - There's a roadmap of when we're going to stop supporting it. And when it's not supported, the app store doesn't work. - That's actually not entirely true. - It's not entirely, you're right. My dad is running into this right now. - Yeah. - That he can't get the latest Zoom updates because he's on the original iPad. So he was able to get Zoom. - Wait, wait, what? - Yeah, my dad's on the original iPad. He's just like, \"Oh, this, this works for what I want it for.\" I don't think he could get Microsoft Teams. - That thing's running like iOS 5 or something. - Something like that. So it only partially works right now. Which is again, that's technically planned obsolescence. - Yeah. It's understandable, of course, we're not all using 1984 Macintoshes. It's not like they continue to update and support them. So there's obviously some element of this which we all expect. But if we tighten our tinfoil hats, there is something to the idea that certain products do lose support much quicker. And specifically, in the case of the Apple thing, the battery gate thing was an actual issue. - Yes. - It really is only an issue because they didn't communicate it, right? I think as long as you're being upfront and honest about it, it's understandable that as the device gets older, you're going to lose performance, right? That makes sense. The fact they were doing this without people knowing it, that actually was not a conspiracy theory. That's just actually not right. - As soon as you're doing it in the shadows, it's just like suddenly so much more nefarious. - Wait, did you say \"doing it in the shadows\"? - I said \"doing it in the shadows\". - Oh, this is getting very shadowy. - We're doing it in the shadows. - Oh. Oh wow. - Our next conspiracy theory comes from... No, now you're just illuminating me. (laughs) - I'm the- - This episode of This Is is brought to you by tom foolery. Thanks tom foolery, for giving us the incentive to do dumb things. - So the real reason we're wearing these tinfoil hats, is because we don't want the 5G waves to enter our brains. - Is Bill Gates reprogramming my neural cortex right now? Oh no! Look, this is a conspiracy theory of the stupidest proportions. - And this is one that has been going like, as long as cell phones have been going on. This is one that I've heard every generation of cell phone. - Are you saying that your mind control chip doesn't work on 3G anymore? That's unfortunate, Matt. - When cell phones came out, the theory was that you were just going to have these giant tumors on your face. From where you, from the big, the Zack Morris phones - 5G supposedly gives you all manner of terrible things. It could give you cancer, could cause all kinds of of stupidness. Now, the reason the people quote, why 5G, or 4G before it, or even people who are afraid of things like WiFi and TV signals, and Better Call Saul is a great example of that idea of when it's like radio, - It was electromagnetic waves. - There you go, yes. There is a little bit, as with most conspiracy theories, there's a little kernel of truth here, in that all radiation exists on a spectrum, right? The thing is, it sounds very scary when you think about like, Oh, gamma rays and all this kind of stuff, but the other thing, - Creates the Hulk. - Yes, that does, that's a confirmed scientific fact that you can Hulk yourself. But the thing is, you know what's also on the electromagnetic spectrum? Visible light. And I don't think people consider that to be this evil cancer causing thing. So essentially what radio waves, based on their frequency, are larger or smaller, right? And certain frequencies can certainly cause cancer, right? That actually is a thing. That's called radiation. That is not good for you. What you don't have to worry about are things that are non-ionizing, right? These are radio waves that pass through us every single day, tinfoil hat or not. There are radio waves that pass through all of us for our entire lives. That is fine. That is normal. I can confirm, it's okay. It's not part of Bill Gates' evil cabal of conspiracy mongers who are trying to take over the world. That's just the way things are. So I'm sorry to let you down conspiracy heads, but 5G? Totally fine, unlike this video. - Living in California, if you go to any location whatsoever there's a giant plaque that says, \"Hey just being in this area will-\" - Cause cancer. - \"Will cause cancer.\" I'm not even making that up. Like that's just like, - Prop 65 my friends, look it up. - So it's, it's everywhere. But like the idea that like 5G specifically, like people are like chopping down and burning 5G towers. - So stupid. - But like the same thing happened with like 4G. There's a bunch of dumb Luddites that just think that this is gonna just going to like fry their brain. And Luddite is your word of the day. - Whoa, we do words of the day? - Yeah. - Awesome Matt, happy, funky word of the day. Wait, hang on, let me, wait. I got tuned into a new frequency. Matt, I'm sensing something. I'm sensing something. (hums) Is it time for a lighting change? Ah, it's bright. Oh, my eyes. My eyes. Oh, is that Unix? Unix is a virus. Ah! - Okay, all right. Now that we've cut back down to earth. Matt, can you tell us about our final conspiracy of the day while I try to fix my very ill fitting tinfoil hat? - Okay, so this is probably the most conspiracy of the conspiracy theories. - Okay, go for it, hit me. - Unix. - Unix. - The operating system? I'm not a tech. I'm a tech? I'm not a tech guy. - You've got the tinfoil hat on. You can tell me whatever you want about Unix and I'll believe you right now. - So Unix was an operating system developed by Bell Labs in the '70s. So Bell Labs is AT&T - Yeah, yeah, back in the olden days. - Back in ye olden days, in the 1800s. Well, I mean, at the '70s, it was also the same. But Unix was designed in-house. - Right. - For Bell Labs for their computer mainframes. - Okay, got it, makes sense. - The theory is that Unix was actually a super elaborate computer virus. - Okay. Designed to be super cheap and portable to spread to as many user systems as possible. - Okay, to do what? - Be so insecure and unreliable (laughs) - Wait, this is, Linux people made this up. Linux people made this up. - That it would require ATT&T, it would require users to come back to AT&T to support and upgrade their systems, which they were super reliant on. - There are a lot of layers here. - Yes. - First of all, you realize that Unix is from the '70s. There were no such thing as personal computers back then, they were just mainframes. - Yes. - So there's nothing small, cheap, affordable or spread everywhere. - Not entirely true. - There were also like five computers that existed, so a computer virus is not particularly useful. - Like with all the other conspiracy theories, there is like a kernel of truth to this. - AT&T likes to make money. - Yeah. - That checks out. - So when they first developed Unix, it was one of the only like multi-user interface. Like the only way that you could, multiple users could access a mainframe. So that was popular. But again, it was developed for in-house, but when they published a paper on it like, \"Here's what we did.\" A bunch of other organizations and companies really wanted it. Now because of a deal, or because of like a legislation, I don't know what would you want to call it. But basically for anti-trust reasons, - Okay. - Bell Labs was not allowed to sell it commercially. Basically they couldn't sell it because it wasn't classified in the telecommunications. - Sure. - Which kind of crazy to say now because you just it's like all it's not synonymous. - Well, the tech space was so much smaller back then, right? I mean, there were like five companies in the entire space, you know, think like IBM or whatever, right? Like, and there are a couple companies and they did everything because no one had computers. This was such a small and nascent space. - So, there was more and more people getting computers. And these aren't, we're not talking about personal computers, we're talking about - Mainframes. - So what Bell Labs did is they sold companies' media. - Oh, sounds suspicious. - Which I could not find the price of media in 1970. - A lot. - It was still a lot, but... - A hard drive was like, came was like a refrigerator size. - It was tape, it was magnetic tape. So whatever the cost of the magnetic tape was, plus shipping and handling, because they always get you on the shipping and handling, $19.95. - That's not a conspiracy theory. That's just true. - Yeah. But so they just so happened to include Unix on that media. So you bought, - Oh, so it's like you buy the hard drive and the secret evil computer virus comes for free. - Yes. And so when they finally were able to license it, the licensing, the reason it was so popular, it was portable. So it was one of the first OS's written in C so it meant it could be installed on almost any system. - Sure. - Whereas the original Unix was only on the whatever big tape computers they had. When they rewrote it for C, pretty much, no matter what system you had, there's only like a handful of lines of code. So it could be on everything. - I don't understand how this is a conspiracy theory though. - Where it gets nefarious, - Oh! Ring the bell, nefarious time. Go ahead. - Is Bell Labs was doing this against the will of AT&T. - Ooh. Okay, okay. So the subsidiary, the secret skunk works lab, are cooking up an evil computer virus without their big brother company knowing - Specifically the shareholders. - Shareholders have nothing. - Specifically the lawyers. - Yeah, never tell the lawyers anything. - That was, the lawyers are the ones who said that. Like they had a very strict policy. And so they did start licensing this out and anyone could license it, but like you said, it's very strictly regulated, it's a closed source, like. - Sure. - Whatever. But it was about the equivalent of about a hundred thousand dollars to license it. - Woo, that's some money right there. - Yeah. And anyone could license it, but you had to - Anyone with lots of money could license it. - You had to go to AT&T. AT&T had a very strict no advertising no bug fix, like no maintenance, - Boy, I love that for a hundred grand. - No troubleshooting. Basically a group was formed of Unix users basically all the system admins for like, it was like UC Berkeley, all these colleges, all these academic things that were using it, and they essentially became the bug. Like they're the ones who were troubleshooting and they were the developers for Unix for AT&T. And they end up forming a group called USENIX. Which sounds like, - I was about to say like, they started, they formed the Illuminati and I was about to go like, hold on a second, what? - Well, so Usenix is like basically the group that researches OS operating systems now. And like, - This doesn't sound like a conspiracy theory, Matt. This just sounds like excellent business practices from a company that makes lots of money. - Exactly. - Clearly this was successful and we all use Unix now, right? - Let us know in the comments what other conspiracy theories you want us to look into. - Wait, no, don't do that. Please, don't do that, I don't want... - I want to go on so many rabbit holes. - Oh no. - Give me an excuse not to work so I can read all these things. - The next video, Matt will be wearing an entire aluminum foil suit. - For the record, I have a picture of me wearing that already.",

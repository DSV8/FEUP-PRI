    "transcript": "- I was going to shoot this RX100 Mark VI review in downtown Brooklyn and it was going to be beautiful a work of art, a masterpiece but mother nature had a little bit of a different plan so it looks like it's time for plan B. (jazzy music) You Suck - How's that? So this is the Sony RX100 Mark VI When I'm shooting stills I'm almost exclusively shooting on a 35 millimeter film camera but when I'm not I'm actually using one of these they're super portable, they're really light lighter than DSLR and most certainly lighter than my 35 millimeter and the transfer speeds are incredible, I can quickly put it on my phone and then up to Instagram and its video capabilities are also amazing which obviously I can't do with my 35 millimeter. Now, Sony comes out with a new one of these just about every year, which is why we're already at the mark VI when the mark I came out in 2012. Now that's great because we've come a long way but it also means that now that we're at the later generations, how much is changing. So let's figure out why you probably won't pay 1200 dollars for the mark VI. So just like its predecessor, the mark VI has a 20.1 megapixel one inch CMOS sensor with 4K video at 24 30 p and at the lower 1080 p resolution you have that HFR mode, or high frame rate mode, that is capable of 960 frames per second. The ISO spans from 125 to 12800 so I find that it performs better in the lower ISO range that's like a 125 to 800 once you get to 1600 and especially at 3200 you're going to see a lot of noise and grain you just have to keep in mind that this is a point and shoot camera after all and with that comes a small flash and small batteries that can't really handle hot days or long recording times. Be prepared to own a few batteries especially if you're recording video. And also like last years model there's the pop up OLED EVF. God bless the pop up EVF I love it so much, yes, yes! It's one of the main reasons I bought this camera and it's so crisp and so clean there's something really intimate about being able to look through a view finder and take a photo. I mean no one else is behind you looking at what you're getting, it's just you and your camera and it makes you feel really professional. Now the big difference this year though, is that it's a single action EVF. So it pops up and instead of having to pull it out like you did on previous generations it just does that automatically then when you want to close it it's one single push down. The photo burst modes and auto focus also got a refresh on this model the auto focus is fast and I mean really fast and its facial recognition is on point too even when the face is super far in the frame or you're really wide. Burst mode can also now capture 230 shots at 24 frames per second, which is almost a 100 shots more than the RX100 mark V 150 shots for making gifs or capturing the perfect moment this is really great. For the vertically challenged among us and the foodies, you're really going to love the extended range on this screen in previous models you had that 180 degree screen which it still does, this is great for vlogging this is great for taking selfies but new this year, is the 90 degrees tilt down. It typically only when to 45 but now you have that full 90 I really didn't think this was going to be super useful but when taking shots of food or at concerts, it actually came in handy. So you pair that with the touch screen capabilities that are also new this year it's kind of banging. You can finally touch the screen to focus and to take shots but I can't navigate the menu or hit okay so in a world where touch screens are so intuitive they're on everything we use we didn't we go one step further and make it completely usable via touch, we're so close but speaking of close, hello's eye is 24 to 200 millimeter lens. For tourists or festival goers or bird watchers or a parent in a high school event this is really a great feature and it's clean, it's crisp and it actually flattens out the image and gives you depth of field much like the Canon 7200 millimeter would it made me feel like a great photographer even when I was just on the fly doing something really quick the problem is, we gave up F 1.8 aperture lens and those built in NDs, which I use all the time I loved being able to get down to 1.8 especially at night and the ND was so easy and quick to slap on it was much easier than adjusting the shutter and when doing video the ND is like absolutely valuable so this might be the difference between buying this model and a previous cheaper model that ND and F1.8 is a little bit more valuable to me. Overall the RX100 continues to be a great camera with better video options and way more models than Canon's G7 or Lumix LX line and with all these models have come incredible improvements I mean this is a super powerful point and shoot, it has great HDR features and with added S-Log 3 support, this model can even step up as a V cam on shoots with an A7S, very comfortable. The real problem though is the total and complete lack of a mic input and the price. I mean for 1200 dollars there really should be a mic input especially for how many vloggers use this camera. Just put it in! So if you had the money, go for it you'll absolutely not be disappointed by this camera, but if you're looking for bang for your buck you might want to look at the RX100 Mark IV or V I had the IV and I bought it on craigslist last year and it stills works really well and with that extra money, you could buy an external audio recorder. So thanks for watching if you like this video and you like watching my hair slowly deflate be sure you like and subscribe also shout out to this camera that is currently doused in water, alright we'll see you next time.",

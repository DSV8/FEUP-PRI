If you still don't believe me, pick one up for yourself. For the record, I use Apple products on a daily basis including a 12-core Mac Pro that cost me a fortune.  iPhone 6 Bend+ HTC One M8, Moto X:  Watch the Note 3 bend:   FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lou here and I'm in Dundas Square in downtown Toronto that's because I want to put all this conspiracy to rest with the \"Bendgate\" controversy. I have a brand new, sealed, iPhone 6 Plus that is in completely new order here, working order. And I've got some witnesses as well to verify that. So that nobody can say I'm doing anything crazy, doctoring anything, using any special machinery, in order to produce the effects that others are complaining about. And I am personally ... a little bit concerned that it's more than the nine people that have been reported. So without further ado, let me unwrap this and give you the new, out in the open, with witnesses, bend test video. So I'm gonna do it the same way that I did before holding it in the same location -- wait! First, fully working -- fully working device as you can see. Without a sim card for obvious reasons. So there you go. So, should we do this? Let's get a nice lock on it. In 3, 2 1 Now, am I The Incredible Hulk? Am I a body builder, guys? Or am I a regular dude? So it's fairly obvious -- that was easy to do. People are saying crazy things like I had to exert an incredible amount of force I have another phone in my bag actually which I could grab right now the Moto X, and this is the one I want you guys to pay attention to This should be part of the story is how durable the new Moto X is by comparison. So for all you individuals saying all phones bend That's not true If you try and bend some devices that's not what happens. So here is the new Moto X once again, completely in working order I'll grab it on the back just like I did for the iPhone I can press as hard as I want Can you guys see how hard I'm pressing? And this phone -- Look! Look at that! It will flex a little bit, make no noise and nothing will change. Completely working. So it is possible to engineer a device that can withstand that amount of force. This is the evidence right here. It's all the evidence you need. Is this a problem for your average user? Maybe not yet, but we're expected to hold these phones for years in some cases. Not just an afternoon. We will see the real reports coming in shortly, but that phone is weaker than many of the competitors. Let me see it one more time. Let me see it one more time real quick. I think that pretty much tells the story. It's completely opened up. This one is even worse than the other one. It even seemed like less force.",

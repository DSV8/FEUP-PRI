    "transcript": "So when a YouTuber reaches 100,000 subscribers, YouTube sends them a silver Play Button as an award, congratulations of sorts. But recently, YouTube started sending out a different style of Play Button. Is it made out of the same material? Is it made out of a cheaper material? Lets find out. [Intro] So there are a couple of differences that we can see right off the bat. This one is the one I got about a year and a half ago, right here for JerryRigEverything. Its a little bit smaller than this recent one. This ones for the Whats Inside Family, and Dan, why does yours have a hole cut out of the center of it? [Dan] We already cut one in half for our main channel and I thought how cool would it be to take the play out of the YouTube Play Button. So they dont come like this with the triangle out of the middle. But we took the play out of it. [Zack] And Im glad you did that because thats the actual sample that were going to use inside of this electron microscope. So if you look at this microscope, the inside chamber right here that we put the samples into, isnt super huge. So its nice when you have a really small sample; you get a better analysis. Weve already done an elemental analysis of the original silver Play Button. And we realized that there is no silver inside of it. Its mostly Nickel. I think its 94% nickel. But now that we have this Play Button, it looks like the interior is made out of something differentsomething besides nickel. And thats what were here to find out. Another difference is that this award part right here is written on the glass itself, and for the Whats Inside Family channel, nothing is written on the glass. Its all printed on the paper inside, which is probably more cost effective. So what do you think Dan? Do you think they changed the size, the frame, and the material to be more cost effective? [Dan] I would imagine there are a lot more YouTubers that are hitting a million and of course hitting 100,000. I mean, this is our second channel that weve hit it with. And so Im curious to see, because we brought our gold Button and our silver Play Button up here and we were able to seethat machine told us what this was made of. But, I want to see what this new ones made of. I think its going to be different. [Dan] Look at the back of that. [Zack] Look at that! [Dan] Its different. Wheres the other one? Oh, you havent taken it off yet. [Zack] Its made in the USA at least, thats cool. [Dan] Yeah, at least they put that on there. [Zack] Its really a lot more light weight than I thought it would be. [Dan] Alright, lets check them out. Side by side. Look at the difference. What about the backside? [Zack] Mine looks a little bit cleaner and more polished. Yours is like industrial. [Dan] Yeah. [Zack] You can see the injection points from the mold that they use to inject it. [Zack] The chunk of the silver Play Button that we have in this cup is sitting in acetone. So if it was plastic, it would have already been dissolved. Luckily it looks like its still in one piece so we know for sure its not plastic. But we got to find out what its really made of. Alright so this is the electron microscope. Inside of the electron microscope is where were going to stick this sample; the inside of the silver Play Button. Just going to rest it right there on top of that little platform. And here inside of the machine, this is a view that not very many people get to see. Its this little platform right here and theres a series of little motors and pulleys and this moves the platform inside so that it can sit underneath this little nozzle and thats where we get our images from. So this whole machine right here costs about 700,000 dollars. The part that were the most interested in though is this part right back here. This is the energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer, and it spits out x-rays into here to figure out what the elemental makeup is of whatever sample we have inside. The electron microscope is able to differentiate different elements on an elemental level simply by putting the sample inside this machine. And that will tell us exactly what the silver Play Button is made of. So if you listen very closely theres a high pitched sound and right now its pulling all of the oxygen, all of the air, out from inside of this machine. Cuz as you know, oxygen and all of the other molecules inside of the air have their own elemental make up, and so we have to have zero air inside of the machine to get an accurate reading on the Play Button itself. So there are several cameras inside of this electron microscope. If you remember seeing those motors and pulleys, its moving the platform underneath the electron beam. We can also raise the sample up and lower it with that same platform. So this is a live camera inside the machine. So the samples being read inside of the machine. If you remember when we put it down inside of the platform, the shiny side was facing up, and so with that shiny side, this is the elemental reading that were getting from it. Right here it says that its 92% nickel and theres a little bit of zinc and a little bit of carbon. The carbon is kind of like the impurities and stuff. Youre going to have that with any sample. So we can pretty much safely assume that were looking at 92% nickel and 2% zinc for that surface area. So now were going to depressurize this machine. Were going to let air back into it, take the sample out and flip it up on its side and go for a second reading of the internal of the Play Button. So right now were still doing the cross section and so right here we can see the internal section of the Play Button, and then this band right here, this layer, thats the shiny part, the exterior. Heres another little shot of that. And so we know that this part does have the nickel in it, but now we want to see what the actual center of the button is made up of. [Dan] So I think this is super interesting because the other Play Button was all pure nickel; the same thing on the inside of it. Where this one, the scientist that were working with here does not want to be on camera, which is fine, she coined this as the inside junk. So even she used, by using the term junk, carbon is basically denoting that it might be a little cost effective and material thats not as pure as what was on the other one. I thought that was interesting. [Zack] So heres the cross section that were looking at here. And then once we get into this image, you can see that this is the cross section. This is what the microscope is actually looking at. And this is the elemental make up of each of the elements in that cross section. So zinc is right here which is the majority of the cross section, but as we get close to the edge here, we see that thats where the nickel is at. And this color is representing the nickel. We have a little bit of copper and Im guess that copper is used to join the nickel to the zinc. Theres also a little bit of aluminum, but we can see here that its only 4%, so thats pretty much a non issue here. The majority of it is going to be the zinc and the carbon. And we have the zinc and the carbon. So the carbon is mixed pretty well inside of that. Which I think is pretty interesting because when you take carbon and you add it to iron you get steel. And that carbon is used to strengthen the iron to make the harder material which you get is steel. So Im guessing what theyve done here with this Button is theyve added the carbon to the zinc to make it stronger and the Play Button will last longer that way. But carbon is also extremely cheap and so is zinc. So lets see how much each of these Play Buttons weigh, the silver one from before, and the newer silver one, and then we can kind of get an idea of how much each of them cost to actually make. Alright, lets go weigh these things. [Dan] Hold on, before we weigh things Zack, make sure you put this one. [Zack] Im not putting those on! [Zack] Here is my silver Play Button. This is the original one. Were going to go ahead and drop it onto the scale, and it looks like were at one third of a pound. Point three pounds. And add on the Whats Inside Family channel, were at point three eight, plusright on point four one. So its a little bit heavier. So to recap, this is my Play Button; this is the Whats Inside Family Play Button. Mine is made out of nickel which is about 5 dollars per pound if youre just doing like the raw weight of the metal. This one is made out of zinc and carbon, which ends up being about 25 cents per pound, just the raw metal weight. [Dan] To put that into perspective, last year alone there were 24,000 people that hit 100,000 subscribers. So not everybody redeems their award, but if they did, YouTube would be saving around 32,000 dollars a year at that same rate just by making this button over that button. So while mine is bigger, its not as expensive as this one. A dollar sixty is what we mapped that out to, and about 25 cents. Not very expensive considering how much this means to every YouTuber that actually hits the award. But by making this Button less expensive, they are saving around 32,000 dollars a year according to our estimates. [Zack] And remember, those numbers are just for the metal weight itself. Were not talking about like the manufacturing cost, cuz like this Button, where its finished on both the front and the back, like its shiny nice and finished. This Button is not finished at all on the back; it has that raw, industrial feel to it which actually saves a lot of money. If we look really closely on the back, you can see the actual injection points for the mold. So they didnt bother to finish that at all, which makes sense because no ones ever going to see the back of the Play Button besides us. [Dan] Except for us weirdoes! [Zack] Were the only two channels that are going to open these things up. [Dan] One thing I really like according to Social Blade, there were 25 channels a day in 2015 that would hit 100,000 subscribers. And in 2016, that was 44 channels a day. So almost doubling that number, and so every single year youre seeing more and more people that are becoming subscribers on YouTube, that are gaining subscribers. [Zack] Even though YouTube can now make probably about 5 or 6 Play Buttons for the cost of one of these, its stillthe most important part is that they actually are giving away an award for hitting a milestone. I think they are the only social media platform that actually rewards their creators when they hit these milestones. [Dan] And I am so grateful for it. Like we took our gold Play Button around the world, like we really are grateful for the award. It sits prominently in our office. Were really proud of the achievement and really thankful for all of our subscribers that actually choose to subscribe. Like 100,000 or a millionthose are a lot of people who subscribe. And Im certainly grateful for it. Like its more than the metal thats inside of it, it really is the subscribers like you guys, for subscribing to our channels. It means so much. [Zack] Im never going to melt it down because I love my award as well. [Dan] I know a lot of you guys said if youve watched Whats Inside even one time, youre looking at this going Dan, how did you cut that so perfectly? It wasnt me I promise. But it was really interesting the way that we cut it. [Zack] Dan is not an expert with tools, but if you want to watch the video where he cuts this open, I will link that at the end of this one. And I do appreciate you guys a ton. If you havent subscribed to my channel yet, go ahead and hit that subscribe button below. I will link Dans channel at the end of this one as well. Thanks a ton for watching! Ill see you around.",

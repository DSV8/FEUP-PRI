    "transcript": "*slap* Playstation. Consoles. A lot of people have them. A lot of people love them. The experience of the controller and so on, I don't have to explain it to you. But can't really be portable, like this thing here. Well I guess now it can! It's putting a screen, on your Playstation... ...to turn it into some kind of monstrous Game Boy type scenario. *Breathes In* Now obviously you're still gonna find a wall outlet To use this thing. But look at it, it flips up! I don't know how its gonna work, I saw it on Amazon, and I was like, I gotta check this out From a company called Hori. It's got speakers in it, controls, HDMI. It's a whole thing. Full 1080p HD. Oh! It's light too. And a nice lil' short; HDMI cable, because obviously this thing sits right ontop. Not only will you have to plug in the playstation, you gotta plug in this too. If you can find one outlet, you can find 2! Ooh I like it already, it's got the exact same finish as your Playstation... ... and it even has the Playstation logo on there. Here are your speakers, two speakers there ***Nerdgasm*** That's a nice little display right there! Up on the top you have controls: Menu, up, down... Side to side You have your power port, HDMI in, number 1, ...and HDMI in, number 2! So dual functionality! OHHHHHHH and check that out! You've even got a headphone jack times TWO! So two people, two controllers, an-and the parents in the background are like... *Weird hand movement* *pointing* SHUT UP BACK THERE! () No problem. Plug the headphones in. FULL IMMERSION RATATATATATATA Kinda just goes right here like this Uhhhhh, I kinda like that ( )( )( )( )( ) It's kinda like a bizarro... Playstation laptop What are these about here? \"I SEE!\" said the blind man As he picked up his hammer and saw... (Jack?) Permanently install this thing... Little cli- *Click* UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SATISFACTION ( ) OHH, it's a package deal now! Look at me! Oh, loo - oh, the guy's got a Playstation, wha-what's the big deal? And then you go, Oh really? Take this little guy... ...into there. ( ) Like so, so that's how you're gonna *tap* connect *tap* *tap* the Playstation *BIG TAP* To the unit. The display is only 1080p! Only, well it's 1080p, but since it's small... It's super sharp even at this range right here! I've got NBA on here So hey listen, let's - let's run a little test real quick Look at that package! Who's better than you? You're gonna just picture mode here, various user settings... ...contrast, brightness, saturation, sharpness and so on. Alright here we go. Air Canada center. Raptors versus Cleveland. The playoffs I was there! Didn't go the way I wanted it to go! Could've been worse. (speakers) On the bench for the raptors... ...coach Dwane Casey... (He's been with the franchise for a long time now.) *Lewis approves* Mmhm (mumble and noise from the speakers) *Lewis nods aggressively* Alright now he's gonna push the ball up. CAROL? (It's wednesday my dudes) OHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaeeugh Opens the game with a TREE ball! OHH, shake 'em, SHAKE 'em, and then let's it goOO! (damn demons again) OHHAAAAAAA ah I'm putting the challenge out there... ...anybody wants to get their 2k game on against me... ...it's gonna be a bad night for you (oh really? ( )) Look at Valaninas on the (boards?) a monster out there. 1 x OHH that was bad! 2x That was baaad! 3x That was bad! *frustated Lewis* How do you missed IT WAS WIDE OPEN! *Lewis' demons are coming back* OHHH *Manly scream* DOOOOUGH It's a simple contraption it's just... ...essentially putting a monitor on top on your Playstation. But I can see all kinds of scenarios where I'm like: \"Man I just wish...\" \"... couple of people could play.\" You know, little bit of Playstation in this enviroment! There is a problem solved here in the sense of... ...you got a Playstation, you got a TV and it all fits in a little package... ...you can carry under one arm. I-I know a lotta kids out there... could be the... ...bell of the ball with this right here.",

    "transcript": "so this is the HyperX cloud mix it's a wired / wireless gaming headset and it'll set you back around 200 George Washington's which is a lot of money and I'm sure it'll raise a lot of eyebrows because we're all familiar with the cloud family and how good they are especially we've got the cloud flights that Cloud alpha is a cloud stinger these are all great headsets that are pressed appropriately for the features they offer now when I looked at the price of the cloud mix it really got my head scratching up for a bit because the only additional improvement that I see with this headset is the implementation of Bluetooth technology and that's pretty much it so how is this particular headset gonna stand out against his competitors we'll find out right after this hello I'm looking for some fans well are you married yeah I have a ring what is your favorite number I would say 3 do I have the perfect fan for you this is the new thermal tech ring trio 12 fans with good static pressure for radiators it is a beautiful frame with double side and center ring illumination with soft and super brights bill with razor chrome and compatibility control it through your smartphone the RGB plus software on the PC or Amazon Alexa well I'm gonna take these home perhaps you should to check them out in the description below ok so there's something I just want to get off my shoulders there is a particular reason why we decided to delay the review for the cloud mix and the reason for that is when we were briefed on it back in October of last year HyperX told us that customers would only be able to purchase the cloud mix exclusively at Best Buy in the United States and to us that just didn't seem like a feasible choice to make a dedicated video on so we decided to wait until this headset was available worldwide and it is right now so we'll make sure to leave links in the description down below if you're interested and it actually does help it does give us a little bit of a kick back in exported channel so thank you very much any back to the review and honestly guys it's really not that different from the other cloud headsets from the outside at least you see it still maintains the same frame structure with the signature leatherette memory foam ear cups I do appreciate the stealth look on the mix because it features a few matte black elements however the HyperX logo does seem to stand out quite a bit so maybe next time they could implement a tone on tone finish and minimize the size of the logo as well that'd be much appreciated now as I mentioned earlier the build quality remains the same just like the Alpha headset it's very flexible and rigid no signs of creaking as well and that should be expected for $200 the headband is not self adjustable and that's my personal preference the adjustable sliders are well defined and intact and the clamping force is also very minimal and I didn't experience any fatigue wearing this for longer periods of time just like previous cloud headsets so that's a good thing and I do note that the ear cups can't rotate 90 degrees so it might be a little bit of a challenge resting these around your neck especially when you plan on traveling with them the signature memory foam on the ear cuffs feature plenty of cushion and they're super comfortable to wear although keep in mind that if you live in warmer environments the leatherette material could start to accumulate sweat so you may have to vent your ears often the ear cups do provide a good seal around your ears though and it does a fairly good job isolating background noise now when it comes to versatility HyperX takes the crown here once again and I think I keep repeating myself every time I review one of their headsets the included braided cables are detachable and that's obvious given that these are wireless as well the same story goes with the boom microphone the braiding on the cable is certainly unique compared to other handsets in the market they're not too thick and they're very flexible which makes it less prone to kink formation and that's awesome however reverberations exhibited by the cable is certainly audible especially when you're you know sort of gaming on it for longer piece of time we can certainly pick this up especially the microphone because it's a very sensitive microphone you can actually start picking up the reverberations as it's you know sort of going through your fabric material or whatever you're wearing so that's definitely something to keep note of the main 3.5 to 3.5 millimeter cable is 1.3 meters in length and that's perfect if you paired this up with your smartphone provided that it has a headphone jack can't believe that's the thing I'm saying in 2019 but that is what it is now you can all find a controller within the cable to adjust a volume and mute the microphone there's also a 2 meter extension cable that splits in two separate headphone and microphone inputs and this can be used to route it comfortably behind your PC and you also get a carrying bag nice touch alright so let's move on to the wireless aspect of the clock mix and this is certainly something that you'll need to pay close attention to you see HyperX does market the mix as a wired gaming headset with bluetooth technology and that's really the key difference here compared to other cloud headsets now don't confuse yourself thinking that you can pair this headset pair your PC via a 2.4 Gertz receiver because that's not the case here it's just via bluetooth and I believe that they using the Bluetooth 4.2 protocol and honestly for 200 dollars that's disappointing now hear me out for a second this is the cloud flight by HyperX it's a wireless gaming headset it pairs with your PC or pairs your PC via this USB receiver and you know you can also be used in Wired mode via a 3.5 mm interconnect here so it's very flexible and right now it's on sale as well so that's really cool but when you compared to something like the cloud mix there honestly isn't a huge difference at least to me personally I don't feel like you're getting all that much for $200 not to mention this headset can only pair with a single device and listen some of you may think that it's not a deal-breaker to include a wireless receiver but what really concerns me the most is the price tag you see I would been completely fine if the cloud Mex was priced between 140 to 160 dollars because now you'd have two headsets competing within the same price range that offers different wireless modes that better suit the customers or their particular needs or their use case scenarios alright so enough of me ranting let's move on now in terms of Bluetooth functionality HyperX has not skimmed on the basics so you do get your standard volume up and down buttons that sync with your mobile or system volume levels enabling bluetooth or powering on a headset can be done by holding down the power button for two seconds the same goes for turning it off and if you want to pair it with that device simply hold it down for five seconds when powering it up there's an LED indicator right above to show the status there's also a multi-function button that acts as your play pause and picking up a phone call or skip tracks by just double pressing on it now HyperX claims that the life lasts for about 20 hours and I was comfortably able to hit that by pairing it with my smartphone and setting the volume to about 50% you can recharge the headset via this microUSB port although I would have wished if it was typed see now as I mentioned earlier the boom microphone is detachable and it basically features the same hardware as the ones found on the cloud alpha so you're not getting a significant improvement in terms of microphone quality compared to that headset which is also really funny because that costs around $100 so there's that now my voice sounds very clear it's not too nasally very natural there's very minimal background compression taking place so it doesn't really affect the vocals I'm typing on a mechanical keyboard these are the romaji switches and it does a fairly good job isolating the background noise but there's something that I really wanted guys to pay close attention to and that's the reverberations that the braided cable exhibits check this out you can certainly hear it I'm sure you'll pick it up because that's definitely something that I noticed when I was doing my testing so if you're wearing like hoodies or something like that with zippers on them just be careful that's all I got to say all right so what do you listen to right now is the built-in onboard microphone on the cloud mix and this works obviously via bluetooth just keep in mind that if you connect the boom microphone it doesn't actually work that way because this only works via a wired mode when connected to your PC so certainly keep that in mind now this is an omnidirectional microphone so it does fake you know fairly a lot of background noise but it actually sounds fairly good for a Bluetooth headset I'm actually surprised by the quality of the onboard microphone and it should be adequate enough for you know taking phone calls or all that kind of stuff and now let's wrap things up with how this sounds and to be honest I really have nothing terrible to say about it because the drivers are built exactly as the cloud Alpha's with the dual chamber design that separates the highest Ament and the base the soundstage is surprisingly wider than I expected it to be and for a closed back design that's actually pretty awesome and given that it now comes with the high res audio certification it covers a wider frequency range so you can pick up the slightest details within a sound track the vocals are well defined however I will mention that just like the Alpha's the bass response on the mix isn't too powerful and that could be a deal-breaker for some of you out there but personally I really enjoyed listening to music and watching a few shows on the cloud mix now gaming on it was a whole lot of fun guys I spent a couple of days playing apex legends which is a huge thing now and overwatch and I have to admit I did take away some productivity time but it was so worth it though the gunshots feel boo me when you're blowing stuff up the explosions really do sound awesome even though the bass response is minimal the widest soundstage really does add up to it and you can hear the slightest details especially when you're navigating through the gameplay you can hear certain directional cues and oh no you just it's just an awesome experience just you know playing with the HyperX cloud mix I certainly loved it it certainly wasn't a significant improvement over the cloud Alpha's so if you're coming from the cloud Alpha's I don't think you're gonna be noticing a huge difference upgrading to the cloud mix so I guess it's time to wrap up this review guys the cloud mix by HyperX is a good headset I mean it sounds amazing it's built really well it's very comfortable and I like the design too but it's the price that I just can't digest because for $200 I'm sure you can expect a lot more I mean I would have preferred if they included at least a USB receiver so that it can seamlessly transition between your PC to your mobile device and of course if you want to connect it in Wired mode to your console it just completes that versatility and that's just a missed opportunity for HyperX now sure you can pair this up via bluetooth to your desktop PC that's totally not a it's not a question it's possible I'm just bummed about the price guys and I really want to know your thoughts about that in the comments down below what do you think about it did HyperX go way too far in terms of pushing the envelope for pricing a headset especially a gaming headset that features bluetooth especially at that price point I'm Eva with Hydra connects thank you so much for watching

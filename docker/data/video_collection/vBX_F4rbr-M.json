    "transcript": "- Hey guys. It's Justine. I'm here with Ro today. - Hey! - How are you doing? - Oh man. I mean, what haven't I been doing during all this COVID? - Well, I'm excited that we are back. We just filmed a kitchen gadgets episode on her channel. So go check it out. Today, you know that I love tech. - Oh, I know you love tech. - I've got a little something. I got some like, old school tech. Well, actually it's not. Well, I don't wanna tell you... Well, I already told you it's old school, so I completely ruined surprise. - What is this classic stuff? - Do you know what this is? - Okay. Well, I'm seeing that it's a charger. And of course, we've got a little apple on here. So this is an Apple charger. - Do you know what kind of charger that is? It's okay if you don't know, it's fine. - Well it's real thick. - It's real thick. - She's thick. She's got a thick plug and she's also got this little thing on the back. I don't know what this is. So, what's this little symbol? - That is Fire Wire. Yeah. Long time ago. Do you remember? - I had a separate Fire Wire that I would use with my camera to my laptop. - Yep. - Back in the day. And it was like, bright. And I was like Fire Wire. Yeah. Fire Wire. - Such a good name too. But yeah, this is a Fire Wire charger. - Okay. - That charges... - What are you... Justine. What have you brought over? - What have I brought over? - What, what is this? - So inside of this $19 Apple polishing cloth. Did you know that Apple sells a polishing cloth for $19? - I can't believe you have one. I mean, that's just fancy. - I mean... - You, you have an Apple polishing cloth. - I feel like you could believe it though. - I do. I mean, cause it's you, you got all the tech stuff. You know, that's like when you have sunglasses that are designer and then you have like, the designer polisher for your lens. You're the like \"Oh, let me just get my Gucci...\" - Polishing cloth. - Yeah my little polishing cloth. - Same thing, same thing. (Ro gasping) - What is it? What is it? - There's something, do you wanna like, do you wanna reveal? Okay, go ahead. Okay. - Oh my gosh. Yes. Me? - It's you! Just do a little like, okay. - Okay, little old me, I'll just... Just like, just an unfold. - Yes, an unfold. - Okay. Here we go everybody. - Ta-da! It's an iPod. - No. - The original iPod from two... - These are huge! - I know! - These are so huge. They weren't this big. - Well... - Were they? - Yeah. Like this is what, what started it all. - Does this still work? This is a relic. - You give it a press. - It's 20 years. This is a 20. This thing is 20... (Ro laughing) - Wow. - I can't believe I've lived through this. This is 20 years old. - So this is actually the 10 gigabyte version. There was definitely a smaller one than that. This isn't my original one. I did buy this on eBay a few years ago. But like, check out like this iPod font. - I can't even believe they still have these. I'm shocked that you could even find one online. Because it's so old. This is so old Justine, it belongs in a museum. I'm scared Indiana Jones is just gonna shoot out from my kitchen and come steal this, to try to get this relic. And like, put it in like some tech museum. - I'm gonna be on the lookout then. - Yeah. - [Justine] Give it a little button press. Let's see if it works. - [Ro] I'm honored. I'm gonna... Just the middle. - [Justine] Yep. It's working! - [Ro] Shut up. Is it on? - Yes, check it out! And the screen is back-lit. - Oh! And I still remember how to use it. Oh, so satisfying. - I know. Shh, listen, listen, listen. - Listen to this. (Ro clicking) - The click. Oh my God. It's such a good sound. - I love that click. - As I was driving over here, I was thinking. Oh yeah, I have a pair of AirPods. It's not gonna work. It's not gonna work with AirPods. I don't... This is not Bluetooth compatible. - What can you even still, does it have the... - Look at the music. So this has somebody else's music on it, because this is not my iPod. - They didn't even clear it. You got their music. - Yes. - You got their playlist. This is a big deal. We're gonna learn a lot about them. - [Justine] Look at that, screen is working. - [Ro] Wow. - [Justine] And we've got the music here. - [Ro] This is history. - [Justine] Playlist, artist, album, songs. - [Ro] You can put audio books on these? - [Justine] Yeah! - [Ro] I don't remember that. - [Justine] Oh my god, there's extras! There's a game! Okay. I don't even... I do vaguely remember this. - Oh, it's kind of that pongy one. Where the, the sliders at the bottom and the ball goes, and you move your little slider. - I remember playing this in like 2002 and thinking that like this was... Which it really was. I mean, this thing was absolutely game changing. - Isn't it crazy, the kind of games we can play on our phones now, from what we used to be able to do? - Yeah. I was wondering if the person who had this last had their calendar synced up to this. Oh my gosh, this is synced up to January 2002... Oh my gosh. - We can see all their plans, hot date nights. - All of the plans. Okay. Let's see what kind of music they have. - Oh my gosh. We've got their calendar. We've got their playlist. I feel like we're best friends. - ABBA? - Okay, classic. - [Justine] Some Adele. - Great taste. - Alanis Morissette. - Oh my gosh. - Alicia Keys. - (singing) Isn't it ironic? - We got Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The Clash, Coldplay, David... Okay, I feel like this might actually be my playlist. Lenny Kravitz. - This is a good weird mix. I'm really digging this. - This is very good. U2. - You know what? Back in the day, I thought that I had the original one. But now I'm realizing, looking at this that I didn't get this right when it came out, I never owned the original. I had the ones that were, they were a little bit thinner and they came in colors cause I had a... - The iPod nano. - That's what I had. 'Cause I had a pink one. And I thought that was the first one. No. I'm even behind. Even 20 years ago I was behind the times. - But like, this is so cool. Like, check out like, these edges. It's just like, it's such an awesome design. - It's got like a thick Plexiglas on top. You know, that kind of like... You know, it lightly scratches but never like, too much. - It's actually pretty industrial. - Yeah. You could really get in there. - We got our headphone jack, and we have this little hold switch. So if you don't want to like, hit any of the buttons, you can keep the song playing. Of course, we got a Fire Wire port. - [Ro] The hold button. - I know. Isn't it sweet? - Oh my gosh. Like when a new jam came out and I just wanted to listen to it on a repeat. You just clicked that hold button on. You're just, yeah. Feeling it all day. Like, yeah. Really getting into your music. - But like, let's just look at that in comparison to like, what the iPhone looks like right now. Look at that. The future. - And look at these ports. I mean, look at your side ports. And then look at these. - Fun fact... - Hmm, teach me the facts, Justine. What's the fun fact? - I may have been like, you know, signing up to MySpace around then. And I was like, okay, Justine is taken. So, whatever, I'm just gonna throw an I in front of it. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - So here we are. I still just can't believe that this actually works. Like after all these years, like it's holding a battery charge. Like, I was charging it over there and it still is good. - I feel like this is a miracle. You guys, this gadget is 20 years old. It still works. It's still holding a charge. You know what I kind of miss? This is making me miss tech stuff. This makes me wanna get my old Nokia phone back and use it for a week. And see if I would really love it. - So this all makes sense now. 'Cause I was wondering how I... Okay, so it was released October 23rd, 2001. Okay? So, but I think that I got, I graduated 2002, but I think, I didn't obviously get it when it first came out. So, getting it around 2002, it makes sense. - Dang, this came out when I was a sophomore in high school. - Crazy! I'm a few years older than you, so I think so, yeah. - I thought we were same age. - I don't think so. - I thought we were the same. How old am I? I don't remember. - Dude, I've been telling people that I'm 38, and Jenna goes \"No, you're not\". Okay so this makes sense. - Yeah, we're one year apart. - So, uh, kids. You're just witnessing... (both laughing) I think we're both senile. And the iPod is still working which is pretty, pretty exciting. - I am shocked that after 20 years. Still holding a charge, still working. I think that speaks a lot to the quality and longevity of these items. Like, that is really impressive. - I have some phones by a manufacturer that I won't name, that I have... They're only a few years old. Like the battery has like, just engorged. And it's like leaking out battery acid. And this has lasted for like, over 21 years. - 21 years later! - Yeah, wait. Two thousand, 2001. - 21! She can drink now. She's legal drinking age. We can make her a margarita. A spicy one because she deserves it. - October would be the 21st birthday. So we'll bring it back out, celebrate and have a little cake. - Happy birthday! - Oh my gosh. Well thank you so much for joining me in this vintage tech episode. - I loved this. - This is great. I have to bring out some more vintage tech and see what I can find for our next video. - Oh my gosh, yes. - It'll be great. Well, thank you guys so much for watching. Make sure you go check out Ro's channel. She is the best. We have been making so many videos over the past couple of years. I mean, I have a whole playlist of everything if you want to go real wild. So yeah, make sure you guys subscribe, hit the bell. Do all of the things. Leave us some comments, and let us know if there's any piece of tech you would like us to check out next. And we will see you in the next video. Bye! - [Ro] Bye! (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "Recently, we showed off the $100,000 desk PC that we built for Karl Jacobs, a Minecraft YouTuber with copious capital. But we only showed you the destination, not the journey. So here it is, how to build $100,000 desk PC and how to thank our sponsor, SeeSonic. We're here in beautiful Squamish, British Columbia to check out SS CAD-CAM. These are the same guys that did the machining for our play button PC and the machines they have in here are freaking incredible. Come on, come on, Andy. This massive hunk of aluminum isn't even one of the largest that's going in our desk. This will make one of the wings and it alone is 315 pounds. And just this part was nearly 2000 Canadian dollars. To machine the wings of our desk, we're using this DMG Mori DMU65. This thing, it absolutely smokes our tormach, like not even in the same league. This thing has 60 tools in it and they swap just so fast. It has a 46 horsepower spindle that goes up to 20,000 RPM. The ability of this thing to shred through aluminum is absolutely incredible. The wings of our desk are at the absolute limits of the size of this machine. Even just getting this thing on here is a huge pain in the arse. Like you can't just chuck this in a vice like a normal thing. So instead, it's held in using one of these orange clamps. So down on the bottom of our big block of aluminum, we have these studs that are threaded in. Then it goes in like that and you're able to tighten it right down. There's three of these in the bottom here. The whole thing is a complete custom fixture just for us. All right, can we run it? You sure can, do you want to press start? Oh, heck yeah. I did a thing. This isn't even the largest hunk of aluminum that we need to machine though. This is the Canada arm three and it's what Amish normally uses to load material into his mill. Only problem, the load limit is 400 pounds and our hunk of aluminum is 550. That's $3,500 worth of aluminum. He had to use a forklift to get this in there. This old Haas might've been made when Karl was only one year old, but it's still got it where it counts. Biggest thing? Well, it's big. This thing's able to take seven feet of stock in the X direction. Of course, to fit a piece of aluminum, this big onto it, we needed to make completely custom jigs once again. So, down here we have a big custom piece of aluminum where you're bolting down straight through it. When all's said and done, this 550 pounds of aluminum is going to be turned into just 65, which means we're gonna have a lot, a lot of chips. This huge bin is where all of our aluminum chips are going to end up and we expect to fill it 12 times. Fortunately, all of those chips are going to go to a recycler down the road. So it'll be turned into, what, like pop cans? Another desk. No, we're not making another desk. Enough of me talking though. Let's get to machining. Tim, hit it. Ah! Oh. I couldn't help noticing that it's in a lot of pieces. Yeah, this right here actually arrived in the back of a car. This is what we have to do today. If this video is any less than three and a half hours long, you can rest assured that it's been cut aggressively and there's gonna be a lot of extras over on floatplane.com. Wings onto frame. Let's go. I mean, there's three of us and it's all been test fitted. So theoretically, it shouldn't be that bad. Should we have gloves to make our lives easier in terms of cleaning it later? First things first, we're gonna take these parts and we're gonna install them and then we're gonna slide the wings in. Okay. So these are indexed to each side. This is a left side front. That is the right side front. And I got washers here right on the bolt side. Just put all the bolts and two nuts on. We're gonna lock tight everything. Okay, so I've got all the bolts and, hold on, it's a little tall. It's cute. Do you wanna speed run the desk or not? All in. Now that the project has been fully designed, Tim figures he spent over a month of dedicated time just looking at solid works and that's nothing compared to the time that this thing took to machine. The details on this are incredible. So this KJ, a ball and mill went across and did all of this. So there's this nice little texture here. This is not some cast part or something. That is machine. What we're gonna do is we're going to make sure that these are flats, or at least as close to parallel as we can. We're gonna be fitting neoprene on top. So it's not gonna be a super big issue. Sure. But we do want them to seat nicely when we put the wings in these puzzle piece slots. Got it. So we're gonna put lock tight in each of them, flatten them, tighten them up. So just apply lock tights. Yep. Just inside. And it never came apart again. We're good? Yeah, tighten that boy. All right. That one's done. Moving in for this. Here's there. Do we not have ratcheting benches? We do, but we don't have a half inch. It doesn't matter. I have a sneaking suspicion. I can do a better job than they are right now by just laser eyeballing it. Tim, you're with me, right? Physically? Oh my God. Our side's so much better, Alex. That's so far off. Hey, watch this. It's not tightened yet. Hey, be nice. Be nice to it. My number one goal with this shoot is to make sure that Linus doesn't drop the desk. Sorry. Uncomfortable question. How much did we spend on aluminum? Was it over $10,000? Yes. Karl, you better beat Minecraft like hard. Jesus Christ, that's backwards. Put it down. Backwards? How long before the first Saudi prince asks us for one of these? Like first in line for the throne or? No, no, no. It's not backwards. It's upside down. Wait, no, that's not right, is it? Oh yeah, okay. That's even worse. Are you messing with me? No, I'm not. No, you're messing with me. I'm worried you're gonna drop it. I don't even believe you. No, I'm not trusting you anymore. Don't let go. Why would I let go? It's not screwed in. I love how industrial this thing looks. There's just a certain beauty to raw machined metal. Karl has no idea at this point what he's getting. Like, look at this. How could you not sit at this? Because it's backwards. But I know I- Guys, I'm trying to make sure Karl's not like, because we don't technically have the money from him yet. You guys know that, right? I'm not in accounting. Let's install radiators. But that's not the next step. You won't be able to install the legs if you do that. Oh, then let's install the legs. Good job, Linus. Good idea. If only there's a step-by-step list so that it all goes together properly. This computer's gonna weigh like a thousand pounds. 350. 350 pounds. How the hell is anybody gonna move it? It's getting built into a crate. Y'all want it extravagant, buddy? It occurs to me that not every motorized standing desk is built equal. Can this actually handle the full 300 pound girth of what's sitting on top of it? It's 350 pounds and that can hold 375. Plus all the water, plus the components, plus all the stuff. This is very borderline. 10 bucks says I can solo lift the desk. Let's go. Hold on. Don't. Tim, you're saying next week can level the legs and then take it off the sawhorses? No, we have to show off the cardboard thing. The cardboard. Do you remember a couple months ago when you were running for an Uber and I was attempting to show you the ergonomic design study that I'd done to say that the desk would actually feel good to fit in? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, this. This is actually critical because an early revision of the desk PC design suffered from the same fatal flaw as my original desk PC. It was thick all the way across the front. So Karl would undoubtedly be celebrating beating Minecraft and whack his knees on it, which sucks. So I asked him, hey, would you mind doing a casual complete redesign of the entire face of the desk and angle this so we can maintain the depth we need in the back of the hardware, but have a nice place for knees to go. Did it end up working? Like, has anyone actually sat at this yet? As soon as I tighten that side, we can check. Oh, God. What's the point of a height adjustable desk if you can't adjust to the height? So what we're doing right now is we're just homing the legs to make sure that they are both at exactly the same height so the whole thing doesn't sit off kilter like this. Then we can take the sawhorses out and work on it as. They're not on the ground, but they're struggling. Not yet, not yet. You're good. No, I don't know. Go down, go down. Oh, it's very short. Okay. Height adjust. Press and hold the down button until it reaches its lowest height, then wait until it rebounds to the lowest height, which signals the reset process is complete. Hmm. I can't get it to do anything. Okay. Now you locked it. Yes. Way to go, Alex. Damn it. Down. I wonder if the desk is too heavy. It's expecting to just have a certain amount on it. I think it's a safety mechanism. Well, it's what I mean. You can adjust it a little bit at a time. See, look, no problem. The point was never for it to be a standing desk, but that it would be a height adjustable set of legs because all of the other ones on the market just do set screws. Okay, worst case scenario, we ask FlexiSpot for another controller or something and we replace it. Sure. Easy. Because we have other desks from them, they don't do this. Do you want to lower it back down and try to sit at it? Oh, knee clearance is more than adequate. Yes. Cardboard prototyping for the win. Okay. What's next? Aux power supplies. You've probably noticed that this is not a normal PC power supply. That's because there are many things going into this PC that are not a PC. Like for example, the RGB lighting tubes. Ha ha ha. We could use LED strips, but instead we used, well, there's still LED strips in there, but really powerful ones. You are gonna take this beautiful, lovely, well-machined three-axis CNC-milled piece of desk and you're gonna put a couple of holes in it. Oh no, not there. Right there. Right there. No. Are you gonna put the Titan tube on there? Well, I just assumed that we'd make a hole with this light saber. Mmm. Hi Linus. Running late on that video. Here, take these heavenly organs from EK water cooling heaven. It's beautiful. EK did up these reservoirs for this project that are A, completely custom. Check that out. And B, gold plated to just really sell the opulence of this setup. Man, I love it. And there's not one, but two of them. Mad respect for not just the equipment, but the expertise that it took to design and build all of these parts. Like these are works of art. These are not computer reservoir pump combos. That's metal on metal. I do not like. Oh, wow. That is extremely tight. Thank you. No, I mean. Is there a total of six pumps? Six. Six pumps. Oh my God. This is gonna take forever. Maybe a little bit faster. All right, now stop and pull it up. I never do that. And that's why I have three kids. Ah! Are you just countersinking by eye? Yep. You're stressing me out, Tim. That's okay. Did I mention there are going to be a whopping three of these in the system? Five? Five, what? Really? Five? I mean, we weren't constrained by budget. What all are you even doing over here? You're still countersinking it. By eyeballs. Why? Because. Do you need help? Many, many ways Linus. Okay. Do we have benefits? We'll make a progress. There we go. Oh, there's radiators on here and everything. She fits. Aha. Nice. Like two mil? Yeah, there's not a lot of space, but that's a good thing apparently. It's called tolerancing. Because we're gonna install all of the gold fittings on these radiators. Yeah. After we install the cables to the fans, those have to come first. So then the other way of providing those instructions would have been, we need to put in the cables for all the fans, then put in the gold fittings. Okay, so you're right. But the thing is. For the rest of this video, let's watch Tim and see if he can say, you're right without also saying, but. Dan and I actually were here till 9:30 last night building these fan cables. He was an absolute saint and helped us out with a lot of the soldering work that needed to happen. And because this desk is not a normal computer, we had to make custom length cables for everything. Even this. What is that? This is for the standing desk legs. And if it doesn't work properly, I blame Dan. No, no, he doesn't deserve blame. Are you just trying to make the workplace less hostile and toxic, is that? I just try to instill goodness in the people that I work with. Man, you know you got a deluxe computer when you're getting hand lubed O-rings on every fitting. We do not want this thing to leak. Can I help you with this? You're doing it, I have two hands here, they're here. But as we have established, the knee is perfectly fine for this job. It's gonna be a really tight fit, but the tolerance does work. Now we got this. I believe in it. Easy mode. These are not the same length at all, but okay, sure. This is where it goes from big sheet of aluminum to big sheet of aluminum with two gigantic pump reservoir combos on it. And these things look incredible. Now at this stage, you're probably wondering, what purpose do these serve? Ah, let me explain. There are three coolant loops in the system. Now I didn't call them cooling loops because one of them doesn't actually cool anything. The first coolant loop is on this side. It gets three radiators, two pumps, and cools the CPU. The second cooling loop is over here. Three radiators, two pumps, cools the GPU. The third coolant loop, and this is great, actually just occupies the space between these tubes so that there's just fluid moving around between this giant reservoir pump distribution plate thing. So there's no purpose at all of them to look amazing. It equilibrates. Oh my God, that's unnecessary. If, say, Karl was playing Minecraft and really stressing that GPU with RTX on and the GPU loop were to get hotter, these gold tubes would get hotter than these gold tubes. So the coolant flowing all around them would actually take that excess heat from this loop and dissipate it through these radiators. What we're marveling at right now is how little flex there is in the middle of the table. So you can see that it's basically a completely flat surface. We were expecting that the cable management tray that's gonna sit under here and act as kind of a brace would be needed to keep it from bowing. But as it turns out, a big slab of aluminum is like... And it's worth noting that it's not fully weighted yet. We haven't added the water. We haven't added a lot of the components like the 4090 and the motherboard. But it's doing remarkably well and I'm quite pleased to see how well it was machined. Thanks, Amos. PCI plates, mobile plates. Are you cross-threading that? No. If I could do that with my fingers, you'd be impressed though. These are ugly. We actually had to use a different type of aluminum for those than the desk itself because we needed this one to bend cleanly. 6061 aluminum does not bend nearly as nicely as 5050. Right, but it's pretty. It's prettier, which is why we used it. And it's more structurally sound for an application like this. But this, with PCI plates and just for the motherboard back plate, works great. What you're gonna be doing is taking this and sliding it in from this side, which doesn't so much matter for this guy, but for the other one, it does. And then you're gonna be putting the screws on the bottom first. And then that way. And then on the top. We're almost at a lock tighten here, which makes it really hard to accurately squeeze it out. But I have a strategy. No, don't use the floor. I wouldn't use it as lubricant though. It's stuck. Cube. Does this hold up the graphics card? It does. Are you kidding me? This is a $100,000 computer. And we have a little aluminum cube with double-sided tape on it. Tim, are you kidding me? Well, we'll need this. All right. Okay. This may be the sloppiest sleeving job I have ever seen. What? How? Well, A, you were lazy and used split loom. Yeah. B, this heat shrink is the wrong size and you barely even bothered to shrink it. And C, you didn't even bother to heat shrink the other side. Well, you go lever nuts. This right here, when it's in location, looks fantastic. It's like they get split like that. And it has to be on an angle. It looks fantastic when it's actually in there. All of my criticisms were entirely valid. It's very easy to just put some heat shrink on there if you want, but I want to make sure this works. I know, which is why you should have done it. No, we need to make sure that's all the correct length and stuff. We haven't done all of the wiring yet for that. Linus has valid criticisms and I have made these criticisms known already. I'm sorry, what are you happy about? Cause it can't be that we're still working on this project. So this entire thing has never been on likes. We are going further than I have ever gone before, Mr. Frodo. And this was something that I had prepped prior to installing, but the scaffolding was in front of it. So I can never actually test fit it. So this, if you can just barely see, is now what it looks like. See how it just runs underneath those USB cables? Z790 Dark. The very specific reason that we got this motherboard. Cause it's Kingpin edition. There's that, but all. Cause we love EVGA. Also that. Because the color scheme is amazing. Also because the RAM is at the top, which makes our tubing runs so much easier with the layout. I'm going to go ahead and install the very fastest gaming CPU on the planet. The 3900KS from Intel. Is it power efficient? No. It is a great value. No. But is it the right choice for Karl Jacobs $100,000 PC? Absolutely. It's a 980 pro two terabyte. The real reason we chose the 980 is because we chose it a while ago. But we're going to say it's because 990 is a rumor to be dying. Yes, that's it. Speaking of which, I have a similar justification for our use of 6,000 mega transfer per second, low latency memory. It actually doesn't really help performance past that. As you would know, if you watched our recent video looking at high speed memory performance scaling on Intel 13th gen processors, but actually it's because, you know, I already told you. Okay. Can I help you guys with something else? I have installed CPU. No, I can install CPU block. Who moved the damn, oh, I did. Hey, is that enough thermal compound? Probably. You know what there's definitely enough of though? Gold. That looks amazing. Now I'm sure you thought of this, but you know that there's a specific inlet and outlet on there, right? Yeah, we'll just run the pumps backwards. Did we account for it? Yes. Are you sure? I have absolutely no idea. These tubes go flat from out of the block into the distribution block. And so there's no way for us to cross them. They're hardline tubes. We couldn't have this one come out to this side and then have this one magically teleport through it. That wouldn't work. When Jake and I built the VR gaming PC in the lounge, we discovered that the difference between installing these the correct way around and the not correct way around can be 30 to 40 degrees. Holy crap. It would be a disaster. I have to say to your credit though, Tim, this is about as smoothly as I have ever seen a project like this go. My new favorite feature of this computer, the four RGB headers on this motherboard. Overclocking board, performance first, but damn it, that doesn't mean you don't need RGB. Are we ready for the cable tray? Yeah, I think so. You could kill a man with this thing. Whoa, hi. How are you doing? Guess who did that? Oh, it was you. Yeah. Yeah. A hundred percent. It's so that right there is strain relief. That is very important. I don't know. I'm feeling pretty strained. Now it's time to talk about what might be the most important component of this build. This right here is a 750 watt power supply and not just any 750 watt power supply. It has a modular interface and manages 80 plus platinum efficiency. We will have not one, but two of these for a total of 1500 watts of low profile compact power. And did I mention it comes with a 10 year warranty? That's right. When CSonic says, trust me, bro, they got you. The batteries are dead for our cordless heat gun. So I'm using our other cordless heat gun. Oh my God. Alex. Something we haven't talked about yet is the monitors. He's going for a dual vertical. I don't know if he knows this yet, but he's going for a dual vertical monitor, single horizontal in the middle monitor design. That's going to be perfect for monitoring your chat, having your stream preview up and all that kind of stuff. And then of course gaming down the middle. Tim, you were saying that this is another like first off the line, this monitor, but this is the same one I have. Wait, this one's overclocked. Did Karl get a better monitor than me? Yes. By the way, I had a major concern about the VRMs on the motherboard because those of you who've been paying close attention will have realized that there is no real airflow going across the board. But Tim pointed out that they thought of this and that's actually one of the reasons that they chose this board. It has fans back here that are going to take fresh air from the outside and blow it across the board. So our RAM and our VRMs are going to be totally taken care of. Look at this mangled O-ring I found in one of the fitting. It's a good thing we didn't try to put that in. Wow, this is a really big loop. Like normally this goes up pretty fast. This is going to be a whole lot of this. It is going up though, yeah? Yep. If this is like Spiff's PC, I will be so mad. What happened with Spiff's PC? I just filled it with water and then it leaked water all over the GPU and then yeah. Let's go. This is going to take a lot of water. Whoa, what the crap? Who didn't put this fitting back on Jake? Let's go. Let's go. Speed filling. Careful, that is open. Oh, this one's open too. I didn't put it in over here either. Damn it, Alex. What the fuck Jake? Let's go, let's plug it. One, two, three, go. Let's go. Come on, come on, come on. There we go. Let's just let it do its thing for a little bit. Let me just see. It's going to do the exact same thing. Well, we're just going to let it do its exact same thing just for a little bit. Should we just press the CMOS clear button and see what happens? Yeah, that's a good idea. Okay. I feel good. Oh, hey, let's go. Yay. Do you want to set up? Would strongly suggest that we just downclock the RAM a little bit and it probably will be happy. No, we're not downclock the RAM. Are you kidding me? I would strongly suggest taking. Yeah. You know what? Guess what? Get rekt, Alex. Because here we go. Oh. It's trying something. We also don't. Hold on, hold on. This light up. 6,000 megahertz. Let's go. No, we're not doing Cinebench. We're playing Minecraft, Jake. God, it only does one thing. Wait, 100 degrees. Oh, I loosened the block and it's locked up. I wonder if the loosening of it is what actually fixed it. Oh, no. Yeah, I kind of think we have to play Minecraft today. What? No. I'm feeling really good about this. Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft. 350. Yeah, 350, she's fine. Don't worry about the 100 degrees. What the crap? Yeah. You're running Prime 95? Yeah, it's Prime 95 and it's doing what, like four and a half gigahertz? Okay, so what did you say it was? Classic.Minecraft.com? I mean, we had to stop really quick. Oh, wow. I mean, this is with Prime 95. This is Prime 95 in the background. Gotta chop the tree. Gotta karate chop the tree from the underside. That's what you get. And you guys get the end of this video. Hey, thanks Seasonic for sponsoring it. Your power supply was obviously not the problem, which is great because there was something bound to go wrong and it wasn't you, it's been a really long day. If you guys enjoyed this video, maybe go check out the first video we uploaded about this, where we show off the completely finished one. The glasses in place, like, yeah.

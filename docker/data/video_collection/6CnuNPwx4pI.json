    "transcript": "hmm hey can you type something for me sure thing what even is that to be honest I'm not quite sure this my friend is a proper typing keyboard oh wow how boring can you keyboard do this huh mine's smaller all the important stuff whatever guys at least mine looks good huh so all of these keyboards look pretty unique for either gaming typing or mobility let's check him out after this looking for a solid board to pair your 19 CPU the ASRock Z390 Taichi gets it right with robust vrm designs for extreme overclocking a 12 phase power design for smooth power delivery dual band Wi-Fi 3m 2 slots and reinforced PCI connectors learn more about it down below all right so everything you'll see today will be linked in the description below thank you very much all right so let's begin with something totally different in economic typing keyboard from a company X-Bows Ergonomic arrived with the MX brown switches and the fantastic rubber wrist rest that I now use for all my other keyboards everyday it connects via USB type-c which is a surprise and has a metal backplate on top of a plastic body now interestingly everything about this layout this kind of bizarre with non-standard key sizes like the giant backspace and alt keys broken up spacebar for both your thumbs tiny shift key on the sides and additional backspace enter ctrl and shift keys sandwiched right between that angular shift for the midsection the purpose here is to provide uninterrupted typing for both of your hands it's a more ergonomic level than your typical keyboard because the key columns flare into the middle at first it was super odd and awkward placing my hands on the keyboard and not knowing where the keys are and I was training myself for two weeks trying to get accustomed to it build new muscle memory and finger memory knowing where the keys are but it's been quite difficult and in the beginning I was making so many spelling errors and I still do one particular annoyance for me is how the spacing between the keys increases for the upper keys making it more difficult to actually recognize the full layout and this is the first time I'm trying something like it an economic keyboard some typist based on reviews love it and some find it extremely uncomfortable and in that second camp the driver software feels outdated but I'm a big fan of their RGB implementation and also because of that tiny shift key and caps lock etc on the left side gaming on this keyboard is out of question now speaking of keyboards you cannot game with I found this portable foldable Bluetooth keyboard that is actually quite fascinating if you need some basic typing and navigation so it folds into a compact and protected package with over 500 hours of standby time I wouldn't use this for everyday but the layout is actually not horrible given the fold breaks the keyboard flow I wish all the keys were the same size like DF TV are especially annoying with a thinner profile but if you need to carry a tiny keyboard someplace it's actually pretty good it connects to my iPhone my Android phones but honestly I'm faster typing on the phone itself while for a Windows machine given we have a tiny trackpad that's actually better than some notebook ones the keyboard is awesome to use with hard reach computer spaces or simple control of your HTPC it is a highly niche product of course but it's not too expensive at only $30 and moving on to something for gaming we have this interesting keyboard from Roccat the Vulcan 120 aimo if you like full-sized layouts and desk area is not the concern it's a cool option and the reason it's on my list are twofold Roccats own Titan mechanical switches and the overall board design so first the Titans which is this is becoming my favorite brown switch with a tactile point at one point eight millimeters with total travel distance of three point six and I also love the bounce back and the weight the half high key caps at the slim factor to such a massive keyboard that I appreciate but more importantly they don't cover any of the illumination and unlike what Coolermaster did with the totally flat surface of slim key caps on the Vulcan they're slightly curved and angled by row basis so fingers fall naturally into place and the stem by the way is MX based so if you wish you can swap some out as for the design the clear switch bass look fantastic with any hint of illumination and that aluminum base plate at texture the volume wheel is awesome and can be programmed to something else useful and for macro lovers you can utilize the EZ shift plus feature to activate that second layer of commands on shortcuts that I find incredibly useful for my editing workflow the magnetic wrist rest is okay it's just a plastic piece and if a tkl version was available that was slightly slimmer it would have my name on it totally what go on my desk which brings me to my next unique pick a hybrid keyboard from Asus the ROG claim or following in the legendary footsteps of the Sidewinder xx by Microsoft now the Claymore is from 2017 and I'm honestly quite surprised we haven't seen any more similar keyboards so what you can do here is detach that numpad area from the right and turn this into your standard T key a layout without any compromises but you can also attach the numpad section to the left of the keyboard thus giving you that full-size keyboard shortcuts and all the keys but clearing up that area on the right for a mouse movement it's an awesome hybrid approach the frame is as compact as possible thus there are no dedicated media controls outside the volume dial above the numpad section and you also have these rubber grommets to cover these side connectors when they're not in use and the only reason why this thing has kind of like slid under our radar since 2017 is the price it's hella pricey and especially for 20 so the price yes it is hella pricey especially for 2019 standards and that I guess comes with that hybrid premium and moving on to the last unique pic we have the Razer Tartarus v2 gamepad now I actually did the full video on this guy recently but the idea of a smaller gaming keypad that is more ergonomic is just awesome and I wish we had more of them on the market you can use them for macros within professional applications or in gaming as what they're designed for and the Tartarus v2 raises your wrists and relieves something you're fatigued and placing it closer to the body let's the elbow rest and it opens up a lot of the area for Mouse movement where normally your keyboard would be it does not replace your keyboard but might complement your work or gaming style if you're willing to pay full price over norm keyboard for this half-sized product get a good sense of grip with Corsairs iron claw RGB Gaming Mouse featuring a lightweight design ultra durable Emraan switches paired with Pixar's 33 91 optical sensor and some RGB lining for some extra Flair the iron claw ensures gaming at its best check it out down below alright so if you've seen any interesting or unique keyboards on the market let us know in the comments I would love to try something new going with the economic keyboard for the first time I thought that the awkward stage would pass as I trained my fingers and start to realize where the keys are but that didn't really emergent to anything and I'm quite impressed with the rocket Vulcan for the design and the key switches the Titan switchers are awesome but though if only they made a TTL version because the full-size with that extension on the frame is a bit too big for my style but guys I'm Dimitri thanks much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content subscribe for more I'll see you in the next video",

    "transcript": "Howdy there folks, I'm Quinn of Snazzy Labs and you're seeing my first video footage of the Panasonic Lumix GH4 which I picked up this morning. Now if your question is, \"Quinn, why did you change the equiptment?\" You're going to be seeing some amazing changes to Snazzy Labs in the next couple of weeks. If you didn't ask that, well, forget you. I'm talking about this camera in specific becauase it's an amazing camera. It truly is the first consumer camera at a $1600 pricepoint that allows us to shoot in full cinema 4k. It has incredible video quality and we're going to take a look at it today. Not too in depth of the camera itself because many a YouTubers have already done it. Rather, I want to talk about the Panasonic Image App which allows you to control the camera from your smartphone or tablet. Let's take a look.",

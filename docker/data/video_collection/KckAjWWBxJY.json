    "transcript": "It's giveaway time here in the studio and just like the title says another GTX 1070 will be given away I'm not giving away one of these two in particular These are the ones that go in Heisenberg I'm running some benchmarks on the R9 Fury right now But I will be giving away a Galax GTX 1070 EXOC They're the same company that makes the Hall Of Fame edition graphics cards Except this is the EOC, EXOC model excuse me Uh, it's a black graphics card, it comes with a backplate, had RGB functionality Just, you know, typical run of the mill GTX 1070 They sent it for review, I'll be doing my review on that within the coming days and then I'm just gonna package it back up and have it ready to send to one of you Now, who can enter ? Anyone All you need to do is follow me on one of three sites- Twitter, Instagram or Facebook @SalazarStudioYT You guys know the hashtag you know the @ whatever, my username, it's the same all across the board It doesn't matter where you live, it is a global giveaway like it always is And don't be discouraged if you live somewhere other than the United States, which is where I live In fact all three of the winners of the giveaways I've done in the past have not been in the United States So your chances are as good as anyone else who happens to live much closer than you may So that's it, all you need to do is follow me on one of those three social media outlets and you will be good as gold I did choose the last winner from Twitter, so your best chances are Instagram and Facebook That's not to say I won't choose somebody from Twitter I'm just, I'm trying to be all encompassing cause not everybody uses Twitter Not everybody uses Facebook etc. So uh that's all I'm asking, I'm not doing any special website I'm not forcing you to follow me Or verifying that you are, I'm not doing any of that All you have to do is follow me, that's it. that's all I'm telling you to do It helps me out, it helps my social outreach, it's good for a channel like this to have Social Media presence it does give me a kickback and in turn I guess I can reward one of you with the card and kind of get everyone else excited for the future of this channel and for future giveaways this will not be the last giveaway by any means If you are under the age of 18 all I ask for you to do is have a parent or guardian represent you I will be entering his or her name on the shipping label Just for legal reasons That's the only real thing I think I need to mention in this video It's a global giveaway, anyone can enter, just follow me on one of the three social media outlets using this username right here (@SalazarStudioYT) I guess I can fit it right there, yeah It's gonna be right there and you'll be good to go so facebook.com/SlazarStudioYT and then @SalazarStudioYT on both Instagram and Twitter you're good to go, have fun and best of luck I'll have the winner chosen on December 14th Hopefully you can get your card by Christmas time or if you don't celebrate Christmas whatever it's still a gift from the channel and a big thanks for following me and putting up with me on social media This is Salazar Studio, best of luck, and I'll catch you in the next video @SalazarStudioYT",

    "transcript": "and to conclude our visit here at Phanteks this is something that we also did ourselves when we review the P600s we had an anemometer anonym on our radar interpreter and nano meter 15 minutes we're good we're good hello good people I'm Dimitri feeling good here at Phanteks obviously we got our full brief and it's always pretty exciting because we're like yep Phanteks is getting what people want and as usual big thanks to our sponsors Razer Phanteks be quiet and thermatake for making CES 2020 possible this is the m2 pro 2 I was honestly not expecting them to be based the whole chassis frame based on the end of seven one nine I was expecting them to have a slightly new iteration of the original Enthoo pro but that was based on the Enthoo Lux and so the new evolution of where we are today is the Enthoo Pro II obviously the whole focus here would be on performance and air flow because of the new added performance Phanteks fabric at the front that has also dust filter underneath and this is like the different versus what we see with the end of seven one nine because of that whole aluminum panel on that more premium enclosure here they are not cutting corners but they are minimizing on the premium like material so for example the whole plastic panel here is plastic with a little brushed texture they do have this little channel engraved that I was hoping would be LED strips and kind of looks like you maybe be able to put something in here but it isn't it's a plane and so the only LED we get on the enclosure is the power button and the low LED strip on the power supply shroud that separates the bottom chamber with the top but still gives us a nice little deluxe look with a little bit of texture that isn't just super plain and super flat now since the case is based on the end of seven one nine we do have all the same interior layout in terms of being able to populate that bottom chamber with a power supply and ITX system the ITX motherboard tray is included which is awesome or you can populate multiple our drives using those hard drive caddies the system you see here actually has a dual power supply one in the front that is visible and one in the back and as for the main motherboard area large so accommodates massive motherboards as they have installed here lots of radio locations for the front the top and the side and the side is ventilated well it's slightly different a ventilation pattern but it is there's a little dust filter in there as well in case you want to intake air but everything else is identical except for this slightly different top layout configuration since the pro 2 is all about performance and air flow we can install up to 15 fans in here and the fact that we have that fabric material in the front means we are getting the best airflow possible from what Phanteks offers and you can install like over 10 hard drives and over 10 SSDs so plenty of storage capacity and the overall direction for something like this as you guys have seen in our decade Awards video everyone loves the Enthoo 719 from its performance level and the fact that we're now getting the same chassis at the lower price point and just to recap on the price so the Enthoo Pro 2 is $129 which is six dollars cheaper versus the end two seven one nine giving you all the same features so you can save some money invest some that cash into more hardware and more fans and have a pretty awesome looking system VI ohm is at the front by the way with four USB 3s at type C gen 2 thank you very much behind this nice little closed door that is plastic so as the whole front panel but $129 is a good value for something that is so enthusiast ready and friendly all right guys I'm Dimitri which case oh wait so now let's move on to some other interesting but really exciting upgrades from Phanteks this is the P300a a stands from air flow obviously they've taken a lot of fear like positive feedback based on the P400a now the P300a is still the same price $59 which was my budget enclosure for 2018 fantastic value and you get so much more performance this is the ultrafine mesh without the filter underneath which means that you have no resistive layers outside of this actual metallic mesh a cool element here is that this whole mesh panel is one single piece it's not like a mesh that is attached with a plastic frame so that means that we have much more actual surface area for the holes and air fault to go through and that is actually pretty cool they have removed the RGB strip on the side so now we have this low illumination over here that is your power illumination in white and everything else has remained the same aside from the actual TG mount that has also been moved to the back to keep the side clean it will come with a 120 mil exhaust fan and so that's the P300a $59 case I'm sure this is they're going to definitely pick up some awards for the best budget case so now let's move on to the P500a so obviously a again stands for airflow they're continuing with this whole mesh design that is again based on one single piece of mesh that they fold and they Bend giving us a lot more surface area and this is actually a really nice strong piece so there's no plastic frame that holds the mesh together giving us so much more airflow no filter underneath this is acting as your dust filter and as you mesh for airflow and the actual interior shell or the most of the exterior is based on the P600s which is our case of the year as you guys know make sure to check out the decade awards video which means you can do everything that you could do with the evolve X and the P600s on the interior but in this really high airflow high performance enclosure so as for the interior you can do a 420 rather the front a 360 up top we still have the SLO panels on the side for cable management and for storage you can do a dual system integration above the I main ATX motherboard so an ITX up top main ATX section a power supply has now also has this beautiful LED strip that was not present on the P600s so something that they wanted to really spice up over here the more premium model or the more version of this case will come with three addressable a RGB fans at the front 140 Miller fans so we'll get beautiful front airflow utilizing that front mesh for nice performance still we have a swinging side panel over here with nice rubber pads for best isolation and good pressure while the rear panel no longer has the swivel door it will just be standard the i/o has now shifted to the top with dual USB 3s a type C and the a RGB buttons and the pricing this for this is the fun part for the more premium model that includes the three front fans is 129 so that is 20 dollars cheaper versus what you get with a P600s so that's a really attractive price for really the same features and like a really good performance - and what a little-little my crop over there and $99 p500a that will only include two fans at the front and no LED strip so no a RGB little controller stuff so at $99 for this type of functionality and frame I'm thinking yeah fan things did it again and finish off this video Phanteks has prepared a really cool experiment to showcase how their mesh the fabric mesh and the metal mesh is actually best-in-class we have a noctua industrial fan running at 1,400 rpm we have an unknown ometer that measures air flow speed on the other side and we can see what's what's happening with the air flow when there's nothing in front of the fan and when we have different mesh from like the actual Phanteks P600s that has both the dust filter and the fabric what happens when we remove the actual dust filter when we have just a fabric when we have just the Phanteks p400A P500A P300a mesh the metal mesh on there and we also have some competition this is the sample F as we are told I'm gonna move it around so you potentially may notice whereas this is from there's also a little bit of a filter underneath that you cannot remove so dust will get inside and block out the airflow and this is hilarious you guys can probably guys what this is from right so this is kind of an unfortunate thing where we can see what happens exactly with the airflow and so here are the numbers on screen so based on these numbers the fabric mesh from the new pro 2 case without the dust filter is the best performer it is actually impressively close to what we get without anything in front of the fan and we do lose only a little bit when we add the dust filter with the pro M and that whole fabric mesh the performance measurement acts and it just it's a really cool example to see what happens with airflow when you put something in front the fan and how all the different layers of resistance add to something that eventually reflect in higher temperatures and from what we see today I mean the Phanteks fabric performance mesh dominates alright guys so that's all new things from Phanteks super exciting things when it comes to the evolution of the Enthoo 719 into something that is more affordable and there's more targeted towards like the the performance users at the slightly different category and really really looking forward to testing the p500a as well thanks much for watching I'll talk to you guys in a next one",

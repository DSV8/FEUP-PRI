    "transcript": "in every person's life there Comes a Day A Day of Reckoning where they must push the boundaries of what Humanity thought was possible regardless of the suffering they must endure and today is that day and Lexar I guess blackstars also here they sponsored this video [Music] thank you in case it wasn't clear from the intro in today's video I'm going to use some Lexar memory and other things that are significantly less important hashtag sponsor sponsor to try and reach over 9 000 frames per second in a video game is it possible I don't know is there any point absolutely not but in today's video it may happen I don't know it may let's see now before we scour the entirety of steam to find a game engine capable of over 9 000. we need to meet the hardware I'm gonna use here are the three corners that make up the triangle of power that we're going to use starting off with the CPU I got an AMD ryzen 9 7950 X 3D which is just one of the fastest gaming CPUs in the world no big deal now I did want to buy a 7800 X 3D instead which I think may even be a smidgen faster than this but I couldn't find any stock so I had to buy this one instead what can you do of course in terms of graphics card I had no choice but to use the monolithic RTX 4090 now in all fairness when it comes to just balls to the wall frame rate the graphics cards probably not going to be the main bottleneck I think the CPU is a lot more important but I hear you say David I don't care about these two corners of the triangle of power they're basically irrelevant tell me more about the fancy new Lexar memory you're using I'm going to be using lexar's new Ares RGB ddr5 this 32 gig kit clogs to a blistering 6 000 megahertz without the Supreme Lexar bandwidth the other two corners of the triangle of power will crumble and this is the system that's gonna house the triangle of power so let's get into it first I need to upgrade the power supply to something that can handle all the beef and this 1200 watt unit fsp sent over seems like just the right amount of Overkill [Music] oh that power supply is the size of a dwarf planet look at that oh I really like this gunmetal paint finish despite it being a thousand two hundred watt power supply they opted for this little loser on off button although having said that oh that is a lovely switch [Music] oh no I just realized there's some Ram from a different brand in here we're just gonna have to cover that up real quick and replace it with some Lexar oh that does look like Ram made by Aries himself and it lights up oh that's much better disaster averted I also decided to replace the two 40mm AIO with the 360mm one just for a little bit more temperature Headroom which only involved some medium struggle [Music] I also want to drop in one of lexar's new nm800 Pro super fast nvme drives [Music] and just like that the system was ready for Glory now we're starting off with Battlefield 5 not because I think we can get nine the hour tank not because I think we can get over 9 000 frames per second in it I'm just curious to see what kind of frame rate we can get currently we're running a 1080p High settings and with the frame cap on which is kind of set up by default you can see the system is not doing much at ultra settings and with the frame rate uncapped in the settings drop to low we're not getting much more than 300 frames per second and that's with the system not doing much so I'm guessing this is a bit of a game engine limit which I think may become a theme over the course of this video but we'll see interestingly switching over to DirectX 11 actually gives us a higher frame rate Peak and more GPU utilization although we're still light years off from our 9 000 frame per second goal so I think we need new game wow CS go is not doing as well as I was expecting a 1080p low this is a bot match but still only 380 frames per second what is this trash frame rate so I decided to try out CS Go's built-in Benchmark which I'd say helped a bit in the built-in Benchmark room we're getting a thousand four hundred frames per second it may be Benchmark as opposed to have actual gameplay performance but still is gaming happening and we're over a thousand five hundred here if we look into the corner here we can get up to a thousand 700 and 103 frames per second and on this 240 hertz monitor you can really feel the 1700 frames per second dropping the resolution to 720p helped a bit but I still need so much more my solution was to make the smallest possible custom map for CS go with a wall texture so basic even quick one would embarrass it at a urinal but the initial impressions of my masterpiece was disappointing it's still giving us a what after a quick Google it turns out CS go also has a frame rate cap which you can disable using the console oh yes 2 100 frames per second uh we're still very much shy of 9 000 but that's pretty good either way we need a new game briefly moving away from the source engine I decided to try out Doom Eternal which usually is a beast when it comes to super high frame rates just look at that menu FPS at 1080p low settings we are getting about 500 frames per second again you can really tell on this Monitor and after playing around with the settings didn't yield significantly more performance I decided to find a more basic game environment now I found a tutorial map which has much less going on and in fact if you like look up at the darkness uh you get quite a high frame rate although granted this is at 720p with dlss on performance I guess the next step is to reduce the resolution scale whoa even with the lowest settings possible we are getting much less frame rate than we did with cs go after this slight disappointment I tried a couple other games including Doom 1 which topped out at about 200 frames per second Rainbow Six Siege which gave us over a thousand frames per second at 720p low and I even tried Unreal Tournament Game of the Year Edition I'm so glad I have this two terabyte Lexar Drive in here I can install Unreal Tournament Game of the Year Edition seven million times I guess that's that's the math there a few moments later okay well that just keeps crashing when I try and launch it even Quake 2 RTX with the RTX renderer off capped out at a thousand frames per second so with cs go still being the champion I guess we need to go back to the source engine but just try a much older game I think Half-Life 2 is a good bet uh here it's running a 1080p High settings with vsync off and as you can tell we have an FPS cap of 300 frames per second again it's clearly not due to the hardware because I don't think the RTX 4090 even realizes a game is happening FPS Max zero oh there we go the game is like running in super speed what the hell is going on oh no look at that I then dropped all the settings and the resolution to the lowest they'd go damn it still isn't repeating that initial Spike of over 3 400 frames per second it's so funny how everything is like sped up look at how so despite finding a new frame rate Champion we still have quite a way to go to make our goal of over 9 000 frames per second and after a quick Google something that a bunch of you have probably been shouting at the screen for a while now became clear I need to try Minecraft holy crap with Minecraft running at fast settings just by uncapping the frame rate we're getting over a thousand frames per second and we haven't even started screwing around with stuff yet I'm real glad we have that Lexar memory in here the first step to get more performance was just to drop all the settings I could find oh yes there we go okay so we're at a thousand seven hundred frames per second feels so very smooth okay so if I drop the resolution to 640x480 let's see what that does it's actually not netted us that much more frame rate although we are getting close to that 2 000 frame per second Point I've switched over to creative mode so I could fly around and stuff which has given us a bit more frame rate let me fly higher so the land doesn't render anymore and see the crazy part for me about this is that the CPU is still barely doing anything but I guess that's because this is like an 8 000 core CPU and despite that still not bad better than Half-Life yet I then tried on OptiFine which unfortunately didn't help the performance much but in my disappointment I found a video that said the best version of Minecraft for super high frame rates is some alpha build older than the universe itself which did help so I think how this works is you just fall off the side and eventually lots of frame rate happens wow yeah that is a lot obviously the fact that nothing's being rendered helps but and that is that's a big number but still nowhere near 9 000 frames per second and after spending a while playing around with memory and CPU boost frequencies not helping the performance much I decided for no particular reason that the motherboard and CPU weren't playing together nice and considering that I didn't have another x67 board lying around I decided to try Intel instead luckily I did have a 3900 KF flying around [Music] whoa even with OptiFine that's made a massive difference look at that and when you minimize your HUD it's even bigger we've got almost 5 000 frames per second although as impressive as that is it's still not 9 000. switching to over the edge of Oblivion in Alpha we're getting almost 7 000 frames per second now but it still wasn't enough so I turned off all the efficiency cores on the CPU and started overclocking oh over a thousand were getting so close [Music] setting aside the fact we've got six gigahertz Happening Here we are within spinning distance of our goal but unfortunately the CPU had no more left to give no matter what I did I just couldn't get a higher frequency to boot it seemed like I had tripped right in front of the finish line and shattered both my kneecaps but then for no particular reason I decided to instead of MSI afterburner try fraps as a performance overlay wait what the hell I'm not even in the depths of Minecraft Despair and we've maxed out the frame rate counter at 999. wait fraps has to be reporting it wrong let me quickly get MSI afterburner back up look it was MSI afterburner's fault when you switch it on it briefly shows 10 000 frames per second and then it it drops down to what it was before it was because of MSI afterburner we've done it using fraps I could even get over 9 000 frames per second in OptiFine actually rendering things so on my Day of Reckoning I was Victorious all thanks to Lexar memory until the next video bye-bye [Music] remember",

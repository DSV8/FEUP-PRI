    "transcript": "- Oi! Oh, that's so nice. - The case is on fire. The case is on fire. - Ah! Our friends from Hacksmith Industry came all the way to Vancouver to show us something amazing. - Linus has absolutely no idea what it is. I am so stoked! Do you wanna see this? - I think so. As long as it's not too dangerous. There's so much tension in the room right now! Okay. Okay. I'm doing it - We brought two. - Is this an actual product. Oh! Don't drop. Don't get hit by the flames and don't die. There's nothing in this. - No, this is just a flaming expander to make sure that we don't get liquid propane on the computer. (laughs) - Oh my god. - That's the ignition source. That's where we're gonna light the whole thing up. - Oh, shut up. I'm in. Just like I'm in to tell you about our sponsor AMD. AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT are some of the best graphics card options for 4K gaming under a thousand dollars. Check them out at the link in the video description. - A pretty simple setup. Got liquid propane. Goes into our electronics box. So right now we're just running it at full power and then that goes into our propane expander. This gets sub-zero. Theoretically this can drop down to negative 42 degrees Celsius. And then we have our flame expander that just has, you know a nice warming effect. All right, so you can just-- (shrieks) - Oh, that's fun. Ha ha! Okay. (shrieks) Is that on? - No. - That's not on. That should be on right? - Yeah, probably, yeah. - Yeah! What could go wrong? We do have a fire extinguisher handy. Can someone actually be holding this? No? Okay that'll be here. - Let's just see how we're doing here. - Wow! - Minus 25 at the cooling side! And what's our flame doing? Well more than 130. - Yeah. - Can someone explain to me the principle of this? I mean, I understand that the liquid propane is extremely cold. - Right. Air conditioners work by having a liquid that expands. That cools the thing. You compress that compressor and turn it back into liquid. - Here instead you're just burning it. - Think about it this way, right? Let's say you have a natural gas line going into your house. Instead of just burning it for your natural furnace you can also use it to cool your computer and that tank will last a good two hours. - I mean, it's not the first time we asked Mother Earth to take one for the team, I guess. - The flame expander is standard 240 millimeter mounting. So that just goes right on, top mounted CPU cooler-- - Right on top of your computer. Are we actually doing that? - It is literally the hottest CPU cooler. - This goes for a while, eh? - Yeah, there's a lot of liquid in here - So, like, all of that has to evaporate before it actually shuts down. - Give her a little you know (grunts) - You can actually warm it up with your hands. It goes quicker. - For the components of our subzero-ed on fire pc we have an i9-13900K. For the motherboard, it's a Strix E Z79 For a GP, we have the Strix 4090 and this thing is a fricking beast. Now we do have two not a flame thrower PC coolers and we just wanna put two of them on the CPU. That'll be so much more fun. All of these components spare the GPU are actually going into Spiffing Brit's PC. So Tom, if you're watching this, I'm incredibly sorry that I put Vaseline all over your motherboard. Before we go any further, we need to just set a baseline 39,512 points in Cinebench. She fricking rips. What do you call this - Fiery boy (laughs loudly) You know what they say. Any machine is a smoke machine if used wrongly enough. - Ah, it's actually fine. 38 degrees. That'll feel a little bit warm to your hand. - Give a man a fire, keep him warm for the day. Set a man on fire keep him warm for the rest of his life. - One of my absolute favorite things on these new ASUS boards is that instead of having to stick your hand in there to hit the little PCIe release thing there's just a little switch, little button right there. Now you might be wondering, why did I take this apart if we're not going to be sub-zero cooling and that's because I want to have an external voltage controller. So what we are doing is by just very simply sticking a little header here that allows us to connect to the I2C bus. And with that, we're going to talk to the voltage controller and be like, what about you give us just way more voltage than you think you should. And then it does. Then we have a very fast GPU - Right now, since we don't have a 13900. The only way I can make a mounting bracket for it is by buying a mounting bracket that already existed and then hoping to match up the bolt patterns. Think this is a cooler master bracket that I got from Amazon and hopefully it fits onto this motherboard. - Oh, I think I can do you one better. We have this thing. It has all of the bolt patterns, piece of neoprene. So you go like this. We're actually going to want to take this socket cover right off and underneath it we're going to put a little bit of artist's eraser. When there's air in your sub-zero, condensation forms. Condensation on the back of your CPU, you know where this ends. (machines whirring) How's that? Aha. It's on. Alright, we have I2C now. Dear viewer, I would like to apologize. The storyline for the Strix and the external voltage controller ends right here. We tried to get it to work later but sadly our monitor was melting and we ran out of time. Instead of installing this retention bracket on that came with the motherboard we're going to use this Thermal Grizzly CPU contact frame. Before we put this on though... please everybody clip this and send it to Spiff. There we go. I forgot to conformal coat the bits. All the little chips that are around here. But I have a solution. How do you feel right now? (laughs loudly) (machines grinding) - Now we can get in 800 watts of cooling on a single i9. - Heck yeah! - Yeah. Can fit two beside each other there. So we've got two radiators. The plan is to put one here...and one over here and then that will create a lot of fire. (machine grinding) Now for the free brackets, we have a single double bracket. Basically we've just muted mutilated one of our mounting brackets so we can mount two of the coolers onto a single CPU. - That'll give us full coverage of not just the dye but also the integrated heat spreader. That will actually double our total cooling capacity. - Alex (snickers) - The motherboard is stuck. Ew. You know what will be fun next time, Alex? - [Alex] What? - Cooling a computer with a fire extinguisher. - No! No! (chuckles) - This piece of neoprene might be a little bit bigger than the case can handle. - Hmm. Let's just mount it like normal using the thing you brought. - Add some more dielectric grease. That'd be fine. - Neoprene's nice but since we have schmood it - Let's do that? - Yep. - All right. - I can tell you this isn't gonna be enough. You will literally have water dripping off the back of this bracket. We have to keep air off it. - The best part is if we do this outside they're probably won't even be any condensation on this. - It still smells like propane in here, you guys. - See the thing that they add to propane to make it really nice and smelly? It lasts for about three to six months is what I've read online. - I just did the math on how much heat this is going to create. Okay, well for reference, electricity, a kilowatt hour is equal to 3,400 BTUs. We're going to be close to half a million. (chuckles) - This might actually be more expensive than I'm running liquid nitrogen. - You guys know that we just have like bolt down kits right? - Yes. But I don't know where it is going back to-- - It's in my office. - It's in, I look for that so long yesterday. - Do you know why I keep my bolt through in this bin in my office? Cuz we had lots of them, and nobody puts them back where they're supposed to be which is why we don't have those other ones. And mine is not in here anymore. What the hell happened to my bolt through? Why can't people return things? Oh, this is cute. I did find one cool thing in here though. Check this out. This pen has a Lee and Lee catalog. I would call this whole thing half-baked but with like half a million BTUs? I think it's probably full baked. Maybe even over baked. One thing's for sure. It's baked. - See, my initial prototype was 200 watts and Alex was like, \"That's not enough. Double it\". And I was like, okay. So that was 400 watts and Alex was like, oh I wonder if we can put two of the body here. - Yes, I know. I work with him every day. - What do you want? If we had 200 watts on this thing that CPU would be hotter than the sun. - This is what it takes to make me even more grateful for my team that I work with. Working with someone else is-- - As soon as I asked, I'm like Hey, can I get Alex's contact? You're probably like, oh no. - I'm pretty sure that I actually said that. - You've had enough thoughts, Alex. This ain't no amateur hack job. That's why we're using propane. - That's one of the worst things you've ever said - Man. I've seen builds from our community using actual computer cooling components that look less clean than this. - I feel like there's not many people that are running the 13900 with a 4090 all overclocked, modded and sub-zeroed. We might set some high scores here. - You'd be surprised how many nerds have already set those high scores. The difference is that their system is not practical day to day. - Yeah. In the Canadian weather, it's great for heating your house. Spiffing Brit's gonna get his computer and it's gonna be covered in dielectric grease and smell like propane. He's gonna be very confused. - Yeah. In fairness, his computer was already going to be kind of confusing anyway cuz it's gonna be cooled by tea. So... Well, he's British - Frigging people from Vancouver, they don't clear off any of their stuff. You realize how long it would take to just like (airily whistles) - I cleaned out the spot under the fan so it won't be sucking snow up into the power supply. - That's thoughtful. - It was Brandon's idea. God, there's snow in the USB connector. - Fine. Once you turn your computer off, it'll solve itself. We now have the ability to dump over 20 liters an hour of propane through this computer. I see nothing that could go wrong. - Feel like we're going through a nuclear launch sequence or something. All right, Alex, you want to go ahead and hit it? - Sure. - Oi! Okay! - Aha! - Cool! - Just a bit further away. - Oh! Oh, that's so nice. - Yea. That is very nice. - So that clicking noise is actually the solenoid being controlled by the fan header. Keep the flame at a minimum while the CPU is not doing any work. - I see. We're at minus 10 degrees Celsius so far, minus 11, and this is with restraint. This is with the regulator going. - [Narrator] Regulator! - This is our pilot flame. (chuckles) - This is a proud Canadian tradition. The annual computer cook. Should we be worried about the flames being on the lines? - They'll be okay for a little bit. - They're directly in the fire though. - Yeah, that's probably not ideal. - Yeah, they're kind of smoking - They're cooking. - We really wanna get these outta the way a little bit more - Yeah, there's a bit of wind. We've got a bit of wind factor going on Oh! - I don't know that I want this to be that close. - No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine. Because we're gonna rotate it this way. It's gonna go like this. That power supply is now sucking in snow. Just, yeah. Perfect Okay! Yeah, it should be fine. - Well, do you want to hit it again? (shrieks) (laughs) - Monitor is getting a little toasty now. - Ideally we don't cook the monitor. - Ah! Wow, the front of this case is looking pretty gnarly. - Oh wow! She's sweating boys. Hold on. Back in. Monitor's warping a little. - Oh, that's not great. - Ooh, that's too hot on the hands. That's really hot. Wow. Okay - Guys, so we're gonna overclock this thing or what? - Let's get a baseline run with the cooling. - Distance to TjMax 100 degrees. (laughs) - So we are starting to build us some froth on the back - As long as the frost doesn't turn to water we're good CPU package, one degree Celsius. 39,795 points. What was our baseline? - 39,500. - Oh! So we've got like 300 points. Wow! - XTU has a new automatic over clock. Should we just hit it and see what happens? - Let's see what it thinks of this - CPU package. We're currently consuming 260 watts. - 40,481 points though. - Ha ha! Should we just give her the beans? See what happens. - All right. We are now deregulated. Who needs regulations? - But you can't be any geek off the street. - Oh my goodness. I don't know if max was a very good idea. Oh my God. The monitor! (screams) - The fittings are on fire. The case is on fire. - Oh yeah. The plastic at the front of the case is on fire. Who was it who didn't wanna have the fire extinguisher handy? - You? (laughs loudly) - Alright, I can solve this. Ah, oh did you turn it off? - Yeah, I turned it off. - Oh why? - Why?! - Yeah, we can just press that one. - Okay. It's back on - In case it hasn't been adequately covered yet, the flames themselves are not what are doing the cooling. These are propane cylinders. Instead of having them right side up so they release gashes propane, we flip them upside down so that they release liquid propane, which is between negative 40 and negative 45 degrees Celsius. That runs through this regulator right here - [Narrator] Regulator! - which then dumps that liquid propane directly onto our CPU. Now obviously liquid propane is gonna have to go somewhere. It gets heated by the CPU, turned into a gas and then released through these tubes into our flame expander up here where obviously it's gonna be lit on fire so you can roast marshmallows. - Alright, do you guys think this can do six gigahertz? - Yeah. Are we gonna turn onto max again? - It's running Cinebench right now at six gigahertz. Oh, it's actually at 95 degrees. So it did six no problem. - What score did we get? - 40,990. Yeah, I think that we can do 41 pretty easily here. - Some graham crackers? - Yeah, I could really go for some. - By the way, I love your portable marshmallow roaster. Go onto Hacksmith.store Alright, would you like a pair of safety glasses too? - Safety. Ooh - 41,604. (laughs) 6.1 gigahertz. Not too bad. 4.5 on all the efficiency cores. This thing's actually ripping. - It may not be as cold as some methods of cooling but it certainly has plenty of cooling capacity. Ooh, wow. That's really hot. - Since we're getting some liquid coming through at full power. The bottom is actually completely frozen over. - If we had a maze style design or otherwise more complex evaporator head over the CPU it's possible we could be seeing much better heat exchange and getting better efficiency out of our propane cylinders. - Ooh, that's hot. Woo. - So it turns out having flames on your stuff does make it go faster. - Oh, I don't know if we can do 6.3. All core 6.2. - All core 6.2? That would be impressive. My god. So hot! Listen to your Mac do this. (sniggers) Sup Jake. - Also, the CPU's running at 6.4 gigahertz right now. - Nice. - Oh God, okay, urgh! - Ah yeah, it's a little unpredictable. - Oh no. The back of the monitor is all liquidy again. - Oh balls. Oh my Jesus . - It's very ergonomic now. No more sharp corners. - I don't think that's-- - Whoa. Oh and it crashed. - Okay.

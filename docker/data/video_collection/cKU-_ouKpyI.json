    "transcript": "what's up everyone over here with Hardware Canucks and welcome to an interesting camera comparison between the Google Pixel 3 and the Razer Phone 2 now this is by no means a full head-to-head comparison in fact I still have to spend more time evaluating the hardware and my experiencing using both of these devices so stay tuned for my reviews or individual reviews on both these devices in the next few months but my recent trip to Beijing I took both these phones with me to test the camera performance because you know interestingly enough these both cost $799 and I thought you know it would give us a unique perspective as to how as to what these phones could offer given that they cost exactly the same because both of these devices are tailored towards a different type of demographic so let's check out the results right after this one of the best gaming headsets is now available through Massdrop the PC37X has fantastic drivers incredible comfort and the best microphone in class plus they look awesome for a gaming headset check out the drop link below alright so before I show you the results I do want to mention something so remember I said I took both these devices with me on my recent trip to Beijing I did and I performed a lot of camera tests between the two but on my way back Michael decided to accidentally factory reset at the razor phone - so it literally just wiped all of the pictures that was taken on the razor phone - which was really depressing didn't really it it was quite it was quite a terrific terrific experience actually so I got my baby back to Toronto and I just had to reshoot my camera comparison so yeah that's we're gonna leave it at all right so specs why is the pixel 3 features a single 12.2 megapixel rear-facing camera with an f1 pointed aperture the razor phone 2 features dual sony IMX 12 megapixel sensors and different focal lengths so one of them is a standard F 1.75 lens and the other being a telephoto F 2.6 lens the razor phone 2 has OIS is on both lenses whereas the pixel 3 features OIS and electronic image stabilization I'm going to start with the rear cameras and move on to the front-facing sensors later on I shot these photos in auto mode with HDR turned on to get the optimal results and at first glance I notice that the pixel 3 retains a lot of the detail with subjects compared to the razor phone 2 and I think part of this has to do with these software processing it's not overly done like LG but rather razor-sharp no pun intended by the way with the razor phone too the detail is certainly present but it comes a bit shorter when compared to the pixel especially when you zoom in and crop photos the other thing that surprised me the most was how well the dynamic range was on the razor phone 2 it's really amazing to see how razor has stepped up the quality game in that department it's really hard to find any overexposed shots on the razor phone 2 simply because the HDR processing is done pretty well and you won't be disappointed with the results I also want to touch base on the exposure and as you're watching these samples you'll notice that the pixel 3 tends to underexpose in most situations compared to the razor phone 2 but with that being said you can easily fix that through an editing app like Snapseed or Adobe Lightroom now in terms of colors this is totally subjective but I actually prefer the razor phone 2 over the pixel 3 simply because razor actually does a good job capturing the natural two-tone colors of a subject depending on the lighting situation whereas the pixel of 3d has a weird magenta shift and I'm not a fan of that I think it was AI processing is trying to spice things up by increasing the saturation making things look pretty compared to what's actually out there again you may disagree with me on that but in the end of the day it's all about personal preference taking a look at low-light performance and I have to give this one to the pixel 3 the images still maintain their sharpness and color without introducing a lot of noise and it just looks awesome the razor phone 2 on the other hand does ok but you lose detail and there is a little bit of noise and images and in some cases it starts to introduce weird color shifts so that's something to keep in mind now I should also mention that the dedicated telephoto lens on the razor phone 2 comes in really useful if you want to zoom into subjects since there's a lot more detail preserved compared to the pixel 3's enhanced digital zoom feature and that's to be expected portrait mode on the other hand certainly favors the pixel 3 and no matter how hard you try Google's AI is really good at isolating the subject from the background plus it's super sharp so you really won't be too pointed with the results however in some cases I was able to notice that weird magenta shift that I talked about earlier I mean it's a cooler look compared to the slightly warmer tone on the razor phone too but just from a feature standpoint pixel 3 takes the edge here because the end results are getting nowhere compared to the razor phone 2 in terms of the sharpness and the subject separation when we want to the front-facing camera tests and interestingly enough the number of cameras on these devices are at the complete opposite so the pixel 3 has two front facing cameras and the razor phone 2 has just one so specs wise the pixel 3 features 8 megapixel sensors with a standard one featuring an F 1.8 aperture compared to the wide-angle lens that has an F 2.2 weighting the razor phone 2 has an 8 megapixel sensor with an F 2.0 aperture and right off the bat the pixel 3 dominates the razor phone - I mean when you look at all aspects like dynamic range sharpness colors subject separation etc there is no denying the fact that Google has worked really hard and delivering the best overall camera experience that additional wide-angle lens comes in really useful for group selfies if you're into that kind of stuff now with the razor phone 2 I feel like they could have tweaked the sensor a little bit because I think they're using the exact same one from the original razor phone so if you take a lot of selfies I would completely skip the razor phone 2 and get the pixel 3 portrait mode again favors the pixel 3 there is great subject / background separation whereas with the razor phone 2 let's just say it's completely unusable alright good people this is the video test on the razor phone 2 and the pixel 3 as you can probably tell there's a lot of jitter I guess a lot of motion on the razor phone 2 compared the pixel 3 because the pixel 3 looks like it has OIS and EIS is which means it's doing a pretty good job stabilizing this footage whereas with the razor phone 2 it's just clearly not evident so the pixel 3 but this is also a good microphone test because it's it's a pretty windy day today in Toronto also really really cold and freezing my hand right now but yeah let me know what you guys think about the microphone quality as well in the comment down below so this is the front-facing camera test on the pixel three and the razor phone 2 as you can see there's a lot of exposure I mean highlights on the razor phone 2 are completely blown out where's the pixel three you can certainly retain a lot of that there's also a lot more detail on the pixel three compared to the razor phone 2 and of course the colors are a little bit washed out in the razor phone 2 compared to the pixel 3 but it also gives a good idea or representation on what the microphone quality is like on both these phones and before I wrap up my thoughts I do want to talk about my experience using the camera apps on both these smartphones so the pixel 3 was pretty straightforward I just opened the app I was just pointing out this you know a particular subject and I was able to capture that moment right away whereas it the razor phone 2 you have to actually spend some time to frame and of course make sure that you actually hit the shutter button because in some cases it actually takes 2 to 3 seconds to complete that shutter and that's just kind of annoying at least in some cases especially if you want to capture that right moment you have a very I guess you have a tendency of losing that with the razor phone 2 compared to the pixel 3 so that's something to keep in mind another thing that I want to mention is that there's a significant amount of delay with the live viewfinder on the razor camera app so if you are putting in a subject you are known gonna be noticing a little bit of delay in that regard now in terms of video performance the pixel 3 is the clear winner here because the sensor has both OIS and EIS so the final results are very much usable colors are well balanced it's got great sharpness and you know it's not as washed out when compared to the razor phone 2 I should also mention the pixel 3 does have a slow motion capabilities whereas the razor phone 2 doesn't and microphone quality I'm I'm kind of neutral in that regard because I haven't compared it to the iPhone 10s and the other smart phones out there so I want to hear your thoughts on the overall camera comparison what do you guys think about it let me know in the comments and which one do you actually prefer considering both of these devices cost $799 stay tuned for my full review on the pixel 3 and the razor phone 2 in the next few months I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out our new boot sequence channel for the latest tech news and rumors and you can also check out some relevant content over here I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one you",

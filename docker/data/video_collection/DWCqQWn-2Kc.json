    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video and today I have something that I am very excited for. I think you might be too, this is... Well, it definitely fits into the weird zone. The weird zone keeps expanding, but this is really in that neighborhood. It's called the SUBPAC look at that. This here is wearable bass, tactile bass. What?! It's like a back pack, the SubPac M2 And this is supposed to enhance your experience of sound, in like a physical way. I can see that being interesting specifically for gaming. If you could imagine some warzone type game you're getting shot at. You can actually feel the... feel the rumble! *shaking uncontrollably* If this doesn't get you excited as a tech head, I don't know what would, you're gonna wear your sound. Bro. Is that the title of the video? \"Wear your sound, Bro\"? Now this thing isn't cheap, I'm going to warn you so before you click the link just realize that This thing looks like some kind of body armor Wow! A little sound card kind of deal Intensity, bluetooth, a line-in and a headphone out. A little power brick for that unit. What is this? It's a strap? That's what I'm going to look like in a minute when I strap this baby on. You can hook on the little sound unit to the belt straps. So you actually be completely mobile, Oh! There is right there. All the international connectors Holy! This is some terminator type stuff right here Pick that up there, Jack? It's very slim, Grado here from a previous video. Now, these are very, highly regarded, but they're not well known for having the most bass. So the headphone out, and go to my headphones It thumped me a little bit, plug this guy in OOOH *laugh* The audio is coming out of this iPad into the box out to the headphones. I'm exited! *exclaiming pleasure* *laughs* What?! OOOH Wow! *laughs* Wah! That I didn't... you... You don't even think about music that way, It is so weird! To feel the bass, not to hear it! I can't even imagine you got the headset one, people shooting machine guns at you and *machine guns like sounds* It's that kinda like, You know what? We we're having a bad day. I'm alive again! It just gave me juice! If you can try the thing, try the thing, I don't know maybe... you could send it back if you don't have this weird experience that I do, but I'm a different guy now. It's a subwoofer and you wear it! I feel like I'm 12 years old",

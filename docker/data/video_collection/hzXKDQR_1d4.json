But what REALLY matters right now is how this lineup seems designed to create customer confusion.  Let's try and cut through the hype to explain what's going on here....

    "transcript": "well you guys probably guessed it because there's no way Intel was gonna take all of those AMD product launches lying down right I mean if you're here to learn more about their new desktop processors look away right now because you guessed it I'm here to talk about mobile CPUs again that means the ice lake architecture Gen eleven graphics and ten nanometer manufacturing process are almost sort of here I mean you'll be able to buy them starting November supposedly and honestly if you thought Intel's lineup was confusing before just wait till they see what they've cooked up now to set the stage let's do a little test here are four of Intel's newest processors and pause if you have to because I'd like you to write them down in order of the highest performance to be lowest and we'll discuss about them later in the video with that done I'm going to try to make some sense of Intel's lineup right after a quick message from our sponsor with long battery life an nvidia MX150 GPU and Intel Core i7 processor in a compact design the Razer Blade stealth 13 is a great companion for users on the go if you want more gaming her hook it up to the core X EGP you would support for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs the Razer Blade stealth plus the core X the ultimate power couple all right so let's get right into this with a quick explanation on how Intel and AMD usually launch their processors so little give you a rough idea on why we haven't seen Intel respond to Ryzen 3000 series yet so basically AMD launches their desktop processors first and noble processors last what that means is they're noble processors are a generation behind their desktop ports intel does things a lot differently unlike AMD intel's mobile processors are at least a generation ahead of what desktop users can remember the coffee lake CPU's on the desktop actually use an architecture that was launched almost two years ago so I guess that brings me to ice Lake and if you thought Intel's last gen lineup was confusing this one is absolutely ridiculous I can't believe this is happening again and it gets even worse I mean Intel what are you really trying to do to us I mean this this is what we're dealing with so this is Intel's version of an alphabet soup a mishmash of letters and numbers and yeah it's call me i7-1068g7 what what I'll try to explain so the i7 the i5 or the i3 it's supposed to tell you the general performance level after that well things take a turn for the worse so the ten part of this number means that it's Intel's 10th generation architecture but there are some exceptions and I'll mention that a bit later so the next two numbers tell you the relative performance versus other parts in Intel selenium for example as 68 will perform better than a 65 right but to add a bit more complication to this any CPU ending in five or eight will belong to the u series family while a name ending in zero puts it into an ultra-low voltage Y Series lineup finally any CPU with G in its name will have the new gen 11 graphics architecture the g7 has 64 execution units g4 has 48 and the g1 has 32 remember these new graphics cores are pretty important to Intel supposedly a gen 11 GPU with 64 use can't perform equally to an NVIDIA MX150 that's good news for Intel but bad news for NVIDIA we actually looked at that GPU in razor's blade stealth and concerning that notebooks form factor it was pretty impressive in fact if you're interested in a full performance analysis you can check it out right over here now imagine that kind of performance from an even thinner and lighter system well that's what Intel's after so let's dive into this confusing lineup starting with the u series which actually don't have the letter U anywhere in the name anyways the lineup includes six processors from i7 to i3 with the i7 and i5 having four cores and eight threads while the i3 has to course other than clock speeds the main difference between I7 and i5 CPU's is the amount of cache asked for the integrated graphics well that's all over the place and you can start seeing why this lamp is so damn confusing while the i7 has the full 64 execution unit layout the i5-1035 series can have either 64 48 or 32 he use the i3 only has about 32 years oh and did you notice that 1035 CPU yeah there are three of them guys all different graphics configs and clock speeds another thing you'll notice is how low the mark speeds are even though the TDP values haven't improved over the previous generation if we take that 28 1 I7 out of the picture the base frequencies barely stay above a gigahertz the single and all core turbo speeds are a bit better but in general they're between 300 and 900 megahertz slower than the previous generation so what does that mean it looks like Intel needs to rely on architectural improvements to carry isolate instead of clock speeds personally I think there will be a minor performance difference between 9th and tension CPUs in regular workloads but I might be wrong you never know you just never know and I'm gonna be really honest here I think Intel might be in a bit of trouble because it looks like 10 nanometer can hit the same frequencies as the older 40 nanometer process you see with AMD and their launch of the Ryzen 3000 series CPUs they were able to switch over to seven nanometer while maintaining or offering better frequencies now I'm sure that's on the desktop side but at least it's worth mentioning alright so back to the lineup with the Y series Intel's most efficient low-power notebook CPUs are popped into this lineup and there's some exciting stuff here but also some bad news it's great to see fork or a thread ultra-efficient CPUs but TDPS have climbed significantly from 5 to 7 watts on amber Lake y to 9 to 12 watts on ice Lake sure you're getting a lot of GPU horsepower but I'm interested in knowing if you guys see this as a benefit or sacrifice now about those base clocks well it's like we're back in the Athlon thunderbird days guys and here's a virtual cookie to anyone who gets that reference luckily the turbo and GPU clocks are per decent even when compared to the previous generation so remember that a little quiz I gave you at the beginning of this video well here's a list again and based on what you know let's put this in order from the fastest to the slowest so the i7-1065g7 is to first since it's part of the u series and has 4 cores and 8 threads next is the i-5-1035g7 not to be honest did anyone really guessed that well what about the other i7 remember what I said about the low power and low performance why series not having a 5 at the end of its name well here it is good people performance on this one will be less than the i5-1035g7 finally there's the i5-1030g7 which is also a fork or a third processor in the y series and it's also the lowest performing of the processors that I've shown here now Intel also mentioned that these new processors will have support for Wi-Fi 6 and terrible 3 but ultimately it is up to the manufacturers to add those features into their designs I mean it's nice to have them as marketing bullet points but that's about it so this is the problem that I see right now Intel's names are so damn long that they actually stopped using the letters U and Y those actually help folks understand the differences between the different series of processors and a number most people who are investing their hard-earned money into these notebooks aren't gonna watch this video and definitely aren't as tech savvy as you and me and the amount of confusion that this is gonna cause it's it's an absolute mess guys actually - what having gone through all of this right now I'm done I'm done",

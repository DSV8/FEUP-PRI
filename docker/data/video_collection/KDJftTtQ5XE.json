    "transcript": "Costco. A place you go to spend $500 on a box of 15 rotisserie chickens cuz they're like $2 cheaper per chicken. And I recently found out that people actually Buy electronics at a Costco now. I knew they had Electronics but apparently it's a common thing to do. So for today's video I bought a gaming laptop from Costco to see what you get for your money but first, today's video is sponsored by a better place to buy Electronics; Micro Center and the grand opening of their new Charlotte North Carolina location opening on May 10 and if you sign up using the link down below and go to the Grand Opening you can get a 328 gig flash drive. Microcenter is also hosting an apple Sales Event through all of April so save some money on your campus Cod piece today AND Microcenter is offering new customers $25 off CPUs using the link in the video description again links for all of these are down in the video description thank you Microcenter for sponsoring today's video [Music] now we're going to talk about pricing and what kind of selection Costco has later in the video but first let's meet the laptop I bought which was the cheapest gaming laptop they had available now our Costco acquired gaming laptop is by Acer o this is the second video in a row I'm picking on them so sorry about that this is quite nice packaging for a laptop we've got a whole bunch of raw cardboard going on here although there is plastic for no reason hiding under here and in that plastic is our 135 W power brick with its Mickey Mouse ears and the cable for set power brick and aside from the bunch of random warranty information we also get an unmarked envelope ooh very suspicious I'm kind of hoping this is a secret Cry for Help from an Acer employee wanting freedom from the tyranny of Costco or the other way around oh okay we get some stickers and more booklets why were the rest of them not in this Envelope as well or why were these not in an envelope either way it's weird so this is what a Costco gaming laptop looks like huh it's some Acer Nitro variant with digital skid marks on it now physically the laptop is really not very inspiring the build quality is extremely plasticky and it it it doesn't look great in terms of IO there's some of it on the right hand side with a bit of ventilation nice around the back there's just a bit of copper provocatively winking at me and the majority of the io is on the left side of the laptop proof that Acer hates left-handed people at least according to the internet but as a normal person I do prefer it this way around let's see if it passes our one hand open test yeah I was going to say it feels like it should and it does display hinge wise I feel like asus's lawyers need to have a chat with Acer because it has the same lift the body up display hinge as zephrus laptops and then here it it looks like laptop yeah the keyboard feels okay we've got a numpad which for tax accountants is very important the trackpad is all this display Hing is so similar to the zephrus it even dumps all of its heat over the display like it does on that laptop but generally build quality wise this is distinctly a budget laptop you've got not great plastic around the not very thin bezels around the display which does give you decent webcam placement but still the build quality is not inspiring at all which depending on the price can be completely acceptable but that's something we're going to talk about later oh I did forget I do want to look on the back of it which aside from a bunch more ventilation peeking through at all of the the cooling going on there which is nice uh this bottom panel does seem like it's going to be pretty easy to remove yeah let's quickly take it off and peek inside getting the back off was as easy as undoing 11 screws and grinning my teeth through some medium cracking now not great build quality and downward-facing speakers aside that is quite a sexy laptop interior there is a lot of heat sink going on here for the CPU and the GPU and then we've got these two fans the ram is fully upgradable there is an m.2 Drive in here and space for another one next to that everything that's replaceable is pretty easy to access it wasn't that bad getting the bottom off yeah generally for 2024 this is a really good laptop interior after turning on the laptop and weathering its initial shouting Windows how do I make the accessibility icon oh there we go things were looking very familiar oh there's our obligatory weird background this one looks like it was directed by Christopher Nolan for some reason and the whole syphilis situation was exactly what you'd expect from any Acer device ooh the Windows Experience is aggressively slow on this laptop I I guess it's still setting up but putting that aside specs wise the CPU is an Intel i53 420h it's nice to see the Intel number get more convoluted by the day as we saw in the tear down we've got two 8 gig sticks of ddr5 running at 5200 me a 500 gig SSD and the mighty RTX 2050 a laptop GPU I actually tested in quite a lot of detail recently and it's well not very fast to be honest you can check that video out I'll have it linked in the description below but let's see how it performs in this context okay now CS2 with low settings at 1080p is running well like this is a super super usable result uh this is a 120 her 1080p display so yeah this like we're getting way more frame rate than we than we need with this display and it feels very good it's nice and responsive it is quite noisy it comes and goes and waves it really does sound like a typhoon cuz it kind of whooshes up every now and then in in a way that's very reminiscent of a storm that's about to do billions in property damage hell whoh aside temperatures are very good for a gaming laptop although our 2050 isn't drawing much power so let's swap over to cyberpunk and see what the power modes do in terms of performance o at 1080p medium settings it isn't going great in terms of cyberpunk it also doesn't feel very good but we do have dlss so we we could definitely get some more frame rate but let's see what happens when we make the laptop a bit angrier we're current using the daily use profile which sets us to Auto fan speeds but let's see what happens when we turn the mode to Performance ooh the fans have gotten a lot angrier no aside from the apocalyptic noise performance-wise it's made no difference very good but with that let's see how this laptop performs in the most important game for it to run well it's the next day and I just got caught off guard Again by how super noisy this laptop is uh this is currently in the performance mode and it it's the fan profile is just wildly aggressive it does give us desktop level temperatures but you really have to pay for it like very dearly having said that it does give you the option to customize the fan profiles and with the fan set to 3,000 a bit RPM the noise was way better and the temperatures were still acceptable but yeah this gaming laptop runs fortnite as well as you'd want a gaming laptop to run fortnite at 1080P and with this High refresh rate display it feels pretty good having said that the display isn't great it measures like bot cheeks that's the only way I can describe it those are very bad measurements uh which means you can't use this for anything even remotely color sensitive although for gaming it looks fine you know it's okay side so now that we've had a look at our lower mid-range Acer laptop that gives you just medium dentry let's see how much it cost from Costco now when I initially did the research for this video there must have been like a sitewide gaming laptop sale on Amazon because every laptop I looked at which both retailers saw old it was at least $200 Canadian dollar cheaper on Amazon and that's why I was like well this is an interesting video clearly Costco is very expensive that wasn't the only problem I saw we'll talk about the others in a second but at the moment there seems to be price parody most of these gaming laptops that you can buy on Costco seem to cost about the same amount on other retailers so that's the MSRP of those laptops I'm guessing so for a quick example here is the laptop that I looked at which is the cheapest gaming laptop I could buy from Costco for ,000 Canadian dollars and as you can see one person did in fact get full-blown dentry from theirs but if you go on to Amazon's website that's what it costs there now too and then aside from Price another problem is selection not only isn't there really any budget options that ,000 laptop was the cheapest one they have the rest of them range between ,400 and $2,400 Canadian dollars but a lot of these laptops are also older models that aren't particularly desirable it doesn't look like Costco has a very High turnaround rate for their gaming laptops the same thing goes for their desktop gaming systems it's just a bunch of terrible pre-builts that I imagine exist in abundance in land centers and Purgatory basically the point is a lot of their selection you just shouldn't be buying which I guess is the case everywhere but it's the ratio of abomination that's unsettling here can you buy like a PS5 from here so it's $ 660 Canadian do for the slim bundle with Spider-Man and an extra controller which is actually a pretty good price you can get it for a a little bit cheaper from Best Buy but that's with just one controller so at the end of the day should you buy a gaming laptop from Costco well I personally wouldn't because their selection is mainly made up of older bot cheeks laptops that you can probably get for cheaper somewhere else uh so yeah with that thank you very much for watching if you enjoyed the video like And subscribe to the Channel watch another video suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video [Music] bye-bye [Music] a",

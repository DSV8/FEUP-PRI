    "transcript": "All right, so, next up, we have the 1989 Reebok Pumps. The Reebok Pumps featured inflatable chambers fitted within the shoe that enabled the wearer to create a sort of custom fit by inflating or deflating the shoe. At the heel was the energy return system, which is a series of cylinders that Reebok claimed acted as springs, releasing energy after the foot hits the ground. A lot of the claims were about enhanced performance. I don't know how many pumps it's gonna take, but I guess we should pump 'em up. Just literally pressing this ball. It's like an air pump. I'm afraid this is gonna explode if we keep pumping. All right, well, let's test our jumps. My baseline in my regular shoes maxed at 10'8\". I'm kinda hoping to see, like, an extra inch or two. Whoo! I did get 10'9\" that time. I did actually get 10'9\". Usually, my vertical is 9'3\". So with these, with the added height, with the added athletic ability, I'm hoping to hit 9'4\". - Let's see it. - At least. - Oh, 9'2\". - 9'2\". A little early takeoff there. - A little early takeoff. - So, they need to sell these along with jumping lessons from instructors.",

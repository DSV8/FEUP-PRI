Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter -  Follow me on Instagram -   Apple announced the new 2019 Mac Pro to much fanfare. Finally, a modular Mac that permits for user-upgradability thanks to socketed CPU and RAM, removable storage, and the ability to use off-the-shelf GPUs supported my macOS Catalina. But at $6,000, there are a lot of professionals that feel underserved by the base-model Mac Pro but find themselves needing more than what the iMac offers. There are also those who need the power of Mac Pro but want a less expensive version of the ProDisplay XDR. You know, one that doesn't have a $1,000 stand. The current options on the market just don't hold a candle to Apple's 5K/6K displays. In this video, we talk about the perfect computer for a lot of people that Apple should make: the Mac Pro mini.",

    "transcript": "I think the dust has finally settled on the celebratory fanfare that was the new Mac Pros announcement. Apple fans round the world clamored at this new, extremely high-end, extremely expensive, modular PC. And it brought a lot of features that Apple fans have been looking for. Upgradable storage, RAM, a socketed CPU, and oodles of PCIe slots for either one of Apples proprietary MDX GPUs or, if desired, the ability to use a standard off-the-shelf graphics card. I know PC users will scoff at the proprietary keying on the PCIe SSD, or the Apple T2 chip that limits upgradability and dual-booting into Linux, or the theoretically effective but practically questionable cooling design, but for us battered Mac users that have been dealing with MacBook Pro keyboard issues, a disappointing MacBook Air refresh and thermal throttling problems, this new Mac Pro finally feels like a fresh start. A new chapter. Apple seems to be demonstrating that they still care about the Macat least, in some form. But theres a problem. This new computer starts at $6,000 and with really underwhelming specs to boot. There are lot of people that consider themselves pros but either cant budget or justify the hardware selection Apple has made on the new Mac Pro. Lets talk about why Apples current lineup excludes a whole lot of people and what they could do to win us back. This video is sponsored by Dashlanekeep your passwords, identity, and online presence safe with Dashlane Premium. Give it a shot todayfree!with the link in the video description. If you want a headless Macwithout a screenyou have two options. The 2018 Mac mini (the cheapest Mac) or the 2019 Mac Pro (the most expensive Mac). Thats it. And while an odd number of Apple fans seem to think the new Mac mini is super great, I dont. First off, theres no upgradable or replaceable components save for the RAM which requires a pretty severe disassembly process to access. Theres no dedicated GPUand you cant blame the tiny footprint as the culprit because Intels Hades Canyon NUC is about the same size and packs a rather powerful AMD RX Vega M. The mini also has pretty severe thermal throttling issues as I demonstrated in my review and the $800 base models specs are comically bad. I built an Intel NUC hackintosh that not only performed 20-30% higher in benchmarks and real world tests with significantly better cooling, but it was less than half the size of the Mac mini and nearly half the price. So many people then say, oh, well if you need more power than Mac mini, just get one of the 2018 i9 iMac models or the 2017 iMac Pro. Indeed they have a beautiful display, but they too mostly lack end-user upgradability. The standard iMac can have its RAM upgraded but thats it. And on the iMac Pro, its not user upgradable. Now, I say that with a bit of a caveat as I have, in the past, upgraded both the CPU and the RAM on the 5K iMac and iMac Pro. The CPU is socketed as is the RAM BUT thats a massive undertaking and is hardly something I could recommend to any sane individual. Furthermore, the GPU (which more frequently requires an upgrade than the CPU) is BGA-soldered on all the iMac models. Not upgradable. Apple permits the usage of Thunderbolt 3 eGPUs, but Ive tested them and while they work, theyre expensive, noisy, and dont take 100% advantage of the cards capabilities. The Mac Pro and the iMac Pro share similar flaws when it comes to hardware selection. I, as well as other YouTube creators like LinusTechTips have demonstrated that when considering the gorgeous 5K display that comes on iMac models, Macs are actually pretty competitively priced for the hardware thats in them. What PC fans will point outand they often have a pointis that no sane individual will choose the same hardware that Apple does for their machines. They unnecessarily utilize enterprise grade Intel CPUs as opposed to high-end consumer ones which are substantially more expensive and offer little to no practical benefit with latest generation hardwareeven for the industries that allegedly require themthey use ECC memory in a world where standard DDR4 has superb error correction, their GPUs are over-engineered and under-perform cards that cost a fraction of the price, etc. So yeah, their computers are priced pretty well for the hardware that they use, but normal people wouldnt choose the hardware that Apple uses. Theyre often willing to spend 3x as much money for a single digit performance or reliability increase. On the Mac Pro, I think thats probably a fair call, but for people that are doing anything other than data science, extreme 3D rendering, or need enterprise certification for those who just want a modular Mac, it isnt. Then we have the ProDisplay XDR. This monitor is in a weird spot because you have color scientists basically saying the monitor is cool but wont likely replace reference monitors that are used in color grading houses which was the competition Apple compared it to. On the other side, you have people like developers or non-professional video/photo editors who feel like they need the power of Mac Pro but dont need a $6,000 monitor. Sure, theres the LG 5K UltraFine Apple sells, but the build quality is crap, its ugly, and reliability issues have been pretty widely reported. Apple straight up doesnt sell a monitor under five thousand dollars. You used to be able to use pre-2014 iMacs in Target Display Mode which allowed you to basically use the iMac as a monitor for another computer. It was great, but that functionality disappeared in 2014 when the 5K iMac was announced. I described why in an old videotake it away, sexy young Quinn! The current base-model 27 5K iMac starts at $1,800. Even for $1,800, you cant find a 5K monitor with similar color accuracy and max panel brightness. There are monitors around $1,100 that have better color accuracy, but theyre 4K, not 5K, and theyre significantly less dim without a glass panel. I propose Apple do the following: build a Mac Pro mini of sorts. Make it look the same as the Mac Pro, but with a much smaller form factor that provides easy access to the CPU, RAM, and SSDs with 1 or maybe 2 full-size double-width PCIe slots for GPUs and accessories. Dont use the Xeon line, dont use ECC memory. Using current-gen i7 or i9 CPUs intended for the high-end desktop market could act as a jack-of-all trades. While it will never happen, itd be cool to also see Apple offer a desktop with AMD Ryzen support since their price-to-performance is a current market champ. Allow this newfangled Mac to be sold without a GPUinternal graphics onlywith the option for users to utilize their own macOS supported GPU. And Apple, stop being a douche and let NVIDIA drivers work on your latest OS. I think a base-config like this could be offered at a rather high $1,999 and a lot of people would still opt for it. I certainly would. On the monitor front, take the exact 5K panel being used in the iMac Pro and put it in a similar enclosure to the ProDisplay XDR. Apple could price it at $1,499 and itd still be one of the best priced displays on the market. And who knows? Maybe they could even through in a free stand. Filling this vacancy in the market could allow Apple to have a line of computers that could cover nearly all use cases for every target consumerwhich would be the first time Apple would be able to make everyone happy in a really, really long time.

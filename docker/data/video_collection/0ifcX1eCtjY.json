    "transcript": "Guess what, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. It's the new 38-inch ultra wide 38 inches diagonal. It's like a giant TV on your desk, but with the proper resolution and Viewing angels and everything. It's an IPS display. This guy here now supports USB Type-C as well as bluetooth audio. Now the resolution is a little bit different than the Ultra-wides I've shown you in the past instead of being 1440 pixels high. It's now 1600 pixels high against 3840 in the other direction. Am I right about that? 3840? Yes I am. What does this mean for you? It means more work space. A bigger monitor Holy smokes! It barely fits in here. Let's get it out of the box so we can take a closer look. Now you know what, its gonna be crazy If I try to put 3 of these things... On my desk like I did, with the 34 inch version Here you go Jack.. Here you go. *laughter* Now, for the main attraction. WOOOW, That's big! Wooo That's a big boy. Wooooh That's a big.. That is a big monitor *peels plastic off* Upstream USB-C connector That's what's new. 2 female USB 1.5 Amp charge ports. There's a service port here, Headphone jack, DC in, 2 HDMIs and a display port in. So, lots of opportunity to interface Oooh slick *peels plastic* Goes in here.. Oh that's convenient. Little switch.. Lift up.. Out And then this guy here is thumbscrews Interface like this.. And you just screw that in and really that is like a 2 minute job Wooooow Hooohoooooh Aaaaand can come up Probably a 4 foot desk right here And this thing takes up the majority of it Now, We obviously need to get this thing booted up before it chops my head off. Oh sweet they've included cables.. Wow I didn't expect that So you have uuuh.. Display port cable, A USB-C cable, An HDMI cable, A USB-C to regular USB or.. Old school USB This thing.. Is insane.. In all the right ways Woooooh.. Hoohohoh Duh.....Duhhhhhhhh HOLY!! You don't really even have to say much about that when you see that happen Enough said.. Let the monitor do the talking You put this on your desk.. God knows what you're capable of! So what you are looking at up here is some drone footage in 4K spread across this magnificent monitor Helping you to appreciate.. The color representation.. The contrast and so on.. The viewing angles This is kind of a good array you got a very bright sky Wooohoo, Easy there Lew. *CCC: In another video he pilots a drone, so that's why he's talking like that.* With the USB-C that's now included transfer your video that way and then use it as a single cable to interface with all of your other stuff It's like a workstation for your laptop all in one place And just to spice it up a little bit before I take off I know you're looking at this you're salivating So LG has you covered They are gonna give away 15 of these to some of you And then one grand prize of a 10 thousand dollar workstation set-up All the details will be down at the description So look at that.. Some love for the audience",

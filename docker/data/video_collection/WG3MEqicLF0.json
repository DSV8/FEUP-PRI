Whether you like camping, hiking, Pokemon Hunting, or just getting ready for the Zombie Apocalypse... a solar powered charger is one of the necessities.  This USB charger can easily charge GoPro cameras, as well as cell phones, or anything else that can be plugged into a USB outlet.

    "transcript": "So last year when I was hiking around Havasupai and away from my charger for a couple days, I thought it would be really nice to have something that was solar powered so I could recharge my phone, my drone, and my camera batteries. Having a decent working solar panel would mean I wouldnt have to carry as many batteries or power banks on long trips. If you have a solar panel you can even take your Pokmon hunting expeditions way out into the boonies. So I decided to finally get a solar powered charger. So today well see how well it works or even if its worth our time to set up. Inside we have 4 panels that can receive power from the sun. And there are 4 little rings, two on each end so you can hang up the panels from trees or hammocks or tents and angle it towards the sun. On this side we have some instructions and on the inside it comes with one micro USB charging cable and it has 4 USB outlets. Two of them are 2.4 amp and 2 are regular one amp USB ports. It also comes with a little carrying sack and two carabineers. So now that we have it, lets take my Galaxy S7 Active with its 4,000 milliamp battery and charge it up outside using only the power of the sun. So I just plugged in my Galaxy S7 Active. Its a little bit damaged but this phone is freaking expensive so were going to use it for another video. Its going to take an hour and 3 minutes to charge, its at 45%. So Im going to switch it over to the solar charger and see how long that takes. So obviously solar panels work a lot better when theres a lot of sun in the sky, so today there are hardly any clouds so it will be the perfect day to test out our solar panel. So it might be a little hard to see but it says an hour and thirty two minutes until fully charged. So a half hour longer. Well see if thats what it actually takes. Its completely unfolded. Weve got the two hooks at the end just in case you want to hang it on a tree or a hammock or something like that. We have the four panels here. And then we have 4 USB ports and a little LED light to tell if theres power going to it or not. So I have it in one of the two smart ports, the 2.5 amp, and Im going to tuck the phone underneath so it doesnt get hot from the sun. There we go. So its been a half hour and we have 52 minutes until fully charged and the phone is at 71% so its moving along pretty quick. Thats impressive. So well leave it plugged in a little longer and see what happens. So its been plugged in for about an hour now. We have 28 minutes left until its fully charged. Its at 85%. We started at 45%. So its a little bit slower than plugging it into the wall, but still, this phones being charged by the sun. So now Im testing the charging of my OnePlus 3 and my Galaxy S7 and its charging them both at the same time. So this can charge multiple devices at once. So obviously plugging your stuff into the wall is going to be a little bit faster than using a solar powered charger, but sometimes you dont have wall power access. I imagine that the easiest thing to do would be to pair this with a power bank and just leave this at your camp site or wherever youre working and charge up the power bank all day. Just keep in mind that when you charge up your power bank and then use your power bank to charge up your phone after that, its not as efficient and you lose some power between each transition. So its much more efficient to plug your phone directly into the solar power charger so you dont lose any energy between the transitions. Either way Im pretty impressed with how fast this charged my phone. It went from 45% all the way up to 100% in about an hour and 20 minutes. I did start charging my phone at the peak brightness of the day though. I started at 1:15. So youd get less power in the morning and less power at night. But if youre using it in direct sunlight, right in the middle of the day, thats when youll get the most power from it. If you have any questions leave them down in the comments below. I will keep this video updated in the video description. Im going to be using this over time. Im headed to Thailand next week and I imagine Ill be using it quite a bit over there. So well see if it starts to fail or stops charging as fast as this first time. Thanks a ton for watching. Hope to see you around.",

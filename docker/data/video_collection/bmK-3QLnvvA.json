    "description": "Doing some research goes a long way for every situation. And this holds true for YouTube as well. In this video, I have shared one of my technique on how to do research for YouTube videos.   No need to use complicated YouTube Keyword Tool. This method is simple and takes only a few minutes.   For instance --   What's the demand and supply ratio? Are people searching for the topic you are going to make? Will get traffic for this video from YT or only from your subs? What is the age & demographic of your target audience?  [Resources]  Wallpaper -- Shark 3d    I use Audio from YouTube audio library.

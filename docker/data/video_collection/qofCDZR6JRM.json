    "transcript": "at this point i feel like amazon products with performance claims in the title is kind of like countries with democracy in their name you should probably take it with a grain of salt but before we have a look at that definitely a 4k gaming graphics card i bought off of amazon it's time for today's video sponsor have you ever wondered where i get all the awesome music for my videos well it all comes from epidemic sound songs like two this one's just awesome how about some sound effects epidemic sound offers a huge library of high quality royalty-free music and sound effects with the library that's growing by the week and you never have to worry about copyright claims sign up using the link in my video description to get a free month trial and even if you cancel after the free trial your content will stay copy strike free thank you epidemic sound for sponsoring today's video now looking at this very plain unmarked brown box which actually came via prime next day shipping but my thoughts have shifted from it just being a terribly marketed horrendously overpriced graphics card too it's a scam gts 450 isn't it but either way let's open up the box of shame and see what's going on in here that's a bad sign as well it comes with the super official looking driver disc that's a staple of all scam graphics cards even the instructions you know driver install instructions are legit when they tell you specifically not to download official drivers from nvidia's website although actually on first impression i think this may not be a scam graphics card because it's got some key differences to every scam graphics card i've ever seen in my life and not meaning to brag but i've been scammed a lot buying graphics cards uh now the first difference which may not mean a whole lot but the general build quality of the graphics card seems more in line with a normal graphics gun it doesn't have that distinct fished out of a shenzhen dumpster vibe to it that scam graphics cards usually have but again that doesn't necessarily mean much this could just be the rolex of scam graphics cards another thing is the rear i o on this graphics card because every single scam graphics card i've looked at up until this point has had a mesozoic period port on the back whereas this one has dvi displayport and hdmi which that's a rare io that kind of makes sense for the graphics card that this is supposed to be which is a gtx 960 which is by no means a 4k gaming graphics card but i i kind of i'm kind of hopeful that this may actually be a gtx 960. and even if it isn't it's possible this is a new species of scam graphics card which would be very exciting so with that let's throw this graphics card into a system and see what it does and then try and do some 4k gaming with it nice okay that's promising it's not doing that only displaying the image on the center of the display thing that scam graphics cards do and the nvidia drivers it told me not to download installed and identifies it as a gtx 960. so it seems to be a real graphics card so let's jump to the future take the graphics card apart and have a closer look at the real boy oh we've got some thermal pad touching the power delivery which is real fancy other than that it seems a bit like an evolution of the scam graphics card cooler in that it's kind of just like a block of aluminium that they then cut grooves out of to like increase cooling surface area and i don't know maybe it even comes out of the same factory now on the pcb we've got what looks like three power phases for the gpu and then i think this top one is a single phase for the memory that is a real basic power delivery but it should be okay for a gtx 960. wow it looks like somebody wrote a thesis on this gpu look at that even the memory modules have been vandalized and in here we have our gm 206 300 a1 die which again is just confirmation that this is in fact a gtx 960. now i thought we should have a quick look at the marketing material behind this real graphics card because it is hilariously unique now it starts off pretty tame with powerful function and how the 4k hdr technology gives the gaming graphics card a clearer brighter and large picture but then they start talking about it being lightweight and portable the graphics card is light in weight easy to install and convenient to carry when going out i'm pretty sure i've never seen a graphics card manufacturer brag about how easy their graphics card is to take with you to the club they then talk about the excellent material and how the graphics card is made of pcb material that's like saying this house is so well built out of house material but it is reassuring to see that they offer a hundred percent warranty anyway with that let's see if this 4k gaming graphics card can actually do some 4k gaming wow i don't think i've ever seen gta 5 look this clear and bright before and this is just a 1080p we haven't even gotten to 4k yet now at 1080p high settings we are getting over 70 frames per second with this gtx 960 which i don't think really gives us enough headroom for 4k gaming but we'll see in a little bit on a side note the cooler is clearly decent we've got about 60 degrees celsius on the gpu and that's with a drawing about 90 watts the frame pacing is remarkably good for gta 5. look at that it's all smooth and it's it's running very consistently actually so that's that's pretty good that's pretty nice uh which means i think we need to move over to a more demanding more modern game and see what battlefield 5 does let's do that wow the gtx 960 is actually holding up very nicely these days battlefield 5 running at 1080p medium settings is giving us a very stable above 60 frames per second result and i mean look at that frame time graph it's so smooth and stable that's very cool um also the game looks pretty nice like it it doesn't look that much worse than ah it doesn't look that much worse than running at high settings although with battlefield 5 the temperatures are quite a bit higher on this graphics card so that lightweight easy to carry construction is really being pushed to the limit here but yeah anyway generally the gtx 960 at 1080p gives reasonable results oh that is in battlefield 5. let's try an even more demanding game before we move over to the advertised use case for this 960. now when it comes to cyberpunk its ability to scale up to 4k is a bit less promising uh because here with 1080p low settings we're sitting roughly in the 30 frame per second range it's not running super well but it's usable you know you can see that it's a very stable 30ish frames per second which means it kind of feels like playing a game on the ps2 you know although it definitely doesn't feel like playing cyberpunk on a playstation because that is a very very very different experience to this but i think with that we finally need to try some 4k gaming on this system so let's do that now the fact that gta 5 will even let us apply the resolution is a promising start now like i did in the 8k gaming pc video i am going to leave gta 5 on high settings because i feel like it's quite reasonable to expect a 4k gaming capable graphics card in 2022 to be able to run like a six-year-old game on high settings at 4k so let's see how it goes let's see how it goes wow okay that is actually more playable than i was expecting it to be this gtx 960 may actually be a 4k capable gaming graphics card at this rate let's actually let's let's let's drop it down to low damn i clearly underestimated the little gtx 960. it may just be gta 5 with low settings but we are actually gaming in 4k to some reasonable capacity and it's not half-life 2 so that's pretty cool let's see what happens with battlefield 5. those are some good textures right there this may by no means be a usable multiplayer 4k experience but at low settings battlefield 5 again is running better than i was expecting especially compared to just the menu hell we got in 8k with the 8k mini gaming pc from that earlier video so yeah good job little gtx 960. but now let's try a real challenge cyberpunk okay well clearly cyberpunk at 4k low settings was just a step too far uh but again i'm impressed that we didn't need to stoop down to half-life 2 to get a playable result at 4k just considering what normally happens with these amazon products so not taking the price into account it wasn't quite the 16 car highway pileup i was expecting the gtx 960 can actually kind of play some games in 4k but what if i told you that the seller was selling this gtx 960 a graphics card that you can buy used for like 70 canadian dollars for 320 canadian dollars i don't care how portable that graphics card is that price is insane that's basically rx 6600 money which even that would be a stretch to describe as a 4k gaming graphics card but it does perform a hell of a lot better at 4k than the gtx 960. anyway with that it brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching if you enjoyed it consider watching another one a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video thank you for watching bye

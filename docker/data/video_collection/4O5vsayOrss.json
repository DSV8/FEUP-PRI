This video is not sponsored. 95% of the driving on this towing test was done on the freeway at about 75mph.   Watch Engineering Explained talk about the Cybertrucks High pressure zone:   Watch my full EV Humvee build here:   Its pretty crazy that the Silverado can be 'filled up' with about 25 dollars of electricity and go drive 450 miles. But how far can it drive with a full 11,000 pound trailer behind it? Today we find out!  How far can the Chevy Silverado EV tow 11,000lbs? - (New Champion)",

    "transcript": "Today we are gonna max out the electric Silverado work truck with 10,000lbs. Towing my EV Humvee on the back. Just to see how far it will go. This video is not sponsored. Chevy did loan me the truck, for this project and said something along the lines of, \"Go to town.\" So I am. That's not going anywhere. The Chevy has hands down the longest range of any electric truck on the market right now with this trim getting 451 miles of total range. Obviously, that's unloaded and we are going to max it out just for science. Our current high scores are with the Cybertruck with 90 miles. The Rivian with 100 miles, and the Ford Lightning with 130 miles. To be fair though, the Cybertruck and the Rivian did their test in the middle of winter, and temperature has a lot to do with EV range. They still work just fine in cold weather, but they are not at peak performance. And I imagine if the RIvian and the Cybertruck did their towing test in the summer when it's warm outside they each would have gotten 10 or 20 miles more of the range. But towing conditions aren't always optimal so it's good to see this test in a variety of seasons. Personally, I think the Chevy Silverado is going to blow everybody else out of the water. And my estimate is about 191 miles of range. Let me know in the comments what you think. Nate what's your number? Nate: I don't think it's gonna get a 190 miles. After seeing the Cybertruck only get 90. I can't imagine going that far with this much weight. Zack: Give us a number. Nate: 140. Zack: Let me know in the comments what your guess is and at the end of the video we will see who's closest. And we have all of the trailer hooks we have a full size spare tire underneath the truck. WHich is not something guaranteed with electric trucks. The Cybertruck does not come with one. The RST does not come with one. So it's nice to see it here on the work truck. The Chevy is built for towing. We have one of these pinchy trailer break gizmos on the side to slow down the trailer and not just the truck. Immediately getting into the truck we have already dropped to 277 miles of range. The Silverado is already compensating for the extra load behind us and will probably recalculate as we keep on driving. Zack: 10,000? Do you have the exact number, or no? Lady: Yes 10,000. Zack: RIght on the dot? Lady: Yes Zack: Im suprised. Okay it's official they said we weigh exactly 10,000lbs. Which I think is a little bit strange. But they said their scale is accurate within 20lb increments, and we are right on 10,000. So let's keep going. Adding the 1,000lbs of trailer tounge weight we have on the hitch gives us a total of 11,000 behind the Chevy SIlverado. Which is a tad higher than Chevys recommended, 10,000lb towing capacity. But I'm not about to tell my Humvee to go and lose weight. We always do 0 to 60 going on the on ramp going to the freeway just to see what kind of power the electric motors have. So, after these cars in 3, 2, 1. Little bit slower, little bit slower. We are at 30, 40, 50, 60. What is it? 15! Alright, so 3 seconds slower then all the other trucks. Every single truck the Cybertruck, Lightening, and Rivian all had a 0-60 in 12 seconds. 15 is not bad though with 10,000lbs on the back. That is pretty crazy. But I could feel that it was a tad slower off the line. But hey, maybe we don't need power we need efficiency. Let's see how far we can go. Nate: Let's see how many kilowatts we pulled? Zack: No I wasn't Nate: It was 400. Zack: Really? Nate: Yea. Zack: 400 Kilowatts. That is so much power. We've gone about 20 miles so far and the first thing that I've noticed is that, again with electric trucks you can't feel the trailer behind you, but this truck has far less motor noise than other electric trucks. If you remember in my Rivian video you can hear the motors whine. The Cybertruck, which is loud in general, but this one, like I'll floor it. You can't hear the motor kick on. I'm also not going to take it easy. I'm just going to drive normal with traffic on the freeway. We do have the AC on. We are driving 75 miles an hour. Which is probably what the trailer is weighed anyway so I'll probably stick around that or a tad slower. I do like how on the dashboard it tells me the exact number of kilowatts that we are outputting. When we are accelerating onto the freeway we got almost 400 kilowatts of power going out to the motors. I really like all the information in front of me at all times. And so far this is the only electric truck that gives it down to the number. As we're going down hill here you can see energy going back into the battery. So check that out. We have 120 kilowatts going back into the battery as we regen down this hill. One of the perks of towing with electric truck is that you aren't using your breaks as often to slow down your entire load. Obviously, there's trailer breaks and stuff. But with the trailer weight and the inertia of it as we are going down hill we are actually recharging the battery. Putting about 120 kilowatts of juice into the pack that we didn't have to pay for we are just using gravity and mass and inertia and those other big sciency words. Which gives us more range in the long run. It is pretty cool that they have the trailer break gain written out to the millionth decimal place just in case I need to be ultra precise. We are just about to cross 90 miles, which is where the Cybertruck was completely out of juice and we still have 103 miles left of range. The Chevy SIlverado is pretty darn impressive. The reason I think that the Cybertruck performed so poorly is three reasons. One, it was on off-road tires, which is a pretty big deal. Two, it was in the middle of winter. Also a big deal. Three is aerodynamics. Like the Cybertruck is super aerodynamic when it's by itself. But the shape of it. Air comes over the front and gets suctioned to the back where it abruptly hits the trailer that it's towing. Where as the Chevy Silverado is shaped like a regular truck and the air comes up and then gets release over the cab so it can disperse without directly impacting the trailer. Now I'm not the one who thought all this up. Engineering Explained, who's another Youtuber, made a fantastic video talking about towing efficiencies and aerodynamics. And I highly recommend watching that. It is fascinating. But yea, the Cybertruck compared to the Silverado is a terrible towing machine. Not exactly sure what we are going to hit yet. We still have another 6 miles to go before the Rivian's ending point. We are going to be towing forever with this thing. The Chevy Silverado tires are street tires, and much smaller, which makes them way more efficient, and better for towing which is what we are doing right now. We are at 100 miles right now it is 88 degrees outside. We are going 80 miles an hour with the AC on and we still have 88 miles left. There is a lot of information there. This is where the Rivian died right at 100 miles. Also, in the middle of winter though. But it's absolutely wild we still have 87 miles of range left. The Chevy Silverado EV is doing exceptionally well while towing. 130 miles with 24% battery left with 50 miles left. I think we have a new EV towing champion. We will have to get the final results as we pull into the charger. And again as we pull up to the charging station none of them are pull through chargers. So we do have to drop the trailer entirely and back into the stall because the charger port is near the rear driver tail light. Road trip charging would be the worst part of the whole towing deal. If you are local contractor who can charge up at the shop or home you can get a whole tank of electricity for $24 here in Utah. And while fast charging is more expensive, it is still cheaper than gas. But if you have a trailer it is a lot more work. We are at 6%, 14 miles left. And if we come over here to vehicle status, trip information. We went 163.4 miles. It is to bad we had to drop the trailer though, but people are interested in it. 163 plus 14 is 177 miles with a full above max capacity payload behind the trailer. That is so impressive. We have a new towing champion in the EV realm. Nice work, Chevy. We are plugged in and charging at 223 kilowatts and it looks like we will be at 80% capacity in 55 minutes. Thanks a ton for watching and I'll see you around.",

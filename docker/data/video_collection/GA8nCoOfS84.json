Get your MacBook Pro 16 skins here:    [APPLE MACBOOK PRO 16 REVIEW / MACBOOK PRO 2019 REVIEW]  With the exception of the time I upgraded from Windows 98 to Windows Millennium Edition (and then immediately back again) Ive never experienced tech whiplash like I have with Apples MacBooks.  Five years ago I made the MacBook Pro 2015 the foundation of my production pipeline; I logged thousands of hours on it, building hundreds of YouTube videos. It had all the ports I needed and it was rock-solid reliable. I didnt covet it like I do flashier laptops  but I valued it a lot more, because I knew I could rely on it every single day.  Then, Apple did something interesting: it took everything I loved about that 2015 MacBook Pro  and ruined it.  2016 was a dark year for the Apple MacBook Pro. The ports? Gone. The reliability? Lost- along with half my keystrokes on that notoriously fragile keyboard. From shot speakers to thermal throttling to backup failures, the 2016, 2017 and 2018 MacBooks Pro were varying flavors of compromise that I came to detest. It was only my love for Final Cut Pro, the software I use to make these videos, that prevented me from jumping entirely to Windows.  For the MacBook Pro 16 / MacBook Pro 2019, Apple didnt bring back my ports or take off the touchbar  but the changes it did make were enough. Im MrMobile and for the first time in four years  I feel like Im home. This is the Apple MacBook 16 Review.

    "transcript": "- With the exception of that one time I upgraded from Windows 98 to Windows millennium edition and then immediately back again, I haven't experienced tech whiplash quite as harshly as I have with Apple's MacBook Pro. Five years ago I made the MacBook Pro 2015 the foundation of my production pipeline. I logged thousands of hours on it building hundreds of YouTube videos. It had all the ports I needed and it was rock-solid reliable. I didn't covet it like I do flashier laptops but I valued it a lot more. Because every day I woke up for work I knew I could rely on it. Then Apple did something interesting. It took everything I loved about that 2015 model and ruined it. The ports gone, the reliability lost along with half my keystrokes on that notoriously fragile keyboard. From shot speakers to thermal throttling to backup failures the 2016, '17 and '18 models were varying flavors of compromise that I came to detest. It was only my love for Final Cut Pro the software I use to make these videos that prevented me from jumping entirely to Windows. Now Apple didn't give me back my ports or remove the touch bar for the 2019 MacBook Pro but the changes it did make were enough. I'm MrMobile and for the first time in four years I finally feel like I'm home. (upbeat music) Now if you're not subscribed to my youtube channel or Twitter feed, maybe you've missed my last few years of complaining about those old MacBooks PRO. Suffice it to say when I bought the new 16 inch model I felt obligated to give Apple a fair chance to redeem itself. So not only did I decide to wait until I'd used it for at least three months to review it, but I maxed it out. Every spec on this machine is as good as it gets. Which means the final price tag is nothing short of outrageous. But even here there's a silver lining. Apple doubled the storage options for 2019. Which means I got 8 terabytes of SSD for the same price that would have got me just 4 terabytes last year. And while 8 million million bytes might sound like overkill, it's actually evidence that Apple's getting back to serving professionals. You might have noticed that I tend to reference a lot of my older videos in my content. With this much storage I'm able to keep much of that old stock footage right on my machine in the original 4K resolution instead of carrying around extra hard drives or trying to download it over a slow public connection when I'm on the road which is like always. It's the first time in a long while I can say the MacBook just makes things easier. The same goes for this webcam. While I'd still like better optics the new microphone array makes it possible if I need to, to ditch the sound booth and record my podcast or whatever wherever I happen to be. Certainly it's not ideal but at least it's not the acoustic disaster that it would have been on a prior MacBook. Speaking of disasters that terrible keyboard has been totally redesigned on the 16 inch. I put my hands on this thing and that full millimeter of springy travel under these scissor switches instantly takes me back to the feel of my first MacBook Pro 2015. I can't put into words just how big a relief it is to just use my keyboard without the fear of double taps or missed keystrokes. Now after three years of hating life on the old broken keyboards, I'm reluctant to praise Apple for simply reverting to the old reliable design. So I'll put it this way instead I'm very grateful the company did. Sadly I can't say the same about the touch bar. While it's handy for when I need to break out the calculator or the screen recorder, it still mainly gets in my way. I accidentally brush against it a few times a week usually autocompleting the wrong word and even after four years it still occasionally hangs. If I'm gonna put up with weird bugs I'd at least like a proper second screen like Asus built into the Zen Book Pro duo. Or hey why not just make the main display a touch screen like most high-end Windows machines. As it did for the latest generation of iPhones Apple went bigger and heavier with the MacBook Pro 16 but you know I don't mind. In exchange for the added size, we get a larger display by a little over half a diagonal inch and more space for the speakers which are the best I've heard on a laptop. And in exchange for the added weight we get the biggest battery you can legally carry on a plane. A touch under a hundred watt hours. Now you're probably not gonna hit apple's promised 11 hours of usage unless all you're doing is watching video on a loop, but I found it can get me between five and seven hours even when i use it pretty heavily. I've never had much to complain about when it comes to the MacBook Pro's performance. You can check out the deeper dive from Rene Ritchie for some harder figures but from day to day responsiveness to 4k edits, what can I say this machine just flies all the time. Take everything I just said and combine it with Apple's ecosystem advantages. Easily sharing files with airdrop, easily drafting your iPad as a second screen and really the only thing I have to complain about is the cost and you don't need to max out your computer like I did. There are obviously options below $6,000. Well actually I do have one more complaint and it's that this kind of looks like every other macbook. But you can fix that with help from today's sponsor. dbrand makes quality vinyl skins at a fair price. They're easy to install and they offer lots of options beyond my slick marble one. Thanks to surprise visitor SuperSaf for modeling his stealthier brushed black option here. Hit the link in the description to get your own and thanks to dbrand for sponsoring this video. Maybe those conventional looks betray a deeper truth. Maybe you might say, \"It's not worth getting the new MacBook \"because isn't it just yesterday's keyboard \"slapped on to some updated specs?\" You know as much an oversimplification as that is, I can't really disagree with it. And I admit that the biggest reasons I enjoy this machine wouldn't even exist if Apple hadn't had three years of misfires. You can hear in my voice the frustration those caused the wasted time and money. Those bad feelings will linger for a while. Also Apple's cloud-based services still impede me far more often than they assist and for the sake of thoroughness the 2019 line isn't without issues. There was a widely reported random shutdown bug back in December and if you still need to use USB hubs like I do your experience will vary with the quality of the accessory. I still miss my SD card slot every day. But broadly speaking as someone who uses the MacBook as an everyday tool to get work done it's a wonderful feeling to have faith in that tool again. If you're a MacOS based mobile professional and you need to buy a new laptop in 2020 the pro is finally back in the MacBook. This video made possible by MacBook Pro retail unit purchased by MrMobile. As always I don't produce paid reviews the lone sponsor of this video is dbrand and Apple was given no copy approval or early peek at this review. That means they're seeing it for the first time right alongside you. Please subscribe if you'd like to see more reviews like this. Until next time thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends.

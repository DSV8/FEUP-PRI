    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here, back with another video. And today, I'm gonna show you something, that relates to the past video, so recently, I unboxed what I think might be the ultimate backup battery. The ultimate portable battery brick. Now, in that video, I had cables flying everywhere. Now, thank goodness they've included the cables that you need. But the cables, they were- So, I went, on a search, for what might be the ultimate cable to go with the ultimate battery backup, or anything else for that matter. And I found, This guy right here, look at this thing. ChaFon. \"Greeting you warmly with a wish that's sincere for a healthy, happy, and wonderful day.\" Well, I appreciate that. Now, I ran into this thing on Amazon, call me weird, but I'm a little bit of a cable junky, and this thing, is unlike anything I've ever seen before. You see all these nice little flat cables coming out, and you know what this means for me? This means: No tangle. I'm a tangle-free kinda guy. Regular USB, this will go into your power source, for charging, or syncing, if you wanna go into a laptop. Then, check this out: Micro-USB, second Micro-USB, Mini-USB, Lightning, USB-C What?! You have- this is normally in your bag, I mean, and this is only 3 of the cables, Never mind if I added a- a Mini-USB, there's no Lightning cable even there. Gimme a sec. These aren't even the right cables, but you get the idea. Like, who am I right now? What am I doing? What am I trying to prove? The ladies, they- this is not what they're looking for. A'ight? If, given the choice, you tell me. Huh? What're you gonna go for? Not this. I get excited about strange things, this is one of them. Let's say, you're using one of these badboys. If you saw the last video, the you know what this is, this is a backup battery, it's kind of a giant one, might be my favorite one right now. Look at that pretty little package right there. You might- you know, you might be on a road trip, and you brought your Nexus with you. So, oh, guess what? Charging. Different phone, same cable, here's an iPhone. Lightning. You heard the noise. A Galaxy S7, Micro-USB. Got that lightning bolt? That's a good sign. 'Course, this guy also supports- I mean, if you got some really old-school equipment- I was looking around for Mini-USB equipment, couldn't find a single thing. Now, let's say, I wanna bring everything with me. I wanna bring all my gadgets, because my gadgets are my friends. They've replaced the real life version. Humans. These are your new humans. You happen to have a big power brick lying around, like this guy, and this one is from a UE BOOM Bluetooth speaker, I believe, Now let's say we go into this guy, can we supply juice to all of them at once? 'Think Shakespeare said something similar. Gimme some micro love, gimme some more micro love, I know it's not a race, I'm turning it into one, gimme some lightning love, gimme some, USB-C love. Oh-oh, did we just do the impossible? Charging, charging, charging, charging, can you see all that? No matter which gadget you choose to bring with you, as long as it's relatively modern, This cable, is gonna do, what you wanna do. I think, I have found, the holy grail. CC by Alex Leonce",

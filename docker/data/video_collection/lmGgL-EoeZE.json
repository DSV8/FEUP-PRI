    "transcript": "well hello good people I'm Dimitri coming from Thermaltake beside me is the new let me just find the name Thermaltake aht600 ok you may be wondering what is a H stand for based on this design some may say attack helicopter yeah we had a laugh as well and as usual big thanks to our sponsors Razer fantex be quiet and Thermaltake for making CES 2020 possible but we've seen something like this from Cougar we've seen something like this from an tech we've seen some other companies do something similar so this is thermal takes approach to giving us an open frame concept that has lots of paneling and the case itself is the showpiece outside of building something that you are proud of it on the interior the whole front panel here looks very interesting in terms of giving us a cockpit vibe this is tempered glass this is not acrylic acrylic sucks tempered glass both in the front and the sides they swivel to open which is a nice little touch unfortunately it's not aluminum I was hoping for for it to be a little bit more premium but this is steel tempered glass and plastic pieces so like the side sections over here I'm guessing it would cost way too much for them to bend these properly all these pieces are plastic and only the main frame is steel we have two models over here white and black 249 for them the white model and $20 cheaper for the black one and the whole open concept is there so you can populate kind of beastie system on the interior up to a 480 radiator in the front up to 360 at the top and we also have a side radiator mount which is quite common for the thermal take you can have multiple radiator sections the power supply area is of course exposed but that's kind of been the nature of like these types of cases where everything is on display and it's up to you to make sure that you make it all look good and the one sort of distinct feature about this enclosure versus the competition is the non rotated motherboard tray whereas previous cases had the motherboard tray following in the design of the actual chassis whereas here the layout is actually pretty standard the PCI bracket can rotate so all your slots are now in vertical orientation and the one thing I find odd is the eye oh it's the very top so not very accessible there is no dust filtration anywhere that's kind the thing you have to face when one comes to open style cases but the i/o has a type C port which is great but also has at you use B to port for some reason which on a really high-end case makes no sense next case here would be the level 20 RS not exactly sure with RS stands for but it's based on the level 20 GT a lot of complaints there because the whole front section was completely closed off with TG it was a beautiful color design tone with that whole grey aesthetic now they're going with a black version the level 20 RS is a $149 case and of course they are Meza fiying everything both the front and the top panels have been replaced with the mesh side and they are still unsure whether to include the metal mesh and the lobe like almost dust filter on the inside that the really coarse type or to remove the coarse type completely and just stick to the metal mesh and as for the rest of the case it has been left untouched unfortunately the power splash out that the front is not caused off so you see all your power cables this is the little 20 RS more airflow for the level 20 GT based on feedback and the last case here Thermaltake is the view 51 they are taking multiple approaches and the same design philosophy from the view 71 in terms of the low spacing over here for airflow so so the hardware does suffer a little bit but they have added a little bit more ventilation pattern on the sides so you kind of go with it the whole visual aesthetic instead of performance aesthetic but the few interesting elements about the V 51 are that it's competing with the lian li o11 excel dynamic in terms of like having the dual chamber separation power supply the back a little hard drive cage above the power supply and this whole front section over here is dedicated for water cooling hardware I mean like you're going with air cooling in this case like you're doing it wrong full support for radiators at the bottom the motherboard traits like to extend it so we have that angular section where the cables exit we have a side extension over here for radiators the front the top and everything can be populated as usual the PCI slot bracket can be rotated as well for Co alignment and obviously it's all about the glass the side the top the front the back section is actually not TG it's just a simple panel with ventilation so if you do mount anything on the side of the radiator that is set to exhaust that of course will exit normally as for the price point 189 for the white one 79 for the black both 200 millimeter fans will be included for the front they are RGB which is great and one rear 120mm fans will be exhausted too so case airflow from out of the box will be present and obviously you go ahead and populate this massive case with your own hardware that's all and to finish off the cases let's talk about thermal takes new RGB software for lighting it's called neo maker and this is not something that I was expecting myself to cover but it's actually very interesting they're taking a whole new approach in terms of how you customize something like it so we have a timeline which means you can schedule different effects as the timeline for seats forward and you can have different channels and all that stuff they are trying to make it as intuitive as possible because the previous RGB software's from them has now been not been very user-friendly a few cool things about this solving obviously we have the timeline at the bottom so you can see when effects are being when are starting you can manipulate the actual fans and different products on screen and you can align them the way you would actually have them inside your enclosure as you click certain fans for example they do light up in red and that means that you can like find the the piece of software and that product inside your case without trying to do all the guesswork and gives me a little hope for the future of RGB software alright so that is it from thermo take new cases really excited to see what you guys think about this attack helicopter monstrosity over here not something that I personally do but you know companies are coming out with something that that is different so yeah I'm Dimitri thanks for watching talk to you guys in next video",

    "transcript": "- When you're feeling down, just apply a little bit of pressure like this and your character, whoa! (Mario Bros effect) - [Cameraman] What? Sorry. I crouched there cause I press the down button. - [Cameraman] What is that? That is not a thing. - TikTok didn't respect the fact that I would rather not talk about them, but the sheer amount of news today means that I have to tell you that the Facebook of Gen Z has released a desktop live streaming app called TikTok live studio. The app is pretty bare bones, but seems surprisingly robust for something the company says \"Is only available for a few thousand viewers to test.\" It's likely that TikTok will add more features as it ramps up its efforts to break into the gaming scene. The company also just launched its own Discord server where E-girls and Cottagecore aficionados alike can chill. - [Cameraman] You're both! - Shut up. That is not from their marketing. Is it? E-girls? - [Cameraman] Yeah, of course. - But in other, not-chill TikTok news, multiple school districts across the US canceled classes today in response to viral rumors that threats of violence had been made on the platform. It turns out these rumors were false, which is good, but it's kind of wild that some kid can just start a rumor on TikTok and get a free long weekend. - [Cameraman] Oh, great idea! - [Linus] And it's also wild that TikTok is also launching TikTok Kitchen, which will be 300 virtual restaurants that will deliver food to you based off of viral TikTok recipes. Okay. That's actually cool. I'll allow it. - [Cameraman] Oh, and they'll miss their peace! NVIDIA came out of nowhere today and surprise announced new laptop GPU's but they're... Kind of weird. First, team green is releasing a mobile version of the RTX 2050, that is not based on the touring chips in the original RTX 20 series, but on a newer and peer-based GPU the GA107, according to a manufacturer interviewed by German site computer-base, the card apparently has the same core configuration as the desktop RTX 3050, but a lower TBP for laptops. So... Why is it a 20 series? Is naming just a meme to NVIDIA now? - [Cameraman] Modern name. - The company also announced the G-Force MX570, which appears to be the first MX GPU that supports ray tracing and DLSS. And there's an MX550 as well, which doesn't support those things so well, it does have some value, especially in a chip storage. We don't really care about this one. I wouldn't say that's true, I disagree with the script. Neither of them are going to be powerful enough to do any retracing anything. So... - [Cameraman] But they will be worky! - And, while there are patches available for the incredibly widespread Log4J Java vulnerability, researchers have now determined that those patches have at least two vulnerabilities themselves! - [Cameraman] We're catching a patch! - Woo! A team at security from Praetorian detailed the flaws on Wednesday saying that they are actively being exploited and urged system administrators to install the new patch that fixes the first patch. This whole Log4J thing is really a snafu of the highest order. There's even a whole new family of ransomware identified by Microsoft that takes advantage the flaw. As before, there's not much that regular users can do to protect themselves other than trust the large corporations and governance institutions, that will definitely act on their behalf and update all their software so promptly, even if there's no profit incentive. (cameraman laughs) So yeah, it's game over, I guess. By the way, floatplane the LTD forum and LTT store are all patched using not the patch that was provided our own solution. And that's why they work. - [Cameraman] They do care. - Well, Luke cares. (cameraman laughs) And now it's time for caring about our sponsored bits. Quit, better quickly. - [Cameraman] Yeah. - [Linus] Brought to you by Build Redux, the PC gaming builder who's striving to bring PC gaming to the masses with no price markups on the components. You'll pay the same as you would if you just bought them for yourself with a flat $75 fee to have the PC built by a PC building expert that has never even seen sunlight, only computer components. They're like really good at it because it's all they know. It's their, it's their entire world. You just, you pick your budget, pick the games you want to run, see how they're gonna perform, and one of Redux's builders is in their, in their dark, little tunnel they run to the end of the tunnel. They get the components, they bring them back to put them together for you, just for you. And there's a two year warranty. So click the link below and start creating your PC today. Now, I would call this section the quick bets, if I was into NFTs. Long bets. - [Cameraman] Is long, isn't it? - This was a mistake. - [Cameraman] Yeah. - [Linus] Speaking of NFTs, the gaming community seems confused about whether they actually want them or not. Because, community Backlash led the developers of Stalker 2 to cancel their plans to incorporate NFT based metahuman NPCs in their game. But then, another game called Legacy made by industry legend, Peter Molyneux, I don't know, he's a legend, sold $54 million worth of a crypto token called Land when it was announced this week... Really? They raised more than Star Citizen. No, actually less than Star Citizen, not even close. So, wait, holly... They sold $54 million... No, I'm sorry. I need to stop. I can't do this. - [Cameraman] No! Linus, wait, come back. - Okay. I'm back. Make up your mind. Do we want a crypto NFT dystopia or not? 'Cause... - [Cameraman] That'd be cool! - I have to make plans. - [Cameraman] Yeah. - Gamers are so confusing. You know? You know, they're complaining about the cost of Halo Infinite skins, just don't buy them! - [Cameraman] Yeah... - Intel knows the PC gamers are hungering for their desktop gaming GPUs, which is why they probably, intentionally leaked this driver revealing the names and the lineup from the Intel Arc A350M, which is presumably a desktop model, up to the Arc A380. Are you happy Intel? We're talking about it! You really don't have to do this because we are going to buy them anyway, because we have no other options. Battlefield 2042 had a rough launch thanks to bugs and some unpopular changes, but it was apparently so rough that EA has already discounted the game by 30% on Steam and is holding a free weekend to hopefully attract more players, 'cause that's how you attract more people to your brand by kicking them in the teeth after they paid full price for your game. - [Cameraman] You're kidding if it have to end up in the teeth. - The player count is already the highest it's been in a week, so maybe this'll work and everyone will forget that bad stuff ever happened. I mean, if Cyberpunk can do it, anyone can. No one forgot about Cyberpunk being bad at launch. - [Cameraman] But now it's great! - In other gaming news, 343 industries promised that campaign co-op would come to Halo Infinite in a later update, but some players have already got in the feature working on the Xbox thanks to a glitch. It's not the smoothest experience, but hey, it's an experience. The question is, will 343 patch it out? Because they said they wouldn't patch out janky stuff. They did say that, didn't they? - [Cameraman] They said it! - That's Halo. - [Cameraman] Let them play with the arbiter. - And Hyundai has made another wacky robot. The MobED is essentially a motorized platform on four wheels that can be used to transport any number of things, like a television, or cold drinks for your friends, or even a baby. (cameraman laughs) Yes, that was seriously one of the demos, which seems like a great way to have your baby kidnapped and raised by machines, and then used as a weapon against you in the great robot wars. - [Cameraman] You know, it would be real cool, to be fair. Do not give the robot your baby! - [Cameraman] I'm thinking about it. - No! But do come back on Monday for more Tech News. That's when you do the ear cup thing. See? I didn't do his intro, so it doesn't make any sense. I'ma press down right now. - [Cameraman] Okay, see you later!",

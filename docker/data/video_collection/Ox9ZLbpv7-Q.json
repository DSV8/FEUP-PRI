    "transcript": "This here is a Viewer's Broken Xbox One and apparently i broke it while i was trying to clean it so i'm gonna give you a bit of backstory here this video that you're seeing on screen or was the console in question i actually cleaned this in las vegas during ces just to add some extra different content to the channel this is the first time that i ever cleaned or attempted to fix anything outside of the office and so i brought all of my cleaning gear with me with very few exceptions the tear down was pretty straightforward i don't remember running into really any snags apart from trying to get the upper part of the xbox one shell together and i think that's where the issue lies because the owner of this reached back out to me and told me that he didn't turn the xbox on for a while after he got it back he didn't play too much but then he tried to turn it on for the first time after receiving it back from me and it wouldn't power on at all he clicked the power button up front no response he also said he tried turning the console on by the controller still nothing and he also took a two game stop to see if maybe the power brick had died because the original one that came with the system was pretty old but they were unable to get it powered on their side as well so he was wondering if there's any way he could send it to me to have me look at it again so what i initially told him to do and i'm going to be very transparent about this whole this whole thing because i don't want anyone to be afraid of the worst case scenario which in this case is me supposedly breaking a console we're going to figure out what exactly is wrong with it because i did test this before i gave it back to the individual but you know i have no way of knowing what really happened between the time i gave it back to this person and the time that he or she turned it on so i am just going to take responsibility for it because i don't want this to turn into some huge ordeal what i've done since then is told this owner to send it to an independent repair shop in las vegas and after doing that apparently the repair shop told him that the main board needed to be replaced they said they couldn't get it to power on no matter what they did and the main board was totally fried they recommended just replacing the main board outright which they quoted at a little under 200 bucks it was like 180 dollars i mean that's just for context i'll show you on screen here this is what you can buy on xbox one for right now on ebay some of these are new but most of them are used you can see they're around 140 160 to maybe 180 us dollars so to be quoted just 180 bucks for the main board of course there's gonna be a bit of labor tacked into that as well just this makes sense to repair the board when you could just buy a new or gently used console for the same price so that's what i told the owner to do i said go ahead and just buy another console i said just try to keep it under 200 bucks it seems like that's pretty doable and i'll reimburse you for the cost of that console i will also pay for shipping so that you can send me the original console that i cleaned so that i can investigate figure out what exactly is wrong with this because i'm kind of curious i want to know what i did wrong so this doesn't happen in the future and i'm not trying to put us on a pedestal here if anything we should be held to an even higher standard because we are representatives of this industry and i don't want anyone to to think that i'm out to to hurt folks that that's the opposite of my goal so that's why i paid this person i didn't want him to to be without a console for several weeks that's why i told him just just buy another one and and that'll be the end of that we'll be good and then i can just figure out what's wrong with this so uh hopefully it's nothing serious i mean at the end of the day i've already i've already paid up for it but i i still want to know what i did wrong if in fact it was something i did which again i i i still find that kind of hard to believe because i tested this like hours before this person showed up at the hotel he was a bit late he there was apparently uh the president or the vice president was flying into vegas that weekend so traffic was super backed up and he was about 30 or 45 minutes late but anyway i i think i did everything correct because this isn't my first rodeo with xbox ones but i'm curious anyway i'll stop rambling now i promise you'll want to stick around stay with me the be quiet purebase 500dx is an excellent mid tower optimized for maximum hardware support and performance the three included 140mm purewings 2 fans along with a perforated front panel you'll experience some of the best airflow in the business and subtle rgb accents never hurt anything choose between black and white and soak in your build through clear tempered glass take it from me you won't be disappointed learn more about the purebase 500 dx from be quiet by clicking the link below so let's see what's in the box here i would be awfully surprised if it was anything other than an xbox one i just want to make sure that it was shipped okay and uh oh yeah it looks like it definitely was so not the original box so most people don't keep these older console boxes anyway i do appreciate the thoroughness of the packaging because it ensures that uh nothing else had happened to this during shipping and while i normally don't accept shipments obviously i made an exception for this because i don't live in vegas and this was the only console that we ended up cleaning over there and here is the unit it looks pretty clean still i expected it to be and it wasn't really used from what i uh what i understood and again it wouldn't turn on either so how can you use it so the first thing i want to do is power this on or attempt to and make sure that the symptom described by the owner is what we see here in person so let's see what we're working with again i don't expect it to power on at all but we do need to verify that uh we've got the cable plugged in oh nothing actually there's a cd looks like a game disc that is just barely in there it's not all the way in he probably tried to put something in with the console off oh yeah this thing is bricked it's it's not turning on at all so we'll need to open it up and uh figure out specifically what's wrong with it or we'll try to get as specific as we can i did check the ac adapter that he included with his console this is the original xbox ac adapter and it has the amber led on the side this is normal means this is probably okay i did check with my own though i have a third party adapter that i use for testing here in the office it also does not work with his console now my first thought when he first reached back out to us about the console not working was that something was wrong with the ribbon cable here for the front power button if that cable is disconnected or snagged because installing this top shell can be a bit of a pain because the ribbon cable attaches to this front piece which you then have to kind of like hinge into place after the fact it's easy to snag that cable and if you do this button won't work problem is if he's not getting it to turn on either with his controller it means it might not be the ribbon cable it might be something much more expensive there we go okay and what i really want to focus on is a state of this ribbon cable which i know you can't see yet but we'll get to it and uh yeah this is actually what i expected i'm not sure if this will fix the issue but you can see there that ribbon cable that connects to this small little board up front is not where it should be it should be inside this little tannish clip and it's not and actually we need to leave the front panel the way this is because the ribbon cable is attached to this all the way across and that's what makes this install so difficult here so it's likely that whenever i connected this again maybe the connection was just sound enough to work when i first turned it on after reassembling to make sure everything was good to go but then after that likely in transport this ribbon cable came out and that's why it won't power on then again it's also possible that the ribbon cable was perfectly fine when it was sent to either gamestop or the indy and it was just pulled out or not properly reconnected when they reassembled things again i can't speak for any of the stuff that's happened between the time i cleaned it in now and that's one of the issues that that i have with consoles is that you know i can't readily replace smaller components in here with pcs it's very simple if i make a mistake and i know i damage some hardware component i can very easily replace i can isolate it and fix the issue for the viewer so there's no down time with the console i mean even if this was my fault which it very well could be if this is to blame um you know there's just there's more to it than just swapping a quick part i'm glad it's probably just the ribbon cable but who knows that this video is 25 minutes long and you're watching and you're only 10 minutes in then obviously it's not the ribbon cable so here's what i'm going to do i'm going to reconnect this but i'm going to leave the top cover off it's not pertinent to the stability of the console long term and i'm going to see if just connecting this and then trying to power on up front here uh works so we'll connect the console to power obviously to do this and uh that'll just rule out this as a possibility in case we need to dive deeper into the unit it's just so easy for this to get snagged to get torn if it's not slotted all the way in it's uh yeah it's not fun to work with i think the design is certainly flawed it's not uh it's not diy friendly so to speak i'm gonna go ahead and detach this one more time here just so that i can show you how difficult it is to work with so the connectors on the cable look to be okay they aren't stripped i don't see any tears in the cable all the way along this front panel i think we're good here um i'm just going to reconnect it again but i wanted to show you what this looks like and that the traces are all there but with it all properly reassembled once more nothing we are not getting anything no power read from this console that uh that's that's not good at all so we're gonna need to dive a bit deeper i'm gonna remove the uh bluetooth wi-fi card here and attach the antenna take the cover off now that a few screws have been removed and we also have this connection we need to take care of on the board pull straight up all right what are we working with here again this looks super clean because when we deep cleaned it um it shouldn't look dirty hasn't really been used i'm just looking for obvious connection problems uh anything that we could have done wrong during reassembly the fan is connected we'll disconnect that for a second because we'll probably end up pulling off this cooler we'll take the optical drive out so detach cables on both sides i've got the uh the half lodge disc already removed so no worries there pull straight up on this this is slotted in correctly so this front board should be working go ahead and pull this out i'll pull the front i o board away just slots into a larger connector here just checking this board looks fine no issue with the connector itself on the other side pads look fine for the ribbon connector you know visual inspection checks out so at this point what i've done is pretty much stripped the main board down we do have the front panel reconnected along with the speaker just so we can hear something if something does happen to work here i'm going to bypass the ribbon cable all together i could have done this a bit earlier but now that we've got it at just a bare board i want to see if we can get the console to power on it's possible that the ribbon cable is still being pretty jank so i'm going to jump the final two pins here at the bottom the console's on that's what it is and uh disconnected power very quickly i just wanted to see if we could get the console to turn on and we did of course we don't have a cooler over the apu that's why i don't want to keep it on uh but that to me looks like just a ribbon cable problem at this point which should be a very quick fix uh because all this is is just it think of it like flattened wire it's very thin and it's flexible as a result but it's probably just the connector it looked okay maybe we can scrape through a few extra you know a few extra layers of plastic here try to get better contact with uh yeah with the connector so what does this mean well so far it looks like the main board is not the problem at all and this is literally nothing to do with the main board which would mean that the independent repair shop wherever this was taken in vegas i don't know the name of the store just know what the owner told me they were completely off base and it's very likely they just threw the main board replacement out there because they wanted to make a quick buck which is pretty that's that's pretty crappy pretty dishonest work so i wouldn't recommend you go there wherever that place is um i mean power on no problem bypass the ribbon cable the console does turn on the speaker wouldn't i mean the speaker wasn't working prior to this which means that the console wasn't turning on we were attempting to with it reassembled so the fact that we got that to work now means that it's probably probably just the thin ribbon cable so i'm going to show you that cable connector again and i'm going to scrape away a bit more plastic see if we can get a better connection with the with the actual connector on the front board and if that's the case then we don't need to buy a replacement front panel if we do i mean it's only going to be maybe like 5-10 bucks most of this is plastic we don't even need the full plastic we just need the ribbon cable itself which should be pennies so this side here is what we're working with and you can see the trace is underneath the plastic covers most of the wiring but what i'm going to do is this is the side that contacts the the pins in the connector i'm going to take a flathead screwdriver and try to scrape away the upper layer of plastic a bit further down the connector worst case this totally ruins it that's fine again this isn't very expensive to repair at least in the context of replacing an entire main board which was suggested earlier so we'll see what we can do here i also want to show you the inside of the connector itself this looks totally clean no issues no need to clean any of this up i in fact i would say that even on the back side of this if we look at the pads there aren't any issues nothing sticking out so i don't think the connector needs replacing so just very gently scraping away here don't want to chip through the wiring itself but these pads look a bit cleaner we'll take some ipa and finish the job and then we'll try reconnecting and seeing if the actual like capacitive button works you can see these two traces from the ribbon cable that run to the power button and that's what it looks like of course on the other side so we'll see if we can get it to work then and if it does then we can fully reassemble the console if it doesn't work then i think i'm just going to order a replacement ribbon cable because again it's not a lot of money and uh it's just not worth the hassle okay and wiring up again we've got power at the rear we're just gonna try clicking the button up front now see if we get a sound the speaker is wired up by the way i'll just let it sit up front here here we go no nothing nope oh it did work so now to test with a bit more fairness i've reconnected basically everything uh the only thing that's not connected is the the wi-fi card at the top uh we don't need that for the system to turn on i believe but i've got the hard disk drive reconnected sometimes when those aren't connected the console refuses to power up the optical drive same thing that's connected and of course the cooler so we can let this run for a bit longer i will track temps we'll also check for a picture on the screen that's wired up as well um crossing fingers let's see what we've got i'm hoping this works a few moments later and of course now it doesn't want to work we've got everything in there this is why you don't want to fully reassemble until you're absolutely sure just create some more work for yourself yeah we're getting nothing so i'm going to disconnect the ribbon cable and we're going to jump manually and that'll at least rule out any other issue with the console we can get it to post by bypassing the front panel so we're going to jump the bottom two pins here why would we get no power now is this plugged in okay let's take out the optical drive the system is on i'm not getting a picture out which is slightly concerning all i did was remove the optical drive and i did that actually with the console still connected to power so it powered on automatically hmm this is this is odd odd behavior whoa whoa we had it for a second there we had picture why aren't we getting picture consistently okay power on led up front is on looking for consistent picture here we have a source there it is it looks good i don't see any issues sounds fine storage drive is definitely working i'm not sure how much further we're going to get than this because our disk drive is disconnected we'll see but this is a huge plus because again i mean even if this front board wasn't the issue if it was this optical drive this still rolls out the main board which is the most expensive component as the issue so either way it doesn't seem like it was troubleshot very well all right and uh that looks good i think we're getting this picture here because i did power on without the cooler connected uh and it probably just saw that and triggered some warning message so that's good so we get picture the main board is fine the apu is fine memory seems fine just for some reason this is causing us problems and the connectors look good i don't see any snags in the cables or anything no shorts nothing at all it refuses to power up when the optical drive is connected so let's disconnect sata sata data let's just disconnect the data side of this and see if that's to blame if i can get it out of here okay try powering on nothing it's power fed to the disk drive is what i'm thinking so let's disconnect the power side of this so now we've just got sata data connected which shouldn't really do anything and it powers on without me even it just hates sending power for whatever reason to this are the is the cabling backwards surely it's pinned identically to both let me yeah let me check on that let's try flipping the cable around i'm gonna feel pretty stupid if that's the blame i don't think it is it looks like it's pinned identically on both sides it's wired up correctly i know for sure now that it is oh it works now that should be it please tell me that works yes that would be fantastic please do post she's looking for me see we get a source perfect perfect okay okay um i highly doubt it was the wire because these these cables were connected i mean they're keyed they only go in one way on each side i don't know i will say though i'm 100 willing to admit this this does look like user error it does look like whatever i did it just made it super finicky about wanting to turn on or off i mean i got a post but in the transfer maybe something came loose i i still don't know for certain about this ribbon cable if this was even to blame to begin with or if it had something to do with the optical drive and the the power cable for that but uh this looks to be this looks to be going so wow that that really that really took an odd turn i don't know consoles are weird i don't know just spitballing a bit i i don't know what was up the optical drive we just kind of played around with the the cables a bit and uh it all works now this definitely was an issue this wasn't slotted all the way in which would explain why the power button up front wasn't working for the viewer but again he also couldn't turn it on by a controller which as far as i'm aware that should still work without this connected because all this does is handle the physical power button it handles the eject button for the disk drive and it also handles the sync button for the controller here on the far left that's it and the console still apparently wouldn't turn on even with the controller so that might have been where the optical drive issue was coming into play if it was either wired backwards or not slotted incorrectly which i checked it looked good but who knows fact of the matter is we got it working now and we didn't need to replace the main board which that would have been oh my gosh could you imagine replacing a main board and that not being the issue that would have made the independent repair shop look a bit silly but before reassembling i did again want to try this uh we have an issue so i actually think the ribbon cable is fine i think it's the connector that is bad and here's why i think that i'm just gonna kind of finagle with the connector a bit i'm just putting a tiny bit of pressure on this that's all i'm doing that doesn't right i shouldn't be doing that so i think this needs to be reflowed a bit we'll clean up the pads and try to uh yeah try to fix this connector ultimately if we get this fixed i think the entire console will start working like normal again all right and after some very quick work with the soldering machine off camera i tried my best not to melt the connector itself which is made of a plastic composite you can see the eject button works now and the power button that's the one that's still kind of i don't know sometimes this one works sometimes it doesn't and it's it's a delayed as well if i hold it down let's just see i can't this one works and i'm assuming this one right here to the far left works as well there should be a small bump sound you hear from that when you're trying to sync up a controller but the power button is still it's the only one that's not working and that sucks but at least we can eject now and that was my only concern was trying to get a disc out of the console just by pushing the physical buttons a lot easier and to turn the console on i guess we can just do it through the uh through the controller which shouldn't be all that difficult i think what i'm going to do with this console now that um well i guess it's mine now i bought it from them or i bought them another one is i'm going to send the owner's original hard drive back to them along with the cd we just pulled out so i'll ship those two back and then i'll upgrade this console with an ssd so it'll load things a lot faster should be just snappier overall and if i ever get tired of that you can always just order a replacement oem front power and eject faceplate connector board for like 10 bucks it's literally nothing at all and i'll probably actually do this just so the console is fully up and running so if i ever sell it in the future you know there won't be any issues so now we're going to reassemble the unit we've got uh everything connected i was having a bit of trouble getting the controller to sync it would obviously sync when it was wired in but i couldn't get it to sync wirelessly and that might have to do with the front panel as well i'm not sure i didn't have the antenna connected and that might be to blame so i want to test with that if we can't get that to work then yeah we're definitely going to be replacing the board so let's slide this back in so we'll connect this front board here again and the speaker i suppose a good thing about the front panel being to blame and not the main board apart from the obvious price disparity is that this is fairly easy to replace i don't need to take the entire console apart just the front and top covers and then we can yank this straight out okay so everything works with the controller connected no issues at all the fan's still spinning now we're going to try the wireless sync so we'll disconnect the controller and there it goes now it works okay so it should be fairly straightforward now powering off the xbox turning it back on we'll turn the console off and then we'll see if we can get power back on just by holding down the xbox button on the controller so we can effectively bypass this uh yeah defective area here so console's off now and there we go i'm happy with that i don't think there's a need to go any further with it i mean 10 bucks yeah it's not a big deal but save me some time and hassle it's back up and running and we didn't need a main board replacement that is the biggest win ever so uh this was really something i i really i was really hoping that it wasn't going to be as bad as it was made to seem in the emails and this is not the viewer's fault the viewers just the the owner of the system just passing along this info that he was told by the independent repair shop uh it's i think it's safe to say gamestop really didn't look too much into it that's not really their forte as far as i'm aware they might have folks on site that can work on these but generally they're just there to buy sell trade etc you could have maybe taken it to geek squad i'm not sure geeksville would have helped but he possibly could have taken it there and they probably would have charged you 150 bucks just to look at it um the independent repair shop it's i i don't even know if they took it apart to be honest with you the way that things were torqued down i mean it seemed pretty solid although that's a pretty standard thing i i can't really judge too much there it looked pretty much in the same state that i left it in and they clearly didn't do enough due diligence especially with the front panel connector which again folks who work on xbox ones they know that ribbon cable is freaking annoying the whole connector's annoying and you know i wish they would just use little contact pins that of course they had to complicate it and and that was the first place i looked because i knew just based on forms my own experience that that cable was annoying and if you're not getting any you know picture you're not getting any power by clicking the power button it's probably the ribbon cable that's bad heck we still again have that problem i'm not entirely sure what was wrong with the optical drive side of things i that that one's a bit of a a bit of a mystery still i i look this isn't my first radio i've done this many times that connector is keyed only one way there's only one way to connect it on both sides so unless the pin out is different on both sides of that which would be super weird because it's the exact same connector unless that's the case that shouldn't have been a problem i don't know why we were getting that weird symptom where if we disconnected the power side of that cable you know the console would work just fine i think the biggest issue was the front panel and the fact that that was totally overlooked by the repair shop in question that is super super concerning but uh yeah i'm glad it works again so we can you know we can use it ourselves i did all right buy the the other guy a console so this one i'm probably gonna keep and uh we'll figure out what he wants to do with the storage drive in here uh if he wants it back i'll ship it to him uh if he doesn't at least until i find the time to upgrade the ssd i'll just wipe the drive and start fresh with my own account i do have an account because i've used xboxes in the past when i was in college i didn't have a gaming pc i gamed with an xbox 360 and then an xbox

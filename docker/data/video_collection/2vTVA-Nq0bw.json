    "transcript": "Here's a Windows laptop which is very nice but you know what's a lot nicer the ability to reboot this laptop into Kali Linux so I've installed both Windows and Kali Linux into this laptop and I can dual boot between them so I can boot into Kali or I could boot into Windows so once again what I've done here is taken a Windows 11 laptop an installed Kali Linux on the laptop and then I have the ability to either boot into Kali or boot into Windows. In this video I'm going to show you how to do that I've got another laptop here and I'll show you the full process same principle applies if you're using a Windows 10 laptop as an example very easy installation. Okay but without further ado let me show you how to dual boot between Windows 11 and Kali Linux. Okay so here's my Windows 11 laptop that we're going to set up for dual booting we need two pieces of software we obviously need to download Kali Linux so on the kali.org website I'm going to click on download I'm going to go to the installer images and I'm going to download the 64-bit installer I've actually already downloaded did that in preparation for this video you can see it's about 3.8 gig in size but I'll click save just to show you the full process next thing we need to download is Rufus you may prefer using other software but we basically need something to write the iso image to a USB drive so I'll plug this into my computer and what I'll do on the Rufus website is download Rufus 4.2 for Windows 64-bit you could use the portable version but I'm simply going to use that version of software I'll double click on the exe say yes to run it what it's done is pick up my USB drive I've actually previously installed Kali on this drive so that's why it's showing up with Kali I then need to select my ISO image so I'm going to select the image that I previously downloaded what I'll do actually is stop the current download because I've already got it downloaded. Very simple you download the ISO image for Kali you download Rufus or some other software and then what you do is you select your USB drive and you select the image. We're told that we could either use an ISO image or DD image I'm going to use ISO and then we warned that everything will be overwritten on the USB drive I'm okay with that so I'm going to press OK and write the image to the drive you can see the drive is being formatted and then the image is being written. Okay so while that's been done what I'm going to do in Windows is right click on the Windows icon and then go to Disk Management so here's my disk manager at the moment I don't have any free space on my hard drive because the Windows partition is taking up all the free space what I'm going to do however is right click on my Windows NTFS partition and I'm going to click shrink volume now you don't need that much space to run Kali and Linux in general but what I'll do here is specify about 60 gig that gives us plenty of space you could obviously allocate much more space or perhaps as little as 25 gig more is generally better I am only going to specify 60 gig here so I'm going to shrink the Windows partition this is the amount remaining for Windows and that's more than enough I'm going to click shrink so there you go 58 gig in size now you could obviously give a lot more space to Kali especially if you're not doing a lot on Windows but just for this demo I've got about 178 gig for Windows and 58 for Kali I'll just show you this if you want to allocate more here you could shrink this volume again so what I could do as an example is allocate another 10 gig and click shrink and there you go 68 gig of space is now available we just need to wait now for the writing to the USB drive to complete and then I can show you what you need to do to go into the BIOS of the computer now there are two ways to do that you could power this down using shift and I'll show you that method in a moment otherwise you just need to reboot the computer and then press the right control key this depends on your laptop so this is an Asus laptop I could just do a search for Asus BIOS key and we're told you to enter the BIOS configuration on an Asus laptop press and hold F2 while the computer isn't powered on and then press on the power button that depends on your laptop for instance with this Dell laptop different key is used f8 if I remember correctly so you just need to find out which key to use for your specific laptop or you can do the following which I'm going to show you in a moment either method works. Okay so the writing to the USB drive has completed I'll click close I'll close this and then what you can do is press the shift button down click on power and click restart okay so notice what happens we can go to troubleshooting Advanced options and then we can go to UEFI firmware settings or if you're old like me the BIOS and click restart. Okay so there's a few things that you need to do here first thing we need to do is go to security so this really does depend on your specific brand of laptop and laptop but I'm going to select secure Boot and you're going to want to disable secure boot make sure that you have that disabled now as always with these videos you do this kind of thing at your own risk for this to work you're going to want to disable secure boot so that's something that you're just going to have to decide to take the risk on but that isn't really a concern of mine so I have disabled secure boot next thing we want to do is we want to specify the order of boot so I want to set the computer to boot off the USB drive first so I'm going to set that up make sure that you disable your secure boot set your boot order to USB and then I'm going to say save and exit and I'm going to say yes so hopefully what should happen now is the laptop should reboot and then boot off the USB drive okay so there you go we can decide how to install Kali Linux either using graphical installation or just a standard installation for this example I'll just go with the standard installation so no graphical install graphically is nice in some ways but I'll just use the standard installation okay what language you're going to use I'm going to use English which country are you in in my example it's the United Kingdom so I'll specify that which English you're going to use British English okay so we need to connect to the internet to download files so in my example I've got to this laptop connected via a USB to the Internet so using ethernet you could connect to a Wi-Fi network if you like but I'm going to just specify ethernet I'll press enter it's getting IP addresses from DHCP next thing you need to do is specify the host name so in my case I'll specify Kali domain name I'm going to specify as none now again this is not best practice I'm just showing you a demo I'm going to specify username of Kali password is going to be Kali just like you get when you download the pre-built VM again not an example of good passwords but just to show you the demo so I've put in my username I've put in my password I've verified the password and now it's going to start the partitioner now to keep it simple I'm just going to use guided and I'm going to use the largest continuous free space enter I'm going to install all files in a single partition so keep it simple and I'm going to say finish partitioning and write changes to disk if you're happy with the changes that are listed say yes it's now installing the base operating system okay we now need to select the software to install so you can just go with the defaults I'm going to show you from I've had and a way to solve that but I'm going to simply go with the defaults and press continue notice this issue so I've had that on a few of these installations so I'm going to select and install the software again and what I'm going to do to get this to install is uncheck top 10 and uncheck default I found that I had problems it might be something with this image or something else that's causing problems but if I unselect those two options and then go continue the installation passes and then I can just install all the software later once this is installed successfully. Okay there you go installation is complete so it's time to boot into your new system make sure that you remove the installation media so that you boot into the new system rather than restarting the installation choose continue to reboot so what I'll do now is remove the USB drive and then press enter to continue you can see the system is rebooting now and there you go now we have the option to boot into Kali or into Windows it automatically boots into Kali and I can log in so my username Kali password Kali and I've successfully booted into Kali Linux on this laptop now before I update the computer I just want to show you that it works properly so I can restart the Kali Linux installation and if I press down arrow now I can select Windows and as you can see there it's starting to boot into Windows and there you go we've got a Windows installation so I can log into Windows so there's Windows 11 and once again I can simply restart Windows and I'll be able to boot into Kali Linux so in other words boot from one operating system to another I've now got dual booting working on this laptop I'll press enter to go into Kali I'll show you a few more things in Kali just to get your installation up to date you don't have to do this you may want to get things updated so I'll boot into Kali again and what I'll do is start a terminal so I'll type sudo apt update to update my references I'll put in my password now one of the things you may want to do is upgrade your Kali Linux installation always mentioned you may want to install the default packages so what you could do is simply paste that in here and that will allow you to install the various tools that are missing again that's not required depends what you want to install I had issues during my installation process whereas it didn't want to pass the installation when I selected the default tools and top 10 tools so this allows you to install those you probably also want to upgrade your Kali Linux installation so you may want to do that first before installing the default packages I'm not going to bore you showing you all those options now this is simply going to install the software what you can see is I have got various software tools installed this will allow me to have more tools than what I've got here and it's probably something that most people want to do. Okay so there you go I've shown you how to get Kali Linux running as a dual boot with Windows 11. It's not that difficult to process just be aware of secure boot you're going to want to turn that off very important to do that in the BIOS make sure that you've got enough disk space to install Kali make sure that you've got a USB drive you can download the image and then install it from the USB drive.

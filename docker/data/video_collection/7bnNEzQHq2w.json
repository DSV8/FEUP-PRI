    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is. AMD has announced their new architecture RDNA 3 and it's got some goodies attached to it. So Matt attended the AMD Beyond Gaming Evolution Next Gen Super Cool graphics event. - Story time. I do a thing that's reflex, when I sneeze I pinch my nose. - Incredibly unhealthy, do not do this. - Yeah. I go to sneeze, I do the thing. Someone behind me goes, \"Sir, that's not good for you.\" I turn around, It's Lisa Sue. - You've been officially uninvited from every AMD event from all time. Lisa Sue officially does not like you. - The beautiful thing is she has no idea who I am. - She's like who's this weirdo who's not sneezing in front of me? Get outta the way. - Why do all the CEOs hate me? - And there are a couple of major takeaways. It is the fact that AMD have their brand new generation of graphics cards which I think have one major feature that is going to be very important to the future of gamers. We're all tired of compromising, right? - No, we don't compromise over here. - Well, not with AMD we don't 'cause we've got the power of... - Display Port 2.1. - 2.1. - No longer are we living in the past, the stone ages of display port 1.4B. Boo! - No, we have the much more aptly named 2.1. - Yay! - Which has an astonishing 8K. (laughter) - What Matt's trying to say is that these new AMD graphics cards have display port 2.1, which enables a ton of new features. Now one of the big dramatic things about the RTX 4,000 series, specifically with the 4090, is that it doesn't have upgraded HDMI and display port. You've almost got a GPU, which is being bottlenecked by the kind of displays you can connect. And while these displays don't exist yet, AMD actually co-announced with Samsung and a bunch of other companies. AK Ultra wides, crazy high resolution, and specifically high frame rate monitors that are gonna be coming. You simply cannot drive at full speed if you're using an RTX 4080 or 4090. Whereas these AMD graphics cards will let you push 900 frames per second to your monitor. I went to the event, the graphics cards that they came out with, the Radeon 7900 XT, XTX. - XTX. I gotta get used to - And XT. - saying the XTX. - Yes, and they specifically said it's the extra X because they want this one to be shown as like the newer-- - No, it's just cause X gonna give it to ya. (dog barking) - They're not gonna blow you away performance wise. And they specifically said we're not trying to compete with the 4090. - Importantly, they're not arguing with the 4090 when it comes to price. - Price. Right, so just as a recap, if you're not a PC aficionado. Nvidia really upset a lot of people with their latest high end flagship, the RTX 4090. First of all, 1600 United States freedom units. - Whoa! - That's about three 1993 Ford Focuses worth of money. And like a Ford Focus, it will catch on fire if you don't have the correct power supply and cables. These graphics cards are first of all much less expensive. It's nine hundred and a thousand dollars respectively. They're going to use just regular eight pen power leads from your power supply which you shouldn't really need an upgrade for. - And that's what I think they did completely right. Like I said, they're not gonna blow you away power wise. These are powerful cards-- - They're more powerful than the 6900 XT. - Sure, but it's not like, it's not gonna compete with the 4090. But I feel like this is a way better option for most people because again, you don't have to change out your power supply. You don't have to get a riser for your GPU just to make sure it's not sagging and breaking your PCI slot like a 4090. And the inclusion of 2.1, display port 2.1, really future proofs a lot of this. - So hit me with the specs. So you can do 8K at 165 fps, which is stupid 'cause no one should game at 8k, but whatever you can do it. But what are the more practical resolutions in monitors? - That's the thing, none of them are practical, because they're all ridiculously high numbers. - Okay, go for it. - 4K at 480 hertz. One of the things that they talked about at the event was trying to break into the eSports market. And how many eSports players play at 1080 or even sub 1080 just to maximize their frame rates? - And they'll be pushing 3, 4, 500 FPS in some games. - So here's where it comes in for eSports players. - 1440p, at 900 fps. - [Austin] Great resolution. - You mean 900p? - No. You can see into the future with 900 frames per second. - Okay wait, hang on, so 1440p at 900, this is a theoretical maximum of what you could push with display port 2.1. But they did give some actual examples of some eSports titles that you can play at hundreds of frames per second, right? I think the gist of it seems, if you're just talking about these graphics cards, right? If you're thinking about buying a new PC, props to AMD for bringing out a graphics card which on some aspects looks kind of boring, right? It's the same size and power and all these kind of things as the, you know, last generation. But because of what Nvidia has done, this now seems like a bold decision to not go to the new power sort of connector. Not to be seven feet long and three feet tall. And also to not cost three kidneys and a pinky toe. - There's one we didn't talk though. - It only uses 355 watts. I wanna remind some people who are in the market for a 4090. At running what it was a maximum of like 600 watts when it's fully... - [Austin] It's in the 500s I believe. - Still that's more than a lot of people's PCs. And that's not insignificant when you look at your power bill. You're essentially renting to use your gaming PC at that point. - I will say, Matt, if you're spending $1,600 on a graphics card you're probably not worrying much about your power bill. - I'm talking about all the people who dream, all you dreamers out there. You say I want to get a, I want get a 4090. Put that dream to bed my friend, alright? - That's not where I thought you were going with that. - No. - open your eyes sheeple, the real world exists don't-- - You can get a really good GPU for a whole lot less. - You can, you can. - That won't cost you an extra $20 a month in electricity to run. - Look, though, it just seems like Nvidia have kind of missed with the 40 series, right? Like AMD I think are doing what AMD do best, which are trying to be the spoilers. They're trying to be the underdogs. They're trying to, you know, find whatever the weakness in Nvidia's sort of marketing or their product is, and attack it, right? So I don't think we should be thrilled about a thousand and a $900 graphics card, but in context with what you've got with Nvidia, that is better. These cards are going to be more reasonable to install in your pc. You're not gonna need a crazy power supply and a bunch of other things. This is not gonna match up to an Nvidia card when it comes to ray tracing performance. But also how often are you really using ray tracing? Like it's nice to have when these have it, but realistically this is not really meant as a hardcore ray tracing card. 'Cause if you're really leaning into the ray tracing side of things on the limited games that can really properly take advantage of it. Realistically, I bet you could probably get away with like a 4070 or something and it will outperform this. But if you care about gaming for gaming's sake then these AMD cards look impressive. Especially because, as of recording this video, the performance metrics that AMD has shared, and you always have to take these with a little bit of a grain of salt, are limiting. It's like, oh, it's 1.5 to 1.7 times better than the previous generation. - Some of the things that impressed me the most about these cards was not the just the raw hardware. It was more some of the software side of things that they were doing. So FSR, there is a new version of that. They also have AV1 encoding. - [Austin] Which is great. - [Matt] Which is a massive thing. You know, a lot of streamers were drawn towards Nvidia cards for NVENC and now AMD is actually partnered with OBS to do integration with that. - Traditionally, like you kind of said, streamers have been leaning towards Nvidia cards 'cause they've had shadow play and just straight up better video quality when you're actually recording and streaming and whatnot. But it seems like AMD have sort of rectified that and tried to build in better hardware and better software to make these things better. Which makes sense, right? You look at what AMD have done over the last few years and they're constantly, generally a little bit behind Nvidia when it comes to like raw performance, but they're significantly cheaper, the features are getting closer and closer, and better and better all the time. We're gonna see stuff at CES. Make sure to subscribe to the channel and ringiling the dingiling button because when we hit CES, when we're cruising the show floor, if we're there and they have stuff, boy oh boy we're gonna go straight to the 900 hertz monitors. - Oh yeah. - When you have gaming PCs that are capable of pushing out higher refresh rates and high resolutions than the monitors that you can buy are capable of. That's a good place to be, right? Like that to me feels like, oh, okay, we're ready for the next leap because again, right now the games that we are playing are still tied to last generation console hardware. So that's why you see things like, you know, Modern Warfare 2 and whatnot, which are running on PS4, which are running on Xbox One, and because of that, they can't really take advantage of all the horsepower of a gaming PC or even something like the PS5. So the only thing you could do is really run these games at higher refresh rates and higher settings. Now mind you, two-three years from now, when all games are built to a sort of higher standard, we're gonna start to see these PCs really start to struggle and really try to handle these sort of next gen titles. But as of right now, the main way to differentiate your gaming PC from your last PC is not so much running it at higher settings, but generally speaking, it's running it at higher refresh rates and higher sort of resolutions to get more detail and to get smoother images. And the fact that Nvidia have kind of missed by not offering some of these things such as display port 2.1, and AMD have included it at a much cheaper price, I think bodes really well, like this is a strong option for them. - I mean yeah, they're future proofing it. Like, you know, you go and get this you're future proofing yourself for a long time that you have the next generation of display port today. Obviously there's nothing that really can run this whatever. - But I mean, stuff is being announced here very shortly and if they're gonna bring out an 8K monitor I bet we're gonna see 4, 5, 600 hertz sort of-- - Yeah. We're already starting to, Yeah. We already are getting into, you know, pretty big refresh rates at 1440p. Now you have something that's actually capable of pushing this hardware wise. It's like I said, I like a lot, I really like these GPUs. I don't know if we should necessarily be celebrating a thousand dollar GPU 'cause that's still really high. - So if you are a gamer today and you don't wanna have to compromise, you want to get the absolute maximum of performance. We were dealing with graphics cards that were massively inflated, right? There was a chip shortage, everyone was concerned about it. In the span of less than a year, now we've got a chip oversupply. We've got companies who are cutting costs. Based on how the chip supply actually goes, we could actually see these brand new graphics cards come down in price relatively quickly. - I would say for the a hundred bucks, just go for for the XTX. Like, you know, when you're talking about $1,000. - Especially $900, yeah it's not a big-- - Yeah, like it's not a massive difference and it is a fairly big difference as far as what you get out of VRAM and stuff like that. But whatever. But I mean, you know what's gonna be great too is-- - Chiplets! - Chiplets! So I have specs on that. We have a 5 nanometer graphics compute die - Which is the core chip. - And a six nanometer memory cash die. - Which essentially means that AMD are able to get a larger physical chip without actually having to build it all as one monolithic die. They've already been doing this for a while in CPUs. It's clearly a thing now on graphics cards. I think this is gonna be something we see more and more commonly going forward. - We're in the cusp of a really good place for gamers. You know, we're having tough competition from AMD which is gonna force Nvidia to do their thing. And now we're gonna have Intel coming in soon and having all these extra choices is only gonna be good for you. - Especially if the chip shortage continues to disappear and micro centers supplies are overfilling with graphics cards. You better believe those sales are coming your way. - Like subscribe, follow, let us know what you think about AMD's new graphics cards and we'll catch you in the next one. (relaxing music)",

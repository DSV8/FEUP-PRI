    "transcript": "- Big trend, big trend in gaming mice, and Xtrfy, who sponsored this video, is all-in on it. This is the Xtrfy M42, and apparently it's multiple Xtrfy M42s. These mice weight just 59 grams and come in at anywhere from 59 to $69, depending on the color. Personally... Whoa. I am liking this retro one. You got this retro gray, but with RGB lighting. All right. Feel like I'm playing mahjong. Just got my tiles and I'm just moving 'em around. All right. There we go. Oh, that's kinda fun. They include a couple of little, cute keycaps that you can put on your keyboard. Cherry MX-style with the cross stem. Nothing special in terms of quality, but at least they do have a pass-through so light will come through them. So this is interesting. This is one of the big changes since their previous-generation mouse. The M42 is a symmetrical mouse and it actually includes a second rump, so you can swap it out depending on what's more comfortable for you to palm, or actually, I guess it depends whether you palm at all, because some people, particularly with these symmetrical, ambidextrous mice, prefer to use them with more of a claw grip. Another thing they've changed is, apparently, there's been a big focus on durability. So in spite of the light size, it's supposed to still have strong plastics. That's something you can run into, when you go and punch a bunch of holes in your product, is it might not be strong enough. But that and the cable are apparently designed for optimum strength. So let's have a look here at what we think in terms of feel of the plastics. Actually, you know what? Like... (fist thuds) There's not a lot of flex there. That's pretty good, especially considering how light it is. Although we should, of course, (clears throat) validate their claims with our trusty dbrand-ed scale here. So supposedly this is gonna say 59 grams. Let's see if they win the prize. That's 63 grams. I mean, the good news is that when I lift the cable up it does reach 59 grams. I mean, I could just cut the cable off it and then we could find out for sure. I don't wanna ruin a perfectly good mouse though. (fist thumping) Here, why don't we whip open one of the other colors and we'll have a look at the swappable rump plate. Which one next? - [Andy] The retro one. - The retro one? Heck yeah. All right, that's the one I wanted. All right, here comes the retro one. That looks so bad that it's good. I kinda love it. This would go perfectly with that retro-inspired build that Intel sent a couple of years back. So... Here, can we actually plug this one in so that we can have a look at the RGB lighting? Apparently you can adjust the RGB on-device and you don't require any software for it, so why don't we play around with that and see exactly how that works? There is somethin' kind of unnerving about the juxtaposition of modern RGB aesthetics and old-school red and beige and tan plastics. What do you think, Andy? I think the RGB might actually harm the aesthetic. - [Andy] That's, like, additional five horsepower. - Thanks for that. Of course, you don't need to go full-RGB. You can just, you know, have it be a single color. So you can have breathing. Wave. There's another RGB LED on the bottom that shows you which CPI you're running at. You can also adjust it from 125 to 500 to 1,000 hertz. Okay, I gotta grab the blue one now. - [Jono] That's a really small knife. - Hey, look. It's not about the size of the knife, okay? It's how you use it. Oh, that's cool, I didn't actually notice they've got their logo on the inside. And the retro one, this is cool, has their retro-ized logo. Okay, these really do not seem that different to me. I think this is the default one, and then the one that comes in the box seems to be a little bit wider and flatter. Yeah, there you go. So it's not quite as perky. Is that really gonna change it that substantially in terms of feel? I have my doubts. Okay. This is default. I'm mousing. (upbeat music) (buttons clicking) Oh. It does change it a lot, actually. So it goes from comfortably hugging the inside of my palm here to... I kinda feel like my hand is floating over the mouse. Like, if I was more of a claw grip-type character, I would definitely prefer this one. Well, that's kinda cool. Apparently they provide the 3D files, so if you wanted to 3D print your own design for it and see if you can get it contoured exactly right for your own hand, that is something that you could do. That's pretty cool. Whoa, that's very different. Okay, so do I have a gaming PC here that I can actually play some games on? - [Jono] Yes you do! - Sweet. Sorry, Xtrfy, the white one and the black one are just not that interesting. - [Andy] Put the pink one on the blue one. - [Linus] Ooh! Okay, we're going candy store. Ha. - Heck yes. - How sick is that? It's sick, dog. Oh my god. Default highest DPI is ridiculous. I mean, who could possibly game like this? Oh, he 360 no-scopes with no effort whatsoever. Ah! Oh my gosh! I can't even point at anything. To be clear, guys, I'm not blaming the mouse for my performance here. I have it set to maximum sensitivity so you can see it. Like, as I'm walking around, there's these tiny, jittery movements. That's not the sensor. There's a PixArt 3389 sensor. It's fine. It's just that if my hand shakes even a little bit it moves me all over the place. Oh, wow. Those guys really lunge at ya there. You know, I gotta say, I think my preference for this mouse would be to not use the palm-style back. I'm gonna switch over to the other one and see if I like that better, 'cause for me, I prefer my palm mice be non-ambidextrous. Like, more sculpted to the hand that they're intended to be used with. So let's switch to candy store here, which is also at a more reasonable sensitivity setting. Yeah, that's better. And quite comfortable for more of a claw-type of grip. Oops. Oops, I'm almost dead. Don't die, Linus! Don't die! Click feels really good. It's using Omron switches, which, basically, if you're trying to make a good-feeling mouse, is probably what you should be using. And does this one look cool or what? I'm not saying to buy two. I'm just saying that if you got a blue one and a pink one, your mouse could look like this. Obviously we're gonna have it linked in the video description. Thanks for watching the video, and thanks to Xtrfy for sponsoring today's video. Whoops. And what's left? Yeah, subscribe to ShortCircuit. Why haven't you done so already?",

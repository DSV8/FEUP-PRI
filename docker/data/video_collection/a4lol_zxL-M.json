    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And this is Ro. I am so excited because obviously you guys here on my channel know that I do a lot of tech stuff and Ro does a lot of food stuff on her channel. - Yeah. - And when we combine knowledges - You get a lot. - So today I brought some really fun tech and it's no surprise that, you know, like Ro, you are a little more petite than I - Yes - and most people So for you, like finding like smaller gadgets and things like that to, to work for you is it's difficult sometimes. - And you can't tell how short I am right now because I'm sitting down and I have a big butt. What does that do? (laughing) So like, we look more even in height, but if we stand up, let's show everybody how short I am. - Okay I'm off the camera - I mean, this is, like (laughing) - I mean, you're so cute and just so little like I just need to like pick you up and put you in my backpack. - I'm a Polly Pocket. - You are. Obviously I love tech, so today I brought over three pieces of tech and I'm gonna call this a tiny tech series. So we have three things. You probably didn't even notice that they were sitting right in front of me. - Oh my gosh they're so small. - This is like the Mac book air air air air air because it's so freaking small. And this is the iPad air air air air. And this is the iPhone mini mini mini mini mini. - That's five minis, five airs. - I freaking know. So first I guess we'll maybe check out the Mac book air air air air air. - Okay. - And as you can tell, this is a genuine Apple product. This is made by Apple. There's the logo. And I was really hoping that it would light up like some of the previous gen Mac books 'cause it used to be a thing. It was cool, you would open it up. It would, it would light up. But this one doesn't I hope, I hope it's charged. I'm not sure, I did charge it before. - Whoa, that's a cool screen. - Look at the screen. And it does this really cool feature where it'll like bend all the way back. This is kind of a new thing that a lot of like two-in-one tablets are doing where, you know, normally your laptop will just stop right here. - [Ro] Right, right, right. - Freaking goes all the way, yeah. - And now there. - Yeah, it's great. - Oh my gosh. - The specs range mean, gosh, there's so many various configurations, which you can get this laptop in, but this one, I think we have maybe the 16 gigs of Ram. I can't actually quite- - I can't read the bottom bar. Is that the, is that called a task bar? - That's the dock. I can't even see it to be honest with you. - Okay I don't know much about tech stuff, so I can't see the dock very well. - [Justine] Here, I'm going to just put in my password. - Is there a setting to make it a little bigger? - Yeah, let me go into the screen size here. Let me use the track pad. So the track pad, the one thing that kind of upsets me about this is it's not centered. Like look how old the track pad is not centered. - It's off centered. - This aesthetic is all off. - No, no, no, no no. - Let's see if I can make the screen size bigger. - [Ro] I do like the keyboard. I just don't like that the dock is so small. I'm having a hard time reading the icons. I wish it was a little bit bigger, but I do like small screens. - Yeah. - I have small hands, so usually I like little stuff. That's just like really little. - Yeah, it's very small. Do you want to give it a type? See how you feel. - Okay. - See, see if you can maybe make the screen a little bigger. The problem is the aspect ratio on this screen size, like this is it, like the reason that you would be getting this is because it is pocket-sized, it's something that you would take with you anywhere. - I mean it's so small, though. Like you can fit it in a really small pocket. - [Justine] Yeah. - I feel like you could make something a little bigger and still fit in a pocket 'cause this is very teeny. I mean, I'm small and this is like- When I learned how to type in elementary school. We a little typing like class. They told us not to use just your index fingers. But with this situation, I feel like you have to, because otherwise I can't. And actually having my nails done a little pointy helps really pinpoint the buttons. - [Justine] Yeah, I don't have any nails, so it's been kind of a struggle for me, but it is also a touch screen, which is nice. So you can also click, you know, the icons down below to be able to access all the various apps. - [Ro] What are these three buttons here? - Oh, let me see. - What do they do? - Let's see here, okay. - This for like a quick thing for volume? - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So a lot of times, you know, laptops can kind of have like the touch bar. So Apple for a while did have that digital touch bar, but they did get rid of that. So they actually did add in these physical buttons. So you'll be able to access things like- - Okay. - your email, very important. And these are the speakers right there. The speakers on this thing are amazing. - They're so little. - Yeah, so let's so you're going to be surprised how loud this is, though. So let me, let me pull up a song here. - Okay, pull up a song. - Okay. - [Ro] I mean, there's so teeny. - [Justine] I know. I hope- - Like teeny and powerful, I guess. - Okay. Let me find a song. (music plays) - Oh! - Can you, I don't even - This is too loud. - Can you hear me? - This is too loud. - This is so loud. Oh my gosh. - We don't need it that loud. - I haven't been to the club in like seven years. I feel like I'm ready to go and party. - I feel like I'm there right now. - Yeah, we gotta turn this down. I feel like I have, I'm getting a migraine that, that was intense. - They really, the technology these days is getting so good. - It's really kind of fascinating because that is, I mean, it was such a crystal clear sound like even the bass. Like, there was no distortion at all. - Things are getting so much bigger, bigger, bigger, but now we're kind of moving more smaller again. - Yeah, so that's the Mac Book air air air air air. To go with this, like - Okay. - We also have, like I said, we've got our iPad air air air air air and our iPhone mini mini mini mini mini. - Mini mini mini mini mini. - And what's great about both of these is I love like a color scheme. So they have them the nice, I think they're calling it the glacier white, maybe an iceberg white. - [Ro] I like that they match. - [Justine] Yeah, me too. - It's like this screen is about the same size as your Apple watch kinda. It kinda is giving me those vibes. It's even maybe a little smaller. - [Justine] It's a hair smaller. Do you want an Apple watch? No, I'm now wearing my iPad air air air air air on my wrist. - Air air air air air. We could just put a nice little, you know, thing on that, like bracelet on that. - [Justine] And it's a super fit. - [Ro] And do it from there. - [Justine] You're right, and look at this. I can even wear the iPhone mini mini mini mini mini as a ring like, hello, oh my. - Can you imagine? You're just like, hi, what's up. - You could flip it around like this. - Oh, that'd be nice, that'd be nice. Oh, you put it in your ear. - I could just put it in my ear. - Put it in your ear! - Look at this, this is - [Ro] Let me see. Yes, yes - Hold on, I need to take a call. Hello? Like AirPods are no more. This is the future; you just put your whole phone inside of your head. - In your ear. - I love it. Oh my goodness, okay. - Sign me up. - Well, they should be out hopefully very soon. And the one thing that I do like is they kind of relocated the apple logo up here - Okay. - to the top, and that's because that is now touch ID. It's a whole fingerprint ID. So you'll be able to unlock your phone, just using your fingerprint on the back. I know, right? - What that's so cool. - [Justine] This is basically the size of your finger. - I mean, this is a bit small even for me, but I think if I mess with it long enough, I could get to, you know, get familiar. - This also shoots 8K, which is surprising. I know, but you know, I think the ability to be able to capture this type of content on something so small is honestly, it's, it's really surprising. - It's kind of a heavy for a little thing. - You know, it's how they're packing all the tech in there. - I mean, this is heavier than you'd think, you guys, this is pretty heavy for a little thing. - [Justine] The calendar is a huge one. I don't even know if I can see the date on there. - Aw, where's the date? - Wait, here, let me click on it. Okay, oh shoot that's- - [Ro] That's that's the wrong one. - [Justine] Let me close it out. Okay, there we go there. - [Ro] There, there. - So, if I actually had to see what I had to do today. I can't, I can't really see it. - Okay, wait a minute. If I got something this close, I can't see it, but if it's here I can see it. - Like I've been rewatching all of the Marvel movies- - Yeah. - Like in order from start to finish, like how they were supposed to be. And I feel like there's somewhere in the Marvel timeline for us and our tiny tech. - You could glue it on a nail. If you got a big nail, you could literally glue it on your nail and no one would know. - Oh no! - Oh no! - [Justine] Is it okay? - [Ro] I don't see a cracked screen, it's pretty durable. - [Justine] Yeah, mm hmm, durability test. - Yep. - Check. Let's check let's check out the iPad. Look how good that looks. - I always love their backgrounds. Like I love when they do these, like, like, I don't know if it's like the raindrop background or, I love these. They just feel so calming. - [Justine] And I love what they did with the mini mini mini series and the air air air air air. They kind of did a nod to like the original iPhone. So this is like the original iPhone background and they kind of went back to the similar icon designs. So, you can tell it's very similar to that. - I'm feeling like very nostalgic with this. And also the only thing that's difficult, my only criticism is that these, the grouped, you know when you get your grouped apps, it's so small, I don't know what's there. - [Justine] So you guys might be able to see what she's talking about. Like the grouped apps, so when they're in that folder - I cannot even see what's in there. I mean, I have to guess. - [Justine] Well, at this point you're able to use Siri mini mini mini mini, and she will actually answer so we can have her open stuff for us. Hey, Siri, mini mini mini mini mini. open up my notepad. She opens the notepad. - Oh. - It's like, basically you'd be like talking to it. - [Ro] This is great for you. Siri doesn't understand me. She never has and I don't know if she ever will. - [Justine] Well, I'll get you a review unit of this because, honestly, it is game changing. Let's take one last little picture here. - Okay, let's do it, okay okay. Maybe we should do a quick little video. Let's let's, hold on a second. - Okay. - Hold on a second. I can't. - Well, you're going to have to re- do you need a I got a toothpick. - Is it recording? Okay. Hi. - Hi. - Okay, so this is recording on the mini mini mini mini mini Five minis - Mini video! - Yay. Okay, wow, this looks actually pretty good. I mean, I can't actually see it so I don't really know what it looks like. - I'm looking in this general direction where I think the camera is. Yes, I think those were, I think those were it. I think that was the vibe. - I'm so excited about this. Thank you so much for checking out this new tech. I love checking out, you know, new tech and baking with you, but man, getting a chance to check out this revolutionary new stuff that's not even out yet is like super awesome. - This is awesome. This is blowing my mind, Justine. I learned so much from you. Like sometimes when I get a new phone, I just have to like call you about it. - Yeah, well, when next time you call me, I'm going to be like, Ro, my phone is in my ear! Like, this is just, I just can't even. Well guys, thank you for watching. I would love to hear from you guys, like, what do you think of this tech? Is this something that you would use? How do you think this would kind of fit into your lifestyle? I would love to hear it in the comments below. Ro, Thank you so much for joining and hanging out.

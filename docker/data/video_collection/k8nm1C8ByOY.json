    "transcript": "What's up you guys. Lew here back with another video. Today I've got something unusual, I guess. Its a case. It's an Iphone 6s case. But it has something I haven't seen before. It actually adds notifications through the form of a light or lighting to your iphone on the outside of the case It's a notification case this company Lunecase have been in touch with me a number of times There like \"Lew, make a video our stuff is cool\" We're gonna start with this icon right here nice simple packaging I do appreciate that and on the inside \"I AM DIFFERENT\" You can see when you've got a phone call coming in a message How does it do it's so thin and slim and that's the whole thing right there Okay on the inside of the case \"reset\" \"on/off\" Bluetooth icon so obviously it's going to use bluetooth connect and then what does it get power from the phone or what insert phone and find out Do I use like a little pin to turn that on you think? You think I go in there with like a pencil tip is that a botton? You know what would work really well a sim card tool Yes yay we got it woah Connecting simple little stuff yes I'd like to pair. Ohh that was kinda cool *phone rings* see that guys? I'm picturing in your bedside table if you're sleeping with somebody else Jack doesn't know anything about that part but if you are and you don't want that person to wake up and theoretically you can have your phone completely on silent and still see a text come in As a case its pretty straight forward you've got cutouts for all the important things its got like a soft touch plastic vibe to it it's pretty good The next one this case the cult look at that thing you get like this that's for people with a little bit more attitude The eyes of the skull flash three times for calls or two times for messages turn this guy on oh man those eyes are flashing red already pitch black ooo on the skull version you're not going to know immediately if it's a message or a call not a huge fan of that like its essentially two blinks or three blinks kind of hard to distinguish they are fairly dim so I really think this becomes more interesting in a dark environment As I said bedside table don't want to disturb the other person and all of a sudden now even in silent mode you're going to see if you're getting a text or an incoming call and that's kind of the concept here If you guys want to check out pricing and availability on these I'll drop a link in the description There you have it external notifications on your iphone",

    "transcript": "- In this video sponsored by ASUS, we're gonna be checking out and unboxing gaming, on the ROG Swift PG329. This thing takes a lot of boxes. It's 32 inches, 1440p, HDR600. It's got G-Sync. It runs at 175hz. Well, that's it, there's nothing else. But come on, do you really need more than that? No, I lied. So it's got an IPS technology display and quantum dots. So what I expect from this and I will accept nothing less is, absolutely zero compromises. Got some feet on here that are strong enough to kill a man. (banging metal) Look at that. You know how some viewers get upset about me abusing the hardware. Think of it this way. If I didn't abuse it, how would you know that it can stand up to abuse? Crazy how efficient monitors are getting. I mean, it used to be at a 32-inch monitor, you had this like, ginormous power brick. Mind you, this is a 150 Watt power brick, holy shakes. What are we gonna find in this box? Stickers, manual, cables. Dang, check out these nuts. You know, Ben, I remember going to the like university campus, computer store and seeing for the first time in my life, the original Apple 30 inch cinema display. You remember that thing David? - [David] Oh yeah. - And being like, \"wow, \"if only someday I could afford a display that beautiful.\" And now, the craziest thing about this thing, is not only is it a high, like 160% SRGB. So it's a wide gamut, high resolution, 2560 by 1440. So that's a very similar density to that old Apple cinema display. Not only that, it only costs like 700 US dollars. And yes, 700 US dollars, a lot of money. That's a lot of money. But to put it in perspective, back around that time, I bought a Dell 2005 FPW, okay? That was around $700. It was a 24 inch. It was like this thick. (mumbles) as usual, they've got nipple joystick navigation back here along with a handful of shortcut buttons and power button. They've got RGB built into the logo. Back here we got a built-in USB hub, headphone jack, display port, dual HDMI but it should be noted, these are not HDMI 2.1. Although, because the panel is 1440p rather than 4K, that may not actually end up being an issue. You know we're gonna have to hook up an HDMI cable and see how high we can go on an HDMI 2.0 connection. Did I mention already, this thing is VESA 600HDR certified? Cool, well it is. Oh, it also has both G-Sync and ASUS's ELMB Sync. So that's their ultra low motion blur strobing Its got height. So that's good. Side to side. Yep, and tilt. But no swivel. All right. Fair enough ASUS. I get it something's got to give. Overclocking, on. That's my refresh rate, gonna turn that up to 175. Shadow boost is off. So if you're up all about bringing up the shadows and someone's crunching under a brand during CS:GO or whatever and they've got everything from level one to three to dynamic adjustment. One concern I have about this thing is I've always found the sweet spot for 1440 is around the 27 inch range. That's where you pretty much can't tell unless you're getting really close to it. Oh yeah, this is noticeable. It's not bad. It's not like, Ew, that's gross. Everything's blurry but if you're the kind of person who is ego like and really wants your texts to look as sharp as possible, then you probably wanna pay the extra for a 4K version. And then the extra for a GPU that can power the 4K version. And then think actually you know what, maybe if I'm an actual gamer and I don't spend all of my time on lttstore.com, maybe I'd be you okay with it exactly the way it is cause that's an awful lot of extra money to spend. Let's fire up to DOOM Eternal. Well, what, it's so much more expensive. I'm serious. Like this is 1440p, HDR600, 175hz. Like that's a lot of gaming for 700 bucks and it's all about trade-offs right? Like it's not like I'm gonna be looking okay. Well let's see, let's see. But I'm not expecting that I'm gonna be looking at an actual game going well, I can see the pixels. This game runs at 640 by 480 by default for some reason, let me get that fixed for you. And of course, because we're only running at 1440p crank this puppy, I've told you a nightmare. So then real talk David, at a reasonable distance. Do you see any pixels? - [David] Oh, certainly no pixels. - I can sort of make out a bit of stair-stepping around the helmet, sort of. It's not bad though. It's nothing a little bit of anti-aliasing can't fix. Like that's what's great For me about 1440. I mean, we did a whole video away a while back. This is not like this is a new stance on this issue for me. Uh, we did a whole video about how you're just better off having a 1440p display. And if it's not sharp enough, you can throw AA the problem. You can throw super sampling at the problem but at least you're running native resolution at a reasonable sort of GPU load. So we've got HDR enabled in this game as with all HDR400 and HDR600 displays. I would say the HDR experience is not especially game changing. You really wanna step up to something like one of ASUS HDR1000 tier monitors, if you want like a really mindblowing HDR experience. But I would still say that it adds more than it detracts for sure. Like you can see those, those are animal icons and stuff like that really do glow bright, same thing with explosions. It's not stunning or anything like that. In terms of smoothness, I continue to think that a hundred and mid Hertz is kinda what most people are gonna see the most benefit from. So this is a really good middle ground resolution, refresh rate and of course cost is a big factor in a product like this one. Like, do you notice any stair-stepping as I'm running around here, David? - [David] Oh definitely not. - Yeah, I just don't think 4K is necessary for gaming. It's cool and if I'm sitting this close to it, yeah, I can see it but it's not necessary. I'm not saying that better effects and lighting and higher refresh rate aren't necessary. I'm just saying, if I have a fixed amount of horsepower, I wanna invest it in other things rather than 4K that's all. Little bit of blue discoloration on the leading edge. Little bit of yellow discoloration on the trailing edge. So there's definitely a little bit of motion blur. Man it's not bad though. It took us a second and to get ELMB enabled because while you can have it on at the same time as HDR, you can't have it on at the same time as the variable backlight, local dimming nonsense. So that makes sense. For those not familiar, this technology actually strobes the backlight. You can't see it to your eye but the camera can probably see the strobing can it. Yeah, so what it's doing is it's strobing the backlight in between pixel refreshes. So you don't see that blurry in between phases but you just see those sharp finished stages at each refresh. It's cool that you can have it on at the same time as G-Sync on this model. Like if you track with your eyes, if you track the great, for example, those look clear. Are you trying it? Obviously I'm gonna wait for folks like blur busters or RTINGS to check it out and validate exactly how low motion blur this is but to a pled like meets the eye, dang it's looking pretty good. And if you guys wanna check it out, we're gonna have it links down in the video description. Make sure you're subscribed to short circuit to see more videos like this. Thank you for watching and thank you ASUS again for sponsoring our first look here at the PG329, 1440p what a nice middle ground.",

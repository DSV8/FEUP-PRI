    "transcript": "- Butter dog, dog with butter. Yo, Johnson here and welcome to episode three of 50 under 50. High waist jeans that gon make my ex cry Hit me up like I'm still up for grabs, no reply I'm a real go-getter, keep my level at Versailles Only thing on my mind is the bullseye So today's video is sponsored by Adidas, which not gonna lie it's kind of amazing. A little bit of a fan boy. And with that, before we jump into things, I wanted to showcase the GMR, which also happens to come in under 50 bucks. It's unique in the sense that it blends the physical fitness aspect of football or soccer as Americans might call it, with the digital connected gaming side as well. How it works is you first have the GMR insole which you'd first insert into your cleats. It then works in conjunction with this tiny compact Google powered Jacquard tag that packs a ton of tech inside. There's a built-in gyroscope, an accelerometer, even a tiny processor that enables machine learning which then can decipher soccer specific movements. So you're able to track the number of kicks, how fast those kicks were, your top speed, and then the total distance you've run. - Top running speed was, was 18.9 kilometers per hour, which is about like 12 miles per hour. Says I kicked the ball 43 times, but it does say that this value is the total count of kicks you performed, including passes, crosses and shots. Tapping the ball lightly with your foot will not be counted. So it doesn't count like all your touches, it just counts, when you're actually kicking the ball. And then it says, I traveled 3.7 kilometers and most of that was fetching the ball. - Could we pause for a second and give a giant golf clap to my guy Alex, for A, that accent and B, those soccer skills. This is all done through the GMR app, which, of course, is a great way to track your progress but an even better way to keep improving with these fun challenges. It doesn't stop there though, what makes these challenges even cooler though is you can then connect the app to FIFA mobile. So you can then take those goals and challenges in real life, and convert them to exclusive rewards, ways to build your team in the game. And again, this is a really unique way to combine both the physical and digital world together. So if you're into soccer, I mean, football, definitely check out the Adidas GMR and I'll drop a link to that down below. Someone's got to affiliate link these all 50 products, so do you think you could help me out and make affiliate links for me? - Definitely, I'm able to do that, yes sir. (laughing) - All right, so you, every affiliate link in this video will go to your affiliate link. Is that cool with you? - Yeah, for sure, that's really dope, thank you. - So everyone, support my man out, everything in this video, if you guys wanna pick up for yourself, for a friend, for a family member, it's gonna help out my guy. Man you got the acoustic foam and you're outdoing me. (laughing) - Yes sir, yeah. After I fix it up after I plan on getting a bit around here, but yeah. - What microphone are you using? - The Deity D3 Pro. - Amazing, shout out to Deity. That's a good mic. - I know, they sent it to me, it was awesome. It's like the best mic, it's my main mic, I don't use any other mic for anything now. - What's your pick under 50? - My pick would have to be the Seagate hard drive. This one is a five terabyte, but they have a one Terabyte model that's 47 bucks. And it's a really good hard drive, I use this to edit all my videos. This one is 130 for the five terabytes, but for the one terabyte is pretty much the exact, it's the exact same hard drive, it's just a smaller storage. It's actually saved me like a lot, 'cause one of my hard drives went out. So, we got this to make sure I can still edit my videos because my MacBook is only 128 gigs of storage. So I needed something, I need something to edit off of. (laughing). - Yeah I feel you bro, like the 128 giga life is rough. - Right, yeah. So this came be really clutch. We got it and it worked like, work perfectly. - So next this is what I would call set up gains got a seven one package to elevate your current setup. And the beautiful thing is, these work great together or independently. Now you may not see it from here but there's actually an M one Mac book air right behind this display. That's thanks in part to this vertical stand from Hitachi, they make really great accessories. Also have their wireless mouse and wireless 10 key number pad which makes a great extension. If you have a keyboard that does not have that. Now right next to that, I have surprise a wired keyboard because sometimes you just need a wired keyboard in your life. Sometimes Bluetooth can be a jerk, especially if you're trying to boot up into a particular partition. And if you don't mind that wire this is a really clean option above that is this really cool small compact desk lamp from Hot Light. I like that it has touch controls. So you can simply cycle through how bright or not bright you want to have it in. And really this is ideal for someone who needs to concentrate or be productive/creative during the day because being in a dim environment will quickly destroy all of that. Now if you're curious, what the heck are six and seven in this setup gaming series? That's actually one of them right here an under desk outlet. Right next to that though, is something really helpful. It's an on desk headphone hook. Not sure if you wanna store your $550 AirPods max on this, but if you wanted to it is definitely strong enough. For real though it's a great way to keep your desk clutter-free and more importantly, a way to keep your headphones off the floor. From there it's kind of a setup bonus. If you've been a mechanical drive kind of person all your life, and you're looking to just maybe dip your toes into the flash life. This is a great inexpensive way to do that. This is also this really cool tiny compact option where it's almost a Swiss army knife because on one end you have USB-A but it transforms Ninja style into USB-C and it packs 256 gigs of storage. Now, if you've grabbed that Homepod many or really any other smart speaker, and you're looking to add some additional smart home elements in your life, I got you. One of the biggest complaints with Phillips hue and their smart bulbs is that to get into the game you used to have to buy a hub which not everybody wanted to do. Fortunately nowadays they have two cool options that don't need a hub. You have this fancy pants hipster, Edison option or a simpler option here. And again, the best part about these, is they're under 50 and you don't need a hub to control them. If you're deep in that Phillips hue life, though this is one of the coolest accessories I've seen. It's actually this little dimmer that goes on top of your existing outlet switch because there's nothing more annoying than setting up some smart home lights, flipping them off and then dealing with that nonsense. This does two things. It gives you demean power. Plus you're not going to accidentally hit the switch. You don't want to hit next. This is for my home kit people out there. If you want to say, plug your Christmas tree into an outlet and say, hey, turn off the Christmas tree. This is what you need. So next we've got some cool stuff some unique things that kind of really vibe with me. We're kicking it off with this AirPods pro iPod shuffle case from spigen. And it does exactly what it sounds like it does. It allows you to store your AirPods pro in a case that looks like an iPod shuffle. Honestly, I would say it's more of an aesthetic kind of for fun thing. I wouldn't use it on the every day basis, mainly because I'm not a huge fan of how the top part comes off. They do however, make this, which weirdly enough has been my go-to favorite accessory this week. It definitely gives a little bit of the dad vibe where you're rocking a lanyard on your belt loop, but I'm not sure if I really care because with the original AirPods that case just kind of slid right in real nicely. Whereas the AirPods pro not so much and this kind of perfectly solves that problem. Next, I can think of a cooler piece of tech right now than a mask. And I've been legit excited looking for new mask. This might be my favorite reusable right now. It's called the halo mask. And the reason I like it is because one it's layered. You can insert a filter in here. You have adjustable ear loops, which is nice but the coolest part about this something you don't normally see, on a reusable masks is the adjustable nose tips. So that guy is nice and secure. It's not going anywhere. And you got some mortal Kombat scorpion vibes. There's also the, the air mask from spigen which is a little simpler. There's no filter, but again the point of a mask is not necessarily to protect yourself is to be empathetic and protect others. So this is better than nothing at all. It's lightweight, it slips right on and it is super comfortable. And we can look at that. I can still talk. I can still breathe. Point is whether you're wearing that mask or the sick led mask with the cyberpunk led glasses or you can even grab these sweet matte black mask. You can grab an entire box for under 50 bucks. Wear one, let's do our part and let's get through this together. From there's hoodie that I'm wearing right now is actually a bag or it's a hoodie that transforms into a bag. So I get it. Maybe you wanna rock the sweater around your waist. Maybe you want to have those Carlton vibes, that's fine. But if you're looking for an alternative this actually transforms into a bag. So you can either store stuff in your hoodie shaped bag or store your hoodie that turns into a bag into another bag. While we're on the apparel topic, this has been my, everything. We call it the homer into a bush A-plus. Next for my garden, Oh the Tim Apple shirt, that's also under 50 bucks. I'll drop a link to that down below. But like I said, for my guardians of the galaxy fans we've got a guardian of the Bluetooth speaker. I see you peeping group back there that kind of pairs with this. Unfortunately that's not under 50 but this is cool as hell, breaking news group moves. And it's also now under 50 bucks link down below. Now, recently I finally made the switch to the iPhone 12 mini jumped from the 11 pro max down to the 12 mini I've love almost everything about it. And if you guys want to see a video on that experience drop a like down below. The only thing I haven't been crazy about though is the battery life. So these two have been my best friends. So I've really enjoyed the Magsafe charger. I wish you could get a detachable cable or it was a little bit longer but what it does It works perfectly for me. Also for those that have heard the song it is finally available on Spotify and Apple music. And I'll drop a link to that down below. And as we pivot this little guy, looks like the charger you normally wouldn't wanna use if you found one in your house. It's the anchor power port three nano. And despite its size, this little boy pops out 20 Watts of juice. An alternate side story I've been using the M1 MacBook pro pretty much as my main machine. This video that you're watching right now was exported on that laptop. In my video covering AirPods max where my first impression is that was also edited on the MacBook pro. The problem was I was so deep in the zone. I couldn't find a proper USBC charger. So I use this to keep me afloat and surprise, It actually did. So I think that's a combination of how impressive this is with how impressive the power draw on these new machines actually are. Now for like, hold up, what if I need more power? This one from Aoki just squeaks in a cent under 50 bucks but delivers a hundred Watts of power with two USB-C ports. On the subject of power, this the Rode Rockstar, cheesy name but it's a super cool product. Obviously one first and foremost, it's a car charger but the sauce is that A, you get four USB ports. It's a little older school in the sense that you're going USBA, which is kind of weird to say but the magic here is there's a breakout USB box that goes to the back of the car. So not only are you passing the aux you're passing the power. From there this is one of the coolest things I've come across lately. It is the Echo gear outlet shelf. And like that name implies it's intended things like the Echo plus, the Echo dot but as you may or may not be aware there is a new smart speaker that has entered the chat, the Homepod mini. And this happens to work out perfectly for that as well. It's pretty simple. You just remove your old outlet plate replace it with this, that locks things in there's in cable management, which is incredible. And again, while it does work perfectly for the Homepod mini, it was intended for the Echo dot, the Echo plus. And you know, it's gonna work with other small speakers as well. Next, Marquez I got a gift for you. I've heard you've been known to carry an iMac around, to edit on. I get it. I love editing on a bigger screen something with more power. A lot of us out there probably do that. So that's where this comes in. It's one thing, if you're traveling with an iMac and you need that heavy duty artillery, the Pelican case but if you're just throwing it in a car, this is a much simpler option. It's padded. So you're getting protection pretty much everywhere you need it. And the bonus on top of everything is you have slots to throw things like your keyboard mouse and even some drives in there. Speaking of Pelican, if you get excited about organizational things, this thing is sick. You get all the protective awesomeness that you've come to expect with Pelican but in a tiny compact package. That makes a great accessory on your desk or in your bag. Now, if you don't need anything that intense this is a great alternative from Platinum. I found this at Best Buy. And the cool thing here is you can grab this for under 30 bucks. So if you happen to be in the market for a pair of earbuds, I've got a couple options for both my wired and wireless friends. On the wireless side, these are the Go Air True Wireless Earbuds from JLab. And they got so much going for them. They're affordable which is obviously maybe the most important thing here. They're compact. I liked that there's an integrated charging solution. In the case, you get great battery life there's customizable IQ and to ice the cake, there are built-in touch controls. Now on the wired side of things, the T2 from Tin Hi-Fi someone argued that in terms of audio quality these would outperform something like AirPods pro. You of course don't get the convenience of wireless and have to deal with a cable, but in terms of how they sound, they are incredible. You're not gonna need a crazy dac or amp to push these. so you can grab them by themselves now, and then eventually if you do upgrade something like a Dragon Fly, it's only going to improve your experience. Now 2020 has definitely been the year for me to jump back into guitar and music. And if you're looking to do something similar these are a couple of my favorite guitar accessories under 50 bucks. First up is a humidifier, which is really important in terms of taking care of your guitar. I know it can be tempting to want to display them outside on a stand or on your wall. But if you can, ideally, you want them in a case with a humidifier. The reason it's so important, is the environment you keep your guitar in can either be too humid or actually not humid enough. What as we know it can expand, it can crack. So this kind of keeps things at the perfect condition. The reason why this one's so cool is with the typical humidifier you gotta mess with adding water and it can kind of get messy or just downright annoying. Whereas with this, you have a couple pouches that you slot into the respective containers. You put one near the headstock one in the sound hole, you are good to go. Now I will admit I'm not the biggest fan of changing strings, but if you do it makes the world of difference. My go-to strings are the Elixir Phosphor Bronze and there's actually some tech going on here where the strings themselves they're coded. So one, they last longer, they feel nice and two, I think they carry a really distinct sound. They're definitely pricier than say a basic set of strings but again, they last longer, they sound better. And when you pair them with a string winder and this headstock cutter, you got the perfect combo to change out the strings yourself. From there, I got two more. What I would say are essential accessories that you should grab if you don't have yet. The first is a guitar tuner. And I really do like the clip on kind. They're simple. They're easy to use. They're convenient. From there if you don't have a cable, you should absolutely grab one. They're super affordable and more than anything it adds an extra layer of fun to playing guitar. Now, as far as what the heck, this thing actually does in a basic explanation, what it does is changes the key of the song you're playing. So for example here's what something sounds like played open (playing guitar) Versus playing that exact same thing with those same shapes capoed on the third fret. (guitar playing) Also fun in fact, what you just heard was recorded on this TC 30 USBC microphone, which you guessed, it also happens to come in under 50 bucks. Conversely it also makes a great budget voiceover mic or for streaming, whatever you're looking to get into to get better audio. I really love the fact that it comes with A, a shock mount. B, a pop filter for those plosives. And it's a little bit funny because it does connect by USBC which is awesome, but it ships with a USB-C to eight cable. So I got this going into the MacBook pro right now battery life is living on a prayer. I'm really pushing this to the limit right now but because of that cable, I ended up having to put it through this anchor USBC hub, which gives me USB back. I like this one a lot because you get USBC pass through for power, two USB ports and actually USBC port for data, card slots and HDMI. The only thing worth mentioning with this hub is speaking of that HDMI port it does not do 4k 60 Hertz but aside from that, it is a fantastic value just like this mic. Now I know what you thinking how was that Mac book that I saw moments ago that shiny and clean. Enter this, which is primarily a screen cleaner. It's alcohol free, which is super important, but it also doubles as a great electronics cleaner as well. Now if guitar isn't your thing and you're more looking to jump into the production midi kind of recording side things, I found this the mini plus AKM 320 which really surprised me for the price. It's built extremely well. And what's really nice is that it's USB power. So you don't got to deal with any clunky power adapters. And I think I should probably send this to my guy Henny the business at some point. So first up on this list is the Sega Genesis Mini which is near and dear to my heart. I'm essentially a part Sega part, Sony boy. True story, many years ago my brother and I had got an NES and ended up fighting over duck hunt So my mom was like, nah fam that's going back to Toys R Us. After a harsh lesson learned, we eventually got a hold of a Sega Genesis and fast forward to Sonic one, Sonic two, Ecco the Dolphin, ToeJam & Earl III that was essentially our childhood. Those are all on the Sega Genesis Mini and apart from a couple of my personal favorites Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, Damn You, Disney and Pixar. This packs a really solid lineup and is a great way to either revisit some of that nostalgia or just jump in for the first time. Next, for the many out there who managed to grab a PS5 controller and not a PS5, I don't have a PS5 for you, but I do got this sweet wall stand. This of course will work not only with the PS5 controller but maybe your Team Xbox or Team Switch. This makes a great accessory to grab. Speaking of teams, switch, if you're on the thick side of things and that light life ain't for you, but you envy that D pad, this is what you need. It's super Mario themed, which is a on top but in its basic form it's a left joy con that you can buy by itself. That adds a D pad. Alternatively, if you've been looking to jump into the controller world, but don't wanna spend a pro controller kinds of cash, the 8Bitdo SN30 Pro Plus is a great alternative. It's super comfortable. The bill quality is fantastic. It packs USB-C. I'm looking at you, Tim cook, and to ice the cake, It also works on windows, Mac, and Android. Now this one is a super cool option for the diehard Nintendo fans out there, behold the game and watch. Next for the socks people in your life, we all got them, hit them with these. Now on the PC master race side of things it's been a rough one this year, because anything cool you cannot buy right now. If you did however jump into the gaming side of things And want to scoop of a gaming mouse that won't break the bank, the DeathAdder by Razer is a fantastic option. And this white edition is super clean. So that kind of wraps things up. I'm going to close this video out what they random Ed Sheeran riff. Thank you guys so much for watching and I will catch you guys later. (playing guitar)",

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave2D here so if you know, me or if you follow My channel you might recognize this place. This is my condo. Now Dyson reached out to me. They were awesome enough to sponsor this video. Dyson has announced today, March 6 that they're no longer designing those traditional upright vacuums. So those yellow Bald things that were really iconic when i was growing up. James Dyson is announcing that they're Not designing any more new ones. Instead they're making something like This. The cyclone v10 absolute so this is supposed to replace those upright Vacuums. It's fully cordless, it's highly, maneuverable, and it's very flexible but, there's a problem to this whole scenario. My place is clean I'm not gonna pretend like it's super dirty just to make a video. This is just how I keep my condo. It's a clean place so I Thought, what is the best way for me to showcase what this thing can do? What's the best way to kind of like Dirty this place up to make it worthy of a vacuum. In front of me are two fans. These are.. I haven't tried this yet. This is going to be a bit of an experiment. I have fans and a bucket of dust, and I'm going to pour a lot of dusts on to these fans, and hopefully coat this place with a fine layer of dust. Okay here we go. I'm gonna go for the far fan first, and then the close fan and...(looks at dust) (realizes his mistake) Holy, smokes. I gotta be honest This, is way worse than i thought it would be. Oh my god. Okay Cyclone, v10 this thing has up to a 60-minute battery, it's got whole machine hepa filtration and the bin size is significantly larger than the v6 or the v8 that i've used in the past. I mean let's just put this thing to work It's actually doing a Decent job on the pull on the push it's leaving stuff behind i think it's. Like, bigger Chunks, but I'll just go out. And just pull it in nice So I've done most of the floor but, I want to switch attachments because I feel like This, tool here is a better device for cleaning the couch, oh? My, god there's like rocks on this thing So i've been, going for about 30 minutes now i've done the couch I've done most of the floor and the battery Still says full, well it says three out of the three bars so I don't know. I guess that's good but I'm gonna Keep, going I'm gonna switch to this tool. It's I guess a, soft bristle and I'm gonna Use this on the computer and the stuff on the coffee table Now the bin is in line with the rest of the vacuum so you're getting better airflow. With this new design Well I thought this thing, would be dead by now i feel like the battery should have, worn out long time ago. I'm going nonstop for about an hour to the point Where my fingers are tired. I think that's actually something. I wish they would add like a switch that you could flick without having to squeeze The trigger. I like this thing a lot. I feel like for most people you could easily replace your vacuum like Your, big quarter vacuums with, this thing it's just like a, big vacuum but, super portable and just Wireless; cordless that's awesome huge battery huge bin. Smaller motor has just been way more efficient is. I like this thing okay if you guys Are interested i'll drop a, link down below you can check out their store at www.dyson.com hope you guys enjoyed this video and seriously i'm so glad for this vacuum clean, this place up properly Because it was a total, mess and i was actually worried this Was me a giant, disaster but cleaned up nicely okay hope you guys, enjoyed this video thumbs We liked it subs you loved it see you guys next time",

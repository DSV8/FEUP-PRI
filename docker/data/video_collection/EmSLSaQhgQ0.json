    "description": "The be quiet! Pure Base 500 is their least expensive case yet at just $70 but it packs a ton of features and features great build quality.  We had some time with early tooling samples at Computex 2019 and it looks like the Pure Base 500 could really provide some great competition in its price point.

    "transcript": "what was that movement after you you clap the hands it's like a fish fish tail get out of here get out of my shot I'm kidding you're always welcome in my shot all right our first meeting of the day we'll just arrived to Taipei let's go see what be quiet has to offer it's not very quiet in here now before we begin talking about the new pure base 500 from be quiet I'd like to thank our sponsors Phanteks and SteelSeries for making cosmetics possible so the pure base 500 is all about expanding that pure base family delivering something slightly more compact versus the pure base 600 we have three color options white black and gray the white one looks fantastic it is full white on the interior and exterior with some black accents here and there the black one is full matte black usually we would find some orange accents in the black version but not here and the gray one that one's not finalized yet but I'm hoping to see it being like dark Space Gray that has a lot of character now price wise tempered glass Edition versus solid side panel are different so for the black one it is 69 and 79 dollars for non TG and TG respectively while the color options the white one and gray are a 5 dollar extra so the competition here would be the H500 in terms of air cooling and size and I really like this approach I want to see more mid towers that are compact that can fit large CPU coolers and the fact that the pure base 500 is slightly wider SAS accommodating a hundred and forty member fans at the back and two of them are included the pure rings - so that's pretty nice and it can support CPU towers up to 180 three millimeters so the latest dark rock pro 4 will fit and here no problem now the included fans spin at 900 rpm and these being a pure wings - fans means they deliver a lot of airflow and are incredibly silent and based on their internal testing temperatures seem to be very very promising and I'm also excited to test out myself their sound dampening material applied to the front and side panels in terms of dust filtration so there is a giant dust filter at the bottom that you remove from the front and the top one you can remove the top plate and - that with a dust filter nice easy approach if you're looking for a little bit more airflow and if you're mounting anything up there for exhaust as for the interior only up to ATX motherboards are supported I do like the cable cover it's become kind of standard we're moving away from rubber grommets and I'm thinking that's for a positive thing to reduce the cost and also give you a little bit more flexibility on actually where you can exit those cables beside the motherboard now for the white model I don't like that the motherboard tray is completely white because it will reveal all your cables while on the black version because it is full matte black I think you look amazing with a CPU cooler from be quiet that there's also black and if you're going for the whole stealth approach it will look pretty sweet the only branding on the interior is that be quiet plate that sits in between two SSD mounts the thing is they're facing each other so you do if you're amounting to assess these then one of them will be upside down as for additional storage options we have a dual SSD bracket behind the motherboard tray and also a hard drive cage in front of the PSU that you can move slightly inwards to clear up some space for the front where you can install a 360 rad and also you can install dual hard drives in there or a single SSD and finally for the top you can mount up to a 240 rad but given how close the mounting locations are to the rear exhaust fan I feel like doing any radiator up here would be challenging so perhaps sticking to airflow only for the top would be my choice and given how Y the enclosure is it is definitely targeted towards mounting a nice large CPU cooler so that would be my round now the cool thing about the Pure Base 500 is that it's still in the development stages so the tooling is not finalized which means any feedback you can provide in the comments about it will potentially make its way into the final release so one thing we noticed is that in the front panel the bottom section was not dust proof while the sides were so they will address that in the final release nice little you know touch that we found after working with the case for 30 minutes or so but based on the footage what are your thoughts let us know in the comments all right good people so that is the pure base 500 and you be quiet enclosure let us know what you think for the price point and for the feature said the color options really hoping to see the great version finalized and hoping it's like that space gray color but yeah thanks so much for watching make sure to check out other relevant content here and that stay tuned for more complex videos",

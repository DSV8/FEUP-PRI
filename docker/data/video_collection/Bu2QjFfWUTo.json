    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Not all the stuff that makes its way to the Mr. Mobile studio gets the full review treatment, and not all of it fits into our short and sweet Facebook videos either. This month, the table of bonus toys includes a set of beautiful wooden headphones, a smartwatch I love like a dumb watch, a desk lamp that charges your phone, and a bonus gadget I want badly, but don't own, at least not yet. I'm Mr. Mobile, and this is my favorite stuff from the studio this spring. (upbeat electronic music) The first thing on the list isn't something I'd ordinarily cover because there's not much mobile about a desk lamp, but Lumicharge is more than a light. It's a charging station that includes connectors for basically any phone or tablet you can think of. It's got a back lit battery powered alarm clock and a motion activated night light, so you can find your way in the dark. The primary LED bar also offers three different color temperatures and articulates to throw light on whatever you're trying to see. I've used it as both a desk lamp and a bedside light over the past two weeks, and it's really helped with my research and addiction to Star Trek pocket books of the '90s. Lumicharge is currently on Indiegogo Prototype with deliveries slated for December. As with all the products in this video, the link is down in the description. A retail price of 129 is a bit too rich for my blood. For that price, I'd like premium metal or wood construction instead of this glossy plastic, but the early bird pricing of 70 to 80 bucks is right on if you're looking to combine a few desktop accoutrement into one. Speaking of premium wood construction, Meze. Mezzie, Meez, these guys offered to let me borrow a pair of their 99 Classics a while back, and while I've been a fully wireless listener since the Bose QC 35 came out, I'm also deeply vulnerable to walnut and gold. So I just had to take these wires beauties for a spin anyway, and he company claimed the Classics deliver perfect natural sound even to the pickiest of audio lovers, but I don't know. I think I've been spoiled by too many months of acoustic noise canceling, which the Classics don't have. What I can say is that it sure sounds like a nice, balanced sound stage, and these are indeed some of the most comfortable headphones I've worn thanks to the Memory Foam under the bi-cast leather ear cups, but at $309, they're certainly not for those looking for a headset on the cheap. The LG Watch Sport was the flagship smartwatch for the launch of Android Wear 2.0, a platform that I think still leaves room for improvement. That goes for this watch too, which on your screen probably looks like a massive, monster meatball of an accessory, and you know, it is big, it is expensive, and for all those grams and dollars, I'd like to have seen better battery life, but despite having more beautiful and more rugged smartwatches at my disposal, I keep coming back to the Watch Sport, and it's all for three reasons, button one, button two, and rotating crown. With all the lists and cards in Wear 2.0, I can't bring myself to go back to that clumsy touchscreen. The crown is just too handy, and the additional buttons being fully programmable means I can set shortcuts to my most used features, the stopwatch and the timer. Yup, I use a $350 smartwatch to do things a drugstore Timex could do for 20 bucks. The last entry in this list is a big old cheat. The Ember mug isn't something I have in my studio, but it's something I've coveted since seeing Modern Dad's review. It's a portable thermos that doesn't just keep your coffee warm, it keeps it at the temperature you specify down to the degree. For someone who frequently braves Boston snow storms to make a Dunkin' Donuts run, this thing is a huge temptation. Suffice it to say, though, there's a reason I haven't bought it yet, and it's not because I don't want another gadget in my life. I'll let Modern Dad fill you in on the rest. Click the card to go over there or just follow the link in the description. Hey, while you're over there, subscribe to Modern Dad on YouTube, and before you go, subscribe to Mr. Mobile, and help me get to a million before the year is out.

Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends. (lively music)",

    "transcript": "this here is a box obviously and it has a very interesting broken and very dirty console inside of it i know what you're thinking okay greg come on consoles enough with the console content we're above that right we're pc gamers and i totally get it i game on my pc but i also still play consoles i have the xbox one that i repaired i still play all the time there's actually really cool games on it some exclusives that i like and that's one of the main reasons why i still have them now this is probably not a console you game with anymore and that's because it's very old and oh gee original xbox like it's just called the xbox there's nothing behind it because it's the first one so let's see what's inside shall we uh it looked pretty rough in the photos so i'm expecting a pretty disgusting looking console here she is wow i forgot how big original xboxes were wow yeah this thing is bulbous the smell is also as you can imagine quite interesting we've got some graffiti on the top of the console which is okay and then we have colored xbox and power button disc tray logos like these were painted red for some reason not sure why that was the case it's also very dusty and the dust here is is not your average dust color this is brown so it was probably mixed with either smoke or something else that's giving it this very pungent odor i am uh man i'm i'm ready to restore it i'm ready to clean it up because it feels awful uh but i'm also hoping that whatever we do inside of this thing of course trying to make it look as factory as original as new as possible uh also kind of as a byproduct fixes the power issue here described by the previous owner it just doesn't send any signal to a modern effect i don't even think it powers up so we'll check that before we take it apart just so we have a starting point and then at the end of this assuming we don't find any obvious physical damage after cleaning it we'll try to power it on again and see if that alone can fix the problem are you ready i sure am i'm ready to clean this up it's really yeah it's messing with my sinuses already let's get into it stay with me nzxt has rolled out their new function mechanical keyboards in varying sizes and with plenty of customizability by their bld service choose between five different gateron switches three chassis colorways two color keycaps and multiple accent caps and cables for a truly unique custom mechanical experience enjoy rgb lighting key remapping and multiple sizes as well from full size to mini tkl like this one here it's my favorite it packs a lot of punch in such a tiny package with media keys volume roller and durable aluminum top plate to round out the industrial feel to start customizing your nzxt function mechanical keyboard be sure to click the link below now before we get started with the actual cleaning a couple things i want to take care of first i need to put some gloves on i'm noticing that i'm starting to get a headache already and i've only been around this thing for like 10 minutes i think it's because this console was smoked around and i don't respond well to cigarette smoke like at all it gets pretty bad and i definitely don't want this in the house any longer because i have kids here so i'll be taking it outside for the remainder of the deconstruction and in there you'll see yeah we'll take it all apart we'll clean most of it out there we'll bring it back in once it's been washed as well uh so we'll take a hose to it maybe some soap and scrub the plastics especially where a lot of that tar and stuff will stick the other thing i want to do is turn on my air purifier because holy crap it needs it this is my big daddy levoit air purifier you guys know they've been sponsoring the channel for a good while and i'm so thankful that i have these because well first off this is like an overkill one for a room this size unless unless you do what i do but it's perfect for now because there's so much crap circulating this stuff will literally cleanse the air it'll make it smell so much better in here it'll get rid of all the dust floating around and in this case possibly some leftover tar it's not really in the best location it should be more in the center of the room but it works well enough here a very powerful fan filtration system it basically pulls in from the sides basically circular 360 degree all that nasty crap in the air and then filters it and then expels clean air at the top so you just get really nice circulation in the office uh man i really need to get this thing outside yeah just give me a second here these purple gloves yeah that's much better anyway long story short i have levoit air purifiers in every bedroom in this house including my two kids rooms my own bedroom the living room downstairs this office i can't imagine a house without them so consider picking one up for your home today if you haven't already you can find them linked in this video's description big thanks again to levoit for being the product sponsor of this video now that out of the way let's get this thing outside i my allergies are just going haywire by the way is this dc stick actually it's not even a sticker it's like painted on here is this not the most period correct thing you've ever seen on a console oh my god this yeah this explains the smell definitely i mean we've got the brownest looking dust and likely tar i've ever seen caked up in a console this is so gross so someone was more than likely smoking around this thing while it was running so you know the air is just being pulled in by the internal fan and uh yeah just kicking up this is ah man i can't even talk in here anymore it's getting so bad now i'm not super familiar with flow patterns in the original xbox i have never taken one apart before so that that'll be fun uh but it looks like this is the exhaust area and you can see there's still tons of brown dust just sitting on these little vertical or sorry horizontal fins it's not not looking too good and i imagine the insides look just as bad if not worse so we've got the console in the garage and the first thing we need to do for disassembly is flip it upside down there should be six screws under here four underneath the rubberized feet and another two under these stickers i'm not sure where one's here and then another one is under one of these so we'll carefully pry these off one at a time the adhesive sometimes isn't wanting to stick so we'll need to take care of this with reassembly we'll just peel off the old discolored stuff for now screws come out with the t20 torx again six of them the sixth one is actually right here you can see the little indention and the sticker we're just gonna poke through it i'm not worried about you know what it looks like underneath and with them removed we can flip this back around i believe the cover just slide right up now this is where you'll start to see just how gross this really is you know look at this like there's stuff growing in here it looks like it was infested with bugs or something uh looks like droppings all over the place and you can see our large three and a half inch hard drive yeah throwback towel this console is all right let's uh yeah let's dive deeper let's see we can get this ribbon cable out at least from the hard drive side be very careful because this stuff is pretty old so i imagine the plastic is going to be a bit brittle disconnect the power as well molex power throwback now we've got one looks like a t10 yep t10 torx holding the hard drive cage in place i could get that yep this uh isn't magnetic so that's gonna be a bit of a problem but now the remainder of this should just slide right out i'll be careful about this cable here there we go oh my gosh it is bad in there so not only uh yeah and this is like this is not only dusty but also corroded but the the motherboard and the power supply board in there are super caked this might er i mean at this point i would normally just give up it's it's so old and just rusted in there and it's probably why it's no longer working but whatever we're gonna keep going pull straight up there we go holy cow just gross in there okay and uh here we are you can see the main board on the left there and the power supply on the right this is an integrated psu so you don't have an external brick which was nice for the original xbox although they reverted to external bricks later on which kind of sucked uh yeah you can see how bad it is in here and i do see corrosion so i'm not sure if this is salvageable let me go ahead and disconnect power cable running to the main board this that's a clip on one side kind of wiggle it free alrighty and then a few more connections i'm not sure if you can see from that angle a few more connections uh toward the front of the main board we'll disconnect these and we're going to try to get this main board out of here let's see one more on this side there we go and then just a few torx screws all the way around also yes that is a disgusting cockroach disconnect the fan and i believe that should be it easy does it hey buddy what's up it's really gross in here you probably don't want to see this it's real nasty see that it's nasty in there huh oh you want to be on camera you're not camera shy just like your daddy all right the camera's following you and back and there's mama coming back from epcot and you're totally blown out there we go that's a little better hello and with a couple more torx screws we can slide this power supply board back and then up kind of finicky be very careful with this if you don't know what you're doing don't touch this i get this fan out next a flathead screwdriver helps tremendously come on there we go all right and just the last few pieces up front mainly for peripherals uh front power and the like our controllers see i think this is it clipped in ah there we go just uh just a bit stubborn as all pull back and up back and up there we go and at this point i think we can detach the metal shell from the plastic it's just yeah again a bit finicky oh there's dust going everywhere that is so gross oh and for the power board i believe i just need to unclip there we go and with the front part of the unit detached we can just pull up on this board here this is again for power and the eject button for the optical drive so my neighbor's just started mowing or whatever he's doing it's going to be a bit loud i'm just going to cut some music which is not what i usually do for the gcdc series all i'm going to be doing is basically washing everything off you can see most of the stuff on the ground is like main board power supply the fan things i don't want to get too wet especially the power supply board uh but the stuff outside that you're about to see us get you know let's start washing is all plastic uh or metal something we can scrub uh and so i'm gonna wet it off first hit it with the the hose and then if we need to take soap to it which i imagine we will we'll do that okay here we go already cutting some music so so so so see so so uh there was a time when i thought i could save the shell of the xbox uh most of the stuff you just saw cleaned is sitting behind me and it is ready to be reassembled a few things that i did that you're probably questioning including painting the metal shell or the metal i guess i should say the metal frame inside of the plastic shell i painted over that just to make sure that whatever corrosion was happening they could see some of the rust on this thin steel is is stopped or halted so we basically put a coating over it it's just paint but it should prevent further corrosion or at least delay it now that we've painted over it and we kept it with a metallic look so it looks close to stock i think it's better than nothing given the age of this console i i wouldn't be too worried about it uh let's get this box open here now this is because i had no choice uh a new shell and i had to do this because well i kind of ruined the other one i'm really hoping this product is as described definitely wrapped up a lot with a lot of paper oh wait oh wow this looks better than i expected okay uh so yeah i mean it's decent it's a little scuffed up it's used clearly but it's not the end of the world this is just another xbox shell i bought this for like 30 bucks something like that it's not bad and we're just gonna throw everything we just cleaned in here so it's kind of a half new xbox yeah oh wow this actually came with the metal uh frame as well so basically everything except for the motherboard and the uh power supply and the ribbon cable optical drive hard drive but yeah everything else is here including front cabling that's pretty cool so we can outright just replace it and it's nice because this one is not corroded and it's not painted over either and would you look at that we also get a bag of screws pretty sweet let's go ahead and get some paste over the cpu as well as the gpu here i'm just gonna do a little dot like that and then this one i'm gonna do more of an x pattern and yep that should spread nice and evenly and then oh these dreaded plastic clips i really hate these they break all the time so we're gonna be very careful here get this one right here okay and then this one there we go i have no idea how to reset these clips i think it just kind of slides on like that yeah all right that seems good enough and same goes for this one this is a larger one geez that hurt all right push why is that not going all the way down i actually think i'm putting this on backwards let's try this direction yeah this this makes a bit more sense so push down on this side that is more like it okay yep i like the mounting pressure there motherboard is ready to go gonna drop it straight in and then we'll screw it down and take care of the connections at the front we'll also connect this fan which was also included with this replacement that is pretty sweet this cable goes right here and these two here and right here they are keyed so they'll only slide in one way if i can get it in there there we go a hard disk drive sits in the tray like so and then we've got these four screws here oh yeah she ain't going nowhere i really wish i said clean up just a tad more there's some corrosion on the surface of the hardest drive that i couldn't clean up and you're probably thinking to yourself greg why don't you just replace it outright that involves a bit of setting up and it's just really not worth it given the age of the console i'd rather stick with what already works gonna drop the power supply back in now that it's all cleaned up we'll slide the connectors portion in first and then we'll set the remainder of the board down this looks to be lined up and we'll tighten things down just a few more torx screws power cable connected let's see here easy does it nice nice drop her straight in and tighten her on down and here we are an xbox original that has for the most part been fully restored yeah i wish i could do a bit more about the scuffs here but i think we're in a better place than we were because uh we don't have the graffiti that we had before so let's see how this goes i've got the power cable connected i also have an adapter for this uh audio video out to hdmi which is why i have my laptop connect because it needs it needs usb or micro usb power to work so that's connected here we'll plug this power cable into the wall and that should be it i'm i'm kind of nervous let's see how this how this goes will it power on no way no way i should probably connect the hdmi cable i was talking about i'm an idiot are we going to get picture if we get picture i will be so freaking thrilled that would just be awesome because that would mean that us deep cleaning this fixed it check the optical drive it does not like that optical drive did not want to open at all yeah i can hear the motors trying to get things open but uh it's not liking it too much okay so let's power off again and we're getting power to our adapter here i'm really surprised it even turns on that video is connected properly so man it just took a minute it just took a minute that's all i said to be patient an original xbox folks there you go oh my gosh what a throwback it wants us to set the clock i'm so happy i don't know why i'm not even going to use this like it's so old i mean for nostalgia's sake i might play a game or two on it but to be completely honest with you i grew up with the original playstation and that's where a lot of my nostalgia lies a lot of the games that um just like the og playstation you know gran turismo games like that growing up i loved um so you know maybe i could make a case for having an original playstation around but i don't really need an xbox maybe if someone else does in the local orlando florida area i'll just give this to you you don't need to pay me or anything just meet me to pick up i yeah i'm not only offering that because i'm surprised it's even working but i i really have no use for it so i think the best way to handle this is to to give it to someone who would appreciate it and use it that's kind of the point so i will try my best to let's see i think the one thing yeah i still need a tinker a bit with the optical drive because that doesn't want to open i think i didn't set it in there correctly because it's kind of a little tight up top but other than that it works and i i don't know what to say because this was described as not working doa we deep cleaned it folks that's all we did and that seems to have done the trick thank you guys so much for watching this far into this one i know the consoles are kind of under most folks radar it's just because you can usually get decent if not better value out of a gaming pc maybe not the case a year ago but now that graphics cards are coming down in price again it makes a lot of sense to go the gaming pc route that said there are obviously huge fan bases loyal fan bases four consoles this being an older one maybe it was just nostalgic for you wanted to just see one of these be restored i wasn't sure how this was going to end uh but i'm glad we got it working again and um yeah hopefully it goes to somebody who will appreciate it and and use it as intended it needs a controller or two i'll include the adapter because i don't need that here so you can have that hook it up to a modern tv you should be good to go with that if you or someone you know has a very dirty console something like this it should probably work um but if it doesn't deep cleaning it might fix it you never really know especially if it's an overheating issue uh and you live in or around a lounge in or around orlando florida uh and you're able to you know drop off and pick up the console then i would like a chance to deep clean it here on the channel that would be much appreciated if you do that for me um it allows me to continue making videos like this and as a i guess a return of the favor i won't charge anything for it so if you'll drive out to me i know gas being what it is it's pretty expensive i won't charge anything for the service and uh hopefully you'll be happy with the result you'll get a clean console out of it doesn't matter how old or how new it is if it's pretty dirty and you think it needs a deep cleaning reach out our email is in this video's description if you guys enjoyed watching this one give it a thumbs up consider subscribing if you haven't already and stay tuned for the next one i still can't get over the fact that this thing is working right now well it just turned off probably because it's been sitting on the clock screen for a good while but uh wow super impressed thanks for learning with me",

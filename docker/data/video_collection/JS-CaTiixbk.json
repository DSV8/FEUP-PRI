    "transcript": "- Today, we're unboxing the brand new MacBook Pro 13-inch. This was just recently announced by Apple, and we have one here to check out. This has the 10th gen Core i5 processor. Whereas, the lower end starting price at 1299 model only has the eighth gen. So the lower end models are very similar to specs as the previous 13-inch MacBook, but it does have double the storage and also getting Magic Keyboard. You can now max up the internal storage to four terabytes. So, if you are looking for an upgrade at an entry level computer, there's a lot of options right now on Apple's website. I'm pretty excited about this because I've actually never reviewed one of the 13-inch MacBooks, so this is something that is pretty exciting. I've obviously checked out the MacBook Airs. I have one of the 16-inch MacBook Pros that I used to use when I traveled and left the house, but I am very excited to check this out. This is the two-gigahertz Quad Core 10th gen Intel Core i5 version. It has 16 gigs of ram, 512 gigs of storage, and it also has four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and of course that new updated Magic Keyboard. Ooh, look at you! Look at you! (soft upbeat music) (inhales) There's no smell. There's no smell, are you okay? Wow, this is awesome! This is crazy 'cause I really have never, really, I don't think I've actually held a 13-inch MacBook Pro. This is nice! The 16-inch is incredible for screen real estate, but you do forget how large that thing is in comparison to this little. (gasps) (paper crinkling) This is nice. It shocks me every single time. (paper crinkling) New keyboard. I don't have one to do a comparison to the previous version because this is my first 13-inch MacBook. Wow, it's so light. Let's do a quick setup. See what else is in the box. USB-C cable, like always, for charging, some instructional instructions, and our power brick. Instructional instructions for instructors. - [Computer] MacOS contains a built-in screen reader called Voiceover. To learn how to use Voiceover to set up your Mac, press the escape key. - Shh. Oh my God, I touched the screen. (gasps) So while this is connecting, I'm going to fully max out one of these and see what you guys can get. A 2.3 gigahertz, quad-core, 10th gen, 32 gigs of ram, four terabyte of storage, that will run you 3599. Oh, we're ready. It's still so crazy how light it is in comparison to the 16-inch, 'cause I'm so used to lugging that thing around, but it's great. I also have the latest MacBook Air, as well, if you guys want to see a size comparison next to that. The MacBook Air also comes in gold, so if you are really set on getting a gold MacBook, that's really your only option. They are very, very similar in size. The MacBook Air is slightly thinner. So what is interesting, though, is comparing the 1299 MacBook Air to the 1299 MacBook Pro. Here's the 13-inch. So you're gonna get the eighth gen, 1.4 gigahertz Core i5. Whereas, the MacBook Air you're getting the 1.1 gigahertz quad-core, but with the 10th gen Intel Core i5 processor. So it's interesting looking at those side by side, the MacBook Air, you will get double the storage, a little bit slower processor, but they are very similar. It's crazy because there's so many different options right now that I do realize that it is overwhelming. Then throw the iPad Pro into the mix, now, with that magic keyboard. Again, it just comes down to what your plans are with this device, what is your lifestyle like, and hopefully that'll help make your decision. Looking at these guys side by side, the MacBook Pro does give you way more flexibility if you are doing higher processor intensive things, like doing video editing or production. This has way more upgradeable options than the MacBook Air. So the higher-end 10th gen models do have four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports. Whereas, the lower-end with the eighth gen processors only have two. So that's also something to keep in mind when you are trying to figure out which laptop to get. You can also use the 13-inch 10th gen on a Pro Display XDR. It will support one external 6K display monitor, one external 5K, and up to two external 4K displays. Another comparison I want to do is the lowest-end 16-inch MacBook Pro in comparison to the highest-end base model MacBook Pro 13-inch. So this is the almost fully maxed out 16-inch MacBook Pro, and this thing is, it's a workhorse. So, here's the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Oh my goodness, it's so small! This is insane. Like, is this the right computer? Is this really this much smaller? I mean, that's a significant size difference. I feel like my animal crossing character, when I use the shocked reaction. (dramatic music) I need to clean it because I'm disgusting. So we'll have a nice side by side clean screen comparison. Is there like a MacBook carwash that I could take this thing through? The 16-inch MacBook Pro has a starting price at 2399 with a 2.6 gigahertz, six-core, ninth gen, Intel Core i7 processor with a turbo boost up to 4.5 gigahertz, 16 gigs of ram, 512 gigs of storage, and four Thunderbolt 3 ports. Whereas, the 13-inch is a two gigahertz, quad-core, 10th gen Intel Core i5 with a turbo boost up to 3.8 gigahertz, 16 gigs of Ram, one terabyte of storage, and also four Thunderbolt 3 ports for 1999. So the first thing, obviously, that you're gonna notice is the screen size. The 16-inch is much larger. The trackpad is also way bigger over here on the 16-inch. The keyboard, though, is the new Magic Keyboards, which is great, I'm a huge fan of it. Although, I am one of the few that did like the butterfly keyboard. I had no problems with my keyboard at all. As they did now update back to the Magic Keyboard, I don't really remember what it was like before back with the butterfly keys because I've become quite accustomed to this, and I really like it. Now, I think we should take this back there and plug it into the Pro display just so we can see, just so we can see what it looks like. It's so small! It's just a weird after having the 16-inch MacBook over here. Prepare for the moment we've all been waiting for. It's also great because the Pro display will charge your MacBook, so you don't have to have any extra cables or cords to charge it. But here's the content you guys are really here for. Guess what, we are making another Animal Crossing video. It's been a while. I actually went to Emily's island and she made me these lamps, and then I customized them. And then she sent me this little Pisces lamp. So it works! Looks really good. I mean, it's a $6,000 monitor, so it better look good. This is so light. I love it. That's also a huge factor that you guys need to consider is size. This is so much smaller than that 16-inch, but you are sacrificing some power for portability. (soft upbeat music) I will keep stressing this in every single video that I do. It comes down to what you actually do need and what you're gonna do with this computer. For me, 16-inch MacBook Pro, it is absolutely perfect for everything I need. On the other hand, if this 13-inch MacBook Pro was the computer that I had, I still feel like I would be able to do a solid job of video editing, making my thumbnails, and doing everything that I needed to do to make YouTube videos. So that was just a first look here at the new 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro. I'm definitely excited to test this out more, and I would love to do a side-by-side comparison to all the Macs that I do currently have. So I have the MacBook Air, the 16-inch MacBook, and of course the 13-inch. So if that's something that you guys would be interested in seeing, I would love to do photo and video test, since that's basically what I use it for. Let me know in the comments below. And now, I'm gonna just continue testing this out. So I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye. (soft upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "- Hey, what's going on guys? This is a train. Specifically, the Japanese Scuba Express. - [Austin] Hey Ken. - Yeah? - [Austin] Go underwater? - Haaaaaaaaaaah. - [Austin] Josh is gonna hate this. (laughter) - Last year, one of these trains made international news when they issued an apology for something extremely nefarious. Leaving a station 20 seconds early. And this was a big deal. So, how is being early a bad thing? Because, Japan. But it's also not entirely surprising because the country as a whole is quite known for its punctuality. Even just a minute is considered late by Japanese standards. With 127 million people living in Japan and just short of half of them living in both Greater Tokyo and Greater Osaka alone, urban commuting is a huge part of daily life. As cities get denser and denser, parts of the population start to live farther and farther away, increasing demand for rail transit. It's hardly surprising that trains country-wide average about 16 million rides a day or six billion rides a year. But despite numbers like that, somehow the trains are generally never late. Now think about what this actually means. For the locals, they have a really consistent daily commute. And for us travelers, rail transit is one of the easiest, affordable and most reliable modes of transportation to commute between parts of the city. - [Matt] How often do you go to the city? - Uh, I think this is my 14th time in two years. I kinda lost track. (laughs) the fact that you can open up Google Maps, check specific routes and get exactly where you need to be with down to the minute accuracy is genuinely mind boggling. Especially as a native New Yorker. [Matt] - Yeah, what about the MTA? - (bleep) the MTA. - [Both] Daaaaaaaaaaaamn. - [Ken] There are plenty of factors that play into how Japanese trains move people as efficiently as they do. The Japanese transit industry is made up of various privately owned companies all trying to win the customer over for max profits. It's very similar to the airline industry in that regard. This encourages companies to keep their services in check which of course means well for the consumer. Or, in this case, the commuter. - [Matt] So, if I don't like Company A, I can ride Company B? - [Ken] For the most part. Those trains don't exactly overlap in most of town like some trains will go specific areas. But, generally speaking, if you're going from a huge major point to another major point, you can use multiple train lines to get there if you really wanted to. The train stations also play an important role in keeping trains on time, even though they can be a huge bottleneck. Jammed corridors and crowded platforms cannot only slow those down at the station but all it takes is someone holding the train doors and delaying one train to throw off the entire system. There are marked platforms designed to organize flow and ushers to direct foot traffic to keep people moving as efficiently as possible throughout the station. Fun fact, they even have the fastest transit tap card in the world. (laughs) - [Matt] That was a tongue twister for you. - Di da da da da da da da da da. I hate that I wrote it. (laughs) take Shinjiku Station, for example. It services an average 3.5 million people a day across 10 platforms, 20 tracks operated between multiple train companies and 12 station gates that lead out to over 200 access points from the surrounding streets and buildings, it's crazy. Shinjiku Station is the busiest train station in the world. And a handful of other ones in Tokyo are not that far behind. But, despite that, even at their worst times like peak rush hour, they continue to run without breaking a sweat. A lot of the credit goes to the train conductors. Especially when it comes to the local lines. They go through rigorous amounts of training to the point where driving trains is basically second nature. In practice they even know how fast they're going without looking down at the speedometer. And they're also experts at controlling their speed to make sure that they get from station to station with down to the minute accuracy. They also have a routine cadence of hand signals and checks called point and call that ensures that the train conductor is on procedure while the train is at or in between stations. But perhaps one of the least obvious factors that influence Japan's punctual train systems are the commuters that ride it every day. Yes my friends, countless amounts of resources and training went into building the standards as people know it today. But, now that it's basically ingrained into culture, it's both a blessing and a curse. Anyway guys, thanks for watching this episode of This Is.

    "transcript": "(cheery music) - [TV Announcer] Something that isn't a laptop trying to be a tablet. 'Cause, who wants a fan in their tablet? Or a tablet that's really a phone pretending to be a computer? - Wait, who has a fan in their tablet? - [TV Announcer] And these devices pretending to be a computer. A true desktop experience demands a great keyboard, so we created the Pixel Slate keyboard. - You just said that you didn't wanna have a desktop experience. Built in virus protection, ew. (laughing) Nah, iPhone Xr PPI is 326. (playful music) That sounds like that Missy Elliott song. (\"Work It\" by Missy Elliott) (cheering) - [TV Announcer] Yes, yes, The Rock has come home! (shouting) - Come on Google! - [Female Presenter] When it's charging. - [Male Presenter] Pixel 3 was built with exceptionally beautiful and thoughtful design choices. It feels great to the touch, and light. - They aren't showing they're like not showing the notch, it does both. - [Interviewer] It's both of them? - Yeah they're like hugging, yeek. - [Male Presenter] Just black, clearly white - Not pink? - [Male Presenter] And a new color which is not pink. - No! - [Female Presenter] A 6.3 inch Pixel 3XL. Both of them share the same features, so we designed Pixel 3XL's screen to expand all the way to the upper corners, giving. (laughing) - They're doing a great job of hiding that notch - [Female Presenter] With some extra useful space at the top - man, poor lady. - [Female Presenter] And flexible OLED is the best pixel display ever. (piano music) - [Man] Uh, that notch is there. And it's real. (scratchy piano music) - [Female Presenter] Annie Leibowitz (applause) - Where is the confidence to their tweet? Like, nothing today backed up their tweet. (funky music) So single lens on all of 'em. I mean, I'm excited for the camera either way. (funky music) Show me the pictures! - [Female Presenter] These photos are amazing. They belong on. - Ryan Gosling, that notch is hideous but I'm still excited for this phone. - [Male Presenter] Generations ahead of other smartphones - They better make a beauty gate joke. Please make a beauty gate joke, Google. - [Female Presenter] Are completely untouched. Night sight makes pixel the best - Look, I'm not doubting the Pixel 3 camera, - [Female Presenter] The Pixel 3 and our other Pixels as well - but that doesn't look like an iPhone 10s photo. - [Male Presenter] second camera on the front of the phone - let's see what it does - [Man] It's like Let's drag the exposure wheel all the way down. - [Male Presenter] So we added a second camera on the front that captures 184% more of the scene than iPhone 10S, now you can - 184 more percent than the iPhone 10s? Damn, (shotgun sound) Shots fired. Damn that notch is just staring me in the face. It's not happening. - [Male Presenter] First to get this Google Assistant feature when it rolls out, city by city, this month, next month, what month, next month. - (laughs) C'mon Google! - [Female Presenter] And we're going even further to help you with phone calls - This month, next month, one of these months - [Female Presenter] We have one last thing to show you - One last thing! - [Female Presenter] What if your phone could provide a totally different experience when it's charging? We're excited to introduce the smartest wireless charger ever. The new Pixel Stand. (cheers) - That's the surprise? (clapping) Well, at least there's wireless charging this year. Oh, there's that notch. (laughs) It's just like that face, I can't unsee the face. He looks happy at least, at least it's not a sad notch. (laughing) This actually looks like it was shot on a Pixel, Ooh. - [Male Presenter] The newest members of this year's Made by Google family. - One more thing, one more thing! I think it starts at 899, but yeah, they like, brushed over it. (groans) I had such high hopes. Why would they tweet out? (frustrated groan) Dammit Google, I'm still excited though. I'm a head over to that fresh store. - [Maya] Hi, I'm Maya, and I'm here to introduce you to the new Pixel 3. - [Jason] And I'm Jason, and I'm here also. - No, turn this off!",

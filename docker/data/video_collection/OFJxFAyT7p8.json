    "description": "Sabotage, hired goons, and a landfill in Utah: this is a story about the life, death, and afterlife of Apples most pioneering computer, the Lisa. A major inspiration for the Macintosh, Steve Jobs championed the Lisa, then turned against it. In Lisas Final Act, The Verge unearths a new spin on this tale. We discover the outsider who gave the maligned computer another chancebefore Apple closed the door on the Lisa forever. #trailer #documentary #technology   Premieres Tuesday, May 30th, 2023   Subscribe:  Like The Verge on Facebook:  Follow on Twitter:  Follow on Instagram:  Follow on TikTok:   The Vergecast Podcast:  Decoder with Nilay Patel:   More about our podcasts:   Read More:  Community guidelines:  Wallpapers from The Verge:   Subscribe to The Vergecast on YouTube, new episodes on Wednesday and Friday:",

    "transcript": "(bright upbeat music) - [Narrator] Buried somewhere out here in the mountains, is a story, about a pioneering but doomed computer called the Apple Lisa. - [Former Apple Engineer] We were building a new kind of computer that had never been seen before. - [Narrator] It was Apple's big play to own the future of computing. That is until it flopped. Apple killed the Lisa and went all in on its successor Macintosh. - What I'd like to do now is show you the Macintosh in person. - [Narrator] But the Lisa lived on it was rescued by an outsider who gave it a second chance. - There is a need for a less expensive computer. - [Narrator] And for a while it almost seemed like there were two possible futures for Apple until one day, there wasn't. - We ended up getting an anonymous call at the paper. - It was one of the people from the landfill who said you need to come down and see this. - They were destroying hundreds if not thousands of brand new computers. (Newspaper Printer whirring) And the first people that we ran into, they were hired I guess by Apple to make sure that the disposal took place as quietly as possible. - [Narrator] So what really happened that day? To get answers we went back 40 years. - Get a shovel and started digging. - [Narrator] To find the people who brought Lisa to life. - It was really exciting. This was the new foundation, the new frontier. - [Lisa Fan] Definitely A rockstar vibe. - [Narrator] To figure out why it really flopped. - [Man In Checked Coat] You'd have to feel a little bit vindictive to have that project taken away from you. - Well, there definitely was an element of revenge - [Narrator] And to understand why Apple would bury its own past, literally. - It seemed like the mob had come to town, you know?",

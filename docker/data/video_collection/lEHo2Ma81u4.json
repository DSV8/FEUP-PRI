    "transcript": "- Well, I was excited to see what color of these we got but it looks like we got the most boring one, black with the blue ear tips. These are the Logitech G333 headphones. Okay, these are wired headphones, they're $50 US and they have a couple compelling features that I think would make these really popular. They do come in three colors. We got the black ones with the blue ear tips. We also got a pouch. This is see-through, this is acoustically transparent. You could breathe through this, light goes through it. I'm happy that they have a case of some type. This looks very cheap. The zipper seems fine, but it's just nice to have something so these, you know, these are wired. You don't want them floating around in your bag getting all tied up. Man, who's making wired headphones anymore (laughs). It's actually kinda crazy to see these. And they're being marketed towards gamers for some reason. I guess because wired is lower latency. I think they're just marketing towards gamers because that's something you can do. These are really just for anyone who doesn't want wireless headphones. But sometimes you're on a Zoom call, the call's already started, you need to run and grab some headphones. You can't be putting people on hold and trying to pair stuff. You just want to plug something in that just works and you can depend on this, so that's good. This is a huge selling feature. In the box, with a really annoying tag on it, comes a 3.5 to USB type C adapter dongle. These don't even come with your phone half the time anymore. And this alone is anywhere from about $7 to $14 US value. So for a $50 headphone, that's awesome. All right then, here's our nice Logitech looking shiny bag of extra silicone ear tips. There's two loaded on the buds already. The housing on these earphones is actually aluminum which is pretty cool. They don't seem that cheap or insubstantial for $50. \"Important safety compliance and warranty information.\" Oh yeah, the mediums are a good size for me and my medium head. Good seal. My voice sounds different. It sounds like I'm wearing earplugs. Move my ears and they're pretty good. The cable on here is as a flat cable, which is kinda cool. It's slightly stiffer and the slightly less tangle-y than a conventional kind of Apple round one. I like it. It's pretty long. I'd say that's pretty standard, maybe two and a half, three feet. Dongle gets you an extra, three or four inches. Now, inline controls. There's a built in microphone right here as well as plus minus, I gotta assume that's for volume, and then a center button for play pause or hang up the call, answer the call kind of stuff. That's good too. And that's again an excuse for them to call it gamers. You know, it is a headset. You can plug it in and you can play \"League of Legends\" and you can hear everything and speak to your team. But I mean, you could brand this as executive and you know, \"you get to take meetings\". It's just a headset with a mic. It's not gamer. Ah, whatever. So it's kind of confusing when you're on their website. These were announced back in October, but prior to that in September, a very similar looking earphone from Logitech also called the G333 was released but that's the G333 VR version. It's basically the exact same, although I believe it doesn't have the inline mic and it has a shorter cable and it is the official earphone of the Oculus Quest. So you're supposed to just plug it directly into your headset, which just requires a shorter cable. There's also a second version called the KDA version. or K slash DA. I don't know how to pronounce that branding but it's basically styled over the virtual, K-pop inspired girl group made popular by \"League of Legends\". So if you're into that kind of thing, you can get the KDA version. - [David] Mmm. - And I'm just too old for that. Don't know what that is. Well, I guess there's nothing else to do, but plug 'em in. But before I check out the sound quality, here's a message from our sponsor Redux. Redux is a PC builder striving to bring PC gaming to the masses. You pay the same price as if you built the PC yourself, plus a $75 build fee. That is a flat $75 build fee no matter what PC you're building. Through their online builder, you can select your budget, pick your games, see how they perform and then let Redux build your PC for you. All builds come with a two year warranty. So click the link in the video description and build your PC today. And then plug your gamer earphones in. I mean, it's crazy. You can buy like $20 truly wireless earbuds now. So I don't know, I guess there are people who just want the wire and it may be these sound a lot better than those types of cheapy truly wirelesses, because they do have dual drivers in them. So there actually are two dynamic drivers in each earphone. One driver handles the mids and highs and the other driver handles the bass. So they say it's boomy bass and clear highs and that's what we're gonna evaluate now. That's how you test music, baby, Steely Dan, \"Babylon Sisters\". (soft jazz music) Damn. Let's crank 'em. They go pretty loud, at least on this song, but it's not uncomfortably loud. I can't even hear my own voice right now but I'm not like \"ow\" loud. So I do wanna try a different song. I think the whole \"Californication\" album by Chili Peppers was notoriously loud. They brick walled it, like when they mastered it. I'll try something from that. (upbeat rock music) Not crazy loud, louder than I'd ever use. Some people might want louder than this but this isn't damaging my hearing. And I do agree with their claims of boomy bass. They're definitely pretty bassy. It's not like these are audiophile grade headphones. In that realm, boomy is kind of a bad word and I think these meet that definition as well. The bass is, especially when you turn it up like that, a little muddy. They sound super tight, little boomy, but for the price, these don't suck. When I first plugged them in and I was like, \"Oh, these don't suck.\" I have used more expensive headphones, especially in the truly wireless realm, that are worse than these. So I think they're probably going to be pretty popular. Now what I want to do is try the other aspect of them. I want to do a call. So this is me recording a video on my phone using this in-line microphone as the mic. This is when I'm talking to really close into it. This is a little farther from it. Whoa! Yowzer! I'm loud now! We gotta do \"Toxicity\" today because of that Nigerian wedding meme. Have you guys seen that? - [Crew] No! - Have you seen that full crowd of Nigerians singing \"Toxicity\" by System of a Down at a wedding? (laughter) It's insane. (heavy classic rock music) I just wish you guys could listen to songs with me. Stupid copyright. For rock and roll this might actually be too bassy. I might want to EQ these and take a little bit off. They're not lying about the clear highs though. Serge's voice is pretty clear above the rest of the mix right here. Certainly makes the guitar from metal really thick boom-da-boom-da-boom, like drop D tuning. It's just like that. What I'm interested in to test now is \"W.A.P.\" by Cardi B because I used that in my testing suite for the Apple AirPods Max headphones and I specifically remember how gravelly the bass was with those and they have really over-pronounced bass and they're obviously huge over the ears, so I wanna know how these stack up. (soft techno music) Weak! All right, I'm satisfied. These are actually pretty good. That's the beauty of getting wired headphones still. You don't have to pay for a charging case with batteries. How many batteries are you getting with truly wireless headphones? You're getting a battery in each one of the earphones and in the case itself. You're not paying for any of that crap with these. You're probably not even paying for this dongle. It just comes free 'cause Logitech loves you. These are sweet. I would've got a more fun color than the black ones. Well, maybe I wouldn't have, I don't know, but you can. I think these check all the boxes and achieve everything that Logitech set out to achieve with these. If 50 bucks is your budget, I recommend these. You could even sell the dongle and then you're looking at, you know, you're down to 40 bucks. - [David] Not bad. - Flip this on Facebook. So thanks for watching Short Circuit today, if you liked this video hit like, hit subscribe and watch our other videos where I try headphones and yell at them when they have crappy interfaces. That's another bonus. There's no interface to mess with here, I guess other than these.",

    "transcript": "- We're here at CES 2023 in MSI's booth, and we have 10 laptops to look at, and shockingly, none of them are trash. How did you do it, MSI? First of all, Stealth 14 Studio, which we'll tell you about after this word from our sponsor. - Thanks to Acer for sponsoring this video. They've been working on their Earthion initiative to be as sustainable as they are innovative. So stay to the end of the video to find out more. - This thing is freaking sick. It is so rare that you get 14 inch laptops that are actually good, but this thing has up to a 4070 with a 90 watt TDP. Did I get that right? I did, heck yeah. This also has a 13700H, but the most surprising thing is that it's really well built. This thing has a magnesium chassis, and only weighs 3.7 pounds. Look at this, Andy! It's like, well built. I'm genuinely shocked guys. (he laughs) Sorry, it's not magnesium. They're telling me that it's magnesium aluminum alloy. Very important to get that correct. Also important, how is the keyboard? It's fine. It's what, like maybe an A minus, somewhere around there. You guys can't get everything right, but that said, most of it is very good. This thing also comes with up to a quad HD, 16 by 10 display, that's 240 hertz. That is so awesome on something like this. It is just really impressive that it's a gaming laptop that you can just chuck in your backpack, and just go off and do whatever. What also is impressive is the amount of battery life of this thing. I'm sure it'll die pretty fast given how powerful it is. But if you look at this, it doesn't look all that big. But when you sort of look at it from the side, it is a thick boy. This is, what is this here? 72 watt hours in a laptop of this size is hecking impressive. Also, of course they have a big old vapor chamber here to keep everything cool, and replaceable memory. This stuff goes up to 5,200 mega transfers per second, and that's the fastest that I've ever seen in a gaming laptop that has replaceable memory. Well, until the next one that we see that has 56. Up next is the Stealth 16, and they say that they have vastly improved the speakers on this thing. It's six speakers by Dynaudio, and let's just see how good it is. Can it beat the HP? It better, 'cause it's so much larger, and has two more speakers. (Stealth playing music) So here we are, six speaker Dynaudio seems pretty good. It actually does stage pretty well. Like it gets pretty wide. (music continues) Not bad, not bad. Kinda hard to tell 'cause it's so loud in here, but how does it compare to the HP? (HP playing music) HP is thin and lights better, sorry guys. (he laughs) They look so unimpressed. The absolute best part is now they have to hold it for a prompter. Thank you very much. What's fortunate though, is that if you're not fully satisfied with those speakers though, you're able to pair a second Bluetooth speaker as like rear fill surround. It's actually super cool. So if we play this here, are we allowed to play this? What is this? Okay. It's so weird. 'Cause it does actually process surround, so that's a rear speaker. It's so cool. Like you can see how it's set up here in the software. Like there's laptop, there's the Bose speaker. You can even program in the rear delay. That's a really cool way to use Bluetooth speakers. Oh, does this support Atmos? Nice. Aside from the speakers, this is also just a very good feeling laptop. Again, magnesium aluminum alloy chassis. And let's see how the keyboard is. It once again is aggressively fine. And of course, this thing has all of the power that you need for gaming. Up to a core I9 13700H, and a 4070 with 105 watt TDP. Now I just wanna get really mad at Invidia for a second here. That's sort of like the top end of the 4070, but it can be down to 35 watts. That is just unacceptable guys, why would you do that? Anyway, moving on. (he laughs) Next up is something that I was not expecting to see here, though. This right here is the Raider GE78 HX with their smart touchpad. Look at this. Where is it? Where's the touch pad? I don't see anything. Well, look at that! All of this right here is touchpad area, and they've actually done it in a pretty smart way. So it isn't just a large touch pad, where you're able to have programmable macros here on the right as well. So you can, you know, use your touchpad for actual useful things instead of just turning it off when you're gaming with a dedicated mouse. Very cool. Anyway, we'll look at the normal one. Oh geez, how heavy did you say this thing was? Six and a half pounds? - [Representative] 6.8. - 6.8 pounds of absolute gaming chunk. This right here's the GE78 Raider HX, which is kind of the same as the last one, but without the big touchpad and with a lot more RGB. They're kind of like, oh, it's like retro. Oh wow, that actually does look really cool. I've only seen it from the top. Well, when you look at it there, it's kind of like the ionic five. Of course the specs of this thing are absolutely bonkers. So you get up to a core I9 13980HX, terrible name Intel, excellent CPU. 24 cores in a laptop that go up to 5.6 gigahertz. That is fricking crazy. Not only that, but the memory is replaceable, and it's 5600 mega transfers per second. How the heck did they do that? That's like outside of the sodium standard I think. Of course this has the beefiest mobile GP that you can get. So that's the 4090, that's what, 16 gigabytes of V RAM? - [Representatives] Yes. - And that's 175 watt TDP. The total TDP of this thing is 250 watts. Even though they have the largest battery that you can legally put on a plane, 99 watt hours in here, that's what like, one, two hours battery life, something like that? - [Representative] One and a half. - One and a half, they're saying, yep. - [Representative] Engineering sample. - Oh, oh no, engineering sample, sorry. It's gonna be better later, I'm sure. No, physics said it won't. But what physics does say is that this right here is one heck of a heat sink. Look at all of that copper right there. It's just beautiful. And look at how big these heat sinks are. It goes all the way up there, that's like a whole inch of fins. Also, not only do they have dedicated heat pipes for the CPU and GPU, they even have a heat pipe for your V ram. (he laughs) They've gone so hard on this thing. It's just so pretty. I love that they left it just as copper. Is it painted on the inside? Nope. Wonderful. Absolutely love it. But I know what you all are thinking. 6.8 pounds? That's all that MSI has? No, here we have the Titan, and this one's 7.2. Oh my-- (he laughs) What a ridiculous machine this is. It has cherry MX switches, which actually feel really good. Let's just have a little type-y type here. That's like an easy A, maybe even an A plus. It's about as good as you can get for a keyboard on a laptop because, well, it's mechanical cherry switches. And all that it costs you, is it being this thick. And what's the starting price of this guy? - [Representative] 4299. - 4299! Geez. We should go look at their more budget options. (he laughs) If you're more budget conscious, this right here is what you want. This right here is the Cyborg 15, and it starts at just $1,000. Now that gets you an I5, and a 4050, but that still is pretty good. And even though this whole thing is made out of plastic, well, this right here is aluminum, but that doesn't really count. It feels really good. Like look at this. I'm gonna just push on it here. Even MSI's top laptops of just a couple of years ago, they'd just flop all around like an LG Gram or something. This one right here, not a single problem. And more good news, the keyboard is no better or no worse than their much more expensive Stealth lineup. (he laughs) So A minus maybe, somewhere around there. But I'm still pretty impressed. And sure you don't get anything fancy like a mini LED display, but I don't know, who cares? 1080p, 144 hertz. It's gonna be good enough for most of you, and especially if you only have like a 4050 or a 4060, you're probably not gonna be pushing 4K anyway. I really wanna get this thing into the lab. What's the TDP on the 4060? Oh, they just told me that the TDP on the GPU in this is 45 watts, maybe it won't be all that fast. But 1080p, you could still probably do that. We'll need to get this into our lab. Everybody knows that MSI has heaps of gaming laptops though. What really impressed me here is the way that they've stepped up their game for cre-- Oh my god, this is light! This thing is just 2.2 pounds, which is the same as an LG gram, but shockingly it doesn't feel like a wet noodle. Again, just MSI you made laptops that don't flex all over the place. I'm so impressed. That keyboard's like a solid A. It's not the best I've ever felt, but dang that's light. Also, we have a 1980 by 1200p display that gets up to 400 nets, and what I really appreciate is that they haven't taken the bezels right down to nothing. This is fantastic because I can actually put my hands on it. So many 13 inch devices, it's just kind of like, that. Because they took so much time to make this super small, and the whole device sort of does not benefit from that. Also, the real fantastic thing about this is the battery. Somehow they have fit a 75 watt hour battery into this thing, giving you an actual 15 hours of battery life. This is, this is genuinely good guys. (he chuckles) I'm impressed, I wanna have this for like, a proper run. Not only that, but they give you two thunderbolt fours. It's HDMI 2.1? 2.1 fan-- 2.0? Boo! Alright, nevermind. (representatives laugh) Well, half points for that. Wait. Oh, there's a headphone jack. Jeez, I almost thought they delved us there for a second. Fantastic work guys. And also full size type A, and a micro SD card reader. This is, this is really good. It's the LG Gram that we've been wanting for years that LG just has not made at all. As the cherry on top, this thing gets the 1360P. So that gives you four performance cores, eight efficiency cores, in something this big. Now I'm sure it's not going to have the same level of performance as something like the 13 plus, because well this right here is what you get for cooling. But at the same time, that's a lot better than something like the HP Dragonfly Elite that only gets the U. If you want a slightly larger creator laptop, we have the Prestige 14 Evo, and the CPU in this is very strange. So it's the I7 13620H, weird name, weird CPU. So you get six performance cores and four efficiency cores. So half the efficiency cores of the 13, but I don't know, sure, maybe someone wants that. What you probably do want though, is a 4060. If you go up to the 16 inch, that is what you can get. I'm sure this thing right here, again, okay this one's a little bit more flexible. It's not too bad. It feels like the same key switches. A, A minus, somewhere around there. What's really cool though, look at this. Look at this. So this is the new pen for the Creator Z17. And watch, I can just write something here, because this tip is graphite, but then I can also come over to the laptop, and still write things. They currently don't know how much graphite tips will be when this one runs out, but they did say that there's a plastic one that's also included. So, yeah. I think it should be what, like three bucks? Four bucks for a couple of them? They say it'll last three years, but we can see how much it's worn down just from today, so. (he grunts) There is one fatal flaw of the pen, though. Look at this, this is, it's magnetic. Guess where it clips on. (pen falls) Couldn't go anywhere else guys? Nothing? Anyway, fortunately the rest of it is fantastic. So this has a quad HD display, the 16 by 10 version, and it's 165 hertz. That is so good for something like this. Also, we have a RTX 4070 in here with a 90 watt TDP. Look at this vapor chamber they have for it! Overall though, I'm super impressed. Like they have actual laptops that aren't floppy. It's fantastic. Especially that Prestige 13. 75 watt hour battery! That is is fantastic. I can't wait to get these into the office to properly test them out, and I can't wait to tell you about our sponsor. - Acer!

Get your own Anker SOLIX F3800 HERE:  Its a very impressive machine and we would not have been able to finish the bunker tubes without it!! #ankersolix #LIVEINPOWER #Anker #AnkerSOLIXF3800  I decided to build a bunker in my backyard because ever since I was a little kid - I though it would be fun to hobbit hole a home out from underground. And TODAY ITS HAPPENING! The massive conduit is finished and ready to be put in the ground.   Get my JerryRig Razor knife and GroundX Bunker shirt HERE:   Follow me for updates!

    "transcript": "Welcome back to my backyard bunker project. Today hopefully we're going to take this 12T diameter 40t long tube and sink it 20 ft down. underneath the soil in my backyard. Today's video is sponsored by the Anor solx f3800. Hopefully it can do what they say it can do, otherwise this video is going to be cut very abruptly and it'll be a little bit awkward. The reason I need such a large power station is because these elephant sized tubes are over 100 feet away from my welding outlet, and I need to secure boltable flanges to side of the pipe so it doesn't all collapse when I drop a quarter million pounds worth of dirt on of it. And the Anker Solex F3800 should be able to provide enough juice to get the job done. This power station says it can output 6,000 watts through a 240 volt plug on the side while at the time recharging with solar. I think I'm getting a bit ahead of myself though. Let's get started. About two weeks ago I got some massive helically corrugated storm water runoff pipes delivered to my house. I chose to get two 20 foot sections instead of a single 40 foot section because the two 20 footers more manageable with a large telehandler, and a 40 footer would require a crane, and I'm trying to avoid that to keep things as inexpensive and DIY as possible. So in order for us to join my two halves together to create a single bunker, we need to build a flange. So in order for us to get the two pieces of conduit bolted together, we have to have these flanges. We could have lasered these flanges out of a single sheet and had a perfect circle, but we chose to them out in sections. The lasering is actually surprisingly fast and done through our friends over at Oshkot. I don't remember the exact pricing but I'll put that over here, Because I'm keeping you updated on much this whole project cost me here in 2023. Because we lasered them out in sections instead of a perfect circle to save on material, we now have to weld them into place as perfectly as we can get them. They connect together kind of like those train tracks we used to play with as a kid. The conduit we have outside also is not a perfect circle so there will be some minor adjustments as go along. Each of the four flange units create exact circles with holes all in the same places. We should be able to bolt both halves of the tube together relatively easily once they're lowered the hole. Working inside deep holes underground is pretty scary, but we can talk more about the dangers of later. In order for us to get the flanges on the ends of the bunker, we have to lift it ever so slightly the ground about an inch and a half. The problem with this engine hoist though is that these legs don't allow...like we'd have to lift bunker up to get the legs underneath to lift the bunker up, which makes it rather difficult. So we've taken a piece of structural steel and elongated the crane past the feet, which hopefully us enough leverage to get the tubes one inch off the ground. They're 4,000 pounds. Should be interesting. Since our outlets are all the way over there, we have our Miller Matic 255 hooked up to the Anker F3800, and we'll see if this works. Now we know the welder can be powered by a 240 volt battery. Time to see if a 4,000 pound bunker can be lifted by an engine hoist. All right Tyson, clip her in. Nate, do the honors. Moment of Truth. Do we know enough about physics to make this work? probably not. We got the counterbalance, we have the laws of physics, and we have... Oh! Oh dude! No way! Oh! Oh! What's going on? I don't like that at all! Oh my gosh! It's going up good. It is. you doubted me. Look how bent that is. That's sketchy. The whole reason we're doing this is because this flange sticks out just ever so slightly around edge of the tube and so we have to lift it up to make this centered on the tube. If we were thinking about it beforehand, what we should have done is put wood underneath while the was here and set it down on top of the wood. Would have saved us a lot of time and thought. But hey, this was fun. Learned some physics and got to test the battery. As fun as using our engine hoist was, we decided to rent a telehandler which should be able to do a little easier. What's that story about like, you know, the little engine that could? We got each end of the tubes raised up with a 2x4 underneath and about half the time it took us to the engine hoist. Using the right tool for the job is immensely helpful. Now it's time for the Rings and a lot more welding. As the pipe is sitting on the ground, it kind of flattens itself out by just a few inches, like imperceptibly, which changes it into an oval shape. So in order to get it back circle, we either have to use a large strap across the diameter, or we to lift up on the telehandler to relieve weight that's sitting on the ground. Something we didn't plan for in the beginning, but I think we're getting it all figured out. The storm pipes have a coating on top called trench coat, which gives the pipe a 100 year service underground. In order to weld though, we need bare metal, which means we have to grind off the black stuff so welding machine can get clean penetration. Each of these tubes weigh over 4,000 pounds, as much as a full grown hippo, so we can't move them willy nilly and it's impossible to move them closer to the garage where my 240 volt welding outlet located. Luckily we have the Anker Solex F3800 which has its own welding plug built in and makes moving electricity incredibly easy. Welding is like controlling a consistent short circuit across metal where both the wire and the of metal get liquefied by an electrical arc, melting and fused together. Basically a tiny lightning zaps between the welding machine and the metal and it's incredibly energy intensive. The thicker the metal, the more electrical power is needed. The Anker Solex F3800 can output 6,000 watts through the 240 volt plugs right here. We know that's enough energy to back up portions of a house and it should be robust enough to several days worth of very intense welding. It's nice it can output the 240 volts and the 120 volts at the same time so we can have shop lights at night while the welder is laying beads. And since battery power is super quiet, we can work late into the night. A gas power generator would be far noisier than a battery power station and would definitely my neighbors as we try to get this whole thing buried before the snow falls. The Anor solx f3800 has a lithium iron phosphate battery chemistry which can completely charge and discharge 3,000 times before any noticeable degradation of the overall battery capacity, That's like everydayusage for about 10 years. Battery technology has come a long way. As the name implies, the F3800 has 3.8 kilowatt hours of battery inside and is expandable to 26 hours with expansion batteries. We can double our capacity in about 5 seconds. And personally, my favorite part is that this has the ability to recharge with solar while we are welding. It has two DC solar inputs on the side, each capable of receiving 1,200 watts worth of solar. if have the right combination of panels. I only have about 1,000 wats worth of solar connected but even that makes a huge difference since as the welder is welding, it's pulling energy from the sun first and bypassing the battery entirely. Only pulling energy from the battery when it's needed. If I had a few more solar panels hooked up, we really could weld all day long. Usually we deplete the battery right before lunch, plug it into a wall outlet, let it recharge completely from zero to 100, which is about 2 hours or so, And then get back to welding all afternoon. While this tube can be buried up to 100 feet underground, the weakest part are the lips around each and we have to join two tubes together. The giant pieces of tube are made out of steel, but they've been coated with something called trench coat, which is a protective film and helps the steel last for more than 100 years after it's been buried. While we're welding the flanges onto the end though, the heat from the welder melts through the trench coat, kind of starting it on fire. It doesn't burn indefinitely though, but we will have to re-coat with another waterproof coating after we get it back in the ground. so we don't leave any bare metal That might become a weak point for rust in the future. once it's underground it's a lot harder to work on. Also to make things a bit easier, we are using self-shielded flux core welding wire since it's a better at penetrating dirty metal outdoors, especially in windy conditions. The wire contains the which shields the melting reaction. It's a bit dirtier than using a shielding gas like argon, but at least we don't have to worry about wind blowing away our protection. The flange is made up of one perfect circle around the outside and a structural piece around the inside. which is welded both to the circle and to the tube itself. We are welding around the entire of the circle three times for each one. Now that we've completed did all four flanges on both bunkers, It's safe to say that the ankor solx f3800 has done a fantastic job. Even out here in the cold weather. The kickstarter for this thing ends on November 19th. So if you want a 35% discount you got to do it quick, Because the window is closing. Even at full price though, that thing is a lifesaver. And I do want you to know that the hole for this backyard bunker is going swimmingly. It even kind of looks like a swimming pool. If you have any questions or suggestions leave them down in the comments, and I will see you next week.",

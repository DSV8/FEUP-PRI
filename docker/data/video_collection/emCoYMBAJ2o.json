    "transcript": "Did you know that data is transmitted from a phone to the internet using a specific type of wave through the air? On a lower part of the spectrum we can also transmit data using sound waves so sound waves that we can actually hear. In this example I've got two phones I'm going to send data from this phone to that phone simply by using sound I'll keep quiet for the moment because otherwise it'll interfere with the transmission of the data. This is actually Morse code so I'll press listen I'll stop that otherwise it'll just repeat the message I was able to send the message hello YouTube from this phone to that phone simply by using sound. The same principle applies when sending data through Wi-Fi waves in the air are used to transmit data from your phone as an example to a Wi-Fi access point and then on to the internet.",

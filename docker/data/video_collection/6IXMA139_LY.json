    "transcript": "now despite being a tech YouTuber since the Ottomans ruled Cairo. My only experience with VR so far has been a headset I bought off AliExpress for like 40 bucks which in comparison made the Nintendo Virtual Boy seem like a real advanced piece of non-vomit inducing Tech but today that changes... but first today's video is sponsored by be quiet's super high value Pure Wings 3 fans ... now available in white! So you can add some contrast to a build shower your waifu graphics card and some color coordinated fans or even very topically use it to add some wind effect to your VR Gaming available in both 120 and 140 mil both of which is available in a high-speed finger destroying variant so if you're looking for some high performance fans for a good price check out the b quiet pure wi 3es now available in white using the link down below [Music] now there is a lot to consider when choosing a VR headset do you want a standalone headset or do you want to be umbilical corded to a system and if so which platform do you want it to work with and should you get the vibrating Cod piece actually the answer to that question is really straightforward it's 100% yes but then aside from stuff like that there's also price point because if you're the heir to a sugar Fortune it's a lot easier to decide in fact it's the easiest to decide if you have no sense of value for money then you should just get the apple one but after ages trying to decide I ended up going with what most reviewers seem to consider a very good first mid-range VR headset although straight off the bat there's a pretty big problem with it wait I have to give this guy money to get one which unfortunately meant I was chundering before even trying the headset now the main alternative I was considering was the psvr2 which on paper seems very promising but it's not compatible with PC and once they release the little doohickey that makes it compatible with PC you're going to lose like most of its functionality and that combined with the fact that the one game I want to try with the psvr2 isn't compatible with the only reason I wanted to try VR in the first place okay well there are the little bits of plastic that you interact with virtual things using they kind of feel like chomecast remotes and then you get some charging [Applause] [Music] accessories now on the little graphic they do show glasses compatibility although I can see close to me so maybe I don't need glasses for this headset oh here's the supposedly terrible stock strap I've heard so much about but I'm a big boy I can make up my own mind about it wo this there's so many sensors on it Facebook can peer deep into my soul using this thing now in terms of specs the quest 3 has quite a lot going for it with relatively high resolution displays good Optics in front of those displays and with its high refresh rate options and reasonable field of view it should give a pretty good firsttime VR experience for a noob like me and aside from the games that it can run on its own Hardware it should also work pretty well for PC VR although the moment I tried to fire it up I ran into a bit of of an issue now the QR code immediately worries me because as far as I understand it you need a Facebook account to use one of these and because I'm not 72 years old I don't have Facebook so I'm going to probably have to make an account for it meta Quest app and we've got three stars it's a good start but luckily I could set up a meta account without using Facebook so all that was left between me and some VR action was passive aggressively setting up a meta account but before I could try out the headset it took surprisingly long to adjust it to a point where it didn't feel like a face hugger savaging me oh it's very loose oh but it's so wait a minute oh the combination of glasses and long hair is a nightmare for this oh like that I do actually need my glasses in here wow being blind is really inconvenient okay so I've spent a bunch of time playing around with various settings and my main takeaway here is you're really boned if F glasses we okay so now I can see an absurdly grainy image of my surroundings it looks like I'm looking at the world around me through a phone from 2005 but then after completing the setup process I was real impressed by my first impressions W it's so it's so not HD feel like my eyes aren't very happy with What's Happening Here W you can really see like the render quality change oh there's a mirror and I have legs Now the default avat when you didn't make your own is terrifying so I decided to try a game to take my mind off my weird blank [Music] Avatar oh God BL them oh that's a bomb oh yeah no blueberry is safe I guess this is like loser beat saber well the graphics are pretty terrible but I guess it's a phone game from 28 years ago so that makes sense let me take this off oh so it's been all of what 5 minutes and I already feel like I've been railed by a display like the Fidelity is so much lower than I was expecting but the thing is I I guess that it makes sense for something like the meta Quest because it's running the games on Hardware in the headset right and it's a very high resolution so it's not going to be able to make wow that building looks like a penis uh so I guess now I need to figure out how to plug it into a PC so that we can get some real Hardware behind it hopefully this bad boys enough and this Beast will be powering the whole reason I'm trying VR now after all these years Sim racing after I did my video on this insane track racer cockpit with mosa gear in it a video which you should check out I'll have it linked down below if you haven't seen it yet the moment I sat in this insane rig I knew that this very Tac sty experience was theoretically a match made in heaven for VR and now that I've added a manual gear shifter there's even more metal to grab onto and some keyboard stand action now this is the real reason I wanted to try VR honestly I'm not particularly bothered with any of the other uses for it because this is the one that makes the most sense to me because you've got physical inputs that correlate very accurately with what's happening in game you even have force feedback that makes you feel what the car is doing so in my mind it should be a lot more convincing than pretending a plastic controller is an AK-47 or whatever let's pop on the headset and see how hard aeto Corsa is to get running in VR not easy apparently there were a bunch of steps most of which involved just getting the quest three to associate with steam but once we were done with the setup process I was really excited oh oh there's a steering wheel that's a bit weird because I can see the gear lever on my right hand side but you like lean down down and it's it's left here I need a less stupid cable oh that's very exciting oh oh this is this is very very cool the graphics aren't amazing it is a very old game though so it does make sense I should have chosen a much easier track but I like look down in this car to the right and I hear car I feel car there's gears happening even though the gear lever is on the wrong side it does feel still like I'm wearing scuba gear but I could reasonably be wearing a helmet so that when crashing happens I don't die I feel like the game could have better graphics like it's clearly a virtual world that I'm driving in but I mean you look down and there's a little bit of dirt on the glass in front of the speedometer but I mean that's the really cool thing about it right is you're like looking at the switches on the dashboard and there's what looks like fuses over there that you can actually examine the inside of this spectacular vehicle because you've got depth perception you have a much better sense of speed than you have with just a flat display it's not the highest resolution stuff that's happening here but I'm going to have to to play around with settings and see if I can get it better that first impression got me really excited but it was clear there were a bunch of issues I needed to fix for me to be happy with the experience problem number one and the first thing I wanted to solve was the head strap this stock strap is as bad as people say especially when you have glasses it's really difficult to get this anywhere near to being comfortable now the first replacement I tried was this razor one which cost about $1 Canadian dollars and the reason I wanted to try this one first was because the back of the strap seemed quite low profile for like sitting back in a chair and stuff but this strap also sucks I don't know how Razer can think this is worth $100 uh maybe it's due to the shape of my head or something but I can't get this to sit anywhere near comfortably and then it it just feels very similar to this strap but luckily after a couple of days my local Best Buy managed to find one of these Elite straps and this is a huge improvement over the stock strap and that terrible razor strap which actually costs the same amount as this one uh now I I don't know why meta doesn't just ship the quest 3 with the strap because it makes a huge difference to the user experience you can just slip it on and then it's got this ratchet in the back which you can use to adjust the fit and then it just sits well even with glasses on but that brings me to problem number two glasses turn a VR headset into an Iron Maiden esque torture device device me take this off oh and the extent of the torture depends on the glasses you're wearing this pair for example seems to fit okay in the quest 3 but the pair that I have on now has a slightly higher frame and it just doesn't fit at all in the headset luckily there is a solution which again unfortunately costs money but you can buy some of these zeni lenses which takes your prescription and then they're just like magnetic clip-on lenses which fit onto the headset and then you don't have to deal with a cumbersome frame in the headset oh on a quick side note use an app to measure your ipd so that you can set it correctly in the headset that helped quite a bit problem number three Quest link connectivity issues now initially I could use this random Quest Link cable to connect to the PC fine I wasn't really having any issues with it but I was having a bunch of other issues with my sim racing PC so I decided to reinstall Windows on that system after which Quest link completely broke down at least via a cable I ended up Buy in like three different cables none of which The Meta app on my PC would even recognize I then tried it on a completely different system which gave me the same problem how is it still not working after days of struggling it turns out I had to factory reset the meta Quest 3 cuz for some reason the USB connectivity on it just broke airlink was still fine but if you wanted to plug it in VI cable it just refused to work but after I did the factory reset everything was fine in fact generally the quest 3 seems to be quite finicky about connecting to a PC and there's often a whole bunch of issues you have to deal with it's quite an annoying process to be honest and I think it just shows that if your main use case is going to be to connect to your PC you probably shouldn't get a quest and the final arguably biggest problem I had was just getting VR content to not look like bot cheeks and that's even putting aside the metaverse that looks like it was rendered at 240p and stretched onto the display I was even struggling with pcvr ah there's like a visual artifact that like kills it for me I like can't look past it take a setto Corsa for example I had to massively upscale that game over the native resolution of the meta Quest 3 for me to get a clear non pixelated view of the track around you even at the lower settings the interior was nice sharp and detailed but everything outside of the car would have that same metaverse and then once I finally found aggressive enough upscaling settings for the outside to be as sharp as the interior you immediately notice that none of the textures are designed with that super high resolution in mind which makes sense aeto Corsa is quite an old game but it wasn't just aeto Corsa dirt rally 2 Auto mutab I think is how you pronounce that and the problem with the newer games is that because the games are more demanding you don't really have performance Headroom to run it at like 8K over sampled or whatever and aside from the jaggies there were other visual issues like distracting motion rendering and struggles with contrast it doesn't deal with shade very well the visuals fall apart pretty hard when it's dark like with big contrast jumps it doesn't like it in fact it's been two weeks of me doing quite a lot of VR Gaming not just Sim racing and the only game or general use case to be honest that really blew me away visually was halflife Alex oh that's real HD see the this is this is looking way better oh hand it doesn't have that weird like Haze artifact in the distance oh damn there's some like math on the window there very exciting okay so I can add to the math there we go and then and because of how detailed those environments were I just spent ages examining them there's some serious XLR looking connectors on that can I throw it at the pigeon yes I can but I just need to throw better oh that was a pretty good throw this is the first thing I've interacted with in the last like day and a half that hasn't been wildly disappointing every other game looked in some varying degree like it wasn't rendered in the correct resolution and that feeling would be exacerbated when I take off the headset and look at my 27in 4K display everything would be so much sharper and there wouldn't be just huge amounts of jaggies on everything like there was in most most games on the quest 3 and this is something that I've never really heard other people complain about much when they're doing VR videos so yeah maybe I just had way too high an expectation coming into it but yeah I was kind of disappointed by how most content looked on it so in conclusion my first experience with VR was both really exciting and pretty disappointing the fact that you can be dropped in the middle of your favorite game with actual depth perception is really cool fighting a group be monster around to circuit and dirt rally 2 in this amazing racing Sim is just that much more immersive in VR it's an awesome experience but despite meta spending billions of dollars on Research a year I can't help but feel like the tech is still in its infancy now maybe that's a me issue maybe it's a quest 3 issue I'm not sure but uh yeah which brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching if you enjoyed the video subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one and until the next one bye-bye [Music]",

    "transcript": "choosing the right laptop can be a bit challenging sometimes because there are millions of options out there with various specs and hardware designs you might be looking for a thin and light notebook with the best battery life and portability or you might be looking for something that offers a good balance between portability and performance or you might be looking for the absolute best both of the walls to have a laptop where performance is key plus a bigger display because size matters so we've teamed up with razer to bring you a quick overview of some of the most popular type of laptops out there and all the products that we're gonna be showcasing in this video will be linked in the description down below so do think of this as a notebook buying guide but based on our own personal experiences now we've been using Razer laptops for the majority of our production workflow but you can take our guidelines and apply them to any other notebook manufacturer now I do want to preface something very important and that is there's no such thing as a perfect laptop in fact the notebooks that we use aren't perfect either but they happen to fit our workflow and they get the job done really well so I think it's important for you guys to find what fits your criteria and what would work now everyone that you're gonna be seeing this video have moved beyond the need of using a basic laptop in fact the double market has shifted tremendously over the past few years I mean we've moved away from fakey bulky designs to Apple like thinner designs with powerful Hardware packed in and the result of that is that you don't have to sacrifice form over function and function over form to me I think the best thing that has ever happened to the notebook space is the introduction of Nvidia's max to GPUs the performance that you can get out of these mobile graphics card is just amazing I'm not gonna be focusing on entry-level notebooks in this video because I feel like that is a separate category by itself and yes I do understand that they do exist and offer some sort of basic functionality but what if you're looking for something beyond that well let's start things off with Finan lights spoiler alerts miniaturization costs money and the reason I say that is because the smaller the notebook gets and when you pack that with efficient and powerful Hardware packed with great design and build quality you're gonna be paying a lot of money for that now infinite line notebooks are tailored towards people who value battery life and portability say for instance if you're a student who has 8 a.m. classes ending all the way till 6 p.m. you need something that lasts you all day long or if you're a business professional hopping from one meaning to the next you need something that will actually take you through those meetings without having to rely on a power break a lot of notebook manufacturers are leaning towards Portland assigns meaning that they only come with a few USB type-c ports which again may or may not be a huge deal breaker for some of you out there but if you're someone who is looking to connect different external accessories that can be a limitation and there are other Ultrabook options offering a really good selection of i/o for its smaller form factor I should also mention that the inclusion of CNC unibody frames is a big deal here since it allows for super thin and light frame designs without impacting build quality display is also another thing that you need to watch out when you're shopping for a thin unlike notebook I would highly recommend moving away from 4k on a 13-inch notebook because it just doesn't make any sense plus it requires a lot of horsepower to drive that 4k resolution and it can impact by your life so the best option is to opt for a 1080p display and you should be set the last thing that I want to touch base on is performance now in this area you want to be looking for a you serious processor from either AMD or Intel which means ultra-low voltage or G Series for Intel's I select line up if you're looking for lower power consumption and enhanced multimedia features now if you want even more performance for instance a little boost for gaming or rendering based applications there are options independent like space for a discreet graphics card keep in mind that the thin light segments range between 13 inches and 17 inches but that really depends on how big of a screen you really need now there is a performance cap within unlike notebooks it's just a fact so if you're looking for something with a little bit more horsepower than then you'll need to step it up to a slightly larger form factor and the good thing is that you don't have to sacrifice the portability factor to a certain extent because these days with technological advancements from both Intel and AMD on the CPU side and AMD and NVIDIA on the GPU side you can still maintain that portability aspect while achieving close to desktop level performance a good example of that is a new blade 15 it packs a coarse 16 threads and an r/t supermax cube graphics card the thing is when you get into mid sized notebooks it opens a wide category when it comes to pricing for these size laptops so you can pick them up from $1,000 all the way up to $4,000 which can get really really expensive so it's important for you to figure out your budget that should be your number one priority and then find what your needs are and then slowly start narrowing down from that so for instance if you're a gamer you should probably look into a high refresh rate display with a low resolution so that your games can hit those higher frame rates given the hardware can actually support that I know if you're a creator on the other hand you can look into sacrificing that refresh rate but for a more color accurate display I think that's probably the best way to look at it now do keep in mind that OLED panels do tend to get a little bit more expensive so it's best that you might be better off with an IPS display offering you a great color spectrum or a color coverage when it comes to DCI p3 or srgb another nice thing about these larger form factor laptops is that you get more connectivity so you want to make sure that the i/o is up to spec with today's standards for example make sure that the USB ports are 3.2 gen 2 storage is also an important factor for both gamers and creators and I think the million dollar question that needs to be answered here is are you willing to store all of your files locally or are you willing to rely on external storage solutions now I'll give you a perfect example I use DaVinci Resolve to edit all our videos and DaVinci project files take a lot of storage especially when I'm working with 4k footage so external storage seems to be the right choice for me personally so I don't really need a lot of local storage so I'm perfectly fine with maybe 512 gigabytes of storage heck I would even be fine with 256 gigabytes of local storage but if you're a gamer that can be an interesting conversation because modern games these days especially Red Dead Redemption 2 can easily eat up a hundred 50 gigabytes in no time so I would recommend 512 gigabytes of storage or if you're willing to spend a little bit more a terabyte of storage would be great because you can load it with your most favorite titles and basically keep those games wherever you go without having to rely on an external storage now I do want to leave on this note as the capabilities Abhiyan notebook increases the amount of storage you would would also increase so that's something to certainly keep in mind when you're shopping for a 15 inch notebook larger notebooks are typically upgrade friendly as well meaning you can swap out the memory kit or upgrade the storage to a higher capacity and if you're interested in a step-by-step guide you can check out our video right over here so overall you do get a lot of capabilities with a 15 inch notebook but you also do tend to sacrifice on a few key areas like performance and cooling and if you're willing to go a little bit beyond that and willing to sacrifice on a little bit of portability that's where a 17 inch notebook comes into play now everything that I mentioned in the 15 inch form factor can be applied to this segment but do keep in mind that these larger form factor notebooks do come with slightly higher costs they also usually tend to have better connectivity and better cooling resulting in more consistent and higher CPU and GPU clock speeds while smaller notebooks can be considered as complimentary to desktop systems a 17 inch notebook can be considered as a desktop replacement another thing you want to look into is display options for a 17 inch notebook and you might want to look for a 4k option because 17 inches and 4k make a lot more sense because scaling works a lot better in that form factor I don't think you'll ever go wrong with an option so that's something to keep in mind so now that we've gone through some general guidelines for notebook buyers let's go through some of the laptops that Mike myself and Dmitri have been using for a while now so I'm first up here and you might be wondering why do you have this old dell Vostro 1/3 to 0 from you what because it sort of talks towards the kind of consumer that I am for notebooks every single one of my notebooks I've bought myself and they've all been about the same size so this is a 13 inch Dell Vostro and then from that I went on to this which is the voz it's a 13 inch notebook as well this thing was absolutely legendary so what did I go to after that well it's a 14 inch notebook and that is the ThinkPad x1 carbon 8th gen Intel processor inside so this was my last one before moving on and I think what I wanted to show you guys also is what I moved on to and that is the Razer Blade stealth 13 and there's a there's a reason behind that and there's also a reason why I've notebooks that are all the same size about and that's because I do a lot of traveling but I also have higher end computers here at home that I can do gaming and higher-level work on but for me the 13 inch form factor of this and the 14 inch of some of the other notebooks are absolutely perfect to shove into my backpack and not only that this might sound absolutely crazy but it's just to fit on the trade tables of planes and there's actually a reason why I wanted to bring up the stealth 13 in this and it's because it's a good representation of where the thin and light notebook market is headed and it's also why I switched to it from the ThinkPad x1 carbon is because this one has a discrete GPU and a gtx 1650 to be more accurate and for me that was really critical for two reasons first of all i'm designing our new office and you guys might not have known this but i was an architect before moving over into full time hardware canucks and I've been using AutoCAD and AutoCAD the acceleration from the GPU and this really helps me move things around and a more fluid pace and especially with copying pasting and going into 3d right now using Sketchup for 3d and that discrete GPU brings things to the next level and not only that I'm the kind of guy who when I'm on the plane or when I'm just sitting on the couch I like to play pretty basic games by today's standards look I know that a larger device like a 15 inch notebook would probably get me a lot more power get me into some higher level gaming but I just don't need it I'm totally okay with a 13 inch notebook right now with long battery life a discrete GPU and it just fits my lifestyle perfectly because I can come home I can game wherever I want to at home and maybe even if I'm cooking I could bring this with me on the counter so that's pretty much why I am in this 13-inch form factor and I'm sure it's gonna appeal to a lot of people from students to even gamers who have more powerful systems at home like me my experience with notebooks has been an interesting journey over the past 10 years in fact I've come to value three main factors when it comes to choosing a notebook for myself and that's performance portability and design and the Razer Blade 15 hits all those factors really well to be perfectly honest with you I didn't choose this laptop Razer did sample this as a review unit and over time using this on a regular basis I've come to realize this notebook has played a vital role in my production workflow basically 95% of the videos that you've watched on this channel from my end for the last year or so have been edited and rendered on this laptop ever since my switch to da Vinci result studio I've been very impressed with the blade 15s performance and resolves utilization with all of that hardware the model that I have features an RT x 28 Emacs Q and that really helps accelerate export times and when you pair that with Intel 6 core 1230 CPU it's really a breeze when it comes to editing 4k footage making thumbnails using Photoshop and about all of that I really love the design of the blade 15 I also really love this huge glass trackpad with support for windows position drivers and when you pair that with a really fast 240 Hertz display that's also really color accurate for content creation the experience is fast and fluid especially when you're switching between virtual desktops it's honestly a breeze the last thing that I want to touch base on is portability because I carry VP design everyday 20 liter backpack and this thing can pack literally everything that I use for video production including my camera my lenses microphone cables my portable lights but most importantly it can fit this blade 15 advanced without a problem and that to me is a huge bonus because when I'm visiting family in Toronto I can carry all of this horsepower with me on the go play my favorite racing games hop into a multiplayer session with my brother playing cs:go or overwatch this laptop doesn't compromise in all of those areas and that's something that I love about the Blade 15 advance if one year ago we decided to do this video I would not be rooting for the 17 inch form factor but yet here we are I never work from a coffee shop outside of the studio so the purpose of any notebook for me is to be as powerful as possible and also be able to do this that is right it must fit into my backpack so when I do work remotely transportation is not an issue I'm so happy that we're beyond the absolutely thick and massive 17 inch notebooks but with exercise come all the benefits so the screen for example on my 17 inch blade Pro is much bigger that usually means higher resolution so for case scaling on Windows is palatable whereas 4k on the 15 inch notebook is just a joke if only window scaling worked as good as it does on Mac OS then 4k on the 15 inch form factor wouldn't be an issue but it is I actually get more screen real estate with my 4k 17 inch form factor even with high scaling than a 1080p screen on the 15 inch notebook a thicker body also means extra ports it's kind of sad though that we have to upsize in a notebook space to get an SD card reader but usually there are more ports on 17-inch notebooks because of the additional space so with this notebook I have an Ethernet port full size HDMI an additional type see that I do not have with my blade 15 but even more to come back to my original point about having the best performance this is by far the most powerful notebook I've used in terms of clocks and cooling my GPU for example boosts to 1700 megahertz which is about 300 megahertz higher than what I was getting with my blade 15 the CPU is cooler and the fans are quieter we have more space there for bigger cooling solution that your heat sinks more fans it all makes sense I have no regrets ditching the 15 inch at all this is my studio machine when I'm away from the studio back to you boys so I hope you were able to take something away from this video thank you so much for watching again stay safe spend responsibly my friends and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

    "transcript": "hey would you look at that I bought some ryzen 7000 stuff because I felt like starting a house fire and bankrupting myself but that's not really the point of today's video uh the reason I got it is because this actually has an eye GPU in it which AMD is quite Coy about they didn't really mention it much and I think it's because it's not very well endowed it's only got two GPU cores that's one less than a 200 GE which doesn't mean a whole lot but still so in today's video we're going to compare an old three to a new two and then we're gonna try and game with it at a very reasonable resolution thank you I love that they feel it's necessary to say that there's no cooler in the Box um yeah I'd kind of hope there isn't a cooler in here AMD whoa wow that is a very fancy looking cheapest motherboard I could find for the platform no wonder it costs like three million dollars but moving on we finally get an LGA socket on an AMD platform which means no more is savaging the CPU out of the socket every time you take the cooler off ah see every time which as an incompetent person I find very exciting well it doesn't is this the same size as am4 it does actually feel like it it's about the same size uh the heat spreader is a bit smaller although this has a lot more heft to it this is quite a weighty CPU actually but look at the back that gets me real hot and bothered okay it's finally time for my first ever am5 CPU socketing some yummy ddr5 in terms of cooler for the supposed very cool running ryzen 7000 series I'm using this new deepcool ak-620 dark zero which is just like a stealth-dout version of the ak-620 but before we fire up this 7600x to see how the igpu stacks up we do need a point of comparison for it some real loser Apu to make the igpu in there look good or really bad we'll see how it goes foreign that the 200 GE can easily be cooled by a gentle Summer Breeze we don't need to worry too much about cooling so I'm just going to use this AMD wraith cooler which even this is kind of overkill for it but I had it lying around so let's use it power supply wise I'm using the very reasonable c1000 that NZXT sent over because everybody knows apus are very power hungry especially athlons a few moments later okay that's a bit annoying the Athlon 200 GE isn't compatible with this specific x570 board for some reason so I'm gonna have to change out the motherboard squeaky okay so I just gotta jump start it like I'm stealing a car it works that was really irritating but at least it works good good good oh I actually forgot about the old AMD Apu working super hard bug we've got 65 000 GPU utilization which just shows how serious this little Vega 3 is uh now we're currently running a 1080p normal settings so it's like the lowest for GTA 5. and wow it's actually kind of running better than I remember it running like getting about 30 frames per second at 1080p with a 200 GE is quite impressive I'm not gonna lie uh I I think the least impressive thing about this whole situation is that the CPU utilization is almost a hundred percent that poor little dual core Athlon is really struggling to keep up with its eye GPU but with us just using the igpu it's actually not that bad it's quite impressive CS go is running similarly a 1080p low settings as uh GTA 5 was but for CS go it's it's much less acceptable having said that though usually at this kind of frame rate you get really terrible input lag whereas here you know it doesn't feel too bad yeah there's not a whole lot to say about this cyberpunk performance moving on now that we've gotten a bit of a sense of the power of the Athlon 200 GE I think it's time to swap over to the CPU we're all here for and see how that igpu handles gaming foreign hot but damn that is crazy depending on what those numbers are we are about what 90 million degrees over the temperature of the surface of the sun it's not good no way that's actually quite a bit better than I was expecting we're what about like 15 frames per second faster than the Athlon 200 ge now that I've said it that doesn't sound that impressive but still you can play some GTA 5 at 1080p low settings and it it runs fine considering that the CPU is not having to do much the temperatures aren't that bad either you know we're sitting at about 50-ish degrees Celsius which is a whole lot lower than the igpu's temperature it's quite impressive how they thermally isolated to from each other that well not only are we getting about between 70 and 90 frames per second it feels really good like this input lag is crazy good it's it's way better than like a gt710 for example which again isn't the most impressive Victory now you can see that it's got quite a high core frequency compared to the 200 GE also we are using ddr5 in this system as opposed to ddr4 with the 200 GE so this igpu does have quite a lot more memory bandwidth available to it this is getting me pretty excited for dedicated apus of this generation um okay I guess that's a big improvement over the 200 GE we have what looks kind of remotely like movement uh but you know what they say the human eye can't really see over three frames per second anyway which means I think we have more than enough Headroom for some pretty serious 4K gaming on this igpu who knows maybe even with cyberpunk let's give it a try but first we need to unbox a monitor worthy of this kind of power wow that is a lot of keywords look at all of that yeah thanks Corsair for sending over the awesome zenion 32 uhd-144 in the Lost Ark crate nice oh that's a big boy and it's being driven by the perfect GPU a ryzen 7000 I GPU now our first problem is that the HDMI port on this motherboard only supports 4K up to 60 hertz now I don't know if that's due to the igpu or the motherboard I don't know where the limitation lies but either way we're gonna have to game in 60 hertz like some kind of animal which honestly really isn't a problem considering that we're probably not going to get anywhere near to 60 frames per second and 4K with this igpu it's like the lamest complaint ever wow 14 frames per second a frame rate I see suspiciously often on the channel at this point it doesn't even feel that bad anymore you know I've kind of gotten used to the 14 frame per second life it's kind of usable I guess now CS go at 4K low settings gives us a pretty cinematic frame rate actually I wouldn't call it playable because at this resolution it does introduce a lot more input lag than was present at 1080p now it's not going very well in terms of Battlefield 5. foreign as I die in slow motion there but I don't think this is the worst I've seen Battlefield 5 run what I find interesting is uh we have 32 gigs of ddr5 in this system and as far as I know technically 16 of it is allocated to the igpu if it did want to use it but it's still topping out at just about 500 Megs of memory usage wait that's actually running about the same if not a little bit better than Battlefield 5 which is interesting again not even almost the worst cyberpunk gaming experience I've seen now I am very curious to try Fidelity FX on an igpu so let's set it to balanced and see if it helps um not very much at all okay let's take it to like Ultra performance wow look at that Ultra performance has pretty much doubled the frame rate each frame does look a little bit like it's being drawn with an Etch A Sketch there there is a a very interesting aesthetic to to the image it's very blurry yes but that's not really the thing that stands out to me it looks pretty weird actually that's crazy the final thing I want to do with cyberpunk is it does have a steam deck quality preset and I'm interested to see what that does with the little igb whoa okay the steam deck is clearly a complete monster because with the steam deck preset we're just getting two frames per second I don't know what's worse the two frames per second or the extremely heavily handed motion blur usage it always blows my mind how well Half-Life 2 runs on everything because at 4K pretty good looking game and one of the reasons why Half-Life 2 is the game from this era that I always use for these kind of tests is because it just scales so well with resolution like at this point it's very predictable like Half-Life 2 is gonna run on these systems which I find quite funny actually every time because when this came out like in 2004 Half-Life 2 was considered a very demanding game but in modern terms pretty much anything can run the game now and that's it's quite cool so what did we learn in today's video well apparently a brand new CPU with hundreds of dollars worth of platform around it is faster than a CPU from 2018 that cost 55 new and on that very useful note it brings me to the end of the video If you enjoyed it consider subscribing and maybe watching another video suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye-bye foreign",

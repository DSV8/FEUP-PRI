    "transcript": "- [Michael] My name is Michael Fisher. I'm a writer, sailor, podcaster, and recovering actor who's childhood obsession with science fiction never quite faded. 25 years later, the technology that I coveted as a kid, is woven into the fabric of every day life. I've spent the past four years reviewing this technology, and now I've teamed up with Mobile Nations to take those reviews to the next level. This is Mr. Mobile. What am I gonna cover here? These days, a lot of folks are saying that smart phones are over. They're boring, but I never got that memo. Yeah, they're a commodity now. Everyone has one, but that means more people depend on them than ever before. Smart phones are the centerpiece, the heart of the mobile lifestyle. To me, that makes reviewing them more exciting not less. I'll also be looking at the tablets, wearables, and accessories that surround those phones. They're more dynamic because they're still adapting. Some tablets have morphed into convertibles to do battle with the laptop. While smart watches are now fighting with fitness bands for space on your wrist. Every year, hundreds of peripherals hit the scene to charge, store and protect those devices. Remember, technology isn't just stuff you can carry. Today, virtual reality and augmented reality are finally worth using. I'll show you what that's like. Electric cars are right on the brink of becoming affordable to the masses. Right on the cusp of changing the world. You'll be the co-pilot on every test drive. I let go of that. Oh yeah! That's launch mode. The further we dive into the future. The more fun it is to look back at the past. We'll reminisce about those landmark gadgets that shaped our present. Through it all, the focus will stay on mobility. The technology that let's you live your life where I think it's most interesting, outside of the office, beyond the living room. I'm not a travel blogger, but if one of those cruise ships with a robot bartender pulls up to a Boston pier, I'm gonna be on it, and you better believe you're coming with me. This is Mr. Mobile. I'm Michael Fisher and I'm glad you're here. Let's go see what's new. (electronic music)",

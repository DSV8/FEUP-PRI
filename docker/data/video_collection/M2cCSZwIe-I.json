    "transcript": "for today's video I decided to head on to Craigslist for the first time in a while to check in on my local Cesspool but first today's video is sponsored by Micro Center which is not only the best retailer for all things PC Hardware related but they're also offering a coupon for new customers to get a creality ender 3 S1 3D printer for only $149 Micro Center is also opening a new store in Charlotte which is somewhere in North America and if you go there in person you can get a free 128 gig flash drive but they're also launching Micro Center news Micro Center news is all the Micro Center you love but with the news check out these offers using the link in the video description the moment I went on to my local Craigslist I immediately realized why I never go PC shopping on my local Craigslist people are crazy thinking they can get thousands of dollars for 15-year-old systems just because it says workstation in the name one of them did tickle me though someone listed the trash can Mac Pro that I looked at in a recent video as a gaming system so that was pretty good but after spending ages waiting through the ocean of delusional listings I made a realization I don't think there aren't deals to be had in the local area I think there's just a bunch of real sweaty deal Hunters that snatch up all of the good listings the moment that they go up I think if you want a good deal you have to be real Vigilant because anything that's been up for more than like an hour and a half just is trash because nobody's bought it yet but as a very lazy person let's see what I was able to scr up from my local Craigslist in 2024 and after going on Craigslist maybe two or three times in 24 hours I ended up with this system which aside from having a Corsair case that clearly dates it it had some ominous signs of a potential tumultuous upbringing oh this has a Canada computer sticker on it which means maybe it was a pre-built or they built it for the person that should be interesting okay yeah so you can undo them by hand if you use the power and grip of a Greek Mountain God that's not an ideal design to be honest oh um now through the smoked acrylic it did look well put together but there are some weird choices in here oh it smells weird in here okay so I've had a bit of a look around and I guess they kind of didn't have a choice but to use these fan headers and RGB headers for the fans on the the AIO radiator uh but still that does look kind of Bot cheeks going on here I think I'm going to have to take the radiator out to see to what extent I can judge whoever built this PC uh but I'll do that after we test it now when it comes to the specs of our Craigslist system CPU wise we've got a ryzen 7 2700x in it which has been dropped in what looks like a gigabyte b450m DS3 motherboard which is a very McDonald's dollar menu motherboard but it gets the job done I think it was quite popular when it came out when it was kind of in production and then the graphics card is some gigabyte variant of the RTX 2060 super a graphics Cod that as far as I remember holds up pretty well for 1080p gaming but we will see later in the video uh we also get 16 gigs of RAM a bunch of storage it's also got a CX 650 power supply in it which is power supply and we get an aiio ooh fancy now I got all this system for $850 Canadian dollar off of craist which feels like quite a lot to me uh now there did seem to be some slightly better deals when it comes to higher in systems but the reason I wanted to stay in this price point is because I recently built a brand new gaming system for a very similar amount so later in the video we will be able to compare the performance of those two to see how much value we're actually getting here compared to a new system uh but before we do that let's see how it performs luckily the previous owner graced us with a clean windows install but there was immediately something a little concerning ooh there's a fan that sounds like an 18th century canal boat in there that's not a good sign Canal booat noises aside clean windows is always a joy to behold on these systems and our dual Channel Ram kit was running at its rated speed with that I downloaded cinebench R20 which didn't quite do what I was expecting it to it was running slower than the previous generation version of the same chip and the reason for this humiliation was because it was just running at its base free frequency and any attempts to push it higher than that in the motherboard's Bios just led to Windows not posting our little Cheapo motherboard really showing what it's made of here which concerningly gave us a very similar result to the six core ryzen 5500 in the new system we bought for about the same amount which is the component we compromised on in that system so um hopefully the gaming goes better that that's that's a lot of patriotism right there that's exciting okay so I'm going to do medium we've got motion blur turned off and we're running at Native 1080p no dlss even though there is an option for that it's about 70 frames per second with not a whole lot going on in the scene that's not great to be honest but it feels pretty good and you can see aside from the occasional Spike we've got pretty good frame time happening and even here with a lot more insect murdering happening it's never really dipped below 60 frames per second which again isn't great but it feels very usable this is a very playable result in a game that looks very good uh and if we want a higher frame rate we can dlss it up and maybe drop the settings even more oh and I just notice the graphics card's not very happy the combination of the case airflow with that gigabyte card is is not great yeah I think we're going to have to repaste that graphics card later to see if it quells the fires now as fortnite I'm using dx11 because Dar X12 is a stuttery unusable mess in this game but yeah but 1080p low settings with epic draw distance this is very playable we're getting well over 120 frames per second which for most gaming monitors that is enough interestingly we do seem to be a little bit CPU bound I guess because our graphics card isn't doing a whole lot uh but it is boosting a little bit higher than it was during the cine bench run so that's interesting but um yeah Graphics got not doing much although that did help the temperatures which is good I then moved over to Battlefield 5 so we can start our comparison to the new system now straight off the bat with little Craig here the graphics C did get very hot very quickly but we didn't lose too much core frequency it just occasionally dipped below 18800 MHz but when it comes to Performance the new system actually had a slight Edge over the used one which is really not what you want to be seeing bear in mind Battlefield 5 does have some inappropriate adult feelings for AMD graphics cards and when we switch over to cyber Punk the tables do turn quite a bit old Mr Craig does manage to put the whipper snapper in its place here but then when you go to The Last of Us the whipper snapper manages to close the gap between the two significantly again that's not great I feel like for a used system to make sense it needs to do unspeakable things to a similarly priced new variant but with that let's do some basic maintenance like repasting the GPU to see if that helps either way we'll find out how much we can judge whoever built this system now the first thing I want to do is remove this radiator so that we can see to what extent we can judge the person who built this system for whatever's happening down here now we can at least semi judge them because there is a CPU fan header up here and they could have used the splitter so that they didn't have to plug the fan in here but you'd still have the problem of the RGB header but wait let me try try quickly rout it around the top so that it's not just straight in the middle here let's see if that works wait does it even look better I'm not entirely sure maybe a little bit maybe it's a little bit neater next let's repaste the graphics card to see if we can help its slight combustion issue so this is our gigabyte 2060 super after its mild [__] it looks a little bit better it's still a bit dusty but you know what can you do wow that is a huge dive for a 60 series card with some bone dry thermal paste on it so repasting it should at least do Comm none of the rgbs turned on turns out I just plugged the RGB Cable in the wrong way around oh that has started out very promising we haven't even hit 70 C yet but let's give it a moment let's play for about 20 minutes to half an hour and then we'll see okay so it's been a while and it's only made a bit of a difference it does occasionally get up to 83 C but it hovers a little bit lower and we're losing a teeny bit less actual core frequency which means performance-wise we didn't really gain anything so not exactly what I'd call a successful Craigslist find like I said before I'm sure you can find some decent deals on my local Craigslist but you have to be willing to get really still down and dirty with that Craigslist knife battling with that let me know what deals you were able to find on your local Craigslist and until the next video thank you for watching bye-bye",

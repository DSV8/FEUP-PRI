    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and we're at CES 2019, and the first stop here today is behind me. This is the world's smartest yacht. It's something that you didn't even know that you needed. We're about to head in and do a little tour of this. It's called the Adonis. (upbeat music) We are hopping aboard the Adonis, and this is so awesome. I got my boots on. Stepping aboard. - [Man] Yeah, pretty sick, isn't it? - Wow, it's incredible. Yeah, so how long have you guys been working on this? - Well, in terms of technology, I would say it's evolved over, since the company was founded for 12 years. But Adonis, in particular, it was about a two year project. We integrated all that technology and products into the yacht, and we built an artificial intelligence concierge service called Angel. - So it's basically all the things that you would find in a smart home, but now it's in a yacht. - And it's - But better. - Incredible. But better, yes, that is most important. - Hi, Angel. Turn on lights. - [Angel] Okay. Turning on the lights assuming now. - It also has beauty aspects to it where it can detect your skin tone and moisturizer and then indicate what that status is on the interfaces throughout the cabin. - That's really, where's that at? - [Woman] We'll show you the shopping component. It's everywhere. - It's everywhere! - [Woman] It's ubiquitous. We'll show it to you downstairs. - Okay, cool. - [Man] The dashes and the seating is also like, if you're on specialty in the special markets with the navigation and the monitoring of the equipment. - Are you guys letting people do test drives? - [Man] Right now, (mumbles) in California. - Yes, well I live there so, pick me up. How many bedrooms? - Rooms throughout, there's twin size. - When are we going Jenna? - The facial recognition. - Oh really? - You wanna-- - Yeah so it just detect who you are and then it'll find me and set all the preferences to what I like. Turn on lights. - [Angel] Okay, turning on lights at master cabin now. - I would like to order some swimwear. - [Angel] Here is a list of Mossy swimwear. What would you like? - Junk Twilight. - [Angel] I am placing your order now. - You can also order food menus. - No way. - It'll send a note to the captain for you to start preparing. - [Angel] I am placing your order now. - Thank you. - something else you need? - Do you need sunscreen? - No. - You're like, I'm good. Don't let Justine have voice activated shopping. - Activate chill out mode. (light R&B music) - Oh yeah, super chill. Oh wow, you've got blinds going down over here. No way, you've got the fireplace. We should order sunscreen. - Right. - Hello, hello everyone. No one's waving back. No hello. So what is your favorite thing about this boat? - The boat as a whole. - No but like, there's a lot of little things; but what if you had to pick one thing. - Angel is definitely the highlight for me. It's something that I've worked on for a long time and it's part of my vision as the company and what we progressed into. So yeah to see it come alive, here at CES is an amazing experience and I'm really excited for what's gonna come next and how we're gonna evolve that tech. - What is coming next? - You'll have to wait and see. - Oh no. - CES 2020. - We'll be there. (upbeat music) - How are you? - Good how are you? - Long time, no see. - Right, it's been a whole day. - It's been a whole day, I mean wow. Do you wanna say hi to my vlog? - Hi vlog. - Did you check out the gaming monitors? - I have; it has LED's on the back, that's awesome. - That's amazing. I need to redo my gaming space, so this is definitely something I want in my future. - They look good. (upbeat guitar music) - So one of the things that I wanted to do this year, is well, number one, I wanted to redo my office and number two, redo my gaming setup so this is super exciting. We're now in the LG booth. And this over here is one of the brand new LG Ultrawide monitors. This is so incredible. This is a 49 inch monitor, 5120 by 1440. This is so great, like I can't even imagine editing on this thing; actually I can imagine it and it's incredible. Also over here, these are the UltraGear monitors and they launched UltraGear last year, so basically it's rebranding their gaming monitors to have a new name. These are all LG monitors but branded in UltraGear, so what these have right here is they also have the spherical lighting in the back. So they have this reactive sound; so if you're playing a shooting game, or whatever it is that you're playing, the lights will react to the sound that is coming through the monitor. So these are really cool. This is one of the newer ones. This is the 37.5 inch model and over here, we've got the 27 inch. So behind here like I mentioned, the spherical lighting, if you wanna check that out. It's all RGB so you can change the color to kinda match whatever theme you're going with. But man that reactive sound is something that I'm super interested in trying out. I can't wait to redo my office. This is gonna be so fun. (upbeat music) we've been competing on the Apple Watch for quite a while and you beat me on the last one. - You had a good lead of like three weeks-- - I did. - and then I like turned it up a notch. - Chris' vacation happened, and then I did nothing so it's all good. So what've you seen that you're into so far? - I'm gonna look at this TV section. I've seen some interesting stuff from Razer. Pretty quite so far. - So far but, you know, we're here. CES running into friends. (upbeat music) So we're at CES day two and we were checking out the Karma Revero at the booth yesterday and they have a concept car there and they were like, Justine do you wanna take one for a ride tomorrow? This is the production model and it is so beautiful. One of the things that I thought was really cool about this car is the little keystone up here is actually hand painted. Every single one is a work of art. It's an electric car and you can get 15 miles on one charge. We're gonna take this for a ride. With the gasoline you can get about 300 miles, but I don't think we're gonna be going that far today 'cause we've only got like an hour. Let's get in. - I'm gonna get in now. - Okay get in, here. I got you. Let's cruise. We've got 233 miles. We're in sport mode, obviously. This is how you change from drive; he didn't tell me how to change it. You probably just push it. Brake, push, P. - we're in P. It'd be D. - Yes D. - Whoa. Okay so now we D. - [Jenna] What's the horn sound like? - Oh we'll find out. We're listening to all of the songs with drive in the titles. Oh, I'm scared. - What if you get pulled over where's your registration? Do you have a glove box? - I don't, do they have a glove box. Do they have a glove box? (\"Drive\" by Halsey) Oh my god, the police. Put the camera down, put the camera down. They're gonna know, - We're not doing anything. - I don't care. I get so nervous when I see the police. I think that they just know that I'm doing nothing wrong. - Do you know this song? - Yeah, I've got a fast car. Let's let everyone know. - [Jenna] We have a fast car. (upbeat music) Just hit the horn. Give it a toot. - should I? Everyone's gonna think that, this guys looking at me. - Give it a toot. - Why are you putting the window down. - So I can hear the toot. I nailed that shot. Nailed it Just. - Good job. And we made it back and now we're gonna put it in park. (upbeat music) We're back to the show floor and right now we're heading into the south hall and our first stop is gonna be Razer. Yes. We've made it. So we're checking out the Razer Turret for Xbox One and this is really crazy because this is basically turning your Xbox into a C sort of environment. Because we've got a keyboard here, we've got the mouse pad and this is so comfortable and it's great because this will also work on your PC too. So it's not just console, but this little mouse pad, just pulls out just like this. I really love that you can also use it for your PC too. So this is actually some health indicators too, so I didn't do very well, on my first wave. So I died. Oh there it is, there it is, see look. So those are lighting up now, so that's the indicator of the health on my little guy here and he's not doing very well. Oh gosh my ship is being wrecked. I'm getting wrecked guys. So pre-orders are out now; they announced this last year, so I'm definitely excited to test this out. - We have a bit of a surprise for you. - Okay. - Alexa, ask synapse to start a chroma party. - Yes, you guys, they know that I love DMX and there's a freaking party happening. Look at this. This is so great. We are in the Razer booth and they are playing the censored version of DMX for me. This is incredible; we're having a chroma party right now. So these are the new Nanoleaf touch and you can basically activate anything just by touching them, so you can just bind this to whatever sort of set up you want. This one is set to play music. This would be so great for parties. So right now we're gonna go check out the new Razer Hypersense and I'm excited about this because I feel like haptic feedback in gaming and watching movies or TV shows or anything is sort of that next step and I'm not sure if anyone has done it just quite yet as they have. This is so cool because the Hypersense is enabled in the mouse, in the wrist pad, and even in this chair so this is gonna be, oh and the headset. Oh my goodness, it is in everything, so this is a fully immersive experience. Are you ready, am I ready? Do I lean back? What's my proper positioning? - Yep so just move in a little bit - Okay, the carpet's not letting me move. This is crazy, so you guys can't feel it, but I can feel it because in my back, when I am reloading, like I can feel the vibration right here and as I'm even running, whoa! The rocket launcher. That was a wild feeling. Whoa, oh my gosh. This is so wild. I think the craziest thing is the chair. Because you really do feel it, especially when I launch these rocket launchers. And people wonder why no one wants to leave their house anymore. We just ran into the Insta360 booth and if you guys know, I am obsessed with this camera. I've done so many amazing photos and videos that I got in Hawaii, and we're gonna go take a look real quick; see what they have. I see an underwater housing. They've also got, oh my god, they have one attached to a drone. I don't think Matty would like a helmet too much. This is probably the biggest dis I have seen at CES other than the Apple billboard. Insta360 has a recycling program for the Gopros, so if you put your Gopro in here, into the recycling bin, you get an Insta360 One X. I'm on the floor. This is incredible. Alright see you later. Jenna this is for you. A gift. - [Jenna] Thank you; I'll bring mine to recycle too. - So they also announced an 11 K VR set up. It is called the Titan. This is gonna change the way people create 360 content. I feel like one of the difficulties with 360 is creating the content and how difficult it is, but I've been using the Insta360 One which is their consumer version. It is so easy, because you basically just plug it right into your phone and you can edit it into any size, any ratio; you can make yourself an Instagram story, you can tweet it out, you can basically do anything and it's honestly one of my favorite cameras for the past year. Cool story Justine. Cool story. I don't have anything else to add. Bye, so there's a fire alarm. Can you get a shot of that real quick before the fire happens. Just make sure, so yeah that's the 11 K Titan. We gotta go, we gotta go. But wait, I don't think it's real. - We don't care if it's real, we're getting outta here, I'm not burning. - But I didn't get to go to the DGI booth yet. - Well you can burn and think about the drone. - No one's burning. - [Jenna] Well you can stay; here's your camera. - Okay. - Ew, I still have my cough drop. - Jenna and I are getting the CES flu. She's got. - Oh I've already had it for like four days. - Now I'm getting it. But there is something that I need to show you. I saw this when we were walking over here. We're heading to the DGI booth, but on the way there we saw something. - What did you see? - Come on, you gotta see. Here it is. - What is it? - I don't know. - No way. - [Justine] Our future mode of transportation. - Is it concept? - I know nothing about it. - Okay (mumbles) - I didn't really think about it; I saw it. I saw it with my eyes and I said, Jenna. - Love that helmet. - Me too. - Look how cute the little Osmo Pocket logo thing is. - Oh my god, it's beautiful. Okay so the Osmo Pocket is probably one of my favorite cameras, other than the Insta360 that came out. But they're kinda two different things, but what I love about this is the Gimble basically attaches right to your phone and it's so steady, it's so incredible, and you guys have already saw my video, but let's go look at it here at CES. Their little display is so cute. I wonder if they have some of the accessories. Because we don't have any of the accessories yet. - Oh I don't even have one. - We have found the accessories. We've got the charging case; the cover we already have. The controller wheel, the wireless module, we do have that one. The 3.5 millimeter adaptor, that's gonna be amazing to do lobed audio and de-filters, quick release, the accessory mount, extension rod, I don't. Smart phone adapters. The underwater housing. Oh shoot. So this is the new DGI smart controller and this thing looks amazing. 'Cause one of the things that drives me crazy when I am actually using it is I will forget that I have my phone connected to it so I'm always trying to like tweet or text, or something while I'm flying, especially when I'm doing like the hyperlapses. You can't use your phone. This is so nice. Easy. It's I'm playing by myself. I'm playing against the computer 'cause I don't have any friends. I just lost on easy. You saw nothing. You saw nothing. Hey you wanna see something? - Do it again. - No. - This'll be great when we have our ranch. - We can till the ground. I think if we, well we can harvest wheat. - So the tire is bigger than my car. - This is lovely. How much do you think this costs? - 700, and no no. - It's gotta be like over a million. - Retract. One point-- - like way over a million. Probably I mean-- - 1.5? Let's move on. (upbeat music) Those are too aggressive of moves. - That's my sister. - Take a picture. - Well guys thank you so much for watching. Jenna, thanks for being in my video. - Thank you for having me. - You just danced with a robot. - I did, it was really cool. The robot danced with me. It found me and it's like we're dancing now. I'm like okay. - They said that's gonna be available within a month. Which is kinda insane. - Oh shopping. - We definitely both need one. - Yes, yes we do. - Alright we're heading out. There is so much more to see at CES and we honestly, I don't think we could even see it all if we even tried. But, we'll see you guys next year. 2020 CES, we'll see you in a year. Wow, we should start prepping now so we're a little more prepared. - Yes, we have to lift more weights 'cause these cameras are heavy. - We're never prepared for CES. Every year it's like oh surprise. - Surprise. - The time is now. Alright back to LA. - Bye. That was weird. - That was weird. - We don't do that. - We don't do that. - We don't do that.

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lou here, back with another video. Today, I've got something unusual. I know I said that before and I probably say it again. But in this case, it's truly unusual. We're gonna have a strange moment together. This thing is called the \"Ostrichpillow\", I believe. \"Welcome to the napping revolution.\" So you're thinking, \"Lou, what's that angle here\"? This could be... The future of pillows. This could be the tech-pillow. The new look, the new style of how you snooze. If somebody, I don't know, you're at university, they're trying to suck your blood, don't let 'em. Snooze away the day. This is a wild type of scenario and a lot of people are gonna think your a weirdo. Let 'em. Will I have the balls to rock it? Probably not. New feeling for enhanced dreams. What else is there to look at? Not much. Have a little nap time. I remember when I was in kindergarten, they had a naptime, you remember that Jack? Oh my. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha , ha, ha. Woah! Woah. Ohh I can't tell you what that feels like, it's like little micro... Balls in there. Ooh, very soft. Wow, not what I expected at all and very light. A little bag to carry it around, \"dream with me\", I don't know, maybe this baby is coming on the airplane. Welcome to this napping revolution. We're in it now, me and you. Now do I wear glasses? Probably not. Do I know how to put this on without suffocating? Probably not. Ohh. Woah. Woah. Ok, so I can still breathe, and then, and then, and then, and then I'm down. Ohhh! And I can't see you guys right now, that's sorta of the idea here. Stop laughing, Jack. What, oh, I can expose the ears if I like. Maybe I need to hear what's going on. Or I can shut em' off, for sound. Excuse me, are you talking to me? Yes, I would like a club soda please. But also if you're leaning up against something. Oohh... Right. My hands? Where do my hands go? But why? I kinda feel like an ostrich right now. This thing is weird, my head is super hot. I'm hot. Are you laughing? Look at that, maybe that's the look. That's something like, I'm on that Jar Jar Binks game right now. I think it'll do the trick. You just gotta be able to put up with the weirdness associated wearing with that around. And people, They're gonna be scared of you. Maybe that's what you're looking for.",

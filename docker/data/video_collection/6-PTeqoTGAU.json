    "transcript": "- iOS 13 is installed, I have dark mode enabled, and now I'm going to make my first Memoji. First I'm going to make one that looks like me and then I'm gonna show you guys some of the crazy customizations that you can do. You can basically make yourself look like anything, but first, let me make a Memoji of myself. Okay, so I've got my skin tone. Like you can really get wild. I feel like my hair is a little bit less blonde than it used to be. My part is on the wrong side. You need to be able to switch your hair part. This is like overwhelming. What, I guess I'm gonna go with simple and basic, there it is, couldn't get anymore basic than that. My eyebrows are a little bit darker than my hair. Hm, hm, hm, huh. I always thought that I had green eyes but my mom recently told me that they weren't really that green so I'm gonna go with this like two toned color, like that's actually pretty accurate to what I think that I look like. If I was a child, this is what I'd look like. I guess this is me now. And this is me after WWDCE3 and all of the activities that are happening in June. This is gonna be me. I have a very pointy chin because you guys like to point that out to me quite often. Oh, are you gonna stab somebody with that? Yes. I think that's good, okay, nose. Small, big, thin. We'll keep that. I've always wanted to get my nose pierced but I never have. I always thought like a cute little diamond would be very, very endearing. Whoa, this is all new. Okay, wait. Let me pick my lips first. I think, I'm not Kylie Jenner status but maybe we'll do, that's a little too aggressive. This, I know that's red. I do love a good purple lip. I think that's good. I like super basic. This is interesting. You can have teeth. Definitely don't miss braces. I actually do have two fake teeth, but they're down here, you can't really tell. Mouth piercings, this looks so cute. I'm not very pain tolerant so I don't think I can handle it. Tongue piercing, no way. That's something that I never wanted to do. Ears, let's try the ears. Can you even see me, you can't see my ears. So I'll just take a small ear. Earrings, look at all these earring options. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. Okay, I love like a rose gold color so I feel like that's kind of nice. That's not really rose gold though. That could look like diamonds. I like super simple, just like a little stud. That's me, you can't even see it anyway. Audio, this is cool So they also have a hearing aid and they also have got air pods. You gotta believe I'm putting air pods in even though you can't see it. Maybe if I shake my head. Oh, you can put the audio position. If you lost one of your air pods, for example. Facial hair, a mustache. I mustache you a question, don't really have any facial hair so there a lot of facial hair options, like look at these. Incredible, it is like endless. Whoa, okay. Moving onto eyewear. I actually have these glasses, they're Ray Bans. Oh yes, these are great. You guys will often see me wear glasses, but these are like exactly my glasses. Look at all of these options though. Wow. I normally wear contacts. This is really starting to look like me and it's kinda freaking me out a little, just like a little bit. But I don't normally wear glasses so we'll just, how do I take them off. I have an eye patch option? Like this is so incredibly customizable that I feel like they have taken so many things into account and Apple, I applaud you, because that has got to be something that's so difficult to be so inclusive to everyone. There's all kinds of head wear. Look at this, this is incredible. I mean I'm so impressed. Like they even have my crown here ready for me to wear. Okay, I'm gonna take that off. There is so much more that I missed, I didn't even realize this was here. You can scroll down and continue to customize, like this is, I didn't even realize this. Usually I do like a light little eyeliner so this, this, does that look like me? Does this look like me? I'm having a problem. I love to see who can make the best version of me. I have more eyeliner? Okay. I could spend way too much time. Oh my goodness, I even missed this, the cheeks. We cannot forget my excessive amount of blush that I like to wear. I missed all of this stuff. Now I'm starting to, oh I have a beauty spot, I've got one right here, but they don't, I can't add it. You gotta add two more, look, there's two more spots. We need one here and here. There's freckles to add. This is really fun, I'm really enjoying this. I think this is really starting to look like me I think, I'm not sure. I think I'm too close to it, like actually, too close to it. I don't know. I think this looks good. I think I need to stop before I start getting really crazy. I think this is gonna be my final look. Well it has to be. Oh my gosh, the stickers! This is so great. Oh my gosh, I'm having so much fun, I'm having so much fun already. This is incredible, this is me all the time. All the time! Face palm, I love it, I freaking love it. This is so much less creepier than like the android ones, a little creepy. Hey Jenna, just wanted to say hi. This is my new Memoji. I hope that you like it, I spent way too much time on it so let me know. I've got a little mouse, wee, squeak, squeak, squeak. But yeah, these are the stickers. These are really cool. Oh, I can edit my own? I didn't realize that you could do that, which is great. So if you go into your stickers and then you scroll all the way down to the bottom, you can edit it, so that's great because I thought that once I hit save it was permanent. Oh, this one definitely kind of makes me look like I've had a little bit of work done. I kinda think I look like Hillary Clinton. She's not saying anything, like I need a little bit of like, hello. Hey pig, write back, tell me that I'm beautiful. She's not even giving me any attention. So I guess this is it, this is the Memojis. Now I'm gonna go through and make one that's kind of really crazy, what I wish that I was. So I can make both of my ears have different earrings? This looks so good that I'm about ready to go get my ears pierced tonight. Yeah, look at that, you can see my air pods. So I don't have any facial hair, but if I do want some sideburns, I probably shouldn't. I think I look good. Oh boy. No way, I can also change the colors of my lenses? I think I'm gonna go back with the pink because we've got a theme going on. Obviously I don't have any head wear because I have a Mohawk and you won't be able to see this beautiful, beautiful creation. Well that's it. I think we did it. So Jenna's ignoring me, but that's okay. I'm gonna ask her what she thinks of this one. Hi Jenna, okay, so what do you think? I've got a lip piercing, I've got an eye piercing, I've got some really cool glasses. I also, surprise, have my tongue pierced. I love it. Look at this Mohawk, isn't it good? Yes. It's, it's lovely. Why is she ignoring me? Hey pig, why are you ignoring me? Oh. Oh my God. (laughing) Oh my God. That was the biggest troll, like my heart, it is on the floor right now, I just peed myself thinking that I was sending this all to. That is not funny at all, like I honestly, I think I peed myself. Like I definitely peed myself out of being terrified that I sent those to the wrong person. You're not funny. So I've been using this beta build for about a day now and so far it's been pretty stable. I didn't install it on my main device, this is on my iPhone XR. Of course I have my iPhone XS Max here which I have not installed it on, but now it's so weird going back to this and seeing light mode. It is so different. I'm pretty excited for iOS 13. There are so many fun features. If you guys have a favorite feature in iOS 13 I would love to hear what it is in the comments below. Dark mode so far is one of my favorite things. Like it just really, it's just so much easier on the eyes. So that's all for now. I will see you guys in my next video. I have so many fun videos coming out for you guys this week, so if you guys are subscribed already, be sure to hit subscribe. Also make sure, even if you are subscribed, to hit the bell so you guys will be notified when I post new videos. Make sure you hit all notifications because I have a bunch of fun stuff coming up this week and I don't want you guys to miss it. With that, I will see you guys later. Bye! (upbeat music)",

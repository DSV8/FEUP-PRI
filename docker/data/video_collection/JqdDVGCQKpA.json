    "transcript": "- The iPhone 16 Pro might just be one of the best iPhones for photographers and videographers ever. Look, this iPhone isn't finished. It's still missing a bunch of AI features, even the camera control button isn't fully functional yet. But if you're in it just for photos and videos, there is a lot to love here. The iPhone does this by giving you more choices than ever before. And yes, a lot of this stuff was already available in the older iPhones, but the 16 Pro offers an unprecedented level of customization, from that new button to new file formats and the ability to change the look of your photos for good. It's the kind of stuff you can nerd out on and dial into your own perfect, precise settings. But also, it's the kind of stuff that you can get lost in after falling down a rabbit hole, and it is a lot. So after a few weeks of testing the camera and putting myself in many different situations, I wanna help you and myself make sense of these choices and show you what works for me. (upbeat music) You might expect me to start with photos and we'll get there pretty soon, but I really wanna start with video, specifically slow motion, 4K, 120 frames per second. It is the new big feature this year and it is a lot of fun to use. Coincidentally, there was a skate event nearby and it felt like the perfect place to see how this camera performs in a fast-paced environment, where I wanna switch between modes quickly, capture a variety of photos, videos, and of course, it is the perfect place to capture a bunch of slow-mo stuff. For this type of an event, I knew I needed some extra stability and support, so I brought out this iPhone rig with side handles and a top handle. I went with the SmallRig one, which clamps onto your phone versus using something with MagSafe. I tend to trust MagSafe, but this felt like a safer option in case someone runs into me or I run into them. I've also turned on enhanced stabilization, the camera settings for even more stable footage. Again, I wanted to film everything in Apple Log color profile. It is a flat unprocessed color codec to give me more room for manually post-processing and color grading. This also means I needed an external storage for anything filmed in 4K60 and 4K120 within the native camera app. And those file sizes are absolutely massive, like this isn't worth it, type of massive unless you download some other camera apps. More on that very soon. So I got the hard drive mount on top, added this 4 terabyte SD, and was ready to go. The event was great. I knew I walked away with some fantastic clips I could not wait to edit. Swapping between three lenses really helps to get a variety of clips quickly, but I do wish 4K120 was available in all lenses. I was forced to make choices when to shoot 60 or 120 based on lenses that felt limiting. There are also some minor user interfacing consistencies in the native camera app. So if you go to the slow motion tab, ProRes option isn't available there, but it's available in the main video tab. In the same tab, you can switch between frame rates by tapping through them on this tiny little icon in the top right corner. But if you miss your desired frame rate setting, you have to cycle through them all over again. And if you're not using a hard drive, you're constantly met with warning messages when cycling through your option. It also felt like I had to triple check each time that I haven't accidentally changed any other settings too. Third party apps like Blackmagic and Kino and Moment have better interfaces that are more streamlined for my type of work. Unfortunately, at the time of this event, not all of those apps had 4K120 frames per second support. So for now, I just used the native app and burnt through my storage pretty quickly. And I know what you're thinking, like, \"Dude, I'm not building out this rig. That's not how people use phones.\" You're right. Let's ditch the rig for now and just use the phone while walking around San Francisco and New York City and see how to get the best possible videos out of this phone. (upbeat music) Since we're ditching that rig, I'd strongly recommend investing in some of those third party apps. Those apps will enable you to film on Apple Log, but in smaller formats like ProRes LT or HEVC. Using those formats means we don't have to film straight to an SD drive, but directly to the iPhone. So these are lower quality, but I promise you will not notice a massive difference. The point here is that we want to get rid of Apple processing and make these videos feel a bit more of your own. There are a bunch of apps out there right now, but Kino was my favorite since it has some nice LUTs or color grades to choose from that you can apply directly in the app. I find Apple's default processing just bit crunchy, over sharpened, contrasty and too saturated, especially when filming in HDR, which I wasn't. This whole video is just SDR. One other thing you miss out on when filming in ProRes Apple Log is Apple's noise reduction, which although aggressive is sometimes necessary. So for example, some low light clips look much cleaner straight outta the camera, even if they lack some clarity and detail. Without the noise reduction, the grain is very noticeable, especially with the ultra wide and the telephoto lenses. I did bring the rig one more time for our visit to the California Academy of Sciences. It allowed me to bound two phones together side by side, so you can see the differences more clearly here between standard and Apple Log. Also, this place is amazing. So here's some footage of butterflies in slow motion, some cool fish and a cool looking albino alligator. And actually filming in Log here helped me to adjust colors more accurately. (upbeat music) Let's talk photography and I want to focus on two things, Photographic Styles and the camera control buttons. Photographic Style are Apple's new way to apply different looks to your photos. You can swap between the main camera or select them after the fact for perceptually lossless edits. You can also take your default in the Settings app too. After testing out several looks, there is one Photographic Style that became my new favorite and my new default. It's called \"Gold\" and I love the subtle changes it makes to the yellows and the reds in the photo. I also set the tone setting anywhere between like minus 40 and minus 80 depending on the scene. The tone settings affects the tonality and mostly shadows of your image, which means you can finally let shadows be shadows and override Apple's aggressive HDR look. Finally! I also tend to prefer an underexposed look mainly so I don't blow out highlights, which honestly isn't a problem with an iPhone. So I usually set my exposure anywhere between a third or two thirds of a stop down. Again, this is not a hard rule. It really depends on each scene, but for me it is a great starting point. Okay, so for my more creative and stylistic look, I've been using the \"Quiet\" in Photographic Style. I love the washed out gold look with a bunch of colors stripped out. It helps me turn some more boring photos into something more visually interesting. For nighttime and low light photos, I find myself gravitating towards the \"Dramatic\" style with its green and blue look as my favorite, but I think actually a lot of these styles really pop in low light, so give them a try. More importantly, I noticed how the inclusion of these new Photographic Styles were influencing my process in a way that I wasn't expecting it. I found myself thinking more about how each photo would look with each style based on what I was about to take a picture of. It reminds me of how you'd pick different film stocks for different situations if you were shooting analog. I haven't used an iPhone in that way before and I really enjoyed this cognitive shift that's happening. These styles are a much bigger deal than I initially thought. The other new feature with photos is that the 48 megapixel mode is now available on the ultra wide, but don't forget to turn it on. It's not on by default. The photos do look sharper, but don't expect a massive jump in quality. It is a good upgrade for your photos and the more I use it, the more I'm noticing the details that you're getting out of it. That same ultra wide lens is used for macro photos and those look awesome. I found myself using it a lot more than I thought that I would. The 5x telephoto remains the same as before. It is a sharp lens with lots of reach and a quite bit of compression. At times it feels a little bit just too flat, but if you're tapped to focus, it will save depth data, which can later be used to add some artificial bokeh. Cutouts aren't always perfect, but I like having that option when I want it. Between the three lenses, the main fusion lens remains the best one, but all three are capable of great results in good light and now it can be perceptually losslessly edited for even better looking photos. I only wish we could also control a few other things, mainly sharpness. I often find that all iPhone photos just are a bit over sharpened. For those who want to avoid that look, you can always shoot in raw, which now supports a much smaller and lossless JPEG XL file format. I know a lot of people are excited about that. But using raw also means that you're missing out on Photographic Style. So that choice is up to you. Do you wanna let your iPhone edit your own photos or do you want to edit them yourself? Personally, I'll use (indistinct) about 99% of the time and I prefer to use my real camera to take raw photos. Smaller file sizes and built-in options are more than enough for what I want out of a phone, but the option is nice to have for the rare occasion when I decided to take raw photos within my phone instead. And if you want a fully unprocessed file, you can always get daylight and then shoot process zero, which strips out just everything. You may have noticed. I haven't really spent a lot of time talking about the camera control button, so I guess we should talk about that. So I've been using the iPhone 16 Pro for a number of weeks now and I swear I kept trying to use this button more and more, but I just can't. Every time I attempt to use it, I just end up feeling like I'm getting very little just out of it. The placement of the button when taking horizontal photos is fine, even though it's not how I hold my phone. I hold it one hand, pinky underneath for support and just tap away. I also found it more difficult to use when taking vertical photos, especially on the bigger Pro Max. I also found that the shutter is way too stiff and changing settings on it is just cumbersome. It takes forever. If there is a setting that you like, you can keep it on there and that'll be okay. But most adjustment controls I want to access are just easier to control on the touchscreen for me anyway. And I'm not entirely sure if the announced half press focus tracking that's coming later will make up for it. I truly believe that this button will be a lot more useful as an AI scanner. As of right now, I don't think this is ready yet. That said, I did find myself using it to launch the camera and that's about it, but even then you'd need to wake up your phone first and then click the button to launch the camera. There were many times when I would just pull up my phone outta my pocket, press the button and expect it to be in camera mode and it just wasn't. If anything, the camera button now frees up your action button to be assigned to something else like a dedicated video camera apps. I think that's pretty cool. As soon as I started making this video, I knew I wanted to do two things, set myself out on a mission to see how to utilize this phone for the type of professional work I do all the time. And I also knew I wanted to film everything in this video on an iPhone, which I did. Not a single frame in this video came from a different camera. Even this Verge product B roll and this two camera section that you're looking at right now, all filmed on an iPhone. But this part, it was a nightmare to set up. So first it was nearly impossible to fit it into a teleprompter. Second, the camera and sensors are off axis, so everything is just slightly off to the side. This also meant that it caught corners of the teleprompter in this shot. So if I zoom out, you will see some corners here. Third, monitoring your framing as you're setting up is just impossible if you're doing this by yourself, unless you have like a separate monitor plugged into the iPhone or you're mirroring your phone onto a Mac. Tried using the Apple Watch to control and see my framing, but that thing just never, ever, ever works. Lastly, I just used the Final Cut Camera app that was synced with my iPad, which made things a little bit easier until I lost connection. At that point, I could not get the connection to reestablish itself ever again. I think it's broken forever. Finally, once I got my framing nailed, I switched back to the Kino app and in retrospect, it was probably more hassle than it was worth. I think this looks okay. We're 800 ISO, by the way and the 24 millimeter lens isn't something that I typically use when filming a talking head. Also, this is like my third time trying to film this two camera section. First time is a test run. Second time was the actual setup and I really liked it, but the file was about an hour and 17 gigabytes big, which isn't terrible. I tried airdropping it, I tried uploading it to iCloud and tried transferring it over with a wire transfer. None of it worked. I finally got it to transfer just to find out that the file was corrupted. Like the phone was doing so well up until this point. I even brought it out with me to some recent big shoots and I was satisfied with the results that I got, especially with video. But I can't sit here and tell you that I've always enjoyed the process. Even when it excels at some task, it's still a phone and that phone factor will come with some limitations. Non-swappable batteries, 1 USB-C port, fixed screen, issues with large files and so on. But it also has some advantages. It is your phone and it can perform pretty good stuff. It has a plethora apps available for it, and the accessory ecosystem is growing pretty strong. We're kind of, off course here, so let's just recap some of the settings here. So for video, I strongly recommend some third party apps with some built-in looks. Film in Apple Log in HEVC or ProRes LT to save space. Slap a LUT on it if you don't wanna make your own and this will drastically elevate your videos. If you're looking to build out a rig, you can do that without spending too much money. The rig I used was around a hundred bucks and had almost everything I needed except the hard drive mount. One thing I was missing from my setup are ND filters, which you'll need on a bright sunny day. You probably notice that some clips look a little bit choppy. As far as photos go, just go ahead, play around with each style and with settings within each style and see what works for you. \"Gold\" works for me, but whichever one you use, don't forget to lower the tone setting and you'll get a lot more contrast outta your photos. But at the end of the day, your camera is a tool, a tool that helps you achieve whatever vision you set up for yourself. And sometimes you want that tool to make you feel a certain way. For example, I don't love to use Sony cameras, I'm sorry. They just feel a bit soulless to me. But I absolutely love the images that come out of an FX3 or the dynamic range of Sony's photo cameras. It is just another tool I will use based on certain situations. And now more than ever, it feels like the iPhone can adapt to many different situations and it is a new useful tool I will go to utilize more going forward. You'll probably see a lot of iPhone clips in Verge videos. Will it replace my camera? I don't like that question 'cause I don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon. But during this review process, I started to appreciate how much modern smartphones can actually do. The depth sensor, that you can adjust your bokeh after the photo was taken, the three lenses you can just quickly swap between, the four axis stabilization is pretty good, and then there's the action with stabilization that's kind of mind blowing, and there's 120 frames in 4K in ProRes. And we haven't even talked about all the new audio processing tools. All of those features make the iPhone unlike any other DSLR mirrorless camera. Could you see yourself using this to replace your camera? Are you already using iPhone for mostly everything? Secondly, lemme know about your settings. I'm curious about your photographic styles and what works for you. Talk soon.",

    "description": "The ASUS TUF FX505 may be the best notebook we saw at CES 2019 but not because of crazy specs or insane design.  Rather this gaming notebook uses a Ryzen 3550H and RX 560X while costing just $800.

    "transcript": "looks like another beautiful day today's we all do we all did it we did all right let's go see ASUS well while a for a box at they suits highly appreciate if you're doing any photography let's go see what else p.m. and huge thanks to our sponsors for making see as possible thermaltake Phantkes Corsair MSI and Razer thank you very much alright so with everyone covering the mothership from ROG what really caught our attention and the issue sweet was this little notebook the Tuf Gaming FX505 that's a mouthful but it is another gaming notebook but the best part is then it's not gonna cost you an arm and a leg unlike some of the other flagship models so what are we talking in terms of specs well for starters it now features AMD second-generation Ryzen5 3350H apu with vega 8 graphics a Radeon rx 560x discrete GPU support for up to 32 gigabytes of RAM and a 15.6 inch IPS level display with a refresh rate up to 120 Hertz with Radeon freesync best of all it just starts at $799 that's just incredible so for comparison the intel version of this notebook is $200 higher from a design standpoint this laptop just looks like any typical rog gaming notebook with some aggressive design elements at the top and this fake brushed aluminum look on the plastic chassis that I'm sure will turn into a fingerprint magnet something I noticed recently is that every flagship no bug that's been announced lately features a stealth finish that looks minimalistic but when it comes to the more budget oriented notebooks they just tend to add so much on top of the chassis that just makes it look unattractive maybe it's just me but I'd love to know your take on this the display on this is well-thought-out and features minimal bezels and the webcam is placed appropriately at the top Thank You Asus you're also getting a full size keyboard and all the necessary tile I did hope to see a full size SD card reader but unfortunately this noble does not come with one a laptop is also not too heavy and I think part of that is due to the plastic chassis being used here so portability shouldn't be a concern ask for battery it only features a 48 watt hour module so I'm not sure how that's gonna impact matter your life but it will be interesting to see how powerful these new rise in AP use on mobile would be I'm also really curious to test out how well this notebook would perform compared to the Intel and NVIDIA expected competitors and hopefully I'll be able to get my hands on one later this year and if you guys are interested in that let us know in the comments down below okay guys so with that cool gaming notebook out of the way it's now time to switch things up and check out some of the most unique monitors we saw at the show let's start off with the Strix XG438Qq which is pretty close to my dream display personally I don't understand the use of 4k on smaller 27 inch screens but this beast uses a 43 inch 4k VA panel that's HDR 600 compliant it also has free sync to HDR 120 Hertz refresh rate a 4 millisecond response rate and features low framerate compensation issues is also factory calibrated each one before they leave the factory you have to see it to believe it because what Asus has created is absolutely stunning and while 43 inches might be a bit large for a desktop display I think it's perfect provided you're able to place it a bit further back on your desk if you're into productivity the Strix XG438Q also allows you to view up to 2 content sources at the same time with its unique picture by picture mode it can even sub in as a display for your console since Asus includes 3 HDMI 2.0 inputs and 210 watt speakers as of right now pricing hasn't been sent but it will be launching the spring so we'll have more coverage a bit later this year you might remember that we covered the Allegiant Y 44 W in some CES content which you can find out right over here but Asus has seriously gone a step further this is the Strix XG49VQ which is a super ultra wide 49 inch 32 by 9 gaming monitor with a native resolution of 3840 by 1080 with all these new monitors you'll notice something similar g-sync is missing in action this ultra wide white screen once again has free sync though this time it's at 144 Hertz HDR is present too but this time only HDR 400 rather than the higher-end specs and unlike the 43 inch monitor I talked about before this one can only take up to three input sources at the same time alright so now that you've seen that Ryzen in Sleeper notebook let's check out the case which is called the asus strix Helios so we actually saw semi prototype a computex and now we see a more finished product so they have got rid of a lot of branding on front window glass which I highly appreciate because it was just way over the top now it is RGB it's tasteful it's like slightly glowy it's not like right in your face which is awesome the tempered glass side panel is no longer branded that are just completely slightly tinted black as for the interior the coolest thing about the front panel is the addition of the ROG note panel which displays your temperature I'm not sure if you can cycle between maybe GPU temperature actually you can CPU temperature right now is cool you know it's kind of like discrete it's almost looks like it's OLED just shines right through for text only you cannot see the display that's for the top panel so it is quiet tall and the built-in handles are quite awesome because their fabric and that we're told super strong so you can carry the system no problem you can of course remove them if that's not your thing the i/o is totally loaded there's a type C port in there very standard stuff and that's for the interior so it's a very roomy type of layout we have a little cutout in the front for radiator support the power supply shroud has a nice tempered glass window to reveal whatever power supply you're using so definitely works towards the Thor branding for their own power supplies the motherboard tray is nicely condensed there and beside it we have a cable cover that you can remove so it's pretty standard but one additional thing we have this metal rod that runs beside the motherboard onto which you can attach little brackets for anti GPU sag so it will support the GPU and you can move that back in three positions in case you're using a really long graphics card so that's pretty nice they're thinking about the enthusiast market and yes while the case is quite large I know it's there trying to kind of condense all the things so they can trickle down the features into lower tier SKUs but of course for their first case you got a start big alright good people so that is the ROG goodness I'm standing beside the end to Phanteks Elite with all types of craziness inside and so let us know what is the most you know exciting thing for you that you saw in this video the rise in laptop the case the monitor stuff and yeah we'll try to deliver in terms of reviews later on thanks so much for watching we'll see you guys in the next video",

    "transcript": "- So I'm gonna you guys the trouble, because I know most of the comments are going to say \"Justine, did you really make an entire video about unboxing a pair of AirPods?\" Yeah, and this isn't the first time I've done something of that sort. I'm sure you guys are very familiar with these by now. This has pretty much been my headphones of choice since I got these a few years ago. Which is kind of crazy, because when I first got them they really didn't fit in my ear, I wasn't sure how I felt about them. But now I honestly can't leave home without them. Obviously, there are headphones out there that have much better sound quality but for what these are, the ease of use, and the portability, and how quick they charge, and I feel like they're always with me, I have lost them several times. But I have always found them. But in this specific video these AirPods cost about $399 and you would be right by saying \"Justine, are you crazy? why would you do that? You have to be crazy.\" I'm also using the excuse that I bought this as a gift for myself for hitting five million subscribers. So thank you guys so much. I didn't make a video about it because I didn't really even know what to say other than thank you. Maybe I'll think of something fun and cool to do in another video. But, for now I haven't thought of that yet. So let me know if you have any suggestion. But now we're just gonna ahead and unbox these. So here's the AirPods, from the outside. They look just any other normal AirPods, but they're not. These are ColorWare AirPods. If you guys aren't familiar with ColorWare, they make really cool custom products. You guys remember, I know I get a lot of questions about this, my NES Switch has this really cool custom vintage look to it, and that is also by ColorWare. So let's unbox these. (gasps) I'm so excited. I saw them go on sale, (dog barks) my dog's going crazy. A bunch of you guys tweeted me this, and said, \"Justine, you have to get this,\" and I said, \"You're right, I do.\" Let's open. (gasps) I see it. I see them, I see them. Wow! Oh, a little note. Body sweats and oils can range from neutral to moderately acid. Sweat and oils are more acidic. ColorWare recommends cleaning your AirPods after use with either ColorClean, oh, look, they give you a little sterile alcohol prep pad. Okay, so here they are. So as you can see, it is vintage Apple themed. I love that they even put this back on. Like that's so, so kind of you guys. So these ridges are even raised. So if you're gonna ask me, \"Justine, are these worth $400 dollars?\" I would, well, I'd give you two answers. One, if you have the extra cash that you're looking to spend on something like this, then yeah, it is. And the reason that I do say yes is because the quality of this is really incredible. It's not just a simple skin. This is custom painted, everything is so perfect. So in that aspect, yes, you are definitely paying for a quality piece of work. To be honest with you, I feel like this is something that one day, down the line, many many years later, when there's an iJustine museum of all of my Apple products, these will be sitting there in a glass case with a screenshot of this video, and be like, \"Remember when Justine unboxed $400 AirPods? Here they are.\" Actually, that would be really fun to do, sort of like a display where you guys can come, meet me, hang out, and look at some of my Apple products. That's weird, but I think I'm into it. So let me know. If that's something that you're into, maybe that's what I can do for my five million subscriber party. (gasps) I love it. Either way, I just wanted to show you guys this, because a lot of you did send me links to this, and said, \"Justine, you gotta get these! You have to check them out. I wanna see what they look like.\" Well, here's what they look like. So like I said, the attention to detail is what sets these apart from anything. All of their products, everything is just perfectly lined up. So let's see what they feel like in my ears. They even repainted the L and the R on them. It does have a different kind of texture than the normal sort of very smooth plastic, but they feel pretty normal. It doesn't feel that different. But it doesn't feel exactly the same. A little more of a textured feel. So on the website, they give you many different options of things that you can customize. So for example, the AirPods, you can customize the case, you can customize each AirPod a different color, and there's two ways that you guys can do it. So you can basically send them a brand new pair of AirPods or you can buy the brand new AirPods from them directly. Again, this isn't sponsored, but I thought these were really cool and I wanted to share it with you, especially if you are a vintage Apple collector, or if you just have $399 that you were really looking to spend. You could buy these. Well, thank you guys for watching. I just wanted to thank you again, so much, for being here for so many years and for subscribing. I know a lot of you guys have been here from the beginning, so it's really great to see you, see you out in the comments, see you out in the real world. And if you aren't already subscribed, be sure to do so, and also hit the bell, so you guys will know when I post a new video. Let me know if you guys have any other suggestions for things you'd like to see me make videos on, because a lot of times, some of the things that I'm making videos about, you guys are tweeting them to me, and I'm seeing it, and then I'm crazy and buying them. Case in point. I'll see you guys in my next video. Bye. (funky electronic music)",

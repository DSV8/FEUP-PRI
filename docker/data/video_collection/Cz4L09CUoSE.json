    "transcript": "- Matt, on a scale of one to ten how mad would you be if I stole the intro? - (indistinct) - Welcome to This Is! - What the... are you kidding me? - I am the captain now. - Your S23 Ultra might be cool on paper, but you know what slaps so much harder? (slap) Every one of these phones on this list. - No, you're wrong. You know what phone is even better than the Galaxy S23 Ultra? - What? - Something that leaves it in the dust. - Are you kidding me? - Yeah. - What's that? (Matt squeals) - [Austin] Supreme Blu Burner Phone. - [Matt] Are you a drug dealer who wants to be on the height of fashion? - I'm gonna tell you with a straight face, look how straight it is... that this is better than the Galaxy S23 Ultra. You know what happens when you buy a Galaxy S23 Ultra? You sell your soul to Samsung, and you give them a large number of dollar-y-doos for a phone which, what, makes phone calls? Psh! You know what, the burner phone does that too. It is a high quality device meant to not attract any attention, to go under the radar, and to easily be disposed of when you're finished with your funny business. Dual SIMs, right? So instead of just breaking your phone like Breaking Bad, you can just take your SIM card out and put your other one in, and then you do your other shady dealings. - This would be a great phone in 2005. The problem is, this came out in 2019. - You know, burners still exist, Matt. - I know, so here's the thing though actually - Stop dealing (beep) so often and you wouldn't have this problem. - No, if you paid me more I don't have to sell (beep). - I don't know how anyone could argue that this has not been the gutsiest 23 Ultra. - This is supremely better. - It is so much better. - Matt, try to tell me that there's another phone out there that's better. - Let me show you what I mean. - [Austin] Go ahead, what is it? - [Matt] The CAT S60. - [Austin] Okay, go ahead. - [Matt] Meow! So this big chungus of a rugged phone comes with thermal imaging, it is drop proof from up to 1.8 meters. Mryeester would have no chance on this thing. This also has dual SIMs, so this is also a burner. So if you wanted to see just how hot those drugs are, I got you covered. - We didn't say drugs, we just mean the acronym Do, Really, Unbelievably, Great, Stuff. - [Austin] The Turing Phone. Okay, so, the Turing Phone, which I am very familiar with, with a liquid morphium alloy chassis, which is stronger than steel titanium. It is hacker proof due to it's hardware encryption. It is waterproof on the inside. And then, it was so good that they sent out some unfinished builds, and then filed for bankruptcy 'cause this phone didn't work and it was a complete scam. I'll give it to you, the Turing Phone, wasn't it. But what was? (Austin laughs) - [Matt] Let me tell you about why the Surface Duo 2 Surface Two-O... why did they not call it the Two-O? - The Two-O! - This, I think, is the best version of a folding phone on the market. Until the 3 comes out and they take away everything that's good about it. It's the worst phone I've ever used, but it is my favorite piece of technology of the last probably decade. I'm like genuinely sincere on this. I use this thing daily. I use it more than my iPhone. I play X-Box on it, I play my Raid: Shadow Legends on it, Yes, I play Raid: Shadow Legends, it's fun. - I hate the fact that this is the only phone on this entire list where you're actually enthusiastically and convinced that this is a real thing. - So like, it was so expensive. It was like, what, $1,500 when it came out. - Yeah, something like that. - And no one should pay for that. If you want a decent media machine, the Duo 1 for $400 is actually pretty dope, because a lot of the improvements that they made for it were specifically on the phone side, and honestly they still kinda suck for being a phone. I just won this whole thing. - No, no, no, no! - Ten points to Matt! Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing! - I don't think that was ten. - Bing! - [Austin] The Razer Edge. Now, you might argue that the Razer Edge is not a phone. Oh no! It is a phone. Everyone just calm down for a sec, okay? I'm gonna pitch you on why the Razer Edge is so much better than the Razer phone, which was an actual phone. We made an entire video about the Razer Edge where Matt and I said nothing but good things Aaron, can you cut a clip of us saying some nice things about it? - No actually Matt's right, it's actually not very good. - It has cellular connectivity, and as we all know, if you have a phone number attached to it, it means you're a phone. We have a controller, you've got the ability to play games, and here the thing, it's basically the same size as a phone. - You're not doing great with this argument here. This has really fallen apart on you, just like the Razer Edge. - [Matt] The Xperia 'Pureness' Are you not a sinner? - Are you play with your 'pureness'? (both laugh) - [Matt] I feel like every year what we see is some concept iPhone that's just pure glass. Where there's just, you see through it. Well, Sony beat you to it! The Sony ponies... they saddle up and gallop to the future. All the way back in 2009 they came out with... - Are you saying 2009 is the future? - This included a translucent screen with LEDs around the edges. So it was basically a see through screen because that's what translucent means. (Austin laughs) This is like five years too late. If this had come out early 2000s, this would have been a cool feature phone. But the fact that it costs more than most smartphones today, the only real benefit to it, because it didn't come with a camera, nothing, is it came with a concierge service. Oh, hello, I would like to go to the pretentious club please let me look through my phone to see it. - I agree, I would love to be invited to the pretentious club. So, if you're a 'Pureness' owner (laughs) please invite me to your pretentious club where we can... - [Man] Hey stop! - [Austin] The Blackberry Passport, yup, remember Blackberry when they made good phones? Fast forward like five years and then they made the Passport. It's a square boy, almost like a passport shape. It had a wide variety of gestures with it's baby keyboard. You know what the tagline was? - What? - Work wide. Terrific device, super high quality, in no way contributed to the long and painful decline of Blackberry as an actual brand that people wanted to buy. But, there you go, Matt. That's why the Passport's great. How could you argue? - [Austin] Go ahead, Matt, whatcha got there, buddy? - Can I get the big hat? Do you miss having your Galaxy Note S7 still want a phone you can smoke? Can I offer you the Vape K Jupiter? Talk about vapor wear, this was a phone with a juul pod built into it. And it came in great flavors like unicorn fart and raspberry bubblegum. It has an app that would keep track of how much juice you had in your vape. It would even let you know which flavor it was, bro. Unfortunately, Android never got around to putting in a vape flavored version of the OS, but this was where it was gonna be. It had dual batteries in it. Because, even if your phone died, your vape was still gonna be okay. - You know what, I can see... this sounds pretty dope. - Kyle, thank you, thank you. I hate that... I don't vape - I hate that you don't vape, too. - No like, I hate that this is not the worst feature phone that I've ever seen. You know what's unfortunate though, they never released their follow up, which was just the (beep). - My bro Matt asked me to come back and help with this episode, so like... - Kyle, that was a really persuasive argument, and I'm really gonna have to dig deep for this next one. But, I have confidence in myself that the Vape K Jupiter is second only to the Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha. So, how about this, Matt, sorry, Kyle... - Look, I'm the only alpha here, alright. - Okay, you know what I wish my phone had? More screen. Not a flippy screen, not a foldy screen, how about a screen that goes all the (beep) way around the phone. The phone is screen all the way around, which means that no matter which way you're looking at it, you've always got your impending doom scroll, which is just ready to go. And, while this may not have actually been a shipping product, Marques got to try it, and I'm sure he said nothing but great things. We'll just cut to the clip of Marques saying lots of great things. - [Marques] It just doesn't like right. It doesn't look like a real phone. It looks futuristic. What's the back display even good for? What's the point? Looking cool, that's mainly it. - I'd say this was too good for us. We weren't worthy of this amazing device. - Kyle took a break. - Oh, okay. - We'll just... he left his hat. - [Matt] The Asus Padfone! The Asus Padfone is actually a pretty decent little idea. So, it's a phone and a tablet. So when you want a bigger screen, you just dock the phone in the tablet. It was actually pretty cheap, because it was $200 for both items. - On contract, if I recall. - Yeah, that's fair. It was at a time when tablets didn't really have data connection. So, this was a way to get your big screen and have your cake too. Speaking of cakes, it was pretty chunky. (Austin laughs) So, the tablet bezels were really bad. This is again, a feature phone, which is... - You keep saying feature phone, it was a smartphone, it was an Android, it's not feature phone! - The feature is that it comes with a goddamn tablet! How is that not a feature? - It's not a feature phone, it's a feature, comma, phone. Now I don't want a big phone, I want a small phone. I would rather take a tablet and fold it in half. - May I offer you the Surface Duo 2? - [Austin] The Nothing Phone 1. This is a device that is cutting edge, revolutionary, world-changing, and honestly, it's a little emotional for me. I look at this device, I look at the glyph interface, I look at the hours... the literal tears Carl Pei drops into each phone as he carefully ushers it from the production line through the shaman's temple and up the mountain top to be delivered to you. And I see this, and I think, yeah... I do want to spend $350 on a phone that doesn't have any real support for US carriers. And yeah, I do want to have a device which is so cutting edge and beautiful that it makes me weep tears of joy. I don't know what more you could ask for out of a device than the Nothing Phone 1. You know what's better than Nothing? Nothing. - It's literally one of the coolest looking phones on the market. But, like you say, there's no support for it. - You know if you look at the glyph, you can imagine it's a dude that has his face over there, there's his hand, he's got one leg and he's kind of a little round. That's the way I like to think about it. - I'm pretty sure that's the way you drew me in that video with iJustine. (Austin laughs) - And it's almost like there's a Nothing Phone 2. (silly music) - Is there? - They haven't, or did they? - Wait, did they? - [Matt] The Samsung Serenata - [Austin] Seratatata? - All the hype babies, bros, wanted a Samsung Serenata because, it would about $2,000 back in 2007. You know, we don't want no poor people getting phones that we had, alright? This had no keyboard because again, I ain't no peasant, man. I don't wanna be using my fingers to dial. It had a touch screen. Touch screen. It also came with a little stand so you could look at how expensive it was. - Hit me with your Seranatatabata... and I'm gonna tell you that while sure, it might be fashion forward and stylish, but you know what I would rather spend $2,000 on? The Virgin Mobile Lobster 700TV. Yes, this was one of the first mobile devices to incorporate digital, audio, TV, and a radio transmitter so called it a tele-phone. - Ugh. - This is a high quality device that had a huge, massive screen of some number of centimeters or inches, I don't know! There's a TV button, so you could watch TV. Imagine having the technology today to watch TV on your phone. It was ahead of it's time, it was absolutely amazing. The TV service lasted for a solid two years before it was discontinued and these phones are basically useless. What more could you ask for? - Not one person in the world wants to watch video on their phones, which is why this failed. To this day, we only use phones for making calls, and that's it. If we as a society want to watch movies or TV on our telephones, this would have succeeded. You can't argue with me otherwise. - I'm glad that we all watch YouTube videos in the movie theater, the only place where you can officially watch licensed This Is content. And if you're watching this on anything besides movie theater screen, you're a dirty pirate and you should be ashamed. - It's true. (Austin laughs) - [Austin] Go ahead, Kyle's getting a lot of play today! - [Matt] This was the Nokia 7600, because Nokia just decided not to make names for phones. Because names are so, I don't know... - Is that why you always your girlfriend's name? - Tennifer? - I would forget that name, too. - [Matt] This was also an MP3 player, but it was also one of the world's smallest and lightest GSM phones of all time. - I am with you, this is clearly the greatest phone, however, I am going to falsely argue against it. Are you ready for this? - Yeah, let's hear it. - We'll wind up for this one, hold on, hold on... Alright, I'm not ready for this. We talked about a lot of phones today. Some good ones, some bad ones, some weird ones - We've certainly talked about some of the phones. - Some of the phones, not all of them are phones. But, you know what the most phone of all phones are? It is in fact, the... What you'll find out when you subscribe to This Is and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button for the next episode of What The Hell Are These Phones That We Found! Subscribe, ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button, and if you do I can guarantee that Kyle will never be seen again. (crashing) (cat screeching)",

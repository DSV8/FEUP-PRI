    "transcript": "This past week, the Macintosh celebrated its 40-year anniversary. There have been high-points and low-points. Nearly perfect machines and barely functioning ones. But theres one Mac that stands out above all others in my eyeseven if it wasnt particularly importantand its right here in this box. 25-years-ago, Steve Jobs makes a triumphant return to a slaughterhouse. Its widely known by the mid-90s that Apple is a shell of its former 1980s glory. Mismanagement and bloat in addition to uninspired and overpriced product offerings has the company just 90-days away from bankruptcy. Jobs acts fastby scrapping the Mac-clone program, simplifying the companys product offerings to the famous quadrant, and most often forgotten, forges a $150M cash infusion deal with Microsoftan enemy, yes, but one that very much needs its sole competitor alive to avoid monopoly-status scrutiny. This money helps launch a computer family thats under early development upon Steves return as a singular, focused, fresh take on personal computing: the iMac G3. Its hard to understate how important this brightly colored machine is. In just 20 weeks, over 800,000 iMac units are sold, and it tops the leaderboard as the best selling desktop computer for 3 months straight. But most surprisingly, nearly half of all sales are to first-time computer buyers. The original iMac captures the average consumer like no other machine before it, and catapults Apple from the red to profitability in less than a year. Thats often cited as the end of Apples troubles, but oh is that not so. The G4 Cube, a bold new take on desktop computing failshardlaunching both underpowered while overpriced and is unofficially cancelled less than a year after entering production. The transition to the all-new Mac OS X proves more difficult than expected especially for the underpowered consumer iMac with performance issues, bugs, and popular software stuck running on the OS 9 Classic abstraction layerwhich had its own software and driver issues. And then theres the iPoda three month old music player thats interesting, sure, but panned by many shareholders and critics as a distraction from Apples core businesscomputers. Apple needs another win and in January 2002 unveils the new iMacin the only way Jobs couldas a showman. The team had already decided the CRT would be ditched in favor of a flat-panel LCD and Ive came up with a conventional all-in-onewith the guts of the computer attached to the back of the display. Jobs hated it. The story goes that Steve called Jony to mull over the problem of this design at his home garden which was overgrown with sunflowers and, reportedly, in studying his surroundings, the designer asked: [accent] what if the screen was separated from the base like a sunflower? To which Jobs responded: let each element be true to itselfthe computer flat, the display vertical, and a mechanical linkage between them as the stem of a sunflower. And thus the new iMac was bornJobs was so proud of this design, that in a rare move, listed himself as the primary inventor on the patent. And you can be sure todays sponsor, Eureka, has some patents of their ownhaving made vacuums in every shape and size for over 100-years. I saw their new flagship product, the J20, at CES 2024. You see, at home, I still use separate bots for vacuuming and mopping because Ive yet to come across an all-in-one that does the job well, but the J20 shows a ton of promise thanks to its unique belt-style mopping system. With detergent-mixed water at the bow of the ship, it continuously dampens the mop pad that rotates while it cleans. Once the dirty pads reach the aft of the vac, a scraper and suction power siphons off the waste water into a holding tank before the mop pad makes its way back to the beginning with freshly applied solution. The end result is always clean pads that dont just smear the smut. Another huge advantage to this design is that this roller assembly is super HEAVY giving it much more downward scrubbing force than is typical. With class-leading 8,000 pascal suction, a dock that empties, washes, dries, and even has on-board solution concentrate that it pre-mixes before filling the bots tank, youll actually get clean floorsfor real. Eureka has other exciting vacuums available for great pricesfrom stick, to uprights, even canisters. But the J20 has my interest piqued and I cant wait to try it out come Marchand you can toonot just by saving money off your preorder with my link below, but by entering a giveaway hosted on my Twitter thatll go to one lucky personanywhere in the world.

Click the link below to find the Eureka vacuum thats right for you. and now it's time to see the Mac for which he was so proud 20 years later I got this thing off of eBay and it's not new but it appears to be in really good condition I mean it comes with the original box uh this is not the original packaging though there's some bubble wrap which I'm certain the original did not ship with although look at that there's the little cardboard insert of all of the G4S all the positions that it can function in and there you go 2002 Apple computer and uh what the heck wow who okay this is a United States Postal Service customs declaration and dispatch notice it's from PC connection services so that would have been the Mac retailer at the time Apple Stores existed in 2002 but there were only like 27 of them and uh they were really unusual and they still weren't shipping stuff out of so you would buy from an authorized retailer and um wow the address on here here to the recipient is psc1 APO AE APO is the Army Post Office so that's Europe somewhere um or the Atlantic uh given 2002 I would have expected somewhere else but nope it seems like it wonder if there's any oh yeah hey look at that I should have just looked at the Box France so this Mac was sold in the United States shipped bya the Army Post Office to France and then at some point made it way back to the United States States and now to my home so this thing has seen the world that's cool uh here is a rather beat up iMac setup guide I've never seen one of these oh look at that it's the little pictures and then as if you needed the instructions on how to plug stuff in uh first plug in the power cable then plug in your modem cable we'll talk about that your speakers your keyboard your mouse and then push the power button uh that seems really obvious and intuitive to us but I guess you know 40% of the people buying this computer were buying a computer for the first time that may not have been obvious okay how are we going to take this thing out well okay we've got some accessories this is the keyboard and this is a pretty good keyboard This is the Apple Pro keyboard so there's a keyboard that came after this it was actually sold on the later generation iMac G4 um this was only sold with the computer for a year so this is a true 20 2 model um this was a good keyboard they moved to that crappy keyboard that had that little plastic lip where literally every single bit of dust and crumb and everything fell inside um which means we should also probably get the Pro mouse rather than the Mighty Mouse which was total garbage yeah so this is the pr Mouse and what's really cool about the prom Mouse is check this out there's this little dial right here see how I'm spinning this the more I spin this the more resistance there is on on the actual click of the mouse so this was an optical Mouse it wasn't a roller ball like you found on the iMac G3 but the more you twist it the Tighter and or looser the button is to actually press which is super cool you could change the travel height on your Mouse um it was still single button so to do a right click uh you would need to hold down um a secondary key in order to make that happen uh the mouse that came after this the Mighty Mouse which again was garbage um allowed you to kind of squeeze the sides and if you'd squeeze these little sides it would engage a secondary Mouse click almost always by accident so anyone who used a Mighty Mouse would disable that but that's cool PR Mouse and now we've got the actual machine oh maybe not what is this oh cool Okay so we've got the very cool looking Harmon cardones looking speakers that came on some of the iMac G4 models it didn't come on the base model only came on the second and top Trim in fact there's probably a spec sheet on here cuz I clearly don't have the base oh yeah so 700 MHz power PC which means this is the the midline trim I've got 256 megab of ram 40 gig hard drive and then I've got a combo Drive um they offered this with three drive options there was a CD only drive there's a combo Drive which is the so this can uh read CDs um and then read and write uh excuse me read DVDs read and write CDs and then there's um a super Drive which could do everything it could burn DVDs um this one will not be able to do that I don't think okay now we get to the computer itself there's some very awful sounding styrofoam but let's just lift the machine out like that it's pretty heavy and then uh move this little clam shell there you go you just got to be smarter than the Box Quinn and look at this they even have the original foam still on from the packaging and if we lift this up to reveal whoa this is in really really good shape it's like a little adhesive along here but you could remove that and uh there it is is the computer and this is why this thing is so cool all these years later yes it is the stand modern IMAX are not adjustable you can adjust the Tilt like this but that's it I'm someone who's tall and when I sit at an iMac I have to put it on something I have to elevate it you don't need to do that here you can lower this oh that hinge is a little there might be some dust in there but you can raise it and you can lower it and then you can also turn it side to side these were super popular in fancy hoyy toyy retail stores because they would just put it at basically a 90 angle like this and then they would do their little blah blah blah checking the stuff and then they turn it to you to be like this is the price sir and you'd be like oh I have a million dollars no problem because if the store had an an iMac you were doing pretty good and uh yeah you've got your drive access right here and that's all there is to it so let's follow that uh page that tells us how to plug stuff in and turn the thing on I hope it works [Music] oh my goodness the sticker sticker still on the [Music] keyboard [Music] and now the Moment of Truth okay so it comes time to now turn this machine on the plastic on this thing is just gorgeous it is so so expensive looking all these years later and the being able to twist this is so great I'm sitting on the floor and I can just pitch this down and go like that and it's like what it's made for me it's amazing this is so cool okay let's push the power button and fingers crossed that's a good sign fine now you can hear the fan spin up because there is a fan unlike G3 before it which was kind of convection cooled this thing did have a fan it's pretty quiet though um you've got the uh yeah exhaust at the top intakes here at the bottom there's no problem with that at all you can also hear the hard drive obviously it's been a long time since we've had to deal with those and uho the display is not bright um it never was that bright but it's certainly dim over time um it should brighten up as you know it stays on for more and more time but um the backlight that they used in this had a pretty severe halflife and so after 10 15 years they're just about half as dim as they used to be which was never that bright to begin with but check it out I am on Mac OS and I can just tell from looking at this already this is 10.4 this is Mac OS tiger heck yeah I know my stuff this is version 10.4.1 oh look at that they've done a ram upgrade to 512 megab of memory which is amazing because that means that we can run a really special version of Mac OS 10 tiger let me explain This CD holds Shurikena community-created version of macOS Tiger released in 2022. Thats right, its a herculean effort that has made breakthrough resource optimizations, fixes several bugs never addressed by Apple, and adds quality-of-life improvements to the now 16-year-old operating systemlike an App Store. All we have to do is insert the disc, let it spin up, and boom! Once installed, things still look and feel like Tiger because, well, thats the pointbut the system feels snappier, is able to run 3D demo software it wasnt able to run well previously, and has an App Store of sorts thats really just a local webpage that links to apps downloadable from MacintoshGarden.org; however, it helps acquire old versions of software as well as new apps like InterWebPPC which is a modern browser that permits slow, albeit successful browsing of todays internet. You can even go crazy like using theme packs to make it look like macOS Sierraan operating system that shipped 14 years after this computer did, but enough of that, lets get back to the story... The iMac G4 sees a fair amount of success, but it fails to outsell the G3 before itas it has just two years on the market before being replaced with the iMac G5a computer that moves to the iconic form factor we still have today, but the form factor that Jobs hated and the form factor turned this iconic statement into a lie: [insert Jobs next decade quote]. In fact, it wasnt even Steve Jobs that unveiled the G5 iMacit was Phil Schiller. The storied disaster of the G5 could make for a full video itselflaunching late, slow, and way too bloody hot at double the TDP of the G4 iMac before itsomething that would have never worked in the sunflower case. And, something that never did work in a laptop, which ultimately forced Apple to move to Intel just a year later. The iMac design we know today was one originally born out of compromise and necessity. Around the same time, the iPod mini finds massive success as the first low-cost iPod that also supports Windowsand it would be the iPod that catapults Apple to the next level bringing about the iPhone, the iPad, and every other Apple product we recognize today. In 2007, Apple changes its name from Apple Computer to just Apple. And for many years the Mac sat on the back-burnerexistent, but neglected. That all changed with Apple Silicon as you may have noticed from the enthusiasm surrounding Apples latest computers on this channelbut while the MacBook lineup has gotten better with every successive generation, the desktop Mac seems to have settled. Sure, the iMac and Mac Studio are technically impressive machines, but they lack the soul and whimsy of the iMac G4. Place the G4 and G5 side-by-side and youd be forgiven for mixing up which one was newer. The fact that without much effort Apple could take this same design, slap a modern display on, re-release it and itd be the best iMac in years says somethingnot necessarily that Apple is now lazy, rather, when they had to fight for survival, they were anything but. Thanks so much for watching, and as always, stay snazzy.",

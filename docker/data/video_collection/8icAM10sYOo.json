Despite having zero interest in cars and living in a city with abundant public transit (and abundant traffic jams), I couldn't pass up the opportunity to be a part of a transportation revolution. A few months ago I ordered the Tesla Model 3 alongside about 400,000 other people, and it should be rolling up to my doorstep sometime late in 2018. It will be my very first electric car.  The question I have is probably the same one you do, whether you ordered a Tesla Model 3 or not: did I make the right call? Can the Model 3 possibly live up to all the buzz? And what kind of car will it be when it actually rolls out of the factory? To find out, I needed to learn what driving a Tesla is like today. So I flew to Florida with Derek Kessler and Serenity Caldwell from Tesla Central, and we spent a few days doing our own Tesla Test Drive with the Model S P85D and a brand-new Model X P90D.   What I discovered was that Tesla has the power to turn even the most apathetic driver into an auto aficionado.

    "transcript": "(futuristic electronic music) - This may seem strange coming from a guy who calls himself Mr. Mobile, but it's true. Tesla is the only car brand I've ever cared about. That's not to say I didn't love my first cars, both of them Chrysler LeBarons, because apparently, I'm a glutton for punishment, but I loved those cars because of the freedom they represented. I love Teslas because of what they are, because getting into one of these all-electric cars is as close as I've ever gotten to sitting inside the future. Today a piece of that future will run you at least $66,000, but next year, it could cost you only half that. Starting at $35,000, the Model 3 announced in April is the most affordable Tesla yet. Despite living in a city with abundant public transit and abundant traffic jams, I ordered one of these five seat sedans, alongside about 400,000 other people, and it should be ready sometime late in 2018. And the question I have is probably the same one you do. Did I make the right call? Will the Model 3 live up to all the buzz? To find out, I needed to learn what driving a Tesla is like today, so I flew to Florida with Derrick and Serenity from Tesla Central, and we spent a few days driving the Model S and the new Model X. And what I discovered was that Tesla has the power to turn even the most apathetic driver into an auto aficionado. (energetic electronic music) Right up front, let me say that the cars we drove in Florida are better equipped than most Model 3s will be, with the full performance package, dual motors, and high-capacity 85 and 90 kilowatt hour batteries, about 50% larger than what we're expecting in the base Model 3. Decking out a Model 3 like one of these will push it well past its starting price, and even then, you'll probably find things you don't love. The interiors of the Model s and X are attractive with tons of trim options, heated and air conditioned seats, and a really spacey windshield that blends seamlessly into the roof. But some parts, like the interior door handles, for example, feel hollow and plasticy. The mirrors are undersized, and blind spots are huge, and though the console display is overwhelming in its sheer size, the software is kind of dated looking, and it's oddly laggy at times too. And remember these are the premium Teslas. Given how much cheaper the Model 3 is, I can't help but wonder just how many of these shortcomings will trickle down and what new ones will crop up. I raised these concerns first because it's so easy to get caught up in the magic of the Tesla experience. These are cars which open the doors for you when they sense you approaching, cars which will drive themselves to meet you with the click of a button. (playful music) They've got a cabin air filtration system that keeps you safe from noxious gases, doors that detect obstructions so they stop opening before damaging a neighboring car. Oh, and they drive themselves too. (playful xylophone music) Okay, technically, what Tesla calls autopilot is really just a combination of existing technologies, but when it's you in the driver seat handing over control of the car to itself, surreal is an understatement. You double click a special paddle behind the steering wheel, and the car's ECU starts to look at all the data from its sensors, the long range radar on the nose, the ultrasonic sensors on the sides, and a forward looking camera. That keeps an eye on the road markings to keep the car in the proper lane, and it also reads speed limit signs, literally reads them to keep you from getting pulled over for speeding. All this adds up to a car that can literally drive itself, and whether you're in stop and go city traffic or barreling down a long stretch of highway, it's great for a little break if you wanna take in the scenery, or you can just sit slack jawed at being driven around by a robot car. When you wanna park but you're just so exhausted from all that not driving, that's just a button press away too. (playful xylophone music) Now, while the base Model 3 will pack the necessary autopilot hardware, the software that makes it work is an optional upgrade that'll cost more. Also the implementation will be a little different. See, the instrument cluster on the current generation isn't there on the Model 3. There's just a single 15 inch monitor at the center line, so most people expect the lane-keeping graphics will be projected on a heads-up display right on the windshield. Also, I'm hoping for some other improvements. It can read speed limit signs just fine, but today's Tesla doesn't know a traffic light from a seagull or a stop sign from a gas pump. What that means is if there's no car ahead of you at an intersection, you'll just blow right through. And the auto-park system almost always take more than one try to actually work, and more than once during my time behind the wheel, we came upon a poorly painted road or a hard turn the computer just couldn't deal with, which means it sounded an alarm and threw the control back to me rather abruptly. Tesla CEO, Elon Musk hinted earlier this month that by the time the Model 3 hits the road, it'll be fully capable of actually driving itself. We'll see. What will that drive feel like? Well, you won't get a sense of it from looking under the hood. See, without a big internal combustion engine, all there is to see up front is a forward mounted trunk, or frunk. The motors are down below, and they're pretty compact. They take their power from a huge battery, running almost axle to axle under the cabin, whose mass keeps the car's center of gravity low. I tend to take turns aggressively sometimes, and it's impressive how well the Model S and X stick to the road. And if you're thinking all that extra weight means a slow car, well, look up how much torque an electric motor has, or just watch this clip of Derrick and me testing out Launch Mode in the Model X. (soft dinging) That's enabled. - Launch Mode enabled. - This goes down. I let go of that. Oh! Yeah, that's Launch Mode. (car motor accelerating) Ludicrous speed. (laughing) - [Derrick] Even though it's combing it. (nervous garbling) (laughing) - That is. The Model 3 won't ship with this kind of power by default. The base tram offers only about half the acceleration of the Model S and X. But the Model 3 will still do zero to 60 in about six seconds, and you'll have the option to add ludicrous speed, as well. And when you finally, maybe reluctantly slow down, the car is even smart about that. It uses regenerative braking to recapture some of the kinetic energy that would otherwise be wasted as heat. It is a little weird from the driver's seat. Every time you take your foot off the gas pedal, the car instantly starts decelerating, but you get used to it, and in exchange, the battery gets a little bit of a recharge every time you slow down. (low key electronic music) And let's be honest, you're gonna want every extra watt hour you can squeeze out of it. The Model 3 is supposed to deliver 215 miles between charges, less than what you'll get from today's larger Teslas, but keeping step with its principle competition. More importantly, you'll be able to recharge the Model 3 via Tesla's nationwide network of superchargers, which are clustered around city centers and deployed along major interstates. You can also charge at home, of course and at other public stations too. Tesla offers adapters for its special port, but the superchargers can top off your battery at higher speeds. That's relatively speaking anyway. For the Model S, it takes about 30 minutes for 170 miles of range. So on long trips, you'll be refueling more often than you would in a gas powered car and planning your stops more carefully, so you don't find yourself out of juice in the middle of nowhere. Sadly, the Model 3's cheaper price tag means that supercharging won't be free like it is for today's Tesla owners. (low key electronic music) My remaining concerns have more to do with Tesla itself. For the Model 3, the company has to build at a scale it's never before tried. Even at its current rates, it often faces production delays. Also, you know those flashy falcon wing doors on the Model X? Well, they're kind of a mess. Sometimes they don't open or close properly, and while they do a good job of avoiding neighboring cars with their built-in sensors, they seem to have no qualms about ripping off a side-view mirror. Good thing this was just a water bottle. Now, the Model 3 won't have those doors, but they're a good example of a highly touted feature that turned out to be more trouble than it was worth. And there's a lot we still don't know at this point. Recharging a Model 3 will definitely be cheaper than refueling a gas car, but how much will that supercharging cost? Also, there's the human factor to consider. People are still getting used to all the new technology packed into these cars, some of the dozing off at the wheel after putting too much faith in the autopilot, others getting caught by surprise by just how powerful and heavy these cars are. And while there's a nice tax credit for buying an electric car in the United States, that credit gradually phases out once a manufacturer has sold a certain number of units. (suspenseful music) If so many unknowns are enough to dissuade you from ordering your own Model 3, no one could blame you. But if you just can't resist the urge to be part of the biggest revolution in transportation in a century, you can expect the Model 3 to have an even more profound effect than its pricier forerunners. I think it's gonna do for electric cars what the iPhone did for smartphones, democratize them, push them from a niche audience into the mainstream. My favorite products are ones that make me feel like I'm living in the future, and nothing I've seen this year makes me feel that quite as keenly as the Teslas I drove in May and the Model 3 I expect to receive in 2018.

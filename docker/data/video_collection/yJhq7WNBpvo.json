    "transcript": "- Hey guy, how's it going? It's Justine and guess where we are right now, we are in Seattle and right now in front of me is an old Apple store, because behind me is a brand new one that is opening in University Village, here in Seattle. Because this store was opened in September in 2003, which was before the iPhone, which is kind of crazy to think, there was a time before the iPhone. So I look forward to the grand opening of this tomorrow. Oh my gosh people are clapping. Sorry now all of the employees are waiting for the last customer in this Apple store to come out and they're going to clap for him. He's at the Genius bar right now, and he has no idea what's going to happen. (crowd cheering) (crowd clapping) Definitely was focused on the wrong guy leaving the store. (speaker laughing) So I don't even think I captured it. This is the brand new store that will be opening up tomorrow morning, 9:30 AM. Grand opening, baby. (mysterious techno music) The store looks amazing. Oh my goodness! It looks so good, I can't wait. Hey Jen, is that a Ronin-S? - [Jen] Are you a Ronin-S or you just gonna, suh. - Suh. (speakers laughing) (mysterious techno music)",

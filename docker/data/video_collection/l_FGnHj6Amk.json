    "transcript": "hello the people I'm Dimitri and welcome to the mesh battle for the first case is the Phanteks P600s and there's the mesh and the second case is the fractal Design Meshify S2 I as to which is basically the define s2 but with a front mesh panel so let's see which one measures better between these two Granite's this give you hardware the power deserves with be quiet straight power 11 power supply with a wire free internal design fantastic cooling with silent wings three fan a fully modular layout with black cables and 80 plus gold efficiency check them out below alright so the reason why I'm comparing these two cases is because their price point is identical $139 for a solid side panel and $149 with tgd the meshify s2 comes in two color options so white and black and two TG options with a dark tint while the p600s has three color options available now the meshify s2 is based on the defined s to make sure to check out that review to get the basic understanding while the P600s interior wise is based on the evolv X so make sure to check out that out as well here and so physically you can see they are quite different so I really like the grey P600s I'm not a fan of the black one because it's just too bland while I'm not a fan of the white meshify s2 as well because there's color inconsistency behind the tempered glass side panel it's more yellow and not white and also the texture and consistency between the metal top and plastic fronts but I love both of their measure integrations because they're totally different so with the S2 we get that cool abstract pattern that is visible at certain light angles you might remember this from the meshify I see it is metal with a thick dust filter built in so there's no additional resistance for the fans the P600s however incorporates a high airflow fabric instead of a metal mesh and the fine dust filter underneath it so we'll see which one delivers better airflow now my worry with the P600s is just accumulation you know inside that fabric material because it's black so any you know great dust particles will be totally visible now that is not to say that the meshify s2 does not have the same problem however you just kind of vacuum the front here instead of needing to take off the dust filter on the P600s but I do appreciate the extra front cover that can be angled to open this area for airflow or closed for a more silent system and when it's fully open the fabric pattern looks awesome you know it's kind of part of the whole design and it's not like an afterthought both cases have the same I Oh with dual USB three and a Type C gen two port now the cable on the P600s is three inches shorter so it might not be as comfortable to route if the type-c connector on the motherboard is somewhere in the middle both cases have three 140 millimeter fans both have seven PCI slots at the back with three vertical on the P600s and two on the Meshify s2 and I do like the swivel side panel on the Phanteks case that have strong magnets at the front and rubber edges around the perimeter for airflow sealing while the s2 has thumb screws and additional pegs for more secure mount so you could be totally fine not using the thumb screws at all the phanteks case is slightly taller while the s2 is a bit longer and I do like the interiors of both and especially that grey on black color scheme on a P600s although I really dislike working without sliding covers beside the motherboard whereas the meshify s2 interior is a true fractal staple when they clean PSU shroud and lots of room for water cooling so radiator clearance on both cases it's pretty much identical for the top and front but the s2 can also house some at the bottom given your PSU is short enough for storage the P600s has three SSD caddies behind the mobile tray and four of these drive cages that can be stacked in the bottom chamber or moved inside while the s2 has a couple of us as the caddies and three larger drive cages at the back both cases have SATA powered fan hubs with PWM option and I do like the location of the hub on the P600s as it's not part of that main cable routing area and finally some value add things I do like this screw box with a Phanteks case there's an anti GPU sag bracket included an adhesive case badge and the magnetic cover for the top ventilation area to prevent recirculation of air while with the s2 outside of your normal screws we have a triple sabba extension handy for drive connections in that side area and you could also build a dual system config inside the p600s it's not for everybody and you can check out my experience right over here because I'm using the evolv X which has the same interior and not for cooling we're gonna do stock configuration to see which case cools better out of the box and they both have three fans included and also to replace those fans with my nock to us so just we have you know consistency in our entire cooling assembly and just to measure the variable in that mesh front area alright so for my test system I'm using 8700k at 4.8 gigahertz with that wonderful knock to a u 12s cooler and for the GPU we've got the GTX 1080 for the win let's start at stock settings for both cases you can see the meshify s2 takes the lead in CPU temperatures when the front cover on the P600s is closed but to my surprise with a really toasty GPU in both scenarios reaching over 90 degrees Celsius now removing that front cover on the P600s significantly improves our cooling and while the CPU is still hotter versus the meshify s2 the much cooler GPU is what really stands out now look what happens when I remove the front panel completely the s2 still delivers better CPU temperatures but the GPU is much cooler on the P600s and this is where the stock fans running at the thousand rpm for both cases now me replacing those stock fans would knock to us is a good idea for performance they are running at 2,000 rpm instead and really help with cooling on the s2 but that high airflow fabric on the p600s is not a gimmick and those temperatures are very impressive now I'm not sure why exactly those CPU temperatures are so much better on the mesh by s2 while the GPU is much cooler on the P600s so if you have any ideas let me know in the comments and if you plan on replacing the stock fans in either of these cases with something better the phanteks case delivers better airflow as for noise levels with the front closed on the P600s is slightly quieter but you compromise a lot on cooling but it does suppress more of that noise with higher rpm fans with the front plate removed and at stock settings they are basically identical but with faster fans the P600s takes the lead take your gaming experience to the next level with Corsair's new harpoon RGB wireless gaming mouse with its advanced slipstream wireless technology experienced hyper fast sub 1 millisecond connection speeds along with dynamic RGB lining for some extra Flair check out the harpoon Wireless in links below alright guys so I hope you enjoy this comparison out of the two cases which one would you pick let me know in the comments below and which one to you looks better your styling is very subjective I preferred the black version of the meshify s2 but I prefer the more compact meshify C to be honest while the totally you know that gray p600s is gorgeous while the black one and the white ones mmm kind of look off to me but yeah let me know in the comments I'm Dimitri I'll talk to you next video",

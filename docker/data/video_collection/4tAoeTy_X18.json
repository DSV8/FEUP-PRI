    "transcript": "What's up everyone? We are out of the office today and we'll be out of the office actually for an entire week because we are filming in two Micro Center locations here in Atlanta. This is the Marietta Micro Center store and it's actually the first one they ever built which I didn't know until today. So the premise of these videos is simple. We have asked viewers with older rigs to meet us at the store. They're gonna get to spend one big wheel with a bunch of budgets on it, bunch of different price ranges. And whatever that lands on is going to be their shopping spree amount for Micro Center that day. I think it'll be at least somewhat entertaining and the viewers super excited. Jason, he's already in the store. So let's go check it out. Did you zoom in on my face just then? No, I think the viewership really needs to know behind the scenes. Oh, this is what I get for bringing McLovin with me again to the same Micro Center we were almost kicked out of seven years ago. Okay. A majority of what you actually film gets edited out of the final cut. It doesn't make the final cut. Why is that? It's not very good. These guys do not like me recording. I can see the reflection of them like turning around and like looking at me. There's like there's security with earpieces in. Anyway, yeah, this will be exciting. Stay with us. To get rid of that annoying Windows activation watermark, head on over to VIP SCD key. Purchase a Windows 10 Pro OEM key for a fraction of the price of retail. Just use a secure payment method like PayPal, enter your product key into your PC settings window, and say bye-bye to the watermark. And be sure to use our offer code SKGS for a sweet discount. Jason. Hello. Jason, we're filming. Hello. So we're just going to roll with the punches here. Jason's, I don't think ever been on camera before. So he's uh, yeah, he's being very gracious letting us film. So he's actually already got his rig set up here. You are super fast, my friend. So I think it's what, what is it a GTX 1070 in here? No, it's a 1080. Okay. And then what platform do you have? So 4770K. Gotcha. So that's Haswell, right? 4770, of course, Evan. Okay. So yeah, there's definitely some room to upgrade the platform. Yeah. And potentially the graphics card. If the spin is right, maybe we go with graphics card only, but I could, the platform could be an amazing upgrade too. So we're going to make both work somehow, some way. We're a micro center of all places. This, this is the place to find the deals for sure. We're at Disney World of Atlanta right now. So I want to show you guys how the wheel works and this will also be helpful for Jason as well. Although it is fairly self-explanatory. We've got a 36 inch wheel and it has a bunch of numbers on it, a bunch of prices. [Greg you need better Sharpie Skillz ] And these prices determine how much you'll have to spend at the end of the day. So our big number here is $1,200. It's a, it's a, it's a beast of a number. You've got a thousand bucks on the other side of that. And then everything else is anywhere between about six and nine hundred dollars. There are two spin again tabs. So maybe you get that and I guess take that as a second chance to get something big or not. I don't know how that's going to work. But, but yeah, so I think without further ado, this is it. You can yeah, this is it. Give her a one big spin. Yep. Big money, big money. Let's see that baby blue. It's like gender reveal. Baby blue would be nice. Nice. All right, that'll work. That'll work. Yep. Let's go. Everyone's pumped. We got pumped. Big money, big money. Come on baby blue. Baby blue. 650. All right, that's 50 more than the base. So you still yeah, it's still winners. Jason, what are you feeling? Upgrade wise, my initial thought is maybe a graphics card. Okay, but we can also look at like a platform upgrade as well. Okay, kind of just see what we can do with that type of budget. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, there I mean a lot of different ways you could approach this. If you wanted to just throw the entire budget into the card. I mean you could do that. I suppose. Yeah, we might be able to mix and match. I mean the problem with the platform upgrade is obviously you're going to need not only a new CPU and motherboard but DDR4 or 5 depending on the platform as well. And possibly a cooler as well. Yeah, the cooler. Yeah. I mean what is the Hyper 212 in there? Yep. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. No, it's I mean, hey, it's a job done. This thing was like the value champ back in the day. People love those coolers. I guess we'll start with graphics cards. Graphics cards. My man. All right. Yeah, we can do that. So probably not anything. Not here. Probably not a 4090 right now, but they do have them in stock, which is nice, you know, so oh, yeah, here's here's the Holy Grail. You sure you're ready for this? I think I'm ready. Yes. I think I'm ready. I'm very excited. And don't worry about tax by the way. So like you can go over on tax. We're just looking at like the list price here that we're going to add to the budget just to keep it simple. So the Sapphire pulse 6750 XT is $390. That's that yellow box right there. So yeah, definitely going to keep that one in mind. Hey, by the way, this is Connor. He has like the coolest shirt. Would you go with a platform upgrade, which is a pretty big uplift compared to what I currently have? Or would you dump all the money into the video card and just go maximum FPS? So that's the thing. I think no matter what you do, that's just what it feels like. That's what it feels like when he does. I think it would be a sin to forego the platform upgrade. And actually I wanted to ask your opinion on this as well, Connor. I want to use this too. You saw his rig. Like, yeah, you can't overlook the fact that it's quite, I mean, it's still doable in like budget rigs, but at this point since you've got 650 to spend, it's one of those things where you're probably going to regret it. And even if you got a really expensive graphics card to fill that void, you're, I mean, you're still missing out on performance there. You're going to be held back at that point by your platform. I say graphics card. Yeah, no matter what. You're the devil's advocate. I would fall out on the graphics card so fast, but that's just me. I'm going to be the devil's advocate on that. I wonder what the comments are going to say as well. I wonder, I feel like it's going to be pretty split here. I mean 650 is a really tough budget to like squeeze both into. If we were at a thousand dollars, like if you had won that baby blue tile, like who would have been piece of cake to do both? You're still going to see a big performance jump. Maybe not as big as the graphics card upgrade, but no matter what you do here, you're going to run into a bottleneck unless you upgrade both. This might work better just because you're already on Intel. So you can get a 12600K and a Z690 motherboard for 300 bucks. And this one is no RAM though. So yeah, this one is no RAM. Yeah, there are a few. Yeah. So the bigger ones do like this would be your whole budget basically. So then Jason, decision time. Right now. No pressure. No pressure. But you have to make a decision in the next 10 seconds. Oh God, that's what Jason was like. Don't do that to me. All right, platform upgrade. Let's do it. Platform upgrade. Let's do it. Okay. And then do you want to max out the budget on the platform or do you want to try squeezing a case or a power supply or more storage? We can also work stuff on that end of it too. I need to look at the stuff again. Pressure. I need to look at the stuff. Pressure. So the 12700K Z690 plus tough Wi-Fi motherboard and then just actually the cool thing about this is you can still pick your DDR4. So you can yeah, you can go RGB or whatever. What can I get? 3600. Okay. CL16 if I can get it. Okay. So are we wanting to go G-Skill with the Trident Z's? So $530 - So you got another $120 to spend on ideally a cooler and then depending on the cooler. Yeah, probably. Yeah, if you go what do you think in like CLC? You could even get a Dark Rock 4. I think even a Dark Rock 4 would probably be okay. You might not get a lot of overclocking headroom, but it would save you. Yeah, it would save you about 20, 25 bucks. Do you want an NVMe? Can you squeeze a, what capacity NVMe could you get for 40 bucks? We're looking probably looking at the deals. It's going to be like a 500 gig. 500 gig for 40? Okay, so you'd have to yeah, you'd have to migrate it over though. Okay. Okay, like these kinds of custom sleeve cables, I think would really help set off the rig like the black and red I think, you know, but of course this isn't going to add any more performance. They're just extensions. They're extensions. Yeah. So they will, you know, they'll definitely work. But obviously yeah, that doesn't add any performance. Wow, that's not bad. Yeah, Gen 4 for 40 bucks? And that's the same capacity? That's a 500GB? Dude, buy that. Yeah, 100%. Or, or, or (**Jacob Buffering), oh my. We risk it all if we look at the graphics cards again. And oh, there she is. That's the one. 40 bucks. Absolutely amazing. Guess what? Now we have to upgrade it. Awesome. Let's do it. Here we go. It's time for checkout. Oh, yeah. All right. And now it's time to dive in. Swap all this stuff out. I guess. Yeah, this is literally everything, right? Cool. Out comes the graphics card. Oh, yeah, look at that. That looks really good. Looks pretty clean. Oh, yeah. That's just so good. You just can't put a price on that experience. Taking care of some cabling. In she goes. You getting all that, Jacob? All right, and we are good to go. Time to power on one last time. Don't want to send Jason out with a broken rig. That wouldn't, that wouldn't be a good idea. So our monitor is just going to lay down flat for reasons you did not see earlier. All right, Jason, you want to power it on up front? Do the honors? Oh, forgot one. Yeah, but this, that's right here though. So that we can just reroute further down. Other than that one fan, everything else is spinning. We're looking for a post here. Is there some decent glare on that for you, Jacob? No, it's amazing. Oh, hey, there you go. Looking good. So when you boot into, if you boot into the old drive that you already have windows on, it'll update some drivers and things. But when you reinstall windows, just make sure you put it on the M.2, obviously, and you'll have a much faster rig as well. Sounds good. As a result of that. Amazing. So yeah. Smiles all around. Yeah, let's get this, you get this last fan hooked up. Just cut this part out, Jacob. You can see that RGB RAM in there. So that was an upgrade. Obviously the platform was. Everything that you upgraded actually was kind of connected to the motherboard directly. When we put that in there, it, yeah, I mean it totally, I think, revamped your rig. It doesn't look too different, but you get a nice beefier cooler on there. Now I think that that makes a lot of difference and it's going to be a lot more powerful. Now thanks to that, what, 12700K you have in there? Yeah. There's a lot of, a lot of performance that's now, yeah, now going to be taken advantage of. All right, man. Yeah, looking good. So it all boots up and stuff too. You know, what's really cool is like this sticker still applies. It's still a Core i7. You're not, you're not lying. Yeah. It's still a 8 and it's still powered by a Corsair. And it is a Corsair case still. Yeah. These shirts is technically still. Yeah. All right. So that's it. It boots up. It looks really good. You've got a pretty healthy platform upgrade now. And yeah, what do you think? How do you think it looks? So exciting. This is such a huge jump in power. I'm just very excited. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Yeah, no worries, Jason. Thanks for coming out and for being on time and for bringing your rig in and for cleaning it as well. Jacob pointed that out. This rig is so clean considering its age. Like that is beautiful. So you did us a real solid there. And unfortunately you didn't hit like one of the biggest numbers there, but I really think you maximized the budget that you had. And it was real fun going around the store and talking with you and making it work. All right. Awkward as hell. I was like, I was about to like end the video. I was like, I kind of want to do the outside of the store. I was like, how do I end this conversation? I think I think I was very friendly. Oh, I don't know how. Are you still filming this? We're just going to let it roll. So people know how awkward I am in real life. Right. So that was fun. Again, this is our first time doing it. So it's going to be a little bit of growing pains, but I think it worked out really well and Jason seemed to enjoy it. So hopefully the second person will as well. We'll be back here again for the next Micro Center video. By the way, I don't think I said this earlier, but we're going to call this playlist the gear up playlist. Super simple doesn't really have much of a meaning other than we're just upgrading gear. So gear up. See in the next one.",

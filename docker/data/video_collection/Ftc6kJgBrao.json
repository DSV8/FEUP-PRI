    "transcript": "hello good people I'm Dimitri and last week we published our RTX experience with Battlefield 5 looking at the visual analysis between the ultra settings too low and I feel like this shirt is not really appropriate there we go that's better RTX and since then both dice Nvidia have confirmed there were bugs with his current rtx implementation at the ultra setting so NVIDIA rolled out updates so that's great and NVIDIA promises over 50% which is great and now let's update my bf5 game so we can see what type of performance improvement we can get dice please luckily the delay wasn't that long my game has been updated let's see if the promised performance improvements are there and hopefully no visual compromises when our RTX is set to ultra alright let's analyze rottenness the new inner mac slick tech TR for AI a liquid CPU cooler now features this beautifully diffused RGB lining around the CPU block that can be customized via this control box or through your motherboard it covers 100% of the IHS plus it comes in two forty to eighty and three sixty millimeter variants learn more in the description down below alright so let's go over my settings quickly I'm running at 1440p because it's 4k with DXR it's basically unplayable I disabled those unnecessary visual effects at the bottom but as for the important stuff I have everything set to ultra and including the DXR our reflections and what you're about to see a performance numbers using invidious latest drivers so the before column that is before the game has been patched but using latest drivers from Nvidia and after the game has been patched just to clarify those two and I'm running this on the RTX 2080 ti duke from msi and the 9900k alright so jumping into the first four scene we immediately see about the 20 FPS boost with frame rate dropping below 40 before the update while staying comfortably above 60 after the update also keep your eyes on the VRAM usage because after the update I'm seeing significantly higher vm consumption and the static scene with the fire visually to me they are identical but the FPS on the right has almost doubled with almost two extra gigabytes of VRAM usage after the update the same behavior is observed by looking into the forest solid 60+ fps after the update as promised without any quality difference that I can see and what I'm really happy to see toe is FPS not tanking while you're aiming down sights that was pretty terrible before the latest update and so I'm sure you're starting to see the pattern here DXR on ultra settings after the update delivers between ten to thirty higher FPS throughout multiple scenes whenever the reflections are quite heavy the sniper gameplay before Nvidia drivers was absolutely terrible but after updating drivers and bf5 you can see we're close to eighty and that is absolutely playable basically whenever the scene is wet and full reflections and muddy we notice a substantial boost in FPS without those reflections becoming less detailed or grainy but there are sections in the game where FPS difference is minor like in the desert tank battle since reflections are only visible on part of the tank despite still seeing a much higher VRAM usage going up in the sky fps is pretty much the same with before and after the update because there not many assets with reflective surfaces now skiing down the mountain this is the only instance where vrm usage after the update is not that much higher but with slightly better FPS and during explosions the FPS dip is about the same so throughout the game after the update we get playable frame rates at ultra settings as was promised with the RTXx 2080 TI at 60 FPS plus at 1440p so performance basically matches what it was at DXR on low settings before the update and so if you want to squeeze more performance with the latest update and still have all those ray-traced reflections in your game i recommend leaving DXR on low because that is an additional 10 FPS gained versus ultra now what about multiplayer because previously it was just a nightmare with the DXR on Ultra setting but now with all the eye candy it is actually playable with pretty consistent 60 Plus FPS but setting DXR setting too low gives me around 80 to 100 FPS and multiplayer that is much better for my personal enjoyment of the game online and this brings me to some concluding thoughts the whole launch of ray tracing patch was absolutely rushed seeing how much better performance we get with the latest update on the game and Nvidia drivers so why couldn't dice just have waited a few weeks to roll out a working RTX version of the game like we have now instead of delivering this terrible performance with the initial version with DXR and this whole trend of incomplete launches within the video game industry is just so frustrating because we clearly received a beta version of r-tx and then they're now rolling out bits and pieces that should have been there from the start but let me know how you feel about this whole situation obviously performance improvement is there it's quite significant it's all in the positive and I'm not really noticing any visual differences so that's a good thing but I am noticing a significantly higher veeram usage with the latest update and the 2080 TI has 11 gigabytes of vram while the 2080 and the 2070 have 8 but if I'm seeing over 9 gigabytes of VRAM usage with all the ray tracing enabled everything in ultra how will that impact performance on the lower RTX cards it is good to that we finally have a playable version with RTX on at Ultra settings in BF5 and I'm guessing it will just pave the way forward for future games and I'm really excited to see how RTX and ray tracing is going to be implemented in future games because if it's anything like with bf5 then it's going to be a rocky start and I'm hoping that other game developers learn from this experience all right guys I'm Dimitri

    "transcript": "- Hey everyone, so it has been a year since Apple has announced their Emergency SOS satellite services for the iPhone 14, which now are carrying into the iPhone 15. Now, thankfully, in the past year, that the emergency satellite services have been operating. I thankfully have not had to use them, but what is most exciting about this is the fact that it is there if you are in a car accident, if you're off the grid, and need service or help or you're injured, you'll easily be able to connect two satellites and get the help that you need. So now that it's been over a year, they have some new additional announcements to make. I'm so excited I got a chance to chat with Kaiann from Apple again. If you guys remember, I did an interview last year, chatting with some of the executives from Apple about all of the things, emergency satellite services. But now this year, we're back with some updates and some new news. They now have a partnership with AAA, and if you're not familiar with them, well, you will be shortly. I am so excited. It's so good to see you again. So this is the year anniversary of the launch from the iPhone 15. So how has it all been going and what news do you have for us today? - Sure, well, it's been going great. You know, I would say that iPhone, of course, has a wide range of safety features and this is just one of them. And it combines the ability of having great innovation across hardware, software, and infrastructure. And, of course, that stuff is so important when there's an emergency. And like you said, one year ago, we launched Emergency SOS via satellite and on the iPhone 14 and 15 models, it uses custom hardware and software components. It was the first in a smartphone to allow users to connect to a satellite and message with emergency service providers to get the help they need when they're outside of Wi-Fi or cellular service. And it's just been remarkable. I mean, just in the one year it's had an extraordinary impact, helping people all around the world in each of the 16 regions where it's launched for things like fire, medical emergencies, search and rescue, natural disasters. It's just been incredible to see that it's been able to help people get connected and get help where they need it. - Now, I think it's also really exciting. I got a chance to chat with Margaret from AAA. (computer beeping) - Well, AAA is delighted to be collaborating with Apple. Every second of every minute, of every hour, of every day, of every week, you get it. We are handling a road service call, 32 million times a year. And so now, Apple's technology puts, you know, that ability right in the palm of their hand. So we agreed with Apple that, listen, this service is too important with someone off the grid. (computer beeping) - You guys now have this AAA partnership. So how's that going? How'd that all come about, and how is this gonna help customers who now have this access to a whole new network? - For sure, you know, we saw so much impact helping in these emergency situations. So it turns out, a lot of emergency situations when you're off the grid actually have to do with help with your vehicle. And so this was a great opportunity to expand the capability and help even more people. And we partnered with AAA. They're North America's largest and most trusted membership provider service. They service like 30 million calls across North America for vehicle help. They're able to service a wide range of issues with vehicles, vehicle types like gasoline or electric vehicles. And they have this compelling, really great nationwide network, and they've been working to also shore up the support in remote areas where there is no cell service, so they can continue helping users, and they've been a great partner to work with. It's also great, because this is part of their vision for being able to help anywhere, wherever they are when they need help. And it's been great to work with them through our Road Side Assistance capability all through satellite at the same time. - Now obviously, I've seen this, I've visited you guys done the demos, but for anyone who has never seen this in action, can you kinda walk us through like what's this whole process like to actually get help if you are off the grid? - For sure, so what's great is that when you're in emergency, the first thing that you should do is call 911 and we will try to get you connected through your carrier, another carrier in the area. But if that doesn't work because you're off the grid, you will see a prompt on your phone that's right there that says, \"Emergency text via satellite.\" And you just tap on that and you're taken through a set of very simple questions to characterize your emergency. And that's based on real questions that emergency providers will wanna know, and that we will send your answers up through a satellite and we'll guide you very simply, pointing to the sky with a very simple UI interface to teach you how to stay connected. And we will send over your answers, your Medical ID if you have one set up, your location, which includes your elevation, even your battery life on your iPhone. So that all goes up there. And if you have an emergency contact set up through your Medical ID, they will even get to see a transcript as you go along with that conversation with emergency service providers. So it's super powerful and we've seen just some incredible results. I mean, just a few examples. In the past year, we had a man get rescued by helicopter after his car plummeted 400 feet off a cliff in Mount Wilson. And, you know, he ended up being rescued as part of a car accident. So we had crash detection working hand in hand with the Emergency SOS feature to get him connected to help to get him rescued. It's just been so amazing to see that the capability has been able to help people in their time of need and get them connected to these life-saving rescue teams. - I mean, that's really incredible and I think, you know, we've all been in that scenario where we haven't had cell reception and thankfully now, you know, on the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 15, this all has that satellite capabilities. And now with iOS 17, you guys have the new Check In feature. So I love that you're kind of updating the iOSs with, you know, all these different features that can take advantage of that. So how does the Check In feature kind of work with satellite as well? - Yeah, the Check In feature, as you said, is available on iOS 17, and allows you to, through messages app, let people know, like friends and family, that you have arrived safely at a location and there's a few settings that you can set up, just so that they know that you've arrived safely or if you're delayed, and you haven't answered your Check In on your phone, they'll also be notified. So it's a great another way to build on to these great safety features. We talked about crash detection, we talked about Medical ID. The other thing people are also using the emergency satellite service for is find my location updates. So even if it's not an emergency, they're able to use that when they're off the grid to let friends and family know where they are and that they're doing safe. And in fact, one of the great announcements that we have today is that, the Emergency SOS via satellite feature, last year, when we announced it on iPhone 14, we said the service was available for free for two years for iPhone 14 users. Well, we're thrilled to announce today that for these existing iPhone 14 users, we're extending that free service for an additional year for the emergency service SOS via satellite. - That's awesome, that's super exciting. And I think it is one of those things that you don't need on a day-to-day basis, but when you do, like you're gonna be so happy that it's available. - Definitely. We certainly hope that this will give our users that additional peace of mind that they have that additional capability for safety should they ever need it. - And I guess one last thing for anybody who is watching this, what are some safety tips that you can give them to make sure that they have updated on their phones to make sure that this is ready to go if they ever do need it? - Yeah, sure. We recommend updating your Medical ID as part of the Health app, so that, number one, even if you're not caught out of coverage, right? And having that information for first responders to come and be able to see if you have any allergies or special medication needs from your lock screen without having to unlock your phone if you're not able to do that. And also that setting up that emergency contact within Medical ID, that's the person who would get these notifications should you have crash detection or Emergency SOS via satellite being used. They would get those notifications and be able to see that transcript with either the emergency service provider or with the relay centers that are helping you real time in that emergency situation. And the other thing is, we also encourage people to try it out. You may not always be in a situation where you're off the grid, but what you can do is go into settings, Emergency SOS, and in there you can say, \"Try the demo.\" So you do have to be outside because while it's not a real emergency, it is connecting to those real satellites above you and it guides you through the process to connect to the satellite. And so it's just something good to be able to be familiar with yourself so that if you are in a real emergency, it's something that you already have some familiarity with and know how to do. - That's awesome, I definitely think everyone should test it out, because it is something that it is in that muscle memory. So once you've done it, you can see the whole interface and you'll be really comfortable if you ever, unfortunately, have to use it. - For sure, for sure. And that's why we built that demo in there so that, you know, when you're not in a real emergency, you still have the ability to understand how it works. It is very intuitive, but if you're the kind of person who likes to be prepared and check things out, it is in there for you to try out. - That's awesome, well, thank you so much and thank you again for coming to chat with me and also for extending an additional year for iPhone 14 users, 'cause I think it's gonna be an incredible feature and I'm so glad that you guys have this now available for everyone. - Absolutely. Thank you so much, Justine. - Yes, thank you. Bye. - Thank you. - Thank you guys so much for watching. I would love to hear from you. Has anyone actually had to use any of these satellite services? I have seen a bunch of articles and interviews with other people who have, and thankfully, it has been something that has came to the rescue and actually helped them when in need. And with that, I'll see you guys in my next video. If you wanna watch some more, I will put some here on the end screen. Bye.",

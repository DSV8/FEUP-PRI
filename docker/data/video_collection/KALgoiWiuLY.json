    "transcript": "Intel vs. AMD. (**Comment chicken nuggets for 10 bonus points**) it's that long heated debate between PC Builders, PC Gamers and Content Creators. How you decide in such a complex market as this is really the big question nowadays when Intel's finally given us kinda sort of an answer right to what we've been asking for and with response to Ryzen because Ryzen was an answer to Intel and Intel really had nothing for a long time to combat that but now that Intel does have something you have to start weighing out cost and value and it can all seem a bit overwhelming and that's why this video exists if you're on the fence about either hopefully we'll be able to clear it up for you stay with me to get rid of that annoying Windows activation watermark head on over to vip scd key and purchase a Windows 10 pro oem key for a fraction of the price of retail just use the secure payment method like paypal enter your product key into your PC settings window and say bye-bye to the watermark and be sure to use our offer code skgs for a sweet discount so here we go alder lake good stuff yeah Idon't think the die hard AMD fanboys can deny the sheer horsepower 12 gen Intel chips are packing but there are obviously a few problems namely with the platform constant optimization associated with the introduction of the new architecture see for those who aren't aware alderley utilizes a big little architecture similar in basic form to what you'd find in most cell phones today where some cpu cores are extremely powerful and others are extremely efficient in an effort to save battery life which really doesn't matter in the case of desktops because they don't have batteries except from maybe the motherboard bios battery cmos battery whatever and depending on the processes running at any given time these p and e cores trade off tasks to maximize power savings for as little performance loss as possible see Intel's been running a bit toasty lately they've been known to uh pull a few more watts and maybe what they say they do on paper and so to combat this to an extent again that's why the e cores exist so you have a bit of a weird nomenclature here it's no longer just like physical cores logical cores or logical processors you actually have to distinguish between which chords you're talking about here so p chords have hyper threading e cores do not which means that chips like the 12-700k and 12-900k have slightly unorthodox logical processor counts I was a bit skeptical of this design at first but the higher core count chips in particular seem to manage just fine I'm actually streaming on one right now and I've had really nothing but the occasional like file explorer hiccup or like the whole desktop will just kinda freeze for a few seconds Ihave to go in and restart the explorer and the task manager and then everything's fine again that's literally the only hiccup I've run into in an entire week of using the 12-900k in here and I'm on Windows 10 mind you not Windows 11 we'll talk about that a bit later and then there's the other elephant in the room games they absolutely love fast course and since most are sub optimized beyond 12 or so threads it means that even core i5 alder lake chips are performing incredibly compared to 11th gen Intel and even zen 3 cpus but here's where the water becomes a bit a bit brackish despite the fair prices of alder lake chips and Ithink most of us can agree these prices are fair with the exception of third-party scalpers their accompanying motherboards are still relatively expensive and at that the only available skus pre-2022 are those that are unlocked which means that we only have z690 chipsets to accompany those and because of that it means that if you want to adopt an Intel platform early on you have no choice but to pay more for the higher chipset higher end board that you might not really want out of the gate and of course the Intel fanboys will say oh what's because you can only buy the unlocked skus out of the gate too well okay and to that Isay it doesn't really matter what amd board you buy as long as it's not an a series board any b series board will allow you to overclock just the same as any x series counterpart so you have a bit more going for you there in the amd department Idon't really see any other argument that a team blue fan can have so if you're dead set on adopting new Intel platform going into 2022 which again Idon't really think is a bad decision you just have to weigh the pros and cons relative to when you were deciding to adopt Ipersonally don't think it hurts to wait a month or two for new boards and new cpus to hit the shelves this added diversity will likely affect product availability as well meaning we shouldn't see as many third party retailers flipping chips for several hundred dollars over retail particularly we're talking about the non k skus uh we'll even see some more f squeeze come out which are the ones that don't have igps all of this will kind of balance out that market a bit but the real kicker in the teeth at this point for me is ddr5 and it's being treated almost like graphics cards at this point and it's because there's so little of it in supply at the moment and there is a bit of demand early on uh the early adoption has its benefits sure but again Ithink that an obvious consequence is higher prices on account of initial manufacturing constraints of high entirely new processes basically so while ddr5 is extremely fast and again the new modules look appealing that's the whole point they want to make them look flashy so that you buy them Ibelieve it's in your best interest up front to avoid ddr5 if possible and opt for ddr4 motherboards supporting alder lake yes they exist and yes performance is still fantastic in our own briefings in fact with Intel they've cited very little difference in terms of performance especially in everyday tasks between the two memory generations this may obviously change as faster and more efficient dyes are produced but if you're looking for a 12th gen platform out of the gate your best bet in my book is to stick with a board that supports ddr4 and remember you cannot mix ddr4 and ddr5 on the same board even if it looks like everything fits snug which in theory it should because Idon't think the dimensions have really changed at all the pin out is totally different and that's no bueno and speaking of ddr4 and ddr5 be sure to check out team group's latest giveaway which you can join via the link in this

an email address to earn up to 10 discounts by a special coupon codes for your favorite team group hardware so be sure to click the link below for more details but anyway Ithink the fact that Intel chose to retain support for ddr4 in its alder lake architecture was an excellent decision it's likely they foresaw ddr5 shortages out of the gate and didn't want it hindering a launch they felt could stand on its own and it certainly does against the competition albeit at still higher generally power usages and temperatures the Intel still the hotter choice at least in my case the 1200k runs hotter than my 5950x which is a higher core count chip mind you now as for amd uh by this point you might be thinking well this is old news greg Imean we we want the latest and greatest and team blue has it Imean why would we look anywhere else and sure that's fine that tends to be how a lot of people think but is it the wiser choice from a budget standpoint see Ithink it's easy to cast aside any notions of value for the sake of obtaining the objectively best thing out there but you're always going to pay a bit of a premium for the best thing out there Intel knows that their chips are the best right now and they're pricing their products accordingly it requires little in the way of critical thinking and it makes you feel good for a little while sure until something better is released as is always the case with technology to be completely honest if it wasn't for the fact that much of what Ido here requires extensive long-term testing i'd still be on Ryzen likely far into 2022 the 5950x was incredible the 5900x is incredible especially for that price and and look it's still a very versatile architecture how amd managed to reduce quarter core latencies by increasing core count per ccx is just it feels as snappy as the ring bus in everyday use finally and absolutely slays it video editing thanks to an affinity for higher core counts Ihonestly can't think of a single issue Ihave with zen 3 to be frank with you apart from the fact that it at least now is no longer objectively the best all-around workhorse you know what that's okay it's fine it really is Imean look at what amd's done in response to alder lake's launch they have lowered their prices that's that's fantastic the 5900x and the 5950x have both been marked down by nearly 100 each over the past week now a part of this has to do with black friday and cyber monday but don't tell me that that timing is coincidental entirely because it's not Iexpect similar discounts to stick around until eol end of life that's the benefit of external competition we just haven't had much of that until recently so even if you're still for team red you're die hard you only see red and that's the end of it you can still thank your opponents for spicing things up a bit because it does help you as well in terms of price all we've been asking for is choice those of us kind of hovering in the middle those of us who have purchased based on value in the past have been cornered into red territory for quite a while and look that was fine and dandy because Ryzen's generally been great but with viable competition from across the aisle expect more frequent and aggressive pricing strategies from both camps going forward it's a win-win so Ithink either choice is a great one going into 2022 honestly it really just depends on what you're currently sporting and when you plan to buy if you've been sporting for example a Ryzen 5 2600 for a few years and you want something a bit juicier consider a 5600 or 5800x chances are you can still use the same board you're currently running with a bios update assuming it's like a x470b 450 board a lot of bios updates out there that will let you run little 87 processors with them you also won't need to swap ram and you won't need to deal with early adoption supply constraints where applicable which means prices are going to be generally competitive and since alder lake is fresh more or less it's unlikely we'll see any deals in the immediate and we didn't really see any during black friday cyber monday I'm not surprised it's a new product now if you're on something a bit older say a core i5 2400 or an amd fx 8350 you know in that ballpark maybe older than that your next platform will likely depend on other factors maybe power drop maybe sheer performance maybe even availability in your country you can also run a quick calculation in your head if alder lake maybe is anywhere between five or ten percent faster on average than zen three which it appears to be at least in my testing and others Ishouldn't be paying any more than about five to ten percent more for team blue's platform kind of makes sense right if you are then i'd be choosing zen 3 all day and if you aren't maybe it makes sense to pick alder lake and especially if you're going to be adopting Windows 11 earlier it seems to be a bit more future proof with regard to operating systems because those p and e cores are better optimized in Windows 11 I'm using Windows 10 so I've kind of stunned my growth a bit but Istill feel that there is a benefit here and in my testing the 1200k is actually a bit faster than the 5950x in Windows 10 in video editing so that's saying something created most of that work is now offloaded to the discrete card discrete graphics card but anyway Ireally hate using the phrase future proof because it's just it's just tossed around like it means nothing anymore but if you intend to stick with Windows 10 for a few more years maybe that's a case for you to stay with verizon since it doesn't really have Imean it doesn't really benefit you to upgrade to Windows 11 but if you are upgrading to Windows 11 and you're considering all their like Ithink that's a perfect match there are so many things you could be and probably should be accounting for and I'm just glad that uh we finally can have these deliberations again it feels good to talk like this although I've been talking a bit fast Iapologize I'm really excited to see what else Intel throws our way in early 2022 around their latest architecture uh but if it all turns out to be one big letdown Imean we still have verizon and that's you know it's not like verizon has even remotely sucked recently with that let me know how you feel about current state of affairs in the desktop cpu industry and yeah I'm looking forward to those conversations in the comments section if alder lake is on your radar let me know I'm curious if you just have been all about amd let me know and let me know why thanks for watching consider subscribing and i'll catch you next time my name is Greg thanks for learning with me should I just end it there okay I'm gonna end it there cool",

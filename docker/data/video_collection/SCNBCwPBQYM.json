    "transcript": "- Hi. I would like to introduce myself. I am Justine. I am the queen of rap, queen of pop, CEO of every company, creator of fire, creator of mankind. What else, have you guys said? (laughs) I do not even know, but you guys are absolutely out of control. Hello. Hi. I am on TikTok right now. I have been obsessed with TikTok for over a year, and somehow over the past, I do not know like, what, a week, a week and a half, there has been this weird phenomenon. Showing up in my, for you page. iJustine memes. - Did you really pay, what is this thing, like $500? - It was only 300, and I bought four of them, for every room that I would be in. I will take that, thank you. A lot of memes of some of my old videos, making fun of me, but also like not making fun of me, I am not really sure. I do not know what is happening either way. I am so here for it. Like honestly, the talent, the creativity, the genius, captions that you guys have been coming up with. With videos that I have made, over, 16 years ago? Like when people say like, I cannot even, I actually, I cannot even handle this. Me and my sister and all of my friends, we have been watching these, and some of these are like feature films that you guys have created on TikTok, I am so impressed. I have also been losing my mind because there is these videos that I have not seen, or in thought of, in so long that I, if you would have asked me if I made a video doing that, I probably would have said, no, I did not. I did not do that. Well, the proof is here, and it is on TikTok. So I wanted to react to some of these because some of you guys wanted to know if I had seen them. Yes, I have seen them. Yes. I love them. And I think that you guys, are incredibly talented. So let us go through, and look at some of the iJustine TikTok memes together. Entire fyp is iJustine, and this audio and I love it. Thank you Zach. I appreciate it. (laughs) Oh boy. Oh, oh, oh Did, did Kesha see this and get inspired, to create her music? She outsold Kesha with this, not Kesha copying a song. Oh my God, you guys are so, just, this is just, this is too much. Just broken into iJustine's house. Pretty sure that is an Apple store, but I see, I see where you are going with that. I mean like these, these videos are so old, like who is she? I do not even recognize this person. I do not recognize her. It is me. This was so long ago? I basically used the webcam of my laptop to make all of my first YouTube videos. But I think this video was actually the first one that I saw, and I, I thought that it was just going to be like a, super quick, little thing. No. This is a very, long video, especially by TikTok standards. It just goes on and on. I mean, this is like, this could be like a Broadway play. - Into 200 new colors - OMG you guys, I cannot wait to unbox all of these new iPhones for you. - Apple employees on the way to serve their queen, as iJustine enters the store. What did you create this way? I, as a professional video editor over the past 17, 18 years, this is skill. This is talent. You have outsold everyone. I have not. You, right here, with this edit. This is fire. - Abandon us like you do with every other phone, - The dialogue. - When a new one is released. - Yes, you are irrelevant now, and I have no further use for you. I will dispose of you, and your worthless friends. You no longer have any time on this earth, and you will never feel the touch of another human, or hear the sound of another voice. You have now been forgotten, and old memory of your existence has been wiped clean. You will not be missed. You are prehistoric technology now. Goodbye. - What? That was a monologue. iJustine on her way to the Apple store for the fifth time today, I do not speak French. I do not know what she is saying. This was a song that I, wrote for Siri. It was a love song. I do not know, I could have, let us forget that we did that. Someone, there is an Apple product down that cliff, Queen Justine. She jumps. She does, and she did. Somebody get my idol an iPhone. Oh geez. This is when the iPhones were all sold out. Look at those eyebrows. Can we just take a minute, or a second? I do not want to take much longer than that because, that my friends, was an eyebrow, mistake. iJustine trying to find loss phones in the ocean so she can review it. (whispers) Like what? iJustine on her way to get the three brand new iPhones, the AirPods and the new MacBook the second it releases. You are not wrong. Dancing her way into getting a new iMac. Like what are these? I cannot believe I posted this on the internet, first of all. Justine on her way to the Apple store. Five weeks before they released the new iPhone. (laughs) Like what? (laughs) Oh shoot, you know it. This might have been like one of the second, or third ones that I saw. Queen of rap. You cannot change my mind. I think anybody that watches this video can easily be swayed to know that, that is something I cannot claim. iJustine on her way to the Apple store when there is a new iPhone, also accurate. Live footage of iJustine after dramatic TikTok is collectively dragging her Apple obsession. (laughs) - Did you know about it? This is an ambush. I feel personally, (bleep) attacked. - Everyone digging out iJustine to get the new Apple product? You guys digging me out of my grave. Good. This is what I deserved. I did not deserve to be buried alive. Escape tonight. Look. Yeah, bring me back out. Bring me back out, so you can get the new iPhone. I do not think they necessarily run. Usually I do not buy my things at the store. I usually buy them online, so, you know, if I am coming into the store, probably, just to say, hi? My footage of, iJustine going to buy another iMac. (laughs) Oh my gosh. What? Oh my God. Yeah. I got into a little drama with Chrissy Teigan. I honestly was not attacking her, as a fan of Chrissy Teigan, I was just letting her know that, as a YouTuber, the things that she was saying was not quite reflective of the community. Like I really, I liked her, and then she attacked me, and I was like. (exclaims) What is this? iJustine waits in line for new iPhone. (laughs) Point of view. You are rich on Christmas. That song. I freaking love Taylor Swift. That is a good one. Just some lightsaber fun. What? What? What? What? It is like, you are not wrong. Justine's phone rings, but she has to search through 16,000 phones. She has to find which one it is. Some facts you did not know about me, okay. I am a model. That is not, that is not me. That is, that is not me. That is not even, kind of looks like, what is happening? (laughs) I am a wrestler. That is not too far off. That saw, the, this fits, a perfect for that. I might have to steal that, and redo it. How iJustine became the queen of Apple. (exclaims) (calm upbeat music) (whispers) This is a gem. I am commenting on this one. Truths. I need to start commenting on these is what I need to be doing. iJustine in the sewers, looking for loss AirPods to review. (laughs) What? Oh my God. Why is that so funny? And why is this so true? Why do I picture myself now running, to find the clearest sewer, to find some AirPods? iJustine secret song. Wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that be something? Just, Justine's the reason I have an iPhone, make America great 2024. (chuckles) Pics of iJustine from 2007. (upbeat music) (whispers) Oh my God. What am I even doing? What am I even, this is my first trip to LA. iJustine on her way to free Britney. Girl. I will get her out. She can stay with me. She can live with me. We would be besties, for sure. Introducing the new oat, iOatmeal 5G M1 500GB, 0 sugars. (laughs) So this was peak pandemic. I unboxed, some cream of wheat. Why? Truthfully, I am not sure. Okay. So this could, this is just, it is honestly never ending. I am so incredibly overwhelmed. There are so many of these. I do not even know what to say. The fact that you guys have been digging up some of my old videos, videos that I do not even remember happened, it is basically taking me back to, a time remembering why I started making YouTube videos to begin with, and it is one of the reasons that I love TikTok so much right now. TikTok, is sort of this place, where I feel like, people can be themselves. They can be silly. They can be creative. And it is where so many people are finding their voice. And that reminds me so much of the old school YouTube days. Seeing these old videos is really kind of making me remember what it was like then. Why I started making videos. I honestly started making videos because, I grew up in a very small town, and the things that I liked, there was not a lot of people around, that really, was like into computers or into video games. And when I found the internet, I found like this massive community of people, that liked the same things that I liked. Now, we were all in the same area, but with the internet, it felt like I had found my community. I had found friends, even if they were virtual, and far away, and you guys have played such huge part in that, and, just knowing that so many of you have grown up watching my videos, and even meeting some of you, back in the very beginning days, like the first VidCon, and seeing you now many years later, like you are all grown up, you guys are in college, you have careers, you have jobs, you have families. It is really crazy how much has changed in the landscape of the internet, and in people's lives, over the past 16 years. And I am so appreciative that so many of you are still here. Some of you new, some of you old, maybe some of you guys right in the middle. Either way, thank you again for watching. And I hope that, someday you will see me vlogging from the retirement home. But the good thing, is I have a feeling that by the time I am in the retirement home, I am going to have some other Youtuber, or content creator friends there. And we will probably live stream our retirement home endeavors. Oh, shoots. All right. That is it. I will see you guys in my next video, or, maybe I will see you guys on TikTok. Bye. (upbeat music)",

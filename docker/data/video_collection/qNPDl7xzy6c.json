    "description": "Check out Jared's channel for the drone unboxing videos!:  The two newest drones to enter into the aerial flight game are the DJI Mavic:  and the GoPro Karma. As soon as I heard these two drones announced, I knew I had to make a camera comparison to help people decide which drone is best.   Both of these cameras are set to 4K resolution, 30 frames per second, and each camera has the same bit-rate, interestingly enough. 60Mbs. The footage you see from the cameras is the EXACT same as it was filmed. It has not been edited, or downsized or stabilized.  4K is 4K, and that is how I will present the footage.  Let me know what you think! Which camera wins? Let me know in the comments!!! What is the best drone of 2016? What drone do you want for Christmas?

    "transcript": "Today we have two drones. We have the DJI Mavic and we have the GoPro Karma. Im here with Jared Mecham. We just barely unboxed these drones on Jareds channel. Ill give a link for that down in the video description. Jared, what are we doing right now? [Jared] We are going to go take a quick camera comparison, right after unboxing these to see how they stack up against each other. [Zack] Cameras, side by side. Gotta tell me which camera you think is best in the comments below. Lets get started. [Music playing] [Zack] Alright, that was way fun. [Jared] I loved it. It was sweet. [Zack] What did you think, your first time flying the drones? [Jared] Well Ive only had the Phantom 4well DJI drones to compare from, and my initial thought was that the GoPro Karma was a lot more gradual. Its smooth in its turning and its a little bit slower and a little bit more wobbly when its hovering. [Zack] Ok. Yeah, I did notice that the Mavic was a little bit more stable than the GoPro. [Jared] Yes, like when we were taking off here, it was solid as a rock. The Karma was a little bit teeter-tottery. But while youre turning, like getting, like, shots, the Karma was just smooth as butter. [Zack] Yeah. I also noticed that your lensso on thecuz you were flying to GoPro, I was flying the Mavic. On the GoPro lens, it was actually like a much wider angle so you get a lot more things in your shot. [Jared] Absolutely, yeah. And just in the display, you used your iPhone display to look at. I used the GoPro Karma controller. Your color gamut was way bigger; I mean you could see a lot more rich colors. But ultimately it will come down to what you guys see on the screen. [Zack] So he was using the screen that came with the GoPro Karma. If you want to see all of the other accessories that come with the Karma and the Mavic, go check out Jareds channel: Jared Mecham on YouTube. Ill do a link down in the video description. And you can see us unboxing both of the drones. Now that weve done the side by side comparison let me know what camera you think looks best. Go off of the stabilization, the color and the definition of the footage. Ill leave a poll in the upper corner that you can answer there and answer down in the comments. Thanks a ton for watching. Well see you around. [Jared] Bye!",

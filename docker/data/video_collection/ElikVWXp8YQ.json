    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and I'm here with Jenna and today I thought we would do a really fun video. I think it's going to be fun. - It's going to be a great time. - We're doing a blindfold tech test. Not a taste test, oh well I guess I could taste it. - It could help. - Jenna is going to go find some things in my tech closet and I'm going to put my blindfold on and I'm going to try to figure out what it is. - How many items we're going to do, like five? 10? - Ah whatever you feel, whatever you're feeling, Jenna - Okay, and if you, guess them all... - I'll guess them all - Well is the like any.. - Incentive? - Incentive, like consequences? - Well, do you want to make some? - I don't know? - Do you want money? - Whenever you guess incorrectly is mine (claps) - Love it. - Let me go and get some up, we shook on it. - We shook on it. Wait. No, we didn't. - Oh my gosh, - We verbally, agreed - This is a contract. Why you shaking my head for ? - She agreed! [SOMBER OCHERSTRATION] - Alright, I think we got some things, I've got stuff in my pants, this, this, okay, you have your head your, you have your blindfold on?. - Yap. - Okay. No peeking. Alright, so we're back. We've got the items, we shook on it. There was a verbal agreement, I think that if you didn't get it, that it's mine. - I don't like this. We can't, we can't guess it, it's coming over to my house. So, you're going to have to guess if possible, like the make, the model, the year - Oh the year? - Like the type, if you know what that certain type of thing is if it's going to make sense, it might make sense. Okay. First up. Watch your those fingers. [SOFT MUSIC] - Oh, this is the, Oh, I a hundred percent. I already know what this is. This is the, ah it's the Xbox, the ahhh - Don't look at me I'm going to tell you, - I can't even see you anyway - Come on think about it. - Its the gears five. - Yeah (CLAPPPING) - Definitely cause it has the, like the frozen marks on it. - Okay, Put your hand out. - This is the DJI Osmo underwater - How do you know that? - Cause I know, cause i freaking know, - I thought - It is a - Weird. Not weird but like I saw it and I'm like, what the heck is this? All right. We're going to give you, this. You're going to be able to get all of these you freak. All right. Next up Remember, you have know as much information as possible. - They're the razor. - No [BUZZER SOUNDS] - Really? - No, you're lucky I'm not going to want these. Cause they were probably in your slime little ears. Come on, go back to the case. - So you knew what these are - No , it' too late. These are the Air Pods with the vintage finish on them. - They are, but you were wrong - I thought you were trying to trick me. - No, okay next up - I , so I can't say what it is I need a really focus on it. [VOCALIZING] - Oh, this is the Apple floppy drive from the 1984 Mac that we - Hey you're lucky I also don't want that. But you were also correct. You're weird. This is, I mean, I feel like maybe I should have given you a more practical thing. Alright. Next up on the list. - Sounds like a phone that you touched. - You sound like a phone that I touched. - Oh You gave me something different. Oh okay, These are the - If you know the name of them, you get a bonus point. - Shoot. I don't remember this, There's so many headphones. - If you know the name, you get a bonus point because I've always miss that one letter, I would always mix it up the actual headset, compared to the I'm not gonna say the other word because you got all wrong. Come on What are they called? What are they called? You don't have to know. Cause I, I always have look. - No, these were the ones that we got at that event. Yeah? - I can't look at you with this, nob coming out of you head I'll give you a hint. The WF 1000 X blank, blank - I don't remember what they're called. - They are the Sony, - They are the Sony , the - XM three XM three, I don't remember - Me either. That's why it was a tricky let's - What is this? So what do you think like, Oh Elon Musk's second child's name. - He changed it, they changed the - Yeah they have to legally because, they couldn't put the numbers, they made a roman numeral - This is a good one. This could be potentially one of your favorite pieces of tech ever to exist. You ready? - Yes. Oh my God , it's my label maker [LAUGHING] You guys are on. - Okay I'm doing a - This is a hand held one - Yeah. - I saw the big boy in the corner over there on the corner. I was like no, because she's probably been looking at that one forever. - Okay, am not sure What I should give you next. - You don't actually know? [VOCALIZING] [SOFT MUSIC] This is a challenge - We may have stopped the master, who couldn't tell what Air Pods were. Ooh the roast. Yeah, I know. That's insane. That's crazy. - Take a bite. No, don't don't do it actually. Oh my gosh. We have stumped her. Can't believe this is to be mine in 10, nine, eight, seven , six, five , four, three, two, one. What is your final guess, oh she can't see the microphone. - What the heck is this? What is this [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] - Apparently the timer doesn't mean anything. [LAUGHING] You have to guess. We can't stay here all day. What if I gave you the color of it? - Yeah, - Pink - Oh, Ohhh is it the, uh [LAUGHING] is it the iPod ? the shuffle? - Yeah [LAUGHING] - I think Oh, that was a long, tricky one. - Yes, I don't want I'll tell you later how I figured that out It's private. We don't want, Oh, it's private. - You'll tell me - I'll tell you later. Okay. Next device. Oh, I forgot you can't see - Okay. I already think, I know what this is, this is the satellite phone. It's the big Garmin. - Yes, it is. How many times have you carried that around and thankfully didn't need it? - Now? I have to. - I know. Okay. - Ah it's the super drive. - Yeah - Yeah I mean you know what that is, but you didn't know what an iPod was. - Okay, so hold on a second, the iPods I thought this was a trick. Like why would you give me a set of Air Pods when you know, I would know what that is - I think it's iPod - iPod? - What's silly, You barely know. Okay. Next. - Do I have to know the make and model? - Yeah, you do And you should be able to tell, - I know it's a surface book or surface a surface is the surface. It's a surface. - Okay. Come on, come on. - Well, it's definitely a surface. I don't know which model , it's not the surface go. - No, - It feels it's too big. - Okay. Is there anything that you could like check to see? Like a specific model would have? We'll be here forever What's your final guess? - I mean, it's the surface - What you doing to me? Oh Ooh, [LAUGHING] - There we go. - I don't remember where this was. - The Surface Pro X. - You know, you don't. You have a point. - Oh, come on - There you go. You just need that extra little push. You'll get like maybe half a point. Okay, - What is that yours then? Or is it half yours? It's yours? No, I have one. - Oh, this is heavy boy. Oh, okay I already know what this is. - What happened to the back of it? I know this is, I know this is a Mac book. - I think it exploded. - This is Oh, no, it's the battery. - I don't know. I don't actually have the answers. - This doesn't feel good. - It feels very, very bad. Do you have fire insurance? Oh, I've given her, don't, get that weapon away from me. Hmm - That's unsafe that's a little unsafe. We're going to just move. Okay. There's one more. Put your little hands out. - Sounds like a pen. What is this? Oh, it's the, the first iPhone. - Okay. How many? How many gigs? - Eight. - What's the model number? - Oh get the [ BUZZER SOUNDS] LAUGHING] - What can we do? - That's fun. Are we done? - Yeah. I thought I have anything else? I didn't think you were going to get the DJI weird thing. - That one was so easy for me. I couldn't believe it. - I didn't know, if you hand me that I'd be like, what is this? I don't know what this is - Well, Jen, thanks for making my videos, this was really fun. So what are you getting to take home with you? - Well, today I'm taking home half of a surface pro X and a full thing of the retro Air Pods. - Anyway. Thank you guys for watching. Go check out Jenna's channel. She's also a Twitch streamer. - Oh God. - I mean, I don't know if I am. I mean, it might be, - I've been streaming on Twitch, cause I've been playing so many video games. I mean, I should make this like work. - Alright. - Okay. - I'll see you guys later. - Literally stuck - Am stuck too , you guys like my flippers flippers, slippers - Your flippers, look at this foot, squish my toe - Look at this stuff. Isn't it neat. Wouldn't you think my collection's complete. I've got gadgets and gizmos of lunch. [LAUGHING] [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC]",

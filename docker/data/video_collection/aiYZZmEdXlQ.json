    "transcript": "[Lew] Face towards the product eyes, towards the lens. Okay, what do you do mouth closed yeah? How do you do it, how do you express shock without the mouth being closed? I feel like I'm constipated This is harder than it looks Okay, I'm just gonna do it because that's what we do here Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. And I normally don't unbox things, but I'm in environments where things are unboxed Unboxy place okay iPhone 10 I did not want to do a video in these things because I want to experience these products like a consumer It's some serious stuff But here I am unboxing these things for the world's worst iPhone 10 unboxing. Okay. I'm just gonna crack these open and See what is up, so I actually haven't seen a single video on these things sorry Jon, sorry Lou but I Wanted to see right. I'm excited about these phones These are one of the first proper products have been like amped about since I started doing YouTube. That's the thing as a youtuber You get a lot of stuff and it's cool to get cool things But you lose that that connection with a new product the new toy that comes in you just you lose that That joy that comes with it, and I wanted to feel it again with the item content, so here. We are Space Gray black whatever they call it and white or silver now the phone I'm using right now is the essential phone and I'm a huge soccer for this phone because of the screen the Somewhat bezel was screen and Really Yeah, but there's gotta be phones that are like like those like those like Asian was like dude II know What's this one iPhone 10 Cool So how good is that unboxing you guys want to see more of this on my channel? He subscribed should I just should I just keep going going? Yeah, but come on power chapter sit down Tell me how is it done as a nun as a professional? Versus unboxer first of all first of all you need to take it down a notch because your Husband's feet I mean you're scaring people in this video and audiences as well. They're very It's upsetting your tone is upsetting. Okay. It's stirring up all kinds of strange feelings for me in various body parts How are they still using lightning cable?

It's kind of strange, but then again It would look terrible if it was white The screen is not as like white as I was expecting the color temperature in is that me is it the whites I don't know man, I saw people on Twitter saying that the the eight displays a little nicer than this one I Mean those are just people and really those are just people on Twitter at all I remembered like the the first impressions people are saying It was supposed to be like this is what you buy this for these are nice boxes though You're all that the boxes. I know well like I'm just saying let's see how they put the little silver edge in there There's some attention. Okay. I've decided The color I'm going with is the black it's this silver man.

    "transcript": "the modern laptop ecosystem has stagnated in design with most species opting for a Sleek minimalist design mimicking the primary reproductive traits of the alpha in the biome however due to environmental factors the species in one biome still offers a wide variety of primary characteristics and in today's video we'll examine one of these specimens from the AliExpress biome [Music] hey I see box tape man's diversifying their portfolio to laptop packaging as well good for [Music] them ooh computer notebook that sounds fancy oh I'm so glad for that sign I was about to practice my Irish folk dancing on it but now I know better wow that is surprisingly standard looking laptop packaging wo that's a lot of accessories we do get a very cheaply made USB to ethernet adapter and we also get a gaming mouse with it for some reason which is weird cuz I don't think this is a gaming laptop as you'll see from the power brick we got with it I know laptop Hardware is efficient but this 2.5 amp wallwart looks like something you use to power an RGB stre not a gaming laptop oh it's like a laptop bag that's also a very nice inclusion I guess oh there's more stuff wow that is the thinnest mouse pad ever but it's the thought that counts with E-Waste you know and the final accessory was a little booklet detailing all of the various terrible things that can happen to you while using a laptop wow that is quite a laptop it looks just just really good in terms of IO it's got a bunch on the back which I really like although it's got a mini HDMI port on the back which is real stupid why would you do that on the left side there there is nothing and then on the right side which in my opinion is the wrong side to have the I/O but at least we do get some more we've got a USB port a 3.5 mm headphone jack and what looks like a micro SD card slot and the next to that we have what is oh it's the webcam that is honestly quite an interesting idea but it immediately seems pretty stupid because I mean you're going to lose the crap out of that but other than that physically the laptop is quite amazing looking it's got a bit of an F-117 vibe to it with the kind of angled panels and stuff and they didn't fall into the Trap of just painting it black they decided to paint it a pretty bad gray instead although we do get a peel with it oh yeah that was good here is the bottom of our laptop it's got a glory hole on it I think this may be the first laptop that I've seen in a very long time that comes with an upgrade glory hole I'm I'm going to taper my excitement a bit here because it does look like it's just for like an m.2 upgrade so I don't think you're going to be able to use this to upgrade the RAM but it's better than nothing I'm still excited by that uh aside from that it's it's there's not a whole lot under here does it pass the one hand open test kind of I guess and then under there we have I think this is the form factor that all trackpads should be it's like an ultrawide trackpad but the main selling point as far as I understand of this laptop is the keyboard that is a mechanical keyboard on a laptop that cost about $500 Canadian now we do sacrifice quite heavily with a lot of the specs but we'll look at that a bit later key cap should pop out they do now obviously the keys have very little travel cuz you know it's a laptop keyboard but what's interesting to me is that it doesn't clatter and ring in the way the cheap mechanical keyboards often do this is a surprisingly solid keyboard for a laptop I'm excited to take it out and have a closer look at it but other than that the listing is very misleading because if you look at the pictures of the laptop there are these big powerful looking front firing speakers which is a big part of why I was excited to check out this laptop but when you look at the laptop in person they're just these two bits of plastic yeah this is like McDonald's level expectation versus re reality oh I almost forgot I do want to test the webcam situation so you kind of pull it out of the slot and then I think it just does it wow that is that how it sits oh that's such a bad implementation before firing up the laptop to see what kind of specs we're working with there was one thing left for me to [Music] do oh it's got a Celeron n5105 in it which does help explain its price somewhat so this is not going to game well at all despite it really looking like a gaming laptop other than that we have 16 gigs of RAM which does seem to be in dual Channel when it comes to the storage they formatted it into three tiny partitions for some reason it's a bit weird I then noticed something else which may be a bit of a problem for the gaming performance is that its native resolution this last laptop basically has a 4K display in it that Celeron is going to have a real tough time gaming on this display on the bright side it is wildly sharp despite being real impressed by the display nothing could prepare me for what happened next wait why does it come with music on [Music] [Applause] it whoa that was unbelievably loud wait I need to get a DeBell meter out for [Music] that okay that was well over 100 DB that is actually legitimately crazy what in the world I mean don't get me wrong the quality is horrendous and it sounds like you're being attacked by ice piic but 107 DB Peak that's not even the front-facing speakers it's coming from under there what to put this into perspective a zephrus M16 a laptop with pretty good speakers tops out at 70 DB with this track whereas the AliExpress laptop measured at the same distance Peaks at over a 100 and considering that the decibel scale is logarithmic that's more than 8 times as loud and apparently we hear a 10 DB increase as a doubling in loudness so the AliExpress laptop has three times the perceived sound volume which meant the obvious next thing to do was jump scare Anna with it comes with really weird music on it think if you want to hear yeah oh oh that's sound my God it's aside from the Sandpaper to the eardrum music it did also come with a movie trailer on it oh no way it's Ice Age oh and the webcam implementation was less than impressive hey it does actually function what happened to does okay it doesn't it doesn't work through that which is a bit disappointing the connection is quite fickle like if you hit your table it stops working which isn't ideal but you know that's a terrible webcam my word with that it was time for some 4K sellon gaming ooh very nice a 1080p normal settings we're getting about 25 frames per second in GTA 5 and the little Celeron isn't even bottlenecking its IG GPU which is very impressive it's pretty cool that they include 16 gigs of RAM uh just out of the box with this laptop it's really helping us get this smooth cinematic gaming for 1080p this is a little bit better than I was expecting from the cellon but remember 1080p isn't the native resolution of this display so let's see how the ceron handles that okay so 10 frames per second not seem very impressive but remember this is almost 4k on the kind of CPU that would get bullied in a computer lab at an old age home it it's genuinely going better than I was expecting oh yeah csgo 2 does not like these little cerons very much apparently but it does have a secret weapon for this kind of thing Fidelity FX so we can drop this to balance that didn't help at all the CPU is very much the problem in this situation I I guess it makes sense this is a bot match so the laptop is having to deal with that as well but either way even a 1080p low settings with Fidelity FX on CS goo 2 doeses not like the little Celeron very much 120 milliseconds of latency between frames is not something you want in a game like csgo at which point I tried both Battlefield 5 and cyber Punk both both of which refused to launch on the little Celeron but there was one more game I wanted to try before tearing the laptop down I don't know I feel like it's lying to us I don't think this is six frames per second csgo was just running at six frames per second and it it didn't feel like what's happening here oh yeah oh so cinematic okay no we need to try it at the native resolution maybe we'll get it even slower Mo yeah this is way better I feel like this is actually the way you're meant to play Doom Eternal cuz the slowmo really helps you line up your shots with that let's tear down the laptop I'm really curious to have a closer look at this keyboard this is a big day get to use a glory hole very [Music] excited two screws in a little motion with my wrist and just like that we've got access to our m.2 Drive aside from some semic captive feeling screws and weird cracking sounds removing the rest of the bottom was relatively undramatic this bottom plate is metal very flimsy feeling metal but it is metal under here you can tell this's very little actual laptop we've basically just got like a cell phone interior here which they were nice enough to give us upgradable storage on having said that this is quite a substantial cooling solution for a Celeron which is good but most of the laptop is taken up by that mechanical keyboard which I think we'll get to by doing screws through the other side and then here are our speakers which I want to have a closer look at because they do go remarkably loud even if they do sound like you're having a a night terror the speakers were just part of the plastic battery assembly and they just look like laptop speakers I guess with a janky enough tuning you can get anything to hit 100 DB when it comes to removing the keyboard I had to pull out a whole bunch of key caps on the front to access the screws hidden under them and after unplugging a couple ribbon cables the key keyboard left free hey there we go here is the PCB they soldered all of the switches to you can see we've got our little LED backs there it uses three ribbon cables to connect to the laptop two of which are these tiny annoying ones on the other side we've got a metal base plate under the switches which I think is one of the reasons the keyboard feels so rigid when typing on it and why it doesn't ring and stuff this keyboard just takes up so much space in this laptop it's the reason why they could just fit a seler on in here and why we have this ultrawide little trackpad thing what makes this laptop so fascinating is that it's the product of completely different priorities than what you normally see in laptops whoever made this thing clearly just loves mechanical keyboards and high pixel density displays over all else and it was an interesting experiment who would have thought that the best laptop keyboard I've ever interacted with would be on a $500 Canadian doll AliExpress laptop oh and it even had an upgrade glory hole on it anyway with that subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one and until the next one [Music] bye-bye",

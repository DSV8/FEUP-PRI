    "transcript": "what does an advanced economic keyboard look like actually what is an ergonomic keyboard well it's a keyboard designed to minimize muscle strain and compliment a comfortable posture for people who spend a dangerous amount of time in front of a screen typing and typing and typing and typing you get the idea now there are different types of ergonomic keyboards in the market and here's a quick glimpse of what they look like what I'm interested in is this split keyboard and there's a reason for that today Logitech is announcing the Ergo K860 and they designed this to offer a natural typing experience while also delivering all the wireless features Logitech is known for now this is my very first organ amah keyboard and I have spent quite a while testing this guy and haven't used it extensively I've got to admit I might have to end up ditching my entire mechanical keyboard collection because this is the most comfortable keyboard I've tried yet but allow me to explain right after this the new cooler master master mouse 7:10 a weird name but damn this thing is good with an ultra lightweight body it's only 53 grams for excellent flick control and the aim correction the ultra weave cable is awesome for Wireless like feel the ambidextrous shape for me personally is super comfortable and then like the shorter body plus the glide is smooth thanks to white PTFE feet enjoy the domination with an excellent optical sensor and despite the funky name the cooler master mm 710 is legit check it out the low all right so let's get pricing out of the way it's $130 us which is actually a lot in fact it's $30 more than the MX keys which is another one of my favorites when you compare to other split economic keyboards it's also way too expensive now I'm not an expert when it comes to reviewing organ AMA keyboards as I mentioned earlier this is my very first economic keyboard and so naturally I was concerned about a few things and the first ones obvious the learning curve get it the curve so how long does it take to comfortably type on a split layout without making a thousand errors typing up a sentence also is it really that comfortable and is it something that's worth considering if you value your typing experience and that's an important one so let's begin with the learning curve believe it or not I picked up my pace after spending just a few hours with his keyboard but that might not be the same for you I gave Mike the chance to get used to this keyboard but he still hasn't quite adjusted to it yet in fact he just straight-up told me that this isn't a keyboard for him and that's okay I don't constantly look down on my keyboard for letters when I'm typing up something I've memorized most of the key positioning so I could easily get them Mike on the other hand is not a touch typist because sometimes he uses his left hand to hit Y and the right hand to hit be the problem here for him is to split design because the keys are separated and he has to look down for guidance I still make a few errors here and there with B and n because they're spaced wider compared to the other rows but that goes to show that I don't have all the keys memorized in my head some people take typing courses and so over time they become touch typist meaning they don't have to look down for guidance because they've basically programmed the key positioning to their head and it's basically muscle memory they can easily adjust to another keyboard within a matter of just you know a few minutes and we've verified this with a typist so if you fall into that category you don't have to worry about getting used to this new layout coming from a standard keyboard but I have to warn you going back to a standard keyboard takes even longer to readjust if you're not a touch typist I'm already starting to have issues typing on my notebook because I'm making more typos than before and that freaks me out not to mention we review a lot of hardware and keyboards fall into that category so if I were to switch to another gaming Micanopy board for review well that's gonna take long it's gonna be challenging to get used to the standard layout which I know seems odd but it is true now let's switch gears and talk about ergonomics because this is where things get a lot better if you pay close attention to the center portion of the frame you'll notice that the keyboard is slightly curved and elevated this was done to promote a natural posture when typing while also reducing pronation for your wrists you see if you take a standard keyboard for instance it's a flat surface with a bunch of keys on it and when you're preparing to type you'd naturally rotate your wrists to adjust to that flat surface and this could cause carpal syndrome and a whole other list of strain injuries for a lot of people I've certainly experienced this in the past when I'm glued to a screen for days editing a video or typing up a script or structure like this thing is I really haven't paid close attention to these issues until I started using the ERG okay 860 because this keyboard sort of helped me reevaluate the way how I use peripherals to get work done and I'm sure a lot of you can relate to that because this keyboard offers a supreme experience when typing without applying any stress to your muscles and it's just perfect another thing I noticed is that my wrists we're not deviating that much when compared to typing on a standard keyboard it's basically sitting still with my fingers doing the work for the most part and that to me was just fascinating and this is again thanks to that split keyboard design the other comfort factor is the wrist rest and I cannot emphasize this enough it makes a world of a difference when you're typing for hours and Logitech has made a few tweaks here you get the standard memory foam along with a higher density foam on top followed by a stain resistant easy to clean fabric it's just really comfortable guys you just have to take my word for it now keep in mind that this wrist rest is not detachable and I'm ok with that because you need to find a place to rest your Athena and hypothenar to rest comfortably to type on this keyboard in the first place but the downside is that this is a pretty big keyboard I mean here's a shot compared to the MX keys which is fairly compact I'm a little worried about the wear and tear of this wrist press because given that it's attached to the keyboard you know we know the natural oil is a thing not really sure how this long this is gonna last because if this gets completely worn out then you might have to end up replacing the entire keyboard because like I said it's one unit now right underneath the palm rest logitech has implemented palm lift which comes in two step increments and this comes in handy when you're typing in a standing position just so you get that optimal straight hand posture especially with sit stand s being really popular these days I have to really invest in one of those in fact if you have any suggestions on a great sit stand desk let me know in the comments down below the keys themselves are great it uses the same mechanism as the MX keys so you get a solid faster and pretty tactile experience with a respectable amount of travel distance I love the fact that they kept it low profile but there is one big problem and then is this keyboard does not have a be back running which is really odd because if you look at the MX Keys that cost 30 Lars less it comes with smart backlighting with ambient sensors so this feature I mean the lack of this feature is certainly gonna be a deal-breaker for a lot of people out there but Mike brought up a valid argument if you're a touch typist you would necessarily be interested in something like this because you wouldn't need to look down guidance but I guess that's a topic for another day but really they should have included LED backlighting in this keyboard in the first place because 130 dollars not getting that feature it's I mean it's really a missed opportunity from Logitech and I'm disappointed in that coming back to the basics I like the design of the ergo cage 60 the graphite color matches really well with the master 3 and I like the contrast the palmers offers the keyboard layout is essentially a copy and paste from the MX keys literally every single key is the exact same - to split in the center you still get a numpad which is cool this is a wireless keyboard and it runs off to triple-a batteries now you might be thinking to yourselves well that's kind of dumb but I'm actually ok with that because battery life supposedly is set to last for up to two years which is great and that makes sense because you don't have LED backlighting or any smart fancy ambient sensors it's just a keyboard that can be paired via low-energy Bluetooth or the unifying reciever and it's both Windows and Mac compatible so it's a very simple plug-and-play solution and it's also one less charging cable to worry about it still features easy switch meaning you can switch between three different devices instantly also it has Logitech flow support and if you recall watching my MX keys videos you know how I love that feature just having to work with multiple systems this ecosystem is pretty amazing the last thing to go over is the driver software is very simple just like the MX keys and the master 3 as you can see I've paired all three of them using one unifying receiver and it works flawlessly jumping into customization you can program the top function row to any command that you desire and there is a load of options at launched I guess pre-built already you can also switch the f1 to f12 keys to standard mode right over here and you can check battery status at the bottom so the question that needs to be answered here is who is the ergo key 860 targeted towards in fact should you consider upgrading to it if you're someone thinking about switching from a standard keyboard to an I'm a keyboard skip this because at $130 it is just way too expensive for an upgrade because you can spend a lot less on Amazon and try out an ergonomic keyboard to see how you'd like it I mean the learning curve might take a while to get used to and you might even not end up liking it at all so that would be a little bit of a downside if you decide to pick this out so start with something basic see how you like the style and then potentially maybe consider this one or two years down the line now if you are using an existing organ on keyboard and if you're thinking about upgrading to something with more features like logitech flow and wireless freedom then the Ergo k 860 could be a great option though you need to consider a few things one it doesn't come with LED backlighting I think that's my biggest drawback or my biggest problem with this keyboard but for touch typists it might not be a deal-breaker also I'm not a huge fan of the price at $130 it is just way too expensive so if you can find this for less than 100 bucks on sale then it is something that's worth considering now do I see myself switching to this as my daily driver moving forward absolutely because it's just really comfortable to type on and I love the fact that you get a natural typing posture without stressing your wrists and not to me is definitely a welcome addition but I am concerned about going back to a standard keyboard because if I'm reviewing a mechanical gaming keyboard in the next in the next few weeks or something then man it's gonna be a tough call so that's that's what it is guys let me know what you guys think about the Ergo cage 60 from logitech is it something that you're interested in in fact if you are using an organ on the keyboard let me know the comments down below what you're using and what your experience is like I mean both horican axe thank you so much watching make sure to

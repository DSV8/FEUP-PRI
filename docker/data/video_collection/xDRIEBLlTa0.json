    "transcript": "I may have bought another stupid thing off TEMU this time I bought an X book and I'm pretty sure that a 300ish Canadian dollar laptop off a retailer that primarily specializes in whatever plastic crap fell off the back of the delivery truck this week is going to be real special so let's check it out but first today's video is sponsored by Deep Cool's new digital series of AK coolers it's the same AK coolers we've come to love with their amazing thermals low noise and very easy installation process but with some added tasteful digital flare look at that very much not obnoxious digital temperature readout flexing the cooling power of our AK 620 check out deep Cool's digital series AK coolers using the link in the video description thank you deep cool for sponsoring today's [Music] video [Music] amazingly this laptop actually didn't come wrapped in several layers of ocean plastic which is a nice touch and apparently it's from Germany ooh fancy wait so does that mean it's made of like BR and there's some of the obligatory package negligence on the back I was actually worried initially that there wasn't any but it's [Music] here in this first little box we get a cool power adapter that looks a little bit like a cell phone charger wow that is a 24 WT power brick so this x book is really not very powerful but we're obviously still going to try game on it wow the coup X book does look suspiciously like a rebranded fake MacBook Air which I'm sure means it'll just be a gaming Beast and the specs do corroborate the gaming Beast Theory with an Intel Celeron J 4125 inside I don't think I've actually gamed on one of these before I'm curious to see how that's going to go and aside from the 14in 1080p display what's kind of concerning to me is that there are also Linux versions of this laptop I really hope this is the windows version cuz I don't want a pseudo app get nothing and then finally this is a middle of the- pack 8 gig variant we get a nice heavy envelope in the Box I'm assuming with like warranty stuff in it now I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure that's a picture of a MacBook Air right there other than that it is just a bunch of warranty crap [Music] nice that I'm not going to lie smells kind of like an Apple product it's got that artificially injected neutral clean smell to it which is interesting usually you pay hundreds of dollars for that smell and then we get what looks like a very gamery logo for the little coup wow there is some Deja Vu looking at this laptop the silver plastic reminds me quite a bit of that chewy laptop I had a look at like 2 years ago the I/O on the right side of the laptop aside from the USB and microphone headphone jack has a nice professional touch with the micro SD card slot ooh and on the left next to the tiny little power jack and USB 3 Port is the horrendous mini HDMI port I really hate these but it's a thin laptop I they probably wouldn't have been able to fit a full-sized one here so on the one hand it's a herpes connector on the other hand at least there's a connector although on the bottom we do have something very exciting I think this is only the second time I've seen it on a new laptop a glory hole look at that that looks like an m.2 glory hole that's a bit small for my liking but it's more than enough to accommodate me other than that there's very little room for ventilation on the back but we do have a seller on it here so that doesn't really matter to be honest uh let's see if it passes the one hand open test I like how the little internal cloth bit is hanging out like just BW me from a sandwich i' I've never seen that before normally they actually have them the correct size very much not yeah if you're far enough away and squint hard enough it does really look like a little MacBook I haven't interacted with the chewy laptop in ages but that is exactly how I remember its keyboard feeling it has quite a big trackpad with reasonably nice little clickies to it the front firing speakers are that those aren't actual holes those are just little stickers that they stock on there that is some real nice attention to detail there I like that a lot oh yeah good peel around the edge of the display we've got this like fake carbon fiber effect sticker I'm not going to try and pull it off I don't want to ruin the aesthetic of our Majestic laptop they managed to fit the little webcam up there that's a good spot for it I'm sure it's very high quality now because this is a 14-in laptop we don't get a numpad on it so unfortunately you can't use it for QuickBooks or whatever oh actually so if you like function key you can do Quickbooks on this little laptop that's a pretty cool implementation and with that Revelation I guess it's time to fire up the laptop and see if we have to suffer through some pseudo [Music] today Mega Trends it's been a while since I've seen that okay that is Windows stuff happening so I'm not going to have to deal with Linux once the laptop struggled through the setup process the display stood out to me first is this really 1080p it is 1080p it feels quite soft the viewing angles are also rough you lose a lot of brightness when you're off AIS in terms of measurements the display is pretty garbage for a Modern Display but in practice it doesn't look quite as bad as the measurements would suggest at least when you're looking at it on aess specs wise here's our 5-year-old little on 8 gigs of RAM which says four of four so I'm assuming those are four solder down little memory modules which we'll find out when we open up the laptop a bit later storage wise 128 gig SSD and then finally our UHD Graphics 600 which should make for some real amazing gameplay next installing all the software I needed for gaming on this laptop like Steam and MSI After Burner was an infuriatingly slow process this laptop can barely run Windows 11 it feels like using a device that suffered a recent and traumatic head injury which bodess real well for actually gaming on now of course we're starting with GTA 5 because it runs terribly in a really funny way and I'm being real Brave here starting at 1080p on a laptop that can barely run Windows 11 oh never mind this actually isn't going that badly no I know 9 frames per second not being that bad maybe a bit of a stretch but at least stuff's rendering you know it is actually running GTA 5 a little bit better than it runs Windows 11 no this is super unplayable like not even almost playable happening here I'm I'm going to have to drop the resolution a bit that has made a bit of a difference which you can't really take for granted with these cerons usually the CPU is the bottleneck in terms of frame rate so this is pretty impressive in a baby figuring out how to not vomit on itself kind of way dropping it to the lowest resolution the game supports hasn't really given us that much more performance which is interesting considering that it seems like the GPU is still the main issue here yeah sub 20 frames per second really doesn't count as a playable experience especially at 800x 600 yeah I'd say this is perfectly usable for competitive CS go gameplay look at that smooth game play we do have a bit of a disadvantage here in that there are Bots running and we are pretty severely CPU limited so that is going to have a big impact on our performance and besides even if the frame rate doubles it's still just going to be 10 frames per second let's see can we get him hey I took a bot down though so shroud can definitely use this for competitive play next let's try performance Fidelity FX and see what that does for us wo we've jumped all the way up to S frames per second now oh yeah smooth as silk it's back down to four I guess it depends qu oh do you know why I think it jumped up to seven because a bunch of the Bots died DOTA is the best running game so far peing over 25 frames per second and as we all know the human icon more than that so even if we wanted to we couldn't use anymore the next four games I tried either straight up refused to launch or just died straight after pretending to launch even fortnite took several attempts and a driver update to get running it only took five tries but it's finally launched oh yeah look at ooh those are some good stutters uh according to the game we have some network connectivity issues as well I mean it does look very deyy oh no I think there's someone in here this isn't going to go great is it wow that went very well but I think I know what the problem is now according to the comment section of the entire last temu video This Little Mac ax half keyboard thing isn't nearly as stupid as I said it is because for laptop gaming it is very good apparently let's see if adding the Mac ax to our temu laptop significantly improves our gaming experience oh yeah feeling way more gamery already and fortnite is unironically running better it's obviously not because of the MC axe but I think it's because the desyncs gone I I I think it was a server related issue this feels like I'm playing a game 25 years ago on my grandmother's computer this is crazy like look at them graphicss oh yeah water a tree oh there we go there you go we got our tree finally now when it comes to the macx yeah in this context ergonomically it is a lot better than gaming on the laptop and because it's small it's still portable so yeah for games like fortnite I do agree with you angry commenters in the previous video it does kind of make sense although interestingly I did have somebody tell me that this product they actually had to recall off of Amazon because it's known to install malware on your PC so I am going to have to scrub this laptop after I'm I'm done with it but potential malware aside let's tear down the laptop and have a look at its guts uh oh I forgot about the glory hole that needs to open first and just like that we have access to our SSD which we can now upgrade very easily through our glory hole this actually looks like it's going to be a very easy laptop to take apart cuz we've got a clear separation between the bottom plate and the side one some screws and then hopefully the back's just going to pop out wow that's a strong clip oh there we go so this bit of thin copper is all they need to cool that little Celeron uh next to that we've got our 120 gig SSD which we can access without taking the whole bottom plate off uh other than that here is our battery it's not a super high capacity but this is a very low power draw device so it's the batter is going to last for ages and the right IO is connected to the main motherboard with this little daughterboard thingy and a ribbon cable but with that I do actually want to take this little copper piece off and have a look under there but before we do that we have to unplug the battery before the internet shouts at me [Music] whoa that is some sickly looking copper on the bottom but putting that aside they used the thermal pad instead of thermal paste to interface between this little bit of copper and the Celeron down there which is very interesting and then finally on the PCB we've got the very cute little Celeron and then in typical Apple fashion we've got some solder down RAM on the side so at the end of the day we did get a functional laptop off temu but for $360 Canadian dollars we've seen devices on this channel that don't feel like doing your Computing on something that's recently been heavily lead poisoned which brings me to the end of another video subscribe if you liked it don't if you don't and until the next video [Music] bye-bye",

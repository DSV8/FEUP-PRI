Let's take a look at a cheaper option called the Nubia Red Magic 3 that has amazing specs and performance but does that make a gaming smartphone worth it?

    "transcript": "I got a new Lego piece you win no thanks I've got a gaming smartphone there's my friends is the Nubia Red Magic 3 let's take a look good people so I really have not played this many hours of Android games until the nubia Magic 3 came into my life and exploring the ecosystem of games is both rewarding when you find something actually good because the Play Store is filled with garbage games and paint to win games but when you do find those occasional times when you actually do enjoy something on the gaming phone the experience is actually pretty good now the thing is the specifications on this phone are really impressive for the price point around $500 us for snapdragon 855 8 gigs of ram 128 gigabytes of storage we have a five thousand milliamp hour battery a forty eight megapixel camera which is not great giving this a gaming phone the gaming features or the gaming center is actually pretty impressive and so I want to really explore the question our gaming smartphones worth it with long battery life and NVIDIA MX 150 GPU and Intel Core i7 processor in a compact design the Razer Blade stealth 13 is a great companion for users on the go if you want more gaming her hook it up to the core X EGP you would support for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs the Razer Blade stealth + the core X the ultimate power couple so first of all how would you even classify a gaming smartphone outside a targeted marketing and demographic because I feel like gaming smartphones right now or just performance machines for performance users in the gaming these guys and it's relevant because Razer has a gaming smartphone so there's a soos and I feel like this whole gaming category is actually quite important to push certain features forward like massive batteries powerful SOC s lots of RAM and storage and most importantly high refresh rate screens and push all those features into the mainstream and basically create an ecosystem that makes it comfortable to game on and mobile device and I feel like newbies execution here is pretty fantastic so I guess design wise a gaming smartphone must look the part it is very different versus the sleek glass packs or simple aluminum shells RGB lighting tow seems to be quite common in the gaming sector so the light strip on the Nubia is both expected and very pointless Razer and they Suze did the same thing with the illuminated logos in the back so I guess this is a trend even the fingerprint sensor is this weird shape that unfortunately is kind of slow for the hardware we also have a cooling fan installed inside the frame that you'll not find on your regular Android smartphone it is slightly audible when you put your ear to it but with speakers blasting you know above 40 percent it is not really an issue interestingly it does in fact keep the SOC slightly cooler versus my similarly specked out zenfone 6 and here's the deal the Snapdragon 855 and Adreno 640 is a fantastic combo that is also found on the new Samsung Note 10 which are much higher priced and this hardware is actually pretty awesome for demanding titles like PubG has fought nine world tanks and others and interestingly when they compared the benchmarking scores between the zenfone 6 that also has the 855 and Adreno 640 the zenfone 6 is faster in the physics test but all the other benchmark tests are pretty on par with the Nubia but these are just benchmarking scores you know whatever and in terms of real-world scenarios I have not noticed any difference even between my one plus six it is slightly older using older hardware as well in majority of games no difference between the Nubia or the one plus six outside of like PubG and maybe asphalt nine like a little bit extra performance in terms of frame rate on the Nubia but it doesn't really matter and that's the thing from a Georgia of games on the Play Store they're designed to work with whatever Android smartphone you have regardless of the specifications except for really demanding titles like PubG so with the Nubia because the powerful hardware you get a visual advantage and you also get the performance advantage by having better fps so you can aim better and that is the only incentive to go towards like a gaming smartphone or a phone that has better specs it is a good thing then the phone is absolutely massive within almost six point seven inch display so that when you hold it because of the aluminum shell it is kind of slippery I would love to have a little bit different texture especially on the sides to really give you a little gripping this over here the phone charges via type C there is a headphone jack up top and we have this red toggle on the side that activates game mode and this is something that is actually kind of cool so enabling it gives us access to the full library of games and this is like game mode only you can disable incoming phone calls incoming messages incoming notifications and all that so you will not be disturbed as you gain so swiping from the right you can see we have that full command center reveal so you can enable your fan you can disable the LED strip since it's completely pointless you can also toggle between those notification options you can also change between different performance modes but in my benchmark testing they don't really make any difference and the really cool 4d shock feature so for example playing asphalt 9 the phone literally gives you that haptic feedback about the music and the base which is actually kind of cool the vibrations are pretty strong and it feels like you're almost holding a little controller in your hand instead of a smartphone I also love the temperature notification plus any network activity and both the CPU and GPU frequency and it's actually kind of cool because as I game I can swipe from the right to see the temperature of the SRC and GPU and CPU clock speeds which I guess makes sense to see on a gaming smartphone but not like you can overclock the CPU or GPU independently anyway but it's still kind of cool and you use the same read toggle to get back into your desktop away from that command center and probably the most useful feature are the touch buttons and that's because we have two capacitive triggers on top for left and right so inside the game you can map exactly what left and right does on screen so for example in pop G you can map the right trigger to aim down sight which is super useful you don't have to navigate your thumb away from shooting you can simply tap the trigger on the right this is especially cool for games that have a lot of happening on-screen and if you have a lot of touch controls so you can free up that real estate from your thumbs on to your point fingers via the triggers and given the screen is 90 Hertz that is absolutely incredible for this price point given not many high ends flagship phones even have high refresh rate displays the catch over is that not many games support 90 Hertz refresh rate because they have to be running at that fps as well so if I'm running anything demanding like asphalt 9 world tanks PubG I am a hundred percent not getting 90 FPS on the mobile phone so it feels like I'm 60 and below in majority of the really demanding titles but in terms of gaming with something really demanding I don't feel a difference between this and my zenfone 6 that has a 60 Hertz display but I think majority of people will just enjoy the United Hertz display outside of the gaming arena because not many games supported and the fluidity you get with just basic operations is absolutely amazing scrolling through something or touching something is awesome I do have a few complaints about the screen toe like the rounded corners I feel like they're way too rounded they cut off some of the UI like the battery percentage and the clock for some reason when I open my folder with all my games in it the animation is super laggy despite having a 90 Hertz display and a really powerful SOC - there's no way to change the refresh rate of the screen to anything lower than 90 Hertz which I find odd it'd be nice to have the option to do so and weirdly there's no way to disable the capacitive trigger buttons when you're outside of gaming mode so if I'm watching a YouTube video and they accidentally brush against one of those trigger buttons the menu will show up because YouTube things that I just touched the screen but given the size of your phone you can go into landscape mode directly on your home screen I feel like this size of the phone is absolutely perfect for precise aim so in PubG when you need to land those headshots easily achievable on this phone the same thing with World of Tanks when you need to penetrate those pieces where the tanks don't have armor because the phone is massive and your your thumbs or your trigger fingers are not blocking anything on the screen we do have a stereo set of speakers which is nice but the bottom one on my unit is much louder so when I'm gaming the right channel is just blasting audio at me while the left one is a bit muted and it kind of removes the whole stereo effect as for using this on a daily basis outside of gaming it's too big for my pocket but it's Android you could customize it to however you like to use your phone the only few issues I have with the software is the camera app it's both laggy the shutter delay and there's takes way too long to actually process the images once you take them the actual detail of the image with a 48 megapixel sensor is pretty good dynamic range is there sometimes it likes to underexpose a bit but in terms of having a really nice sharp is great the selfie mode that thing has impressed me a lot nice detail as long as you disable the whole pretty effect so the cameras are good but they take kind of forever to process and the camera app is kind of like it and so in the end I would say this is a pretty complete gaming package for the price point especially with the snapdragon 865 that is found on the zenfone 6 and the new note tents it is really impressive what this thing can do in terms of battery life at five thousand milliamp hours I've played for an hour at full performance mode and I only lost 20% of battery so that gives you five hours on non interrupted gaming like asphalt 9 PubG or world tanks which are super demanding on the smartphone it's pretty good and to come back to the question of whether or not gaming smartphones are worth it in my opinion yes they need to exist to push certain features into the mainstream like the priority for me would be the higher refresh rate screens Razer did it Asus did it oneplus did it with the 7 Pro Nubia is doing it man degrades if more companies did it - ah so that is my experience with a Nubia red magic 3 check out my favorite android games down below something that i've discovered along this journey of trying to see what games are worth it to experience on the gaming device and let me know what you are playing right now or if mobile games are totally not for you but i'm to Eitri thanks much for watching i'll talk to you in next video",

    "transcript": "So in this box is milestone piece of tech. I've never actually seen one of these. Oh my god. [awe noise] This is definitely older than me. This is functioning? [laughing] What is this? [music] Let's see what people think about you. I'm Marques Brownlee and I review dope new tech but on this show I'm rewinding the clock to discover the tech of the past that changed our lives forever. Sega Genesis in the original box. The first ever cell phone. The revolutionary JVC camcorder Polaroid sx-70 Sony Walkman And the original, the 1984 Mac. [music] The DynaTAC 8000x was ten of today's smartphones thick. Tactile buttons. [buttons clicking] Immensely satisfying. Today we test a Walkmans wearability playability durability [boom] It did pretty well. [static noise] Is it rolling? I'm kinda wondering if this brings back any memories? Am I here because of my advanced age? In the 90s I would have been a Genesis gamer. I remember wait till I get this on these mother --- [laughing] 128k people. And k stands for kilobyte? Yes! [laughter] Okay. Got it. Kids today. They don't make em like they used to. And I gotta say, I have a lot more respect now for just how much this tech was at the very bleeding edge at that time. Catch you guys at the next one. Thanks for watching. [music] [music]",

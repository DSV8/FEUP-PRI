    "transcript": "Today I'm toying with a brand-new Xbox 360. It's a little smaller than I remember. And seemingly cracked, did it get damaged in shipping? No power brick, I guess I got one of those lying around. No HDMI port either, maybe an older model. At least it turns on wirelessly. This controller is a little small for my tastes too. Wonder how big the hard drive is... Huh, no label. There's a button. Press the button, and... okay. I like what I'm seeing here. Xbox button, drive spindle and what's down here? Got some fans and capacitors. Does come with a good pack-in game. Let's give it a spin. Pop that in and... Cortana! So that's where you've been.",

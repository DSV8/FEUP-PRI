Not that I'm not normally, genuinely excited, but today it's another level. This is the SupaBoy. Supa. Not \"super\". Supa. This is a little different. We're going to, we're going to do something strange. I know, I've said that before, and I'll probably say it again, but in this case, It's truly unusual. \"From Lu Yao's bosom\". Heh, ha ha ha! Whoa! Woo, hoo hoo! Champion takes the cake, gets the cake. Everyone else? What do they get? Pie? Oh, good Lord. Let's see here. Who makes sense? What about... Ryan? [on the phone] I mean, I don't know what to say. Hello?k Ryan, why are you always so upset man? Do you ever have a good time or what? Oooooh... [on the phone] That's spooky right there. [on the phone] So weird. [on the phone] Oh, jeez... Holy hand-cramping. That is an odd sensation. [chuckles] Ooh... [groan] This thing is weird, my head is super hot. Whoa! Yeah! I'm hot! Three percent. Are you laughing? oh! Woo! Oh! Dude! eh. This point, everybody's looking at you, the whole cafeteria is wondering: \"Who is this guy? What does he think he is with this... battery wallet?\" You know who you are. You're the man right now. Jack, you picking that up? Alright, photo, boom. perfect!",

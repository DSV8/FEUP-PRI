    "transcript": "- All right guys, hardest part of the video. We're getting it right out, right out of the gate. I need to say the name of this laptop correctly. This, sponsored by Lenovo of course, is the Lenovo Slim 7i Pro X, not the yoga. It is in Europe, but not here. (box opening) The charger that we get is 100 watts over USB type-C. Really like to see it. I thought at first, when I saw that it was yellow it was Lenovo's little proprietary charger which also in fairness is pretty good. All right, what else do we have in here? (box opening sounds) (laughing) It says \"Yoga\" right on it. (removing plastic) The good news is it's a good feeling laptop. Having a look at the I/O, here you get two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and you might want to use those for display as well because the HDMI that we have right here is only 2.0, not 2.1. So if you're hooking up with a 4K display, use Thunderbolt. Over on the other side, we have a full size USB type-A Headphone/microphone combo, and oh, a little webcam disable. I like to see that. Overall though, this is a very laptop-looking laptop. What I am impressed with, though, is the overall chassis rigidity. You can see some like macro-flexing here but that's the sort of thing that like when the whole deck as one piece flexes, you don't necessarily get in the keys. Like yeah, if you look at it, the keys, there's no deflection. It's just, if I'm like really pushing it. (typing sounds) Okay. The keyboard's great. We also have excellent key stabilization. So you can see here, like if I push on the side of the key the whole key goes down instead of just like the corner going down, that's the sort of thing that allows you to have just a really fast typing experience and not have to kind of make sure that you're hitting the keys as opposed to just hitting the keys. Now, as well as having a fantastic keyboard, It's also not the laptop we are supposed to be looking at. Makes sense. This one's the gray. This one right here's the teal. Also, this one does not say \"Yoga\" right here. Just says, Lenovo. What I find interesting though, is that the displays are not the same. On paper, they're the same, but in real life, they obviously are not. Now they both are 120-Hertz panels. They also have it color-calibrated from the factory. I think it's, what, Delta-E of less than one. that is mangled good. So you can definitely use this for your Lightroom or video editing or what have you. Just, what I don't get is that the US model is glossy and the European appears to be matte. The glossy one clearly has just nicer, more vibrant colors. Like, the blacks look darker, the colors just look a little bit more colorful, but at the same time, I can see my face in it, if I want to. Whereas the matte display does an exceptional job of not showing me all of the crap that's around me but at the same time, you know, it's just a little bit more washed out especially with our great big light that's above my head. You don't think any of them are touch? - (offscreen) No. - Well, I think you're wrong. - (offscreen) Oh, my. - Wait, what? Is this one not touch? For whatever reason, The one with the matte display does not have touch, and the one with the glossy screen does have touch. So before, I was kind of leaning towards the matte display, because you know, matte's nice. Touch is way better. I absolutely love touch on a laptop, especially one that's this light. How much does this thing weigh? Starts at 3.2 pounds. Damn, that's really good. Now 3.2 pounds might not sound like the lightest thing ever. There's much lighter laptops out there. The reason that's impressive is because of the specs of this thing. We--oh, damn. That is really impressive. We have an Intel i7-12700H, not even the P, they just give you the full fat 14-core 20-thread monster, damn. This thing has 32 gigabytes of RAM at 1600 megahertz DDR5. Okay. I'm legitimately impressed right now. I didn't look at this before. I assumed it was, like, a P-series. We also have one terabyte SSD, Intel wifi 6E, Iris XE graphics, of course. You'll never use those because it also has an RTX 3050. Okay. This one's a bit more reasonable. 16 gigabytes of RAM, 1650, but it also still gets the 12700H for that massive CPU compute. Also just wanna mention that these are both on the Intel EVO platform. So that basically just means that it gets, what, more than nine hours of battery life. Starts from sleep really fast, boots up super fast. One other kind of awkward thing is that it expressly states that we have to show you the Intel EVO badge. Cover up the other badging. There we go. Intel EVO. We now get to do our startup test. It should be real fast because it's on the EVO platform. And it is. There we go. We're in. Okay. Now I'm kind of very legitimately concerned about having a processor that's that powerful in a chassis that is this small. It's going to thermal-throttle. It's already thermal-throttling. CPU package, right now, it's at 86 degrees. Here we go. We're starting our Cinebench run. This right here isn't like a single one-and-done run to get a high score. This is just a \"it's running for 10 minutes\" sort of thing. So we can find out what we're dealing with here. CPU is at 94, 95 degrees. Now if we open up Lenovo's little Vantage software here. Power and performance, actually I'm just gonna check it right into extreme performance mode. There we go. It looks like that. We're at 95 degrees Celsius on the CPU. That's, like, perfectly fine. What you have to realize is that on modern CPUs, they don't care if they're running at a hundred degrees the whole time. If you want, in the BIOS you can set it to go to 115 and it still will be perfectly fine. And our CPU, oh, she's struggling. You might see that this is, you know, for one, it's pretty loud at the moment, and also, like, it isn't going all that fast. It seems like we're doing all-core 2.4 gigahertz which sounds kind of slow, but we just need to put that into context for a second here. This was able to manage a bit over 11,000 points in Cinebench R23. For comparison, an i9 9900. That was a five gigahertz eight-core processor from just a couple generations ago on a desktop. That's comparable to, like, a Ryzen 5 5600X. It's a very competent little machine. Now let's try and just get a proper score. We'll turn off, you know, OBS here, stop recording. We'll give it a second to cool down. Maybe we'll even prop it up. I think it'll love that. Damn. All right. Turns out, you know, screen recording at the same time uses up some resources. This one was able to do 13,576 in Cinebench. That is freaking great for... Like, look at this thing. It's so slim. How did they do that? I am genuinely impressed with this laptop. Now, I don't want to mention this tape definitely helped us out. That probably, I don't know, got us 5, maybe even 10 more Watts on the processor. Oh, we haven't even talked about the trackpad. The trackpad's great. It's big. It's glass-topped. It's nice to use. It's a good trackpad. All right. Thank you, EU version of the laptop. You've served us well, but you're not as fast as our North American one. The number one game in the world, according to me. Valheim, medium settings. Large 1080p, we're looking at what? 30 FPS. Okay. We can do better than that, I think. Extreme performance. There we go. Yep. That got us 20 FPS. Fantastic. This is a fantastic screen for playing games on. Like, 3K? Excellent. Also having the 120 Hertz, even though we're only getting 60 FPS in this game, makes everything so much more responsive. It even has Gsync. It's basically a gaming laptop but you don't have to like, have it be so heavy. It is getting a little bit hot up here. Well, we'll play this until I die. Oh, I'm so dead. Oh, did you see that dodge roll? I died. All right. Well, that's enough Valheim for this evening. That was not a laptop issue. That was purely a skill issue. What else? Oh, \"Crab Rave\", \"Crab Rave.\" Almost opened it up too fast. Have a gander at that. Yeah. How many nits is it? 400? (\"Crab Rave\" by Noisestorm) Well, the speakers are fine. We want to just be clear here, it's not incredible compared to some of the top-end laptops, but if you're comparing it to a laptop from a couple years ago, it's the same as the best ones that existed then. It's this large. You can only make your speaker so good. Our webcam right here, I feel like if you took the time to set up the lighting, this camera could be quite good. I'm really blown out, kind of right in my forehead and stuff. It's kind of weird. Yeah. It's a very challenging scene. I want to be clear. And once I turn it into the pure camera mode it seems to figure it out. Like, this is really good. I'll just take a photo. Another one. I'll smile for this one. It exposed perfectly for my face for the photo. Okay. We're gonna go for a little tour here, Mr. Laptop. Okay. This is still a very challenging scene but it's doing slightly better, but we have so many lights and stuff, okay. I'm sorry, Andy. One second. - Hey. - It's still not quite exposing correctly. - No. - The webcam, I would say, if you put in the work, it's going to be really good. If you have kind of a weird scene like we have here, it's gonna struggle. That said, for a Zoom call, it's more than good enough. Windows Hello facial recognition, it has it. It's my favorite way to get into a computer. It just works great. You open it up and then you get logged in. Love it. Now what we get to do is take it apart. (peppy music) All right, let's see how repairable she is. Okay. Okay. Well, in here, we get a 70 watt-hour battery. They say it'll get you 13 hours of battery life. And more like nine under load. One thing I want to just have a chat about for a second is Windows modern standby. I'm gonna bring it up in every single Short Circuit from now on until it's fixed. Lenovo, go to Microsoft and just kick them in the nuts. It's one of the worst things they've done in years. And so every single laptop, including this one, will do just this really annoying thing where for the most part it's fine and the battery lasts and it's great. Then sometimes you put it in your backpack and it wakes up and then you take it out and it's burning hot and your battery's dead. And everyone's very sad. It's been happening for, like, two years at this point. Just go to Microsoft and get very mad at them. Modern standby. It's awful. Fortunately though, this laptop has fast charging. So they say that you'll be able to get four hours of battery life off of half an hour of charging. The upgradability is about what you expect for a laptop in this class. And it looks like you cannot upgrade the RAM, so make sure you get how much you want from the factory. You can swap your wifi card right there. SSD is removable. The battery also comes out, and it looks like underneath that even the track pad can be removed, which is very nice. I am very surprised that this cooler is able to do 45 Watts of cooling though. Like, we saw it do that. It clearly can. The fin pitch on these fans, they are just super duper small fins. They did a really good job at, even though they were kind of on the loud side, not being annoying. That's, like, very key. Okay, Jake, we need to figure out the price-point of this laptop. Having a look in here, it's pretty clear that the whole chassis was CNC-machined. Like, we can look in here. That's why it's so rigid. That's why it feels amazing. Given the specs and the screen and the chassis, this thing has to be very expensive. You're guessing $1400. This thing feels like $2200, I think. We'll have the actual price right here. If it's lower than 2000, can we have balloons? (cheering) It's a good laptop. I'm surprised how much power they were able to cram into something that's this small. Yeah. If you're like a content creator, video editor, a light gamer, it's a pretty fantastic little machine. I can't, like, you know, thumbs-up/thumbs-down it Because we don't know the price, and it's sponsored. Take from that what you wish. So huge thanks to Lenovo for sponsoring this video. If you guys want you can just, like, start sending us laptops. You don't need to sponsor all of them. This is just a good laptop anyway. But yeah, if you guys want to purchase it, links will be down below. And just have a fantastic day. Hit like, hit subscribe. So long.",

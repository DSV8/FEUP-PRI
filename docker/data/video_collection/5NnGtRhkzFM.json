    "transcript": "the budget laptop from the previous video happens to have the slowest graphics card Nvidia makes with 'RTX' branding in the name and in today's video we're going to take that RTX branding and shove it down its throat... um... but but before we get to that if like me you spend most of your time in a gamer hole and are suspicious that your gaming performance may be blunted by your own exhaust fumes then today's video sponsor; the Aranet 4 CO2 monitor does that for you. With its genuine ndir sensor in it you will get highly accurate CO2 measurements of yourroom it's also conveniently color-coded when it's yellow probably open a window when it's red you're likely dead... I think... it also comes with a handy app if you want to track your air quality. So get yourself an Aranet4 CO2 meter using the link in the video description. Now the graphics card in question is the RTX 2050 a mobile GPU based on the same GA 107 die in the RTX 50 except there are a few key differences Nvidia did cut the memory bus in half something that a huge fan of doing and they also reduced the core frequency to hit lower power draw targets leading to decently worse performance apparently something I will be confirming in this video by occasionally comparing it to this Asus laptop that has an RTX 3050 in it now comparing gpus and laptops is kind of difficult cuz all the laptops have different Hardware configurations but if anything the 2050 based laptops have the advantage here so we'll see how it goes anyway before we get to the testing I did upgrade the RAM configuration in the HP laptop from the heedless single 8 gig stick to a 32 gig dual Channel kit cuz you know we want to be nice to the graphics card give it a chance to succeed and all that so let's get to the testing so this is the best way to use a gaming laptop I'm just going to switch its display over to the the external one and then I'm going to close it so that it's got perfect airflow cool there we go ah yes we don't have a desk blocking our airflow anymore oh that's not a great sign ooh you can just see its struggle to render Dem rays look at that motion blur is disabled wow that's not what I was expecting to see there but then things got weird oh oh things are happening it hasn't crashed it it is still technically running I guess okay that's what happens when you bring the menu back eventually I just snuffed the game out with task manager and when I restarted the game it quickly recovered from its night terrors oh that doesn't feel good let's bring up the rate racing settings and no way this performance is with dlss on and it's dlss 3 does that make sense that that's working on a 20 series GPU I guess cuz it it is working we do need more of it though that is doing a bit better granted this is with lots of dlss happening but we're getting about 20 frames per second with our rise being traced this is with performance dlss things are looking quite spiffy uh it it doesn't look like I'm growing hair on my eyes as much as normal so I decided to try some Ultra performance okay so with ultra performance like magic we now have almost 50 frames per second with the r tracing stuff happening here and even at Ultra performance honestly dlss is doing a very good job here damn although it doesn't like movement near high contrast edges that is some smearing okay so one when we're looking here let's see what happens when we turn it off custom the G just off that's not going great is it 6 frames per second it does look a lot better though I will will say if you don't move the mouse either way depending on what's going on in the scene portal RTX has quite the dlss implementation but considering this non- upscaled result I'd say no the 2050 can't really retrace and the RTX 3050 in the other laptop did a decent bit better giving us a very impressive 9 frames per second with no dlss on nice but with that let's try some other games we've gone to y Old Faithful torture tester Battlefield 5 this is a 1080p High settings and with the laptop upside down I mean that is quite the thermal mod because instead of hovering around 100 C the CPU is just hitting 83 so yeah I guess we all just use our laptops the wrong way around uh anyway this is without R tracing though so we're getting about 60 frames per second in my experience with Battlefield 5 going to rate tracing you usually lose about half your frame rate now battle field 5 does have a very basic rate racing implementation it's not even Global illumination the loser but either way the 2050 is kind of managing here I don't know if I would recommend this but it meets the minimum requirement for running I guess let's turn it up to ultra we went from about 34 to 29 frames per second wow those are some beautifully reflected trees the bullets don't really do anything to the water okay so here we still get the sky just got in the way of it but we still get beautiful tree Reflections in the water we get fire on our gun ooh look at that but we've not really lost that much frame rate down from about 60 frames per second so this is probably the high point I don't think it's going to go better than this at any point for the remainder of the video but I guess we'll find out interestingly the gap between between the 2050 and its bigger brother is not as big in Battlefield 5 as I was expecting I think it's because despite both laptops being in max power mode the 30/50 really wasn't drawing that much power minimizing the difference between them cyber Punk at 1080p low settings is way more playable than it was at high settings in the last video but with that let's make it unplayable turn it on and then we're going to do this which is basically the lowest rate tracing setting that can happen yeah about 20 frames per second is where it's evening out so already not going very well okay let's turn everything above path tracing on oh yeah the abuse is starting to settle in here 15 frames per second which I don't know I feel like we haven't lost quite as much frame rate as I was expecting us to lose at this point yeah and remember this is with the GPU running at max power that is that is as much power as the laptop wants to give the 2050 I guess we can still go further we need to just do psycho here on that's as much rate racing as can happen and we're using that at 1080p low settings which is pretty funny it's enjoying that a lot it says 400 frames per second but okay yeah no that makes more sense zero o does it does it get used to it eventually is that a thing that's going to happen do we now we're still stuck at one frame per second I don't think it's really going to go anywhere from there but we're getting much better performance you can tell by the frame latency uh that it is W look at that we've gone from almost 2,000 down to 700 milliseconds yeah this is this is playable now I then outsourced some of the work to AI hoping to get another frame or two so there's a lot of AI technology going into making this run better now it's in fact running 400% better than it was before and this is with performance dlss which has made the graphics go all cartoony looking okay uh I I feel like maybe we need to do ultra performance is that yeah that's as low as it'll go oh damn that's SM it doesn't like Fast movement very much but with ultra performance dlss and psycho rate racing we're actually getting about 30 frames per second ooh it looks like complete bot cheeks you know what R tracing has nothing to do with making the game look look better it's all about the epen of pressing the psycho button and having your system be able to run it and even with by far the least powerful RTX graphics card it is playable with the psycho button but there was still one thing left to do for even more frame rate now the game's starting to look real nice so this is the lowest resolution the game supports with ultra performance dlss so the actual render resolution is going to be like 3x4 pixels here and um yeah I don't know I don't think you can tell at all this looks very good again not a huge difference between these gpus but interestingly with cyberpunk the 350 is drawing more power than it was with Battlefield 5 now I also want to give Quake 2 RTX a quick try because it's always hilarious how much frame rate you lose we're currently sitting at 1,000 frames per second cuz this game is older than my grandma but then you go into graphic settings yeah yout switch back to to RTX 30 frames per second not even wa it does look so much better though I I keep saying this but I feel like this is R Racing's best use case is going back and making old video games all sexy for us oh terrible things are happening with fortnite ooh at 1080p low settings with epic draw distance fortnite's doing some weird weird stuff real seizur here so it's been a while and it's kind of evened out and now we're getting a reasonable frame rate but with big movements and stuff it is still pretty stuttering anyway let's turn on some R tracing wow dx12 makes fortnite run like it's taking a jackhammer to the face so now that the seizures are slowing down the little 2050 is doing much better than I was expecting it to and I think that it being able to handle fortnite's rate tracing it's like the most important thing it needs to handle because if you're 12 and you buy this laptop you want to be able to shout at the other people in the lobby about how you're using nanites textured raid tracing settings Lumen action and then they're all going to be very impressed with you and then you can tell them how your dad can beat up their dad because of your R tracing you just need to hope they don't have a 30/50 based laptop cuz that'll be real embarrassing for you I also wanted to try control because I think this is one of the early rate racing games depending on where we're looking we're in the 50s so yeah I I don't know this this 2050 is really not a very powerful GPU on medium less than half it's not quite half the frame rate we lost so not too bad and for that you get some remarkably shiny concrete now this game also has some dlss going for it and I like how it implements it it doesn't give you like performance or whatever it just shows you the render resolution uh but yeah so with 720p we have almost entirely if not more so gained our frame rate back and we get to keep the shiny concrete which means we can get our Rays traced even harder now the concrete even shinier we're still getting the same frame rate we did with Native resolution without rate racing dlss when there isn't a huge difference between the render resolution and the resolution that you're actually using it looks decent you know it looks good weirdly control was the only game where the 2050 marginally outperformed the 3050 which could be maybe down to those additional RT cores and with that what did we learn in today's video well if you're real desperate to have your rays traced and don't mind some hairy eyeballs you can just about get away with Ray tracing on the least powerful RTX graphics card n videoid offers which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching and until the next one bye-bye a",

With a reported Snapdragon 670, 4 gigs of ram, 32 gigs of storage while retaining a headphone jack and a stellar camera. Is the cheaper pixel going to be priced aggressively enough?

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. A video was recently put out by a channel called Andro News, that showcased the upcoming, Pixel 3 Lite, or whatever they're calling the inexpensive like cheaper Pixel 3 that's launching on the spring. And this is a device that's obviously focused on price. It's a device that has a plastic back and a plastic chassis. And compared to the original Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL these devices have glass backs and metal chassis. They look nice. They're more premium to hold, but they're more expensive. A plastic phone is cheaper and they can still be awesome. They're durable. Their backs don't shatter They're lighter. They're less slippery. Now in order to ger this phone to be as cheap as possible, Google's gonna be doing a couple other things to the Pixel 3 Lite. It's supposedly running a cheaper, mid tier SOC from Qualcom. So the Snapdragon 670 is gonna run with 4GB of RAM 32 GB of storage, and there's no way to spin it. A Snapdragon 670 is gonna be a slower chip than a Snapdragon 845. It's gonna have slower processing, slower LTE speeds But it's still a fast and effecient 10 nanomoter chip. I think for most people, unless you're going hard to the core on your phone, and playing like mobile games frequently, you probably won't notice too much of a difference between the Snapdragon 845 and the 670 in the Pixel 3 Lite. Now the display panels on the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL are OLED panels. And these are some of the best looking screens that Google's ever put on any one of their devices. The pixel 3 Lite is supposed to be running an LCD panel. And there is nothing inheritingly wrong with LCDs.We've seen some really nice looking LCDs out there, but they tend not to be as nice as an OLED panel. There is also a difference in the audio setup, so the original Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL both have stereo, speakers front-facing ones that sound pretty good The cheaper Pixel 3 Lite doesnt have a stereo speaker it has a mono speaker on the bottom. But it has a headphone jack which is crazy This is a feature that was removed from the Pixel phones last year and to see it come back in the cheaper version of the Pixel is... Its wierd but its also nice.I feel like they recognize the value of that port to a lot of people around the world. So i like that its there I dont know if its gonna come back...just like future versions of Pixel phones but Im glad that its making it into the cheaper version. I feel like the people that are gonna purchase that are gonna appreciate that jack. Uuuh cameras... There seems to be only one front-facing camera on the Pixel 3 Lite So you probably gonna lose the wide angle focal length And you probably gonna lose potrait mode for selfies But the rear camera is supposedly very similar if not the same, to the original Pixel 3 and Pixel 3XL cameras And those were excellent cameras Some of the sample photos in that video look legit And it is a Pixel device Its gonna be using Google's camera algorithm There is a very good chance its gonna be shooting some really nice photos So we have a device that has a great camera Headphone jack Good software. Its got a lot going on for it But the price point is where this thing leans very heavily on. If Google was very aggressive with the pricing they price it like 400 or 450 bucks this will fly off the shelves. Everyone will love it but i dont think they are gonna sell it for that Its gonna be like 550 Maybe even a little bit more See, they have to compete with companies like OnePlus there... Its gonna be so hard for this phone to be picked up on mass if its not priced really well and because its Google I dont think it will...So what do you guys think like If this thing was priced at lets say... 550 four gigs of RAM 32 gigs of storage and as 550 bucks For everything that was discussed in this video Would you buy it like at what point does it become too expensive for you like Im super curious to see what that price point is Because it sounds great on paper but because is Google and because they dont price stuff super aggressively... Im so curious to see how this will pan out for them. Okay hope you guys enjoyed this video Thumbs if you liked it Subs if you loved it. See you guys next time.",

    "transcript": "So my office door right now has a pretty big problem. I've known about this issue for about a year, I just haven't gotten around to fixing it yet. But, today we are. So my office door looks like it's locked, right? Can't get in it. But, it actually has a pretty big flaw. So right now the door is locked and I can press whatever number combination I want and it'll stay locked. But, no matter what, as soon as I press this button the whole thing unlocks and let's me into my office. Kind of sketchy, right? A door lock should keep the door locked. I have a bunch of broken phones in there that I need to keep safe. So I reached out to my buddies over at Ankor, and they suggested their most high-tech Eufy, fingerprint scanning door lock. So today we're going to unbox it, take it apart, and then install it on my door, and hopefully the problem is solved. Let's get started. [Intro] So I figured this is one of those situations where it's time to go big or go home and just get a smart lock that does everything. This guy can unlock with fingerprints, a digital code, keys, or even Bluetooth. And the actual swap between the lock I have now and this upgrade will only take a few minutes. I am going to take mine apart first though cuz that's just what we do, and I want to see how it works from the inside. Out of the box, these things are surprisingly heavy, solid metal construction for both halves of the lock. And it's nice that the installation steps are clearly labeled on the smaller boxes. The deadbolt is universal and fits multiple sizes of doors. If you twist the head it gets longer. We'll start with the half of the lock that sits inside of the door. Popping off the battery cover there are 4 slots for double A batteries. Pretty normal. And on the back we have 10 Philips head screws. Once those are out I can pop off the mid-plate and start removing the 4 screws holding the motherboard in place. Before I can pull it out though I do need to disconnect the loudspeaker plug. As well as the motor wires and battery pack wires. Kind of convenient that the circuit board has labeled these plugs right there on the surface. The motor that moves the deadbolt is hidden under another six smaller silver screws. And then the black plastic covering can come off revealing the pretty cool looking internal gear setup inside. The lock can be locked and unlocked manually from inside the house. But when the electronics are used, like the keypad, fingerprint, or Bluetooth, the motor kicks on to move the deadbolt instead. The lock has a BHMA grade 2 security certification, meaning that it can lock and unlock 250,000 times. You could leave your house twice a day for the next 340 years and the lock will still be mechanically sound. I'll make a followup video here in about 300 years or so. Hit that subscribe button so you don't miss it. We'll see how the deadbolt connects to the two halves of the lock in just a second. I've got the motherboard reconnected and the inside half of the lock all put together. Now we can make our way over to the front side. This part of the lock sits on the exterior of the door, which means it need to be extra secure from the outside. And since there are no visible screws, we're off to a good start. The only accessible screws are on the side of the lock that gets permanently attached to the door, so they'll be blocked when the lock is actually installed. There are 6 screws. Once those are out, the back metal panel lifts up exposing the key way which is where the very uniquely shaped keys can get inserted into the lock. These keys are very specific with a curved half moon shape, and the spikes of the key in the center of that curve. They are probably a bit more secure than the average key, but it also means they are a bit harder to make copies of if they ever get lost. I'll remove the thick rubber waterproofing gasket. This whole contraption is ip65 water resistant so it can handle the outside elements. There's another six screws holding down the middle housing. The lock will also keep working in extreme temperatures from negative 22 Fahrenheit, all the way to 158 degrees Fahrenheit. It's helpful that the batteries are inside the house in a more climate controlled environment. The connectors inside the exterior housing are protected with this white rubber glue. And the board has 5 screws of its own. The back side of the board has the LEDs to light up the keypad. The numbers illuminate through the back side of the glass. The board also has pins on the underside that probably receive communication from the capacitive touch pad. With the solid metal housing, a metal layer underneath the glass, and no visible exterior screws, it seems like a solid design. Breaking off the lock itself would take just about as much work as breaking down the whole door. And either way is definitely more secure than the setup I have now. With everything put back together and tightened up, it's time to install it onto the door. There is one micro USB port on the bottom of the lock that can provide temporary power if the batteries die and you don't have a key with you. But this port will not charge up any of those batteries. As far as installation goes, locks are pretty universal and the installation seriously only takes a few minutes. There are two main screws holding my current lock to the door. Then I can remove the two smaller screws holding in the old deadbolt. Once I pry that out I can just slip the new deadbolt into the same original holes that the old lock just came out of. I'm doing all of this with just one screwdriver. The front half of the lock goes through the newly installed deadbolt, making sure that the wires are tucked underneath. Then the metal back plate gets set into place, along with the two beefy screws holding both halves together. There is one plug that connects the front keypad to the back motherboard. Then the back housing can slide into the metal pin sticking out of the deadbolt. Then it's all held into place with 3 screws of its own. Once all the batteries are in we get a satisfying... [Robot voice] Welcome to Eufy Security. Please download the Eufy Security App to complete the setup. [Zack] Looks like it survived the teardown. [Robot voice] Ready to set up. [Zack] Now on my particular lock, the hole where my deadbolt goes was a tiny bit too shallow so I just deepened it a little with a screwdriver and a hammer so the deadbolt could extend in all of the way. I don't think most people will have to do that part, but either way it's pretty easy. I turned on my app, which I already have downloaded from my security cameras. [Robot voice] Calibration complete. [Zack] And everything was pretty simple to set up. The fingerprint scanning feature is the same kind of thing we'd see on a smartphone. It takes multiple pictures of your fingerprint and it's ready to go. The fingerprints are encrypted and only stored locally on the lock itself. And there you have it. My office can now be locked and unlocked in just 1.3 seconds with just my fingerprint. And obviously there's the code and the whole key thing as well. And the app on your phone. But I think it's a huge improvement over what we had before. Huge thanks to Eufy for sponsoring this video. I'll leave a link for this particular lock down in the video description. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

    "transcript": "The Linux command ls or list allows us to view directories and files on a system. There are many options with ls as an example we could use the command ls -l we can see more detailed information so rather than just seeing the directories listed like that I can see as an example that desktop is a directory I can see the permissions of that directory. The owner and group access to this directory. As an example if I go cd / and I'll clear the screen here and type ls we see that kind of information but ls -l shows us more detailed information. Here we can see that this is a file because it's not listed as a directory, l shows us that this is a symbolic link. Boot is a directory ls -la shows us all files including hidden files if you want to get help about the different options simply type ls --help many other options available with ls get used to using the different options with ls.",

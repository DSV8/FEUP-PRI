Uuuuh...? *laughing* Look at that thing! \"Mad Chill\" It says \"Mad Chill\" It is a Christmas sweater, for, My Pixel. That Pixel is \"Mad Chill\" right now *singing circus music* What am I supposed to, How does this even, I guess it's just so the Pixel can feel included, for the time being Now I think , what's in the next box. I bet, it's gonna be, one of those but for me. Yes. Oh my goodness. Look at that. \"Mad Chill\" Is it too late now, that we're in January, for me to wear this? I don't think so I don't think it's too late at all. Mad Chill! We know what we've got going on there, but what is happening in this next box This one's got me kind of excited.

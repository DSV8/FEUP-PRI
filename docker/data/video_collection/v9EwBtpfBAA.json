    "transcript": "- So I don't want to brag, but I'm going to, I think I might be the only person that's unboxing what's inside of here in front of an X-Box fridge just saying. Don't ask questions. I will do this, how I want. So if I were the rock, how would I, what would I, how would I, would I just. What would the rock do, do you think you would just Be like. - [Cameraman] He would just look at it and it would unbox itself. - I don't think I have that ability. Do you think I'm gonna need a chainsaw for this? Serious question. Tyler shaking his head no, I don't know if I agree with that. Then how else will I open it without a chainsaw? There's no unboxing instructions. Oh, okay so I lift the top off. So that's really all you had to do. I didn't even try to do this and it's just freaking opened. Okay. Believe, achieve, repeat. So as packed for the healthy energy boost, vitamin and electrolytes, that will set you up with the mental power needed to start your daily grind whether you're streaming, competing, or just playing for fun and you'll get the boost you need with none of the crash. Best of all, it tastes incredible. If Dwayne says it does, I believe it. Thank you, Dwayne this is exciting also, Thank you, X-Box because there's anything that you guys know that I like it's X-Box and my X-Box fridge. Do you think that I can put my mini fridge inside the big fridge? Of course, we're going to do it. You guys won't even know what this is. I already know cause my sister had boxed it before me. It's an X-Box mini fridge guys, spoiler. This is where we might need this call. You just don't want to take me to the hospital. What's in here. Oh, the drinks are in here, oh my God and a custom controller. What the heck is this? Oh, do you even recognize me? Who is she? Look at this, little coasters. Ah shoot, this is cool. Oh my gosh, there's so many flavors. Oh, a 160 milligrams of natural caffeine. This looks like it's an original flavor. We've also got a Lemon-Lime. Oh, a Pineapple Coconut, Super Berry. I think this might be the one I'm going to be into and then Wild Orange. You want to see that controller, will show you that controller. Check this out. Let's get these started cooling in our big fridge. Never gets old, Except for what I need space in my garage. Then I questioned my choices, but all right we gotta get this out of here. We gotta get, we gotta get you out. - Oh yeah, here it is. This is so freaking cute. You saw nothing. It's so small, look how tiny this is. What am I even going to put it here? Some cheese sticks, like some string cheese. Let's put tiny fridge in big fridge. Big fridge, tiny fridge. It's a new party trick post-pandemic. It's gonna be great. Hey, come see my fridge with the fridge inside of the fridge. I should probably plug the actual baby fridge in too. Do you know what this is? This is for the car. I can take my mini X-Box fridge with me on the go. To bad I don't have a car. I have one, but I don't know where it is. Okay. I gotta take the fridge out of the fridge. Has anybody ever said that sentence? I need to take the fridge out of the fridge. There's a first For everything and it's on. Okay, It doesn't make a noise, but that's okay. This is what we can do. This is really cool. I'll put a link in the description if you guys want to check out the new energy drink that Dwayne Johnson just came out with and Microsoft X-Box. Dwayne, whoever sent this to me, thank you guys so much, you obviously know that I'm a huge X-Box fan. so it's going to go to good use. Should I put the fridge back in the fridge? Do you think Snoop will be putting his fridge inside of his fridge? I'll ask him. (upbeat synth music)",

    "transcript": "oh boy another rainy day in Taipei the thing it's time to go to NZXT now finally here at NZXT it is bit rainy outside but to continue with the tradition of the peal at Computex and NZXT we have something a little special over here we got ourselves a glass panel and let's all enjoy the delicious peel satisfying alright let's go check out the new updated aged series of cases right after this huge thanks to fan text and SteelSeries for making our comput extract possible alright so moving on from that satisfying peel NZXT at Computex is announcing and upgrade to their aged series cases so it's no longer it's the H200 the H500 or the H700 now there are the 10 edition so the H210 H510 and the H710 minor upgrades that are cosmetic and functional and a H510 elite important thing to note all the prices remain the same as the previous generation of H Series cases which is awesome so you're not paying the premium to get these little additional upgrades and things so the first upgrade will be the tempered glass side panel no longer do we have the 4 thumb screws that we saw with the H200 the H400 and the H700 now they all have the same mount as the H500 so the tempered glass panel has pegs at the bottom that insert into the frame for support and a single thumb screw at the back for that clean look and also minimizing the cost and also minimizing the risk of the tempered glass being broken because you don't have those pressure points in the corners and apparently that was a bit of an issue in the past next up are the ventilation holes on the power supply shroud no longer are they used to mount your SSD caddies like we saw in the previous cases I actually like that approach because it gave you a little bit of flexibility on exactly where you could mount that dakari but now we have a new rail system that goes around the power supply shroud that looks a bit cleaner and the installation of the mounting SSD caddies is just as simple and also because of this new mounting mechanism beside this is the amount does not require any holes like we saw on the previous version so if you're not using it on the power supply shroud then it looks cleaner they've also added USB 3.1 gen2 support which is now called the USB 3.2 Gen 2 support or the type C connection now the entire H series has an I version that includes a smart device and now the difference here the smart device will include two RGB channels so you can connect strips or fans or something like that that has lighting integrated in it they have included vertical mounts but no riser cable so you have to purchase that separately but the work amount is very very close on the cases towards the glass panel so probably not going to be very popular for air cooling maybe just stick to blower style if you go in vertical while the non I've urgent don't even have the vertical PCI slots it's completely bare so no option vertical GPUs on non divergence now I'd like to clarify something the underglow you see here on the bureau is only for them purposes it's not actually included with I and non-ai cases which is unfortunate it would be really cool to have that additional value add for the eye addition case so they can push people towards these smart device and the extra RGB fans and there's no lighting - but nope and now the star of the show my friends would be the NZXT h510 elite it is one of the coolest cases that we saw a Computex is just so elegant and so simple and yet so beautiful and then it's basically just a glass front panel at the front instead of it being totally closed off with the metal piece this is actually based on user feedback people wanted a tempered glass in the front because otherwise maybe it's a little bit too bare for some people and the H510I includes two air 140 Miller RGB fans - to really highlight that whole tempered glass front section the front panel is removable with a single screw from the side if you need to access those front fans for some reason and the front bracket sits on the thumb screw so the whole cooling contraption installation is pretty convenient and two more exhaust fans one on top and one at the rear now important thing to note here are the front fans have been brought in towards the front panel by just a few millimeters and they're saying that won't affect air flow too much it won't be like a significant oven inside the case and based on my previous temperatures of the original H500 cooling was actually really fantastic with a single fan included because the side ventilation is pretty deep but here the side ventilation is still only on the one side on the right I'm guessing that's the whole point of the elite it looking premium and the airflow won't be performance based but it won't be a choking hazard either and I'm really happy with the overall simplicity of upgrades they're not redesigning the frame they're just adding slight refinements to the frame in terms of the side panel mount and the SSD caddies while everything functionally remains the same and design wise you're getting and then zxt enclosure there's simple lines hard lines some right angles and some glass that's pretty good I guess we'll have to wait and see to make sure it is not an oven but that side ventilation has been plenty in the past and I'm thinking it's the same here - all right guys let me know what you think of the enclosure and the entire H series upgrades I'm Dimitri thanks much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content I'll talk to you in the next video",

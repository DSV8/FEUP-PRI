After testing keyboards from Corsair, Logitech, Roccat, Tesoro and Cooler Master in typing tests, gaming and more for this review it turns out that low profile might just be pointless.

    "transcript": "well hello good people it seems like low profile gaming keyboards are rising in popularity but why what is it about having a shorter keyboard body and lower key caps that improves the overall user experience so first of all low profile is not a specification it's not standardized meaning across keyboard brands you might have a chunky frame but low profile keycaps you might have low profile switches but a large keyboard body or a keyboard that is designed from the ground up to be as low profile as possible but also quite massive so let's take these five low profile keyboards that I've collected over time and see exactly why a perfect low profile keyboard does not exist the gamer storm castle 240 X gives you a peace of mind with anti League tech inside by reducing pressure build up as temperatures fluctuate Plus this is one the best looking palm designs with the removable mirror cover and swappable logo pieces with full addressable RGB support for that extra bling check it out below so the collection for today includes the Tesoro gram MX One the Roccat 120 Aimo the Corsair k70 RGB mk.2 low profile the wireless Logitech G915 and cool master SK 630 and I guess it's an expectation that low-profile keyboards are going to be more expensive as they most definitely sell less volume so that LP premium is real the common denominator among all these keyboards of course some form of low profile elements the K70 and the SK630 for example use cherry low-profile switches that are much smaller in comparison to standard MX which is this means the keyboard frame on the K70 is thinner compared to normal K70 plus the slim style key cap reduce the overall height of the keyboard to 29 millimeters instead of 40 millimeters with standard MX switches this also means low-profile switches have less travel distance and feel completely different for one the low-profile speed switch is incredibly quiet it's almost like there's some dampening happening when you bottomed out with a bit more resistance than your standard size MX speed switch the low-profile red switch for example registers at one point two millimeters instead of two millimeters on full-sized MX so that is definitely one advantage of low-profile switches if you prefer faster actuation and less coolermaster uses a similar idea with low-profile switches and shorter key caps I'll tell the flat nature of them without any grooves is a disadvantage it makes the keyboard look and feel bulky despite having the same key cap height as the k70 especially because the entire frame is raised if only the front was slimmer to lower the entire profile but to me it's actually the flat key caps that ruin an otherwise promising phone factor that the Tesoro gram MX one takes a different approach to low profile by reducing the size of the frame itself the key caps a standard the MX switches to but the flatter design of the frame helps to minimize the footprint and appear low-profile like the angular front section of that metal plate small forehead and tiny side sections even though it is the highest keyboard among these five I would still consider to be low-profile the Roccaot Vulcan is another unique low profile example with a thin frame and the coolest key cap design that I've seen it's flooring style plus the thin and narrow format of the key caps helps to minimize the visual bulkiness of the keyboard also the front row of the keys is curved that improves the ergonomics of the entire layout it is kind of brilliant the switches however are not low-profile but it's interesting how all these other elements give the keyboard that low profile character now some users in our community post have experienced issues with the switches and I'm breathing on similar switch problems from user reviews on Amazon and that is just not acceptable for $150 I wanted to save the best for last as the G915 from Logitech was designed with low profile in its DNA it's the thinnest mechanical keyboard that I've used at only twenty two millimeters and here the frame the switches and the key caps are all part of that low profile game and this thing is Wireless too but it's crazy expensive at $150 I really don't know who'd buy it I've also accidentally broken a few key cap legs when removing them from the switch but the structure is impressive the frame is almost non-existent the key caps are almost half the height of the K70 key caps and the switches have the least travel distance of two point seven millimeters with the actuation point happening at 1.5 it honestly feels very impressive to have that much travel distance on something that this thin especial because the body is not angled someone that's on your desk it feels like it's part of the desk instead of being on top of it I feel like that is one major benefit of having such flat low profile keyboards and that is risk placement which is more comfortable for me when the key caps are closer to the surface you don't require a wrist rest to even out the wrist angle because the higher the keyboard the more strain you'll experience and typing on the k70 low profile or the G915 is incredibly comfortable and you can see the difference a slim profile makes on my wrists and it made me realize that the low profile keyboard isn't supposed to be a tiny keyboard and it's not supposed to like minimize the footprint of the keyboard itself on a desk instead the focus is on comfort and minimizing that visual bulk of either the key caps or the frame itself and unfortunately we're not at the point of having good variety when it comes to low profile designs yet they're all still full-sized layouts with either chunky cables insane price points and very few switch options - and if you guys have any suggestions for a low profile keyboard that you think is worth it let me know in the comments as from my perfect low profile keyboard I would have the G915 but in a TKL form factor and make speed low profile switches and the key caps from the Vulcan but I'm interested to hear if you care about low profile keyboards at all let me know in the comments thanks so much for watching don't forget to subscribe check out this other relevant content all the links for products will be listed in the description thanks for watching I'll talk to you in the next video stopped right in time for the construction to begin yay yes hear that",

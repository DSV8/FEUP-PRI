    "transcript": "- So I have done a ton of reviews of a lot of different types of tech, but one of the things that I have always wanted is an awesome home theater experience. Well, my friends today, it is finally happening with this NexiGo Aurora PJ92 projector and I cannot wait to show this to you. A huge thank you to NexiGo for sponsoring this video. (upbeat music) Let's see what it looks like. Why I'm so excited about this type of projector, it's a short throw projector which will allow you to keep it really close to the screen. It's not something that you have to mount in a ceiling or have it mounted. This is legit, like I'm just gonna be opening up a movie theater in my home. Charging admission at the door. Snacks, you have to buy them here. I thought there was gonna be more set up, but this is it. Let's plug it in and I guess get it all configured and ready. Obviously I have a TV behind me and that's not an ideal situation for a projector. So can we get a drum roll please? (drums playing) Oh my gosh. So now I'm gonna put this on the floor close to the display which is great because that does free up my coffee table. I am so excited. I don't even know what to expect. Woo-hoo. Look at you. You look great. So it looks like we need to pair the Bluetooth remote that it came with and it looks like it's a pretty easy process. We're just gonna press these two buttons right here. And the remote was found. It's connect, oh, that's loud. Wow. So now it's giving me some instructions to kind of get this all fitted to the screen which I thought it had to be further back but it's wild how close you have to be. Oops, sorry. It keeps yelling at me not to stare directly into the beam which this is great 'cause it has an eye protection mode. So we just have to press a key to continue. So this has two scroll wheels on the side that will allow to adjust the height of the feet. So as you can see here this is showing you you wanna reduce the heights if the top is distorted or increase the height of both feet if it's distorted on the bottom. Rotate, okay. Yeah, this is great. I think it looks pretty. - [Narrator] It looks good. - It looks spot on. Now it's time to adjust the focus. It already looks pretty crisp but I have a feeling that we can get even more crisp. So everything's all set up, it's calibrated and I was actually so surprised how quickly and easy this was to do. There really wasn't much that we had to change inside of the settings. We did adjust a few things and it's pretty much perfect right now and I have one of my YouTube videos playing behind me, so check this out. Oh wait, before we do, let's dim the lights so we have a more cinematic experience. I also like that the remote is actually backlit too. So if you are in a dark scenario such as our cinematic experience that we're gonna be having here you'll be able to see all of the controls. So here we go. (upbeat music) So here it is. This is the Aurora Pro PJ92 projector. This is NexiGo's newest flagship ultra short throw projector that is the world's most advanced laser TV. It has breathtaking visuals, a wide color gamut Dolby vision support, immersive Dolby Atmos audio, precise color representation, 4K, 120 hertz for gaming and so much more. I love how low profile the actual projector is. They were really able to make this look so slick and have it seamlessly blend into any environment. Honestly for how powerful it is. It has a small and a very minimalist design with the ultra short throw capability, this lets you place it really close to your screen to reduce clutter. This has three HDMI 2.1 ports with minimal latency and full support for 4K, 120 hertz input. This is so wild seeing my video that I made and shot and edited on a huge screen like this in my home. I don't know, I'm honestly speechless right now. Okay, so my first test just watching some of my YouTube videos was unbelievable. And honestly, I can't even stress to you like how much cooler this is than I thought it was originally going to be. Obviously, I've seen a lot of projectors before. I've done reviews of TVs but this is on a whole nother level because I've never reviewed a short throw projector. It's just, it's so crystal clear and it just feels like I'm actually at a movie theater but I'm sitting on my own couch. Now again because it does have HDMI inputs, you can input any types of devices that you have that are HDMI compatible. I have an Amazon Fire Stick TV inserted into this so I'll be able to watch all sorts of content on that. You can use any gaming consoles, live TV, pretty much anything, and you can plug it right into the back and just switch the inputs. Pretty awesome. Okay, let's check out this Dolby Vision content. I'm so excited. The color on this is professionally calibrated making it one of the most color accurate UST projectors out there. I'm also really surprised at how bright this looks. Even in daytime. It's 2,400 ANSI lumens that will let you project a screen size from up to 80 to 150 inches, which is pretty incredible. It has a triple laser engine that produces over 1 billion colors that continues to give this true cinematic color experience. Right out the box you're getting a professional color calibration, but if you go into the menu, you'll be able to further customize the settings at 28 different parameters so you can have that perfect visual setup for whatever type of content you're watching. This also has enhanced contrast with improved black levels with their laser local dimming technology. The audio is also really impressive. You wouldn't think that this device would be capable of such amazing audio, but oh my gosh I was so surprised with Dolby Atmos support every sound is so realistic. I actually felt like I'm living inside of a movie. Okay, so now it is time to test out gaming. I am obviously a huge fan of playing video games so being able to play games on a low latency display like this is gonna be a really cool experience. I mean, it's basically like taking your console to a movie theater and playing, like that's pretty much a dream come true. Oh my goodness, okay. I'm so sad that I just stopped playing this game to tell you about the performance. It was actually really, really impressive. And one of the things when you are playing games like this you don't wanna have a lot of of controller lag. I felt like it was pretty seamless and I got a few kills in my favorite first person shooter game. I think we all know what my favorite game is. I'm beyond excited about this setup. It's been a while since I've been like super hyped about a new piece of technology and since this is something that I've never really experienced before I feel like a kid in the candy store on Christmas Day. I don't know, I'm so excited. So depending upon the type of games that you play I'm a huge fan of first person shooter games and I love having a fast refresh rate. Since this does support 4K, 120 hertz and HDMI 2.1 you are gonna be ensured that this is a gamer's dream. Like it honestly was so fun and I can't wait to play some more. So far the experience of using this projector and this screen has been way cooler than I thought it was gonna be. I have tested out a lot of different gadgets in the past but this is something really new that I've never really experienced before. And until you really experience a home cinema experience you haven't ever really experienced it. Have I said experience enough? I'm not sure. I just know that the experience that I just had I wanna keep experiencing it forever. Thank you guys so much for watching. This was honestly so much fun to test out.

Again, thank you guys for watching and if you haven't already, please hit subscribe and the bell to be notified when I post new videos and I'll see you guys in the next one. I'm gonna go to the movie theater now. I don't have to walk very far.",

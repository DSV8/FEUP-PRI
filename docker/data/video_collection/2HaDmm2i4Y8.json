    "transcript": "with the launch of Another Broken Bethesda game which seems to handily be clapping the cheeks of modern gaming systems it got me thinking about Ram again how little is too little for 2023 at what point does Starfield just start crapping out because there isn't enough RAM available to it well let's find out today oh and other games as well but before we get into that today's video is sponsored by be quiet monolithic new dark Bass Pro 901 a case with so many awesome features if I were to list them all we'd be here for hours not only could it easily accommodate this obscene dual epic system but with its wireless charging huge amounts of front i o great hard drive support for a modern case removable radiator mounts with built-in fan hubs invertible motherboard train I really could go on for ages but if you're in the market for a new Mothership of a case check out the dark Base Pro 901 with the link in the video description thank you for the test platform I wanted to use a CPU that had an igpu in it for a terrible idea later on but I also wanted it to support ddr4 for its lower capacity dual Channel kits so I decided to use the Corsair build kit PC that Anna built in a video a while ago which has an i7 13700k in it although I needed to reconfigure Anna's handiwork a little with the radiator mounted in the top accessing the ram becomes an exercise in heart palpitations and that's like the only thing I wanted to interact with in this video so I moved the radiator to the front ripped out all of the fans and replaced some of them with some fancy new Corsair IQ link fans and because those fans are magnetized I could Mount both of them to the radiator using just two screws which is really exciting I also had to put a power supply back in the system so I went with this be quiet pure power 12m the be quiet 10 over a while ago so now that the ram was nice and easily accessible I dropped in a 32 gig kit and the RTX 4070 TI that was include did in this Corsair build kit oh something terrible is happening so now that I've rebooted the system I don't know if you can see this on camera but the display is kind of flickering that's weird I then spent a not inconsiderable amount of time trying to diagnose the flicker from unplugging all of the IQ stuff to changing out the 4070 TI for a 4090 I even swapped out the monitor wait it's still flickering what it turns out the reason it was flickering was because I didn't delete the AMD drivers off the system before putting the Nvidia GPU in and they were just fighting to the death so when I cleared off all the drivers and reinstalled them aside from some Phantom flickers the problem was solved okay so now that we're in claydonia which is like a closed off indoor City bit we've got about 11 gigs of memory allocation going on here and that's with City two gigs available so um yeah I guess we're gonna have to try different bits of the game so now we're on the surface of Mars and allocation hasn't really jumped up a whole lot has it even wandering around new Atlantis which is a huge City area at 4K was just seeing about 13 gigs of memory allocation so I've been playing for a while now and it's kind of crept up to about 15 gigs of memory allocation but it's never gone above that so I'm gonna go and Benchmark in the flight simulator thing now then we'll try some other games and rip some Ram out to see what performance impact that has oh and for those of you worried about the imminent fusion reaction on the CPU the Corsair aio's stock fan profiles were just on drugs and once I fixed them it fixed the problem no I know cyberpunk's been out for a while but I still wanted to check it out now at 1440p high with medium Ray tracing we're still just getting about 10 ish gigs of memory allocation it's not nearly as much as I thought whoa re4 uses more video memory than rad that actually sucks because it's not like you can spend 50 bucks on an extra 16 gigs of video memory so this is with all of the settings cranked even with Ray tracing on we're getting well over 200 frames per second at 1440p yeah I think we're gonna have to have very little Ram in the system before terrible things start happening but you know that's part of what we're here to find out oh even The Last of Us seems to be quite conservative but this is the first game where we've gotten over 16 gigs of memory allocation and we've got over 10 gigs on the GPU now this is at 1440p with like all of the settings cranked and yeah this is what it looks like when you've got 32 gigs of ram in here we've got a nice smooth frame time graph it feels all good and the things loaded in nice and quickly oh wait I just remembered a game that may use a lot more RAM okay at this point I'm convinced MSI afterburner is lying to us the new streets expansion is just allocating about 16 gigs of RAM I don't I don't know I thought escape from tarkov used way more RAM than that okay well that settles it let's rip some Ram out and see what happens to the performance now the first step down we're doing is dropping this 16 gig kit in there it's basically the same Ram just lessen it oh I love how regularly characters get stuck talking away from you so many cartoons are just you looking at the back of someone's head now aside from the back of head Action cutting the RAM amount in half made no difference to the performance in Starfield despite the ram allocation in some areas being lower than with the previous configuration it didn't seem to impact the performance oh the same thing goes for cyberpunk despite it showing lower memory allocation with the 16 gigs of RAM the performance is very much within the margin of error now again with Resident Evil we're seeing slightly lower memory allocation but this time around aside from the one percent lows and pretty much within the margin of error it seems to be performing identically we've got the same kind of smooth frame time graph and yeah it seems happy with it I think there may be areas later in the game where you need a bit more RAM but other than that it seems to be perfectly happy with 16 gigs oh no I forgot where I did the test last time and I don't know the new streets well enough to find my way back there easily oh and I've got a Timmy PMC so I can't run very far or fast I am so glad this is an offline raid and despite looking around for ages I just couldn't find the same spot but I did notice that the frame rate was very consistent and when I tested in a different spot I still got the same result so I guess that works now for the 8 gig part of the test I didn't want to use single Channel like some kind of animal so I went out and bought this 8 gig kit now it is a different brand but we're gonna run it at the same speed and cast latency so that shouldn't matter so we have that happening which we're very happy with the only sad part is we lost our RGB wait what why is it still performing the same I this doesn't make any sense I was expecting Carnage and all we got was slightly lower one percent lows why is it not performing worse I then thought maybe it had something to do with rebar but when I turned that off I still got out the same result so no apparently you just don't need RAM okay I'm not gonna lie I am starting to get a little confused here we've just gone eight gigs of ram in here and apparently cyberpunk doesn't mind it's perfectly happy with it okay it seems like a Resident Evil 4 also doesn't notice that there's just eight gigs of ram in the system maybe this shouldn't be weird to me but this is just no problem yay we finally found a game that's protesting the ram shortage although it's just not working as opposed to running terribly but then something terrible happened oh oh no I just accidentally loaded into a real rain oh no um how do I leave I don't know this map wow it's so much more stuttery now that it's like on a server it's it feels so much worse now although despite not being equipped for a full raid I managed to take a couple of players down with me but then because of a complete lack of directional audio I got gunned down from behind Okay well now with that having ended terribly I'm now in an offline round and as you can see it's performing way better battle State really needs to deal with their servers but putting that aside the flicker is back I don't know what's going on with this system it seems to be on heavy drugs but I don't know what the problem is with it and then putting that aside it's still performing the same why I think the reason I was expecting it to perform a lot was is because when I upgrade pre-built to 16 gigs it performs way better but usually that's also going from single to dual Channel let's try something let's plug in a single eight gig stick hey that's finally made some difference it's still not the knee to the girl groin I was expecting but it's worse now let's see what happens with a single 4 gig stick this was clearly a step too far because best case scenario the games just crashed right after they launched I then went down a stupid Rabbit Hole of trying to get worse performance out of the 8 gig kit first I launched every program on the PC in the background which made a bit of a difference to the one percent lows but clearly Windows is just too good at prioritizing where the resources need to go I then dropped star fuel down to low priority and task manager which made much less of a difference the next thing I wanted to try was to allocate more RAM to the igpu potentially tricking the games into running with less RAM available to them than they thought but after trying every platform I had available in the office not a single one of them would let me dedicate Ram to the igpu with a discrete graphics card in the system and the final thing I tried was dropping a completely different graphics card in this system now the last thing I'm going to try is a different graphics card ignore the the way the AMD graphics cards getting power that's all nvidia's stupid new arson connector's fault but I'm curious to see how this RX 6700 XT responds to having just 8 gigs of RAM oh no it also clearly doesn't care Starfield is just happy with eight gigs of RAM as long as it's a kit and not a single stick okay so that didn't really go as expected now just a quick disclaimer before we go I know that there are other games in the world and that some of them really like Ram so if you play like City skylines or Beam Drive or something like that you will probably benefit from a lot of ram but apparently Starfield doesn't care which brings me to the end of the video bye foreign foreign",

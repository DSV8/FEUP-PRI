    "transcript": "Do you know this passive information gathering method whois is a TCP protocol running on Port 43 we can use the whois command in a Linux or Mac terminal who is a database that can provide information about a domain and is often able to provide you with additional information such as the owner of a domain, contact details,name server and the registrar. The whois service is spread across multiple registrar and registries around the world. The information is sometimes public because registrar ask extra money for private registrations. I want to point out that we have registered on bugcrowd and we have permission from Canva to look at their domain. We type in the command here is canva.com in the Kali Linux terminal as you can see the registrar is gandi.net. The creation date was in 2001. You can see the expiration date, you can see the name servers, you can also see that the registrant details are all redacted. This will not always be the case who is it's just one of the passive information gathering tools.",

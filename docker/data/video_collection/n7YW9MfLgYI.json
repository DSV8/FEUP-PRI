    "transcript": "[Music] this is a new gaming pre-built by MSI which should be real interesting considering that the previous one did the PC equivalent of soiling itself on stage so this can only be better but we'll find out we'll find out soon enough let's open it up but first today's video sponsor that helped pay for the system today's video is sponsored by be quiet and their new FX series of products which is basically like their amazing standard products but with RGB be quiet his RGB defied their piroc 2 air coolers pure Loop 2 aios and purebase 500 cases and considering that they use non-proprietary RGB connectors that should minimize the RGB struggle so check the link in the video description if you want some be quiet RGB thanks be quiet for sponsoring today's video [Music] thank you now one of the redeeming factors of the previous MSI pre-built is that it came with the E-Waste peripheral equivalent of Brad Pitt's abs and Fight Club and this seems similar [Music] that is a reasonable E-Waste peripheral right there it'll definitely be usable and then we also have the E-Waste Mouse in here oh they've got two layers of turtle death protecting it that's nice and this is a clutch gm08 I don't even think you can consider these E-Waste peripherals that's pretty cool good job MSI and then finally we get some instructions about how to set up your new MSI gaming system I find it a bit weird that they don't say anything about how to diagnose blue screens of death on the system but maybe maybe it's less important on this one we'll find out soon enough I can do this I'm a strong independent woman oh you know it's gonna be a good day when you get stickers included with your gaming PC the sticker kind of looks like the little dragon is coming to enacts my office or wherever you set it down so if I stick it on anything I I guess MSI owns it then is that how property law works I don't know and then we get some technical support information Wi-Fi antenna power cable and two SATA cables very nice oh it's packaged in some very squidgy high quality foam foreign Edition there's just something about the way the top bit of plastic wraps around to the front and the pretend ventilation it doesn't look exactly like one it just does a similar Vibe ooh an embossed MSI logo very fancy in terms of front i o it's perfectly fine we've got two USB 3 ports a microphone and a headphone jack and oh a pretty satisfying power button by the look at the back they painted the inside of the case which is quite rare for these OEM crap boxes I'm going to take this sticker off to see what ports under here at risk of me accidentally using it for testing other than that the rear i o is nothing to soil your undies over but it's perfectly serviceable and then the power supply up here seems to be a standard ATX power supply which is good it means potentially that we can upgrade power supplies if we need to but that all depends on what kind of internal connectors we're using inside the system so on that note let's open it up and see what's going on inside this MSI system [Music] on first impression the inside of the system does not make me want to take a potato peeler to my eyes we have no proprietary parts that I can immediately identify we also have a CPU Cooler that doesn't just look like a cheap knockoff of an Intel stock cooler from 1752 it looks like a cheap knockoff Tower cooler from 1752 way better and it's got dual Channel Ram That's so exciting but now that the excitement of surpassing zero expectation has died down a little the cable management is is kind of shocking although it makes sense there doesn't seem to be much Cable Management space in the case and then we have a non-modular power supply so that's kind of why this Rat's Nest has built up in here this is quite a dark and dingy little case interior it doesn't look like there's a whole lot of airflow and stuff going on here so even though we have a better air cooler I I I think temperatures are still going to be a problem but depending on the temperatures later in the video we may change the case out to something a little less hermetic now in terms of specs the CPU under this cooler is an Intel i5 12 400 a very good CPU and then we have an RTX 3060 so that's the graphics card and 16 gigs of ddr4 in terms of storage we have an m.2 SSD which may fix the constant blue screening of the previous MSI pre-built uh that that problem was linked to a bad Windows install and a terrible SSD so maybe this won't crash the whole time fingers crossed so after having looked at the inside of the system I'm guessing the biggest pube in the ointment of the system is going to be the case that's not very good although having said that we've not looked at the power supply yet which could easily be a bigger problem so let's have a closer look at that foreign [Music] oh you actually can't see the back of the power supply from here now while we're back here you can see that we have some pretend Cable Management holes but there's no clearance between the back of the case and the back side panel so yeah it makes sense that this is all they could fit through here [Music] Apex gaming how have I never heard of that before I don't understand how at this point there are still power supply oems I've never heard of I feel like every one of the 17 000 pre-builts I've looked at has had a power supply in it by a different OEM how does it where are they all coming from now according to ltt's power supply tier list this Apex gaming stb is a d-tier power supply recommended only for very cheap igpu based systems this is not a very cheap igpu based system so not an ideal pairing for this PC so it may be a standard ATX power supply but that doesn't mean it's a good power supply so now that we've had a decent look at the physical inside of the system let's have a look at how much venereal disease that Hardware has been infected with from the factory foreign [Music] to turn it on I'm not gonna lie I'm actually pretty excited to press that power button so let's nice the thingy lights up which as we all know helps with ventilation actually on the note of ventilation I just noticed that MSI snuck some in around the acrylic mounting some sneak attack ventilation straight off the bat we get some Disney action we get clip champ video editor I mean I think some of this stuff just shows up with Windows 11 so that's not really msi's fault although we do have Norton Antivirus pre-installed which I'm not really sure if I think that's better or worse than McAfee let me know what you think in the comment section down below otherwise we also have MSI Center which oh I see it's like a VD Mothership that you use to cultivate more VD in your system that's exciting stuff although on a serious note why is MSI afterburner not one of these options it's a bit weird generally though for an oem pre-built the blower situation is not too bad just a couple retrovirals and you should be good in terms of ram speed it may be dual Channel but it's not running at its rated speed out of the box let's check the BIOS to see if we can change that we can good okay so I'm gonna do the initial testing with it at 266 megahertz and then I'll enable xmps to see how much of a difference that makes a bit later on that note let's check out the gaming performance GTA 5 running a 1080p very high settings we're doing well considering the fact that we actually have dual Channel Ram in here you can see that we may not be using a hundred percent of our GPU but we're not only using like 20 of it so yeah that's pretty good uh the Audi thing is that GPU temperature is not entirely promising I've only been playing like two minutes and we're in a room with an ambient temperature of 14 degrees Celsius and it's already just skyrocketed to 71 degrees Celsius so I've been playing Battlefield 5 for a little bit now and well it didn't take too long for us to get to 80 degrees Celsius on the GPU and you can you can hear it it sounds quite strained in there which considering the 15 degree ambient temperature in the room at the moment is is not ideal in terms of temperatures I think if you are in a hotter country it would get way hotter than that very fast in terms of performance at 1080p High settings with DirectX 12 Battlefield 5 is running very well because the system came with dual Channel out of the box we actually have it doing things so that is a a positive so with cyberpunk a 1080p medium settings we're getting in the mid to high 70s in terms of frame rate now I have been using the included MSI peripherals and luckily they don't make the voices come back although I don't love the mouse it's not very comfortable it kind of cramps up my ring finger a bit but in terms of like the sensor and stuff it's a it's a reasonable Mouse and it's miles ahead of the kind of thing you would get with an Acer or Dell based system now getting back to the game that is a razor flat frame time graph but anyway with that I am now going to install new drivers by ddu wiping GeForce experience and then I'll also enable xmps and then we can see how much of a difference that makes foreign wiping installing the newest drivers and setting the ram to its rated speed we got a healthy Improvement in performance especially when it comes to the one percent lows it led to a much smoother feeling gaming experience but that still leaves the sauna case to deal with so now that we've done some testing let's unshackle the system from its Acer loser inspired case to see how much of a difference it makes [Music] foreign things first we need to gut The Little Oven case [Music] so the exact RTX 3060 that's been struggling in this system is the Ventus too don't worry little buddy we're gonna put you in a better home soon oh look at that so that's another problem with this case power supply combination because we have this substandard power supply drawing all its air from the system cooking underneath it now I'm no expert but that seems like a bad idea to me MSI I don't know [Music] storage wise we have an MSI m390 nvme SSD and we've not had crashes so far so that's good now that we've got all the internals out and I'm keeping the power supply I'd recommend upgrading that but I don't have a reasonable replacement so for this video I'm going to stick with it but all of this stuff is now going to go into a new case which will hopefully help the temperatures now in terms of case we're going to use this NZXT H5 Elite that NZXT sent over I actually I thought this was going to be a flow the elite is a bit more of a fancy case than I would use for a case swap like this but I had it lying around and it will get the point across you know so so let's use it let's use it foreign [Music] look at those big ass fans in the front and we actually have some ventilation it's not the most ventilation but it's definitely not pretend ventilation it also has this special GPU blower fan thing which I feel like the front fans already blow air on the GPU but whatever I won't complain about more fans so with that let's drop our little MSI system in here just to illustrate our point of how important non-proprietary parts are I can't believe I'm actually putting this class 4 hazardous material power supply in this system [Music] foreign wow this quite quickly turned into a bit of an Abomination with the ketchup and mustard cables in the m80x motherboard inside an ATX case that kind of makes the system look like it's a fungus growing on the inside of the case but no that's missing the point this is a monument to the principle of modularity [Music] one of the fans don't work it's because that splitter is broken yes so much light holy crap [Music] so after about 20 minutes we are 13 degrees Celsius cooler on the GPU in this new case so that is a considerable difference in temperature and it's quieter as well there's just a purposeful hum to it but it doesn't sound like it's straining under the weight of its ovenness in the way that it did before and then the final question we need to answer is did I get the same blue screens of death I got with the previous MSI system and after three days of testing the closest thing I got to a blue screen of death was Norton interrupting a Battlefield 5 gaming session which obviously doesn't mean it never will but that is an order of magnitude better than the Codex R we looked at before which brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching and until the next video bye-bye [Music] foreign [Music]",

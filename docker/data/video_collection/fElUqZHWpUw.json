    "transcript": "- OK. - All right, this is take one of Boaty McBoatface. The boat'ning. ((beeping)) (claps) Hello and welcome to The Sizz. Matt, why am I about to look dumb on the internet? - [Matt] All right, we're back for another game show. Last time we played Vintage Tech, you think you did pretty well. - I always do well. I'm a smart person. - You got two out of three correct because you straight up guessed. And the one that you said \"Oh, I know all about\" is the one you got wrong. So we're gonna play this again. The rules of the game are simple. (thudding) I'm gonna ask you when technology that you think is modern actually was invented. - Yes. - And for every one that you get wrong, (machine jangles) $500 will be added to our mystery tech budget. Are you ready to play? - No. - Well, you're gonna play. - No (chuckles) (card clanks) I'm good, bye. - I could still play the game without you and after 30 seconds of no answering then - Came back - It counts as a loss. - Sorry, mystery tech budget, let's go. - What's in your pocket? - Well I can tell you I have a smart phone. - That's all I needed to know. Telephones have revolutionized the way we communicate with each other - Yes. - And they... - I have a wide variety of different ways of calling you stupid on my phone. - It's true, you do call me stupid a lot - On the phone - I have many the options. - You also have another phone - that you do carry around. - I do have another phone. - So you use two phones (phone clanks) to call me stupid. - Oh, that's a good point. - I'm gonna make this one easy for you. In what century were telephones invented? - All right, explain to me what your definition of a telephone is. - Is it like two cave men - The alien across a field or something like. Give me more details. - [Matt] No that's yelling. - I need more information. - No you don't. That's not how this works. (laughs) You don't hear Ken Jennings asking Alex Trebek for more information. - Yeah because they got real writers who know how to ask correct questions. I didn't get to pick a category, I don't get to pick why are you stupid for 300. - I've never been more offended by something I 100% agree with. (pops) Is it A, The 700s (pops) B, the 1600s. (pops) C, 100 B.C's? I don't know how to say that. - B.C's. (laughs) - The 100 B.C. century (pops) or D, 1800s. - I'll start out by saying that I have no absolute whatsoever remote idea of the answer to this. I don't have a concept of what a telephone could be. Because when you say telephone, my initial instinct is the 1800s you know when the telephone was invented, but you're crafty, you're gonna try and make me look dumb. So you're gonna be like, oh it was Leonardo DeVinci who invented the string which you could yell through or something dumb which doesn't make any sense. - Or I could be trying to trick you and it actually is the 1800s - Oh yeah, that's a good point. Maybe I should say 1800s then. - Now there is actually some debate over who actually invented the telephone - I debate at 200 B.C. - Most would say it's Alexander Graham Bell in 1976. - Wait, did you say 1976? - I did. - Did you write your cue card wrong? (mumbles) (laughs loudly) - It's very tiny text. - You wrote the cue card. - It's very tiny text. - 1976, great year for Alexander Graham Bell. ((beeping)) - So him and Thomas Watson had the famous first phone call \"Mr. Watson, come in. \"I want you.\" That is, - Is that actually the real words he said? - Yes. Other people would say it was the Italian-American inventor, Antonio Meucci. So, he invented a voice communication apparatus in 1849. However, it was Bell who beat him to the patent office. Meucci's design looked an awful lot like physicist Robert Hooke's lover's telephone. roughly 1,200-1,400 years ago around the year 700-ish is the first known use of the lover's telephone where they attach two halves of gourds together with twine. The device that was found in an ancient tomb had 75 feet of twine together. - That's actually kind of far. (growls) - It was elite who used them because in their civilization, it was actually forbidden for elites and servants to have face-to-face communication. So that is your first answer wrong and $500 have been added to the budget. - Well, I'm gonna if you're actually okay with that because both of my answers were wildly off and while I think the idea of literally two cans and a piece of string in the middle is a wild farce of an idea that you're gonna try-- - Have you ever tried to use it? - No, I have not. - It works. It works, so FaceTime. Was it invented in A The 1870s, (pops) (pops) B, the 1960s, C, The 1930s or D The 1920s - You know my question, what is your definition of FaceTime? You're saying an actual video call? - [Matt] Yes. - [Austin] Across (mumbles) - [Matt] Distance. - My strong inclination is the 20s or the 30s because that was when TV was just started to become a thing and there's no reason why your FaceTime you couldn't just have two TV-style broadcast being transmitted across. I don't know why this is what TV looks like, but this is just imagine, TV being waved like this. It's gotta be the 20s or the 30s. - I'll give you a hint, it's not record. It's live. - I feel pretty confident in 20s and 30s, though. I think it's just a 50, 50 shot. I'm going to say the 19 20 is final answer. - Thomas Edison's telephonoscope was first introduced in the 1870s and was published in Punch Magazine. Punch was actually a satire magazine and at this point video calling was, in fact, science fiction. However, in 1929, German scientist Dr. George Schubert showed off the - [Electronic Voice] Gegensehn Fernsprechanlagen - AKA, the visual telephone system. It used coax cable to transmit 180 lines of resolution, roughly 40,000 pixel equivalent, - Mmm. at 25 FPS from Berlin to Hamburg. - That actually sounds very impressive. - But beating Dr. Schubert to the punch was AT&T's R & D division, Bell Labs who, in 1927 developed the iconophone, which was from the Greek word for image and sound. - [Austin] I got it right. - I got it right. - The iconophone ran just 18 frames per second. - That's fine. - And the video portion was only one way. And the whole apparatus took over the whole room. - Okay, just get to the point where I'm right. - You are correct. (yells) - Yes. Yes. - So, Herbert Hoover, before he was president used that iconophone to give an address from DC to New York in 1927. - I got to milk a cow at the Herbert Hoover presidential library. (cow moos) It was very, very entertaining. - You got one of two. - 50%! That's passing! - So AT&T continued their development, so in 1964 they introduced-- - Oh way - The picture phone at the World's Fair. So it was a tiny TV with a built-in camera and then in the 70s it was actually commercially available. - Dude, that is so cool. So that was the thing. I remember when I was growing up, the dream was to have video calling. And it really wasn't a thing that anyone really had until things like Skype came along and later FaceTime. - And that is because for the 1970 version of the picture phone, it cost $160 a month just for the equipment. - And then 25 cents a minute per calling. For context, that is roughly the equivalent to $1000 a month for the equipment and $5 a minute when you adjust for inflation. - That's a lot of money. - [Matt] Yeah, it didn't really take off because even the ultra-rich, like, this was expensive. When were DVDs slash Blu-rays... So video discs, invented? (pops) Was it A, 1890s, (pops) B, 1970s, (pops) C, 1920s (pops) or D, 1910s. - So, I'm immediately gonna really put the antic on you. When you say DVDs or Blu-rays, does it like... Like does laser disc count? Or are you specifically saying one is DVD? - Sure, laser disc is a video disc. - Okay, so a video that is put onto some form of a disc. - And I'll remind you, for those of you who didn't watch our Vintage Tech episode last time, all the dates that I pick are not just arbitrary numbers. They are all actual numbers in history where major things happened for this technology. - But it wasn't necessarily the correct, so maybe like there was a disc that had a frame of video in 1974. Or whatever - It's called a picture. One frame of video is called a picture, - Thanks, Matt. - So. (wheezes) - [Austin] So, my immediate thought would be something like laser disc which I believe the first commercially available disc-style format. I know there are ways today to encode video onto records. However, I don't know if that was a technology that was necessarily around back in the day, but I think laser disc is way too simple and easy for you to make that the answer. I think it's 1910s or '20s. I'm going to say 1920s. Final answer. - In the 1890s there were a number of disc-shaped mediums such as Eadweard Muybridge's zoopraxiscope. - What? Nothing old has a real name it's like how many random words can we smash into the 'hydroelectrophonomograph'? - Everything was named after the technology that was squished together. - Well, to be fair now like why do you just keep dropping vowels from normal words (laughs) and calling them startups? - Yeah, I'm looking at WVFRM. (chuckles) (yells) - Ho... Wait, wait, but don't you wanna be on WVFRM one day? - The ironic thing is-- - What if Marques unsubscribes? - These were paper or glass discs and they had about a dozen or so images so they were zoetrope when they moved at the correct speed they had motion. - However, that doesn't count though, right? That's not a disc. Does that technically count, or no? - So, I'm not counting it. - Okay good Whew. - Cause in 1927, inventor John Logie Baird, I don't know, I can't pronounce words. Invented the phonovision. - [Austin] Sounds very legitimate I think that's the correct answer. - The great, great, great grandfather of the DVD burner. Only scanned about 30 lines of resolution and it was just... I mean, it looked something like this. - [Austin] Dude. - [Matt] Yeah. - [Austin] No, no. - So while that was considered a massive failure video discs were pretty much just abandoned until the 70s when Hitachi and Sony started making their own versions. Now, laser disc was actually like the 4th or 5th video disc there were all sorts of other ones. - That was the first commercially like... - Not even. - No? - Not even. It just ended up becoming the most popular of these other formats. So the way that CDs work now and DVDs is the data is actually burned on with a laser and it's grooves. It's microscopic grooves - So it's up or down 001 (Yells) and then you have enough of those to increase. - And so that whole technique was inspired by the way that he was doing these records and actually doing physical engraving on the disc. So, that is why the 1920s is when video discs were invented. - So are you trying to tell me now that lifetime total I am 4 for 6 in this game which is very much full of a lot of questionable decisions and I'm still all mostly correct. - Cause you're just taking a dart and throwing them at the wall. - I'm using deductive reasoning. - Your deductive reasoning? - I am - Using my big monkey brain to try to pare it down to something which might make some sense and then I use some luck to narrow it down to a four out of six chance of being correct. - So what do you guys think (rhythmic rock music) what should I test Austin with next? I just want him to be wrong you know Tweet at me, leave it in the comments, let me know what I should quiz him on next he doesn't read the comments anyway - I would accept any congratulatory Tweets or comments or how really huge brained I am or how Matt sucks at choosing questions So, uh, thanks for watching please subscribe. Until next time, Matt, play us out. (hums) - Oh, God. Please don't play that 1920s disc already. (grates) - [Austin] I don't like this at all.",

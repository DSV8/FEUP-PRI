    "transcript": "a few weeks back we looked at Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors featuring the i7 7700K and the i5 7600k and while these new chips didn't offer a significant increase in performance compared to their predecessor the skylake platform people who are looking for an upgrade from their existing Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge systems could benefit from new features and noticeable performance gains while many of Kaby Lake's true benefits will only be realized by people with older systems or those who absolutely want support for intel's upcoming optane technology there are still people who will see value in these new cpus today we're taking a look at yet another Kaby Lake processor but this time one that costs less than $200 and this is it the i3-7350k now you may ask what's so special about the CPU well it comes unlocked for easier overclocking and I feel like it's a pre reaction to a in these upcoming writes and architecture rather than a favor being done for budget-minded overclockers so let's dive in and take a closer look at this little monster from Intel but before we move on a quick message from our sponsor choose be quiet to join the silent revolution designed and tested in Germany they're meticulous passion for quiet PC components ranges from premium power supplies CPU coolers and fans and innovative PC cases all of which aim to achieve one thing is this thing even on that's right totally quiet power supplies even under load silent Lynx fans deliver awesome airflow with noise that doesn't reach your ears all enclosed in the package designed to be quiet now before we take a closer look at the CPU I want to get something off my shoulders you see many here at Hardware Canucks still believe that the i3 6100 was one of the best options during the skylake generation it had two physical cores clocked at 3.7 gigahertz along with hyper-threading and it just costs $120 while it may not have been a chart topper in synthetic benchmarks or high-level rendering its performance and games was extremely good the i3 7350k follows a similar tradition but it offers a few extra goodies that budget focus overclocking enthusiasts would love to play around with but that comes with a cost now the specs on the 7350k CPU are pretty thing the 4.2 beginners base clock speed aligns perfectly with the $245 i5 7600K processor that also features 4 threads though across a native quad-core layout also remember ikely processors don't have access to Intel's photographers technology and comes with very limited cache so don't expect performance metrics to match the 7600K CPU despite the clock speed similarities turbo-boost max maybe the biggest omission here since without it the 7350K won't be able to consistently remain at higher frequencies so what will the difference be well we'll find out about that during the benchmarks one small hiccup in this equation may come from the current pricing of this processor even though Intel says it's supposed to cost about 170 US dollars actually finding it for less than $190 is a challenge right now price wise that causes the i3 7350K to compete against the i5 7500 and as you'll see in a bit later that's a site it just can't win another factor that most people should take into consideration is compatible motherboard pricing right now you need a Z270 motherboard to at least take advantage of the overclocking capabilities of these 7350k and these boards are not cheap they're almost as pricy as the CPU which really questions the price to performance aspect it's already obvious that Intel's higher in unlocked Kaby Lake CPUs reach the 4.9 to 5.2 gigahertz mark provided they're adequately cooled in the launch review I was easily able to hit over 5ghz with both the 7700K and the 7600K but realistically speaking you're not going to spend $150 on a CPU cooler to cool $170 processor it just doesn't make any sense so with that in mind I approached overclocking from a slightly more budget focused mindset and used a natural Nhu 12s which cost between 40 to 50 dollars the end result was that the i3 7350K was easily able to hit 5 gigahertz with just a few tweaks within the BIOS and it was debt stable during our six-hour I 264 system stability test which is our gold standard for determining whether or not an overcompensating to note is that even though 5.1 gigahertz and even five point two gigahertz were stable for many benchmarks neither was able to stay over the long term so how does the reference clock in overclock 7350K stack up with other CPUs we've reviewed over the last few years we try to equalize the test systems as much as possible with all memory GPUs etc running at the same speed note that slightly older video drivers were used since this allowed us to standardize testing procedures across multiple CP generations so let's get on with this and start with basic synthetic benchmarks as you can see the 7350K at 5 gigahertz breaks the barrier between the lower end i3 6100 and the mid-range i5 6400 CPU there isn't a massive difference between the stock and the overclock speeds but later on in the test it stacks up really well against the very popular i5 4670K CPU which is an old clock by the way now I can't say exactly how this processor would stack up against the i5 7500 but as you can see even when overclocked the 7350K traits below the shock i5 6500 this is likely due to the limited amount of cache becoming a bottleneck in some scenarios moving on to single toilet testing where multi-threading and cache don't matter as much as you can see that the i3 7350K both some amazing results this will likely translate into some very competitive gaming results - there's no doubt this chip will perform really well in programs that are emphasized for single threaded performance mind you the other high end CPUs were not overclocked for our test this is just to give you a rough idea as to how well $870 overclocked dual core for thread CPU performs against its much expensive counterparts that is particularly true in the real world benchmarks you're seeing now many of these tests stress all four threads with the only exception being our dolphin emulation that uses a single thread to process a simple game scene while overclocking doesn't speed things up significantly the premium you pay for the k-series chip doesn't translate into performance that can consistently beat Intel's yes processors gaming on the other hand was a pleasant surprise our initial tests use a lower 720p resolution in an effort to take the GPU out of the equation and allow the processors to shine on their own as you can see the 5 gigahertz 7350K CPU stacks up amazingly well with Intel's Broadwell-E CPUs and the gap between the stock and the overclocked frequencies is pretty significant to what's important to take away from these results is that not too many games properly use more than two threads so these 7350K is able to climb its way near the top of the charts and now on to 1080p where most people are gaming here we can see that the GPU becomes more of a bottleneck and as a result many of the processors aligned with one another overclocking makes a very little difference so while it might look good to be running at 5 gigahertz in reality it doesn't really change frame rates that much now this situation might change as multi-core aware API is like Vulcan and dx12 become more popular but for the next little while at least if you're on a budget it doesn't make sense to pay a fortune for your processor instead put that money towards beefing up your graphics card I mean seriously just do that power consumption was just as expected running stock it's actually quite impressive almost tying with the i3 6100 but when overclock things shift a little north the 7350k consumes a lot more power than the i5 6500 but it offers similar multi-turreted performance so there's a give and take policy here oh hey there nc XCOM is Canada's leading a tailor for anything your mind desires just keep within those categories which are plenty and be attempted by the weekly deals visit ncx dot-com Hold Em sweet deals so what can I say about the i3 7350k to be honest it's a very confusing CPU because you see the performance is fantastic when compared against Intel's other i3 series chips and the ability to overclock does give you some benefits in many applications what bothers me the most is the price that you pay for this at $170 it's already pretty expensive and with current pricing hovering around $190 there are far better options out there that don't necessarily need overclocking to grant you amazing performance not only that but it's also the other components like the motherboard cooling GPU Ram etc that all come into the equation if you're going to z270 you might as well spend an extra $75 and pick the i5 7600K CPU because you get fantastic multi-threaded performance when overclocked and if you want more power you can easily up to the i7 7700K at this price there's very little value with the 7350K especially if you have to pay over $170 for it if budget is first and foremost on your mind when amazing option might be the i5 7500 or i5 7400 alongside b250 based motherboard with that combination you'd be able to invest in a much better graphics card and still achieve CP performance that's similar or better than an overclocked i3 3750k and that's what I'm going to end this review what do you guys think of the i3 7350k does the performance justify its price tag or would you spend the extra cash on a much powerful processor let us know in the comments down below I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

    "transcript": "(upbeat pop music) - [Voiceover] Hey guys, Jonathan here, and for the most part, backpacks all function the same. They have pockets and compartments and slots that house our valuables. But there's something special about how one might differ from another, what makes it unique. And what makes this one special here is that it's $24. But the question is, what exactly does $24 get you with a backpack? For starters, this is not flashy at all. It's a simple one-color design, super stealthy, which may be exactly what you're looking for because the backpack doesn't scream-- - Hey, yeah you! I got some expensive shit in here! - [Voiceover] So, that way, whether you're traveling to work or to school or wherever, you're keeping the attention on you down to a minimum. Now, this is made for laptops up to 16\". And what's nice is, in the main compartment, there's a mesh pocket which will prevent your laptop from sliding around. On top of that, there's also a really handy Velcro strap that's gonna add a layer of secureness. And little things like that are a nice surprise and not something you'd expect on a backpack this inexpensive. For reference, this is a 15\" MacBook Pro. So, if you plan on using this with anything smaller, like a 13\" laptop or a tablet, I would definitely recommend picking up a sleeve to go along with that to keep everything secure. Beyond the laptop though, there is still space in the main compartment for books or an 8x10 of Drake. And while I wish there was a little more padding on the sides for your laptop, it's still nice that you get padding on the back, which results in not only protection for your laptop or tablet, but also overall comfort for you. As far as the straps go, they are straps and keep the backpack on your shoulders. But in all seriousness, this is one area where I wish there was a little more padding. An each side of the backpack are slots for water bottles and I was easily able to fit a one-liter bottle on each side. But aside for just water, these are gonna work great for bluetooth speakers or, if you love beans, you can throw them cans in there. Now, as far as the middle compartment goes, this is gonna work great with over-ear headphones, even those that have cases. And beyond that, this is where you have a ton of nooks and crannies for thumb drives, hard drives, a stylus, pen, pencil or, funny enough, the Apple Pencil, in case you own an iPad Pro because Apple does not give you a decent way to store that thing. And what I thought was a really nice touch is this little dangling hook right here, which is perfect for something like a pair of keys because you don't want them falling all the way down to the bottom. (slow piano music) Now, unfortunately, there is no 30-pin connector built into the backpack, which may break some hearts out there. (upbeat pop music) On the bright side, it's 2016 and battery banks are like $10 and you can pick whatever cable your heart desires. Lastly, there's a zipper pouch towards the front, and this is perfect for those things that you need quick access to, whether it's your 4x6 of Drake because there are certain situations where you simply cannot whip out your 8x10, your earphones, an external power bank. And, honestly, it's perfect for things like snacks and food because we all gotta eat. And overall, it's a really well-rounded backpack that could easily sell for more than $24. Aside from that, thank you guys very much for watching. Hopefully, you enjoyed the video. If you did and you love backpacks as much as I do, make sure to go 8x10 a Drake on that like button. If you love budget tech or you wanna see more awesome things under $25, check out the playlist here. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later. - Hey, yeah you! (laughs)",

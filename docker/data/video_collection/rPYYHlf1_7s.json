    "transcript": "- Today, we're checking out the world's first 16-inch QHD gaming laptop. This is the Lenovo Legion 7. (upbeat music) A huge thank you to Lenovo Legion and Microsoft for sponsoring this video. (upbeat music) You guys, I am so, so, so, so excited to show you guys this laptop. I know we do a ton of laptop videos here, but this is a pre-production unit of Lenovo Legion 7 16-inch. So this really is the first look that we're getting at this device. So I've been using this all this past week, and it's honestly so incredible. This 16-inch display is so perfect for gaming. It has 165 Hertz refresh rate, and an extra wide 16 by 10 aspect ratio. This has an eight core AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX mobile processor, which will give you high frame rates while not compromising battery life. With the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card, we'll be getting a huge upgrade in graphics performance as well. One thing I love so much about this laptop is the fact that it is so portable, so I really can game basically, anywhere. It's not often that you get a laptop that's this small and portable, that's this powerful. You can also spec this out with up to 2 TB of storage, and up to 32 gigs of ram. One feature that makes a huge difference in performance is the Lenovo Legion AI engine. Now this is exclusive to Lenovo Legion laptops, and it's a series of AI solutions that will dynamically shift power between the CPU and the GPU for more frames per second on your favorite games. Basically, they're just kind of making it really easy for us to overclock this. (upbeat music) So no gaming laptop review would be complete without actually gaming on it, and one of the things that I love about having a laptop that I can game on, is of course I can connect a controller, because I have an Xbox controller all hooked up to this. When I used to travel a lot, I would always bring a controller with me, so I would be gaming on the plane, I would be gaming in hotel rooms. I cannot wait to start traveling again because this laptop will definitely be coming with me. Also, I'm very excited about and I've talked about this in many different videos before, is the Xbox game pass. It's always being updated with new games, so it's a really great subscription service, if you want to just play a bunch of different games, and have access to new ones all the time. Right now I'm going to play Forza, this is a part of X-Box game pass. So let's freaking race, shall we? The speakers on this thing, are actually pretty impressive as well. - [Narrator] The most diverse sanctioned motor sport series. For decades, it's drawn the racing world's best. (car engine roaring) - Beep beep, goodbye, my friends. So far while gaming, I've been really impressed with the performance. We're hardly having any drop frames. Everything is running so smoothly. Beep beep, move out of the way. And the fact this is all running on a laptop, wow, I'm so shook. This is incredible. 15th. Cool. We don't have to talk about that. Oh no. It's raining. I'm not ready to be driving in these elements. Oh, I'm slipping and sliding all over this track. (car engine roaring) I just pushed that car all the way off into the grass. (car engine roaring) Holy moly. I have crashed my vehicle. (car engine roaring) We're, we're riding together. We're best friends. (laughs) We ended that race, actually together. Far Cry New Dawn installed, ready to go. Oh, I love this game. I'm so excited already to start playing. (laughs) This would be great. I mean this is running, really smoothly. Oh,shoot. She wasn't ready. Oh, Hey. Get out of here, I'm freeing my friends. No! Don't jump off there. You're going to die. You have fallen. Go to the river, we got to go to the river. Look how pretty this is, like the graphics, like every, look at that, let's look at this water. Oh. Oh. Hi. Are you? Yep. You're, you're strapped to that. Look at the hummingbirds. Oh, it makes me so happy. We need more duct tape. Check at the corner? What? What do you think I'm doing? Yeah, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em. Oh my gosh. I'm dying. All right, so I played a little bit of Far Cry, I definitely plan on playing this game, a lot more. Playing some Halo for my third and final gaming test. This has been running so smooth, and normally when you're gaming on a laptop, sometimes I do feel like there is some performance hindrance because you are gaming on a mobile device, but this has been running, very, very smooth, I'm very impressed. You guys do not stand a chance with my impeccable aim, and talent. We got to go kids, let's roll. Bye, by a friend. Let's freaking go, so you're going to drive with me? Did somebody else want to drive? Or is this, or am I in charge now? Where's all my friends at? Have I left them? Have I left my friends behind? So gaming on this thing, was just an absolute delight. Like I don't even know how else to explain it, because the screen is incredible. Having this 16 by 10 aspect ratio really does give you a lot more screen real estate, and you don't really realize it until you're actually in the game, and playing. The 165 Hertz refresh rate, also absolutely incredible. Like everything about this, just is amazing. Normally when you're gaming on a laptop, I feel like there is some performance loss, but I was playing some pretty processor intensive games on this thing. I barely heard the fans, and I feel like I was not dropping frames, and everything was running really, really well. I also really love the keyboard, just the travel on the keys, it's like a very soft type. Just the overall design of this thing, like it just looks cool. I like that they have the logo up here on the side, so it kind of just leaves this whole thing open and clean. I love the design of the air vents on the side, like there are so many things that I absolutely just, love about this. It's just, I'm speechless. It's incredible. (upbeat music) The colors on it are also really great. With best-in-class color accuracy and high dynamic range. I've also been doing a lot of photo editing in addition to gaming, so it's always nice to know that I'm getting the most accurate colors possible. One of things that I love about this laptop is, you're not going to need a dongle, there are so many ports on this that you should be set for whatever you need to do. I also liked that, a lot of the ports are on the back, including the power adapter. I'm so used to having power cables on the left or the right side. And normally, that's where I would have my mouse if I'm gaming. And I'm also left-handed, so if I'm using like a stylus or something, that's also over here, so there's just cords everywhere. I like that, it's all nice and compact in the back. On the right, we have a USB-C, and also this electronic shutter button. This allows you to electronically disconnect your webcam from the board. So if privacy is something that you're concerned about with the webcam, (snaps) they've got you covered. On the left side, we have a USB-C and 3.5 millimeter headphone jack. On the back, we have three USB type A's, one USB-C, HDMI, Ethernets, and your power adapter. I'm really into the RGB lighting inside the vents and along the body of the laptop, as well as the keyboard, and even on the logo. Plus it's fully customizable using the Corsair iCUE app. And obviously I'm going to make it painful (upbeat techno music) In the iCUE app, you can customize every single light that is on this thing, including the keyboard. Like you can click and change the colors of all of the keys. You can select all of them, and basically have a rainbow party. You can also choose from a bunch of different lighting effects, you have your rainbow wave, color shift, color pulse, color wave, visor, rain. I like that's my favorite. Oh, this one's pretty too. (upbeat techno music) There's also the option to choose static colors. Oh look at that, pink. Nice. Thank you guys so much for watching, I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Again, a huge thank you to Lenovo Legion and Microsoft for sponsoring this video. You guys want to get more info, or to purchase this laptop, I will put a link in the description, and I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye. (upbeat techno music)",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys it's Justine, and today we're checking out a thermal imaging camera. You guys may be familiar with the brand FLIR. They are basically from as far as I know, one of the leading manufacturers of these types of cameras. They have all kinds of crazy high-end ones, but this is one that works with your phone. I have some plans here this year to go, and start hunting Sasquatch again. Squatch Watch So I figured I should probably get some of the latest gear. This is the FLIR ONE Pro, and what's cool about this is obviously, if you're not hunting Sasquatch, or things like that. You can use this around the house to determine if there's leaks, or really, I'm not really sure because that's really not what I'm going to be using it for. But you can use it for practical things, like not hunting Bigfoot. (upbeat music) (scissors snipping) I can't find my knife, and not just one knife, I can't find any of them, I probably have 55, and I can't find a single one. Oh! (box scratching) \"See the Heat.\" And this is it, it's super small. This just goes right on your iPhone. See if there's anything else in the box. A little case! Aww! (case zipping) Some people don't like custom cases for their things, but I absolutely love them. Like look at this it just fits perfectly in here. (plastic rummaging) (plastic smacking) USB-C! Charge it for an hour. It wants me to charge it for an hour. (can thuds) So this is a thermal imaging camera, and what's crazy about this is this can detect temperatures up to 752 degrees Fahrenheit. That's pretty incredible. You're not gonna be seeing the way that you normally would see through a regular camera lens, like you're seeing everything here. You're gonna be seeing heat maps. And you don't need any light to see, so this will work in the complete pitch black. Let's charge it up and test it out! This is exactly what we need, to find Sasquatch. We probably need a few other things too, but don't worry. That's why I've been on Amazon all weekend! Let's go! So we're out here, it's all set up now, everything is charged, and right now, I'm gonna take my first photo! Here, okay Tyler could you move over a little bit? Oh my gosh, you got to see what you look like. (laughs) So it looks like your temperature is about, well so it depends upon where we are. So about like 90 something Fahrenheit? I have the spot meter on right now, which you guys can see right here on the screen, so whenever I point something kind of at the middle of it, it will tell me what that temperature is. So right here, table is about 63 degrees Fahrenheit. And then we're gonna go up there, there's my bag, and then there is Tyler. I'm gonna take my first photo. Okay, ready? So next door, there looks like there's a lot of action going on over there. Oh my gosh! It's like 131, 132! What is happening over there at the massage parlor? And you guys can see here in the settings there's different overlays that you can do. So right now I have sort of a mix, you can see like the outlines of things, but you can also switch this to just thermal only. And then you can click this, and this will give you, basically what it looks like out of a normal camera. So you can do a mix of both, which looks pretty cool 'cause you can see that there's all kinds of little outlines. And the thermal just gives you thermal imaging. Like I mentioned before, this is something that can work in complete darkness, because it's not really using a camera, or light, it's using heat. Okay, so now I'm recording a video, and there's Tyler. It's really funny because it looks like you're wearing sunglasses (laughs) in this video, because of the temperature of your glasses, they look like they're shades. So there you are, there's the massage parlor, some hot things are happening over there. And it's cool because I don't have the little outlines on anymore, so really all you're seeing is the thermal imaging. I'm so fascinated by these types of cameras. Okay Tyler, let's see what I look like! - [Tyler] Okay. - Here we go, all right. - [Tyler] You're made of lava! - (cries) The Justine is lava! I'm also, I'm a little cold right now actually, and my hands are cold. Can you tell that my hands are cold? - [Tyler] Yeah, especially like your fingertips. - I'm cold, I'm chilled. - [Tyler] But your face is the sun. - I am the sun! (Tyler laughs) - I'm so bright and cheery. So, I guess now, let's go find out who's hot and who's not! (car honking) Yeah, I know! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Okay, hold on I'm gonna take your picture, so don't move. This is so weird. This is so freaking weird. I can't even handle it. Okay, it's weird, it's weird. I can't wait to show you. Do you think we should go get Starbucks? I think we really, we probably should go to Starbucks. Just so I can see the temperature of a coffee. To make sure it's to my liking. I just wanna make sure, I wanna check in on Starbucks, just to make sure that they're doing everything correct. - [Employee] What can I get for you? - Could I get a grande, non-fat chai? - [Employee] A grande, non-fat chai, did you want that hot or iced? - Hot please. Can I get it extra hot? Let's see how the cold one-- Oh my god this is incredible! I'm having the best time of my life. The cold drink is 35, 36 degrees Fahrenheit. Hot drink, 115 degrees. (machines steaming) (staff talking) Wow. Hi! - [Barista] Hello! How are you? - [Justine] Good, how are you? What is the temperature that you brew, like, the milk to? - [Barista] Between a 150 and 170 degrees, but it depends on what the, like some customers ask for specific orders-- - So I got mine extra hot, what do you guys usually do to temperature? - 170 generally. So which one? Did you get the Chai Tea Latte? - I did, yes. - Awesome, on the way let's go see how close it is. - Yes, oh my gosh this is great! I'm so exited! - [Barista] I mean let's do it with the milk. - [Justine] Okay. - [Barista] And also because your Chai Tea Latte, half of it is hot water, it's gonna be even hotter. (milk steaming) - [Justine] Okay. - [Barista] So it might hit 175 by the time we're done. - This is awesome. Oh my gosh, this is so cool. Is that it right there or is that somebody else's? - This is the milk for you, so you can see-- - So that one it says it's about 125. This is so cool. - [Barista] So here, so let's see, this is your chai with the hot water, and the extra hot non-fat. There you are. How does it look? - [Justine] Oh my gosh it's great. So it's saying it's like 135. - [Barista] Yeah, it's interesting-- - [Justine] Because of the foam? - [Barista] 'Cause the foam, yeah. It's really aerated, so you're gonna get a lot of contact with the air around it. - [Justine] This is so awesome. - [Barista] So, if you were to take off the lid. - [Justine] Oh, then you can swipe down and see what it actually looks like! (gasps) Like you can even see the logo on there. Like, how cool! So I took the temperature off. - Oh wow that is super cool. - But you can see, like it's so neat. Could you take a picture of me with my drink with the camera? - [Tyler] Yeah totally. - [Justine] Okay. (giggles) Look how silly I look. With my little smile and my drink. This is mixing the actual image with the thermal imaging, so you can see my creepy, excited smile. (laughs) I wonder what'll happen when I drink it. 'Cause my mouth will get warmer. Okay, ready? - [Tyler] Yeah. (Justine laughs) - [Tyler] Seriously, your whole head lights up. - Really? - [Tyler] Yeah. - 'Cause it actually, I feel like I start getting really warm 'cause it's really, really hot. - [Tyler] Oh my god! - What, is it weird? Can you see it go down my throat? - [Tyler] I see it going through your-- - Really? - [Tyler] Like nerves or something. - No way! - [Tyler] Yeah, like it's really, like in to it. Oh yeah let's watch your. - Shut up, is it weird? What is happening? - [Tyler] It's freaking crazy. - Oh my gosh! This is so crazy. (machines rumbling) (Justine laughing) (upbeat music) - Okay, let's go outside to continue our experiment. We're gonna do a little experiment. So we were inside Starbucks and I was drinking the hot drink, well now were going to drink the cold drink, and then drink the hot drink, and I also have very sensitive teeth, so this is going to really suck. Okay, now I'm drinking the hot. Oh god my teeth. This is terrible, this is torture. I'm just looking at your face, and you look terrified. - [Tyler] It's crazy, it just makes your whole face light up every time you take a drink. - Wow! Science is cool. God, this latte's incredible. So, the battery on this definitely doesn't last very long, it was at a 100%, we're now at 40%. I guess it's been on for about an hour, so that's not too bad. But I think that we should continue on, and test out some more things. And then, we're gonna head back inside to investigate my home. See if there's any, problems. I don't even know what I'd be looking for. Like what am I going to look for a problem, like a leak? I hope I don't have a leak. I wonder how hot Matty is? He's getting a haircut right now. That's my dog. Just in case you wanna know. Okay, just picture, it's night time and you're out, I don't know what you're doing, you're camping and you can't see anything. So here Tyler just hold this. I'm going to be an animal in the night. Look at me, I'm an animal of the night. (intense music) I'm an animal of the night! (intense music) (Justine screams) Found Bigfoot. I'm gonna definitely have to test this out in pitch black, and go out and see if I can find some real animals of the night. 'Cause right now I'm just a daytime raccoon that has rabies. Okay, so now I'm going to pick up my dog, so Tyler do you want to wait out here while I grab him and you can film? - [Tyler] Yeah! - See how warm his little doggy body is. (upbeat music) Oh my gosh, you can see the pee. More to come. (gasps) I'm a child! Let's go home and investigate my home. We're back home now, and we're doing all kinds of things, I'm finding crime all over the place. Watch this. Watch. This. I have spotted crime. Oh wow. No way! Like I can still see where you put your hand print earlier. I also put my hand print somewhere down there. Actually right there. I have an idea. Okay could you hold this? I'm going to lay down on the floor, and I'm gonna see if my body imprint will stay here. This is true crime. Warm body! No way! (Tyler laughs) Oh my god! Look at this! The crime, the crime had been committed. Oh my goodness, okay let's see what else we can find around here. I wonder if there happens to be any wild animals? Spotted. You're a hot boy. It's saying Matty is 174 degrees. Are you okay? Oh my god this is terrifying. You look like a cute boy. All infrared. Real hot dog. Matty lemme get your picture, lemme see how cute you are. Oh my gosh, this is where Matty was laying. This is so funny, it's 75 degrees there, Matty. Your little, his crossed paws. Okay, let's go see what's outside Matty. Let's see if we can see any creatures in the night. So it's really dark out right now, as you can tell. God, I was really hoping I'd see a creature. Wait a minute! No, not a creature. Ugh, disappointed. (gasps) A creature of the night! Come on creature of the night, let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, creature! So that's something that I did. I'm looking forward to taking this thing out and finding Sasquatch. Thank you guys for watching, I will see you in my next video. Perhaps with a Sasquatch sighting. Do you think I'll get like a medal or something if? No? But they've been looking for him for so long. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here so Amazon partnered with me for a second gift guide this one's for smart home tech so if You know someone who's interested in smart homes because they moved into a new house or a new apartment Or if they just want to bring technology into their home this video is for you I actually recently moved into a new home and I had to do a little bit of research to figure out what I wanted what I didn't want and These are my top picks I thought I'd share them with you. The most important thing of a smart home is seriously the Wi-Fi backbone because if we don't have good Wi-Fi none of the smart home stuff is gonna work well and the one I went with was the EERO mesh Wi-Fi. It comes with one EERO hub which connects to your modem and a Couple of beacons which you place around the house now good Wi-Fi is super important because if you have devices that drop connection once in A while your smart home experience is going to be so much worse, I highly recommend getting a mesh system You can go with the router, but the thing is when you have bigger spaces with multiple floors You just want Wi-Fi that blankets everything with strong solid connections, so I highly recommend a mesh system I've used a lot of mesh Wi-Fi systems the one from Google, ASUS, D-Link, but my personal favorite is seriously the ERRO There's the reason why this thing has four and a half stars on Amazon It's just super simple to set up really great software And this is the other bonus these devices at least the second-generation one Doesn't have a power cable that needs to connect to this thing, it plugs up right into the wall And it even has a nightlight feature that you can control within the app Okay, next up is the outdoor smart cam from Nest And I've actually purchased quite a few smart cams from Nest over the years. Their hardware is always good, very well Built and reliable I still use one of the original dropcam's from 2010 And it still works perfectly This one here is meant for outdoor use so it's waterproof and includes all the hardware that you would need to kind of install it Wherever you want it to be and it makes a great gift for someone who wants to keep an eye on things when they're not At home and because it has a mic you can interact with the people that appear on the camera so if a delivery man shows Up and you want to tell him something you can through the mic Okay, so the next gift idea is a little bit bigger, but it's actually one of my favorite pieces of tech I have right now. It's an air purifier it's called the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool Link and it can be a fan to cool you down or a Heater when you want it to be and the whole time It's an air purifier. That uses a HEPA filter It has remote so you can adjust things like air speed the angle of the air the oscillation and things like that but there's also an app which gives you control of all of this and Within the app you can see the current air quality of the room It's a really advanced air purifier, but it's a great gift for some who wants better air circulation or better air quality Okay, next we have the Philips hue white and color ambience starter kit now This is a kit that comes with four bulbs and one hub and of all the smart lights I've used This is the thing that's most connected basically any big-name home automation service can connect to this thing The lights are your standard bulb shapes that will fit into your standard sockets, and it has great software you can use it to change the ambient colors of rooms and stuff or you can use the app to turn your lights on and off remotely for a little bit of home security And because this thing has such a good integration with so many home automation Services if you want to you could technically make all of the lights in your house Operated by voice, which is really cool. Okay. I've linked all of these items below if you're interested in purchasing them Hope you enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it See you guys next time",

    "transcript": "- So I'm in Cupertino, which is where the headquarters of Apple is located, and here, they have the Apple Visitor Center, which is one of the coolest Apple Stores ever. They've got all kinds of cool stuff, and they even have some exclusive merch, so let's go in, check it out. I love the new Pride Apple Watch setup. (upbeat music) Also have a really cool augmented reality experience, so this is a replica of Apple Park, and they hand you an iPad, and then you get a chance to actually see inside, you can also adjust the time, so you can see what it looks like from morning until night. Now, it's time to go upstairs. (upbeat music) There it is, Apple Park right across the street. Now, we're cutting through the roof here, we're gonna go back down on this side, and that's gonna take us to the cafe. Snacks, drinks, snacks, snacks. This is the cutest thing I've ever seen. They just made me a little latte that has my name on it. This is peak latte art right here. (upbeat music)",

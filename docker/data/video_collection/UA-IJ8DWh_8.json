    "transcript": "- In this video, I'm gonna show you how to work out if a wifi adapter supports monitor and injection mode. In a previous video, which I've linked here and below, I discussed some of these wifi adapters. I'll discussed some of the chip sets in the wifi adapters, I discussed the wifi adapters that I personally would recommend and use. In this video, however, I'm gonna show you the difference between this wifi adapter and this wifi adapter and let's determine whether they both support monitor and injection mode. I'll also show you the chipset used in these wifi adapters. So I'm gonna demonstrate the commands that you would use to see the chip set in a wifi adapter, such as this or this, and then whether they support monitor mode and injection mode, which is required if you wanna hack wifi networks. Now, before we get started, please consider subscribing to my YouTube channel. Please like this video, and click on the bell to get notifications that really does help me. Let's hack the YouTube algorithm ethically of course, please don't use any of the information that I'm sharing here for non ethical reasons. (upbeat music) Okay, so let's start with the Alpha adapter. I'll plug this in and I'm gonna connect it to my Mac. I'm running Kali Linux or Kali Linux if you prefer within a virtual machine on my Mac. So as soon as I plug that in, I'm asked to whether I wanna connect that to Kali or to the Mac. I'm gonna connect to that to Kali. So in Kali Linux, I'm gonna open up a terminal. IWconfig shows me Wlan0. So the Kali Linux virtual machine has picked up this wifi adapter, you can see the light is on. So this is now working. However, the mode is managed mode at the moment. First thing I'm gonna do, is lsusb. That allows me to see how this wifi adapter is connected. We can see as an example that an Atheros or Atheros chip set is being used by this wifi adapter. You can see the chip set information right there, you can see what wifi networks it supports, but what I'm gonna do is show you another command that gives you more information about the wifi adapter. We are gonna look at a specific device. The USB that we're gonna look at in this example, is two, three. So I'm gonna change that to zero zero three, press enter. And that allows me to look at the details of this wifi adapter. So scrolling up, we can see the device ID, we can see the vendor. So this is an Alpha network adapter, but what's important is the chip set within this adapter. And we can see once again, that it's an Atheros or Atheros AR9271 adapter it supports 802.11n. We can information such as the manufacturer product ID and serial number of the adopter. Okay, so that's interesting, but let's see if it supports monitor and injection mode. So first thing I'm gonna do is use airmon-ng to kill any conflict in processes. So this process was killed. What I'm gonna do now is start monitor mode, but before I do that actually, notice iwconfig mode is managed at the moment, but what I'm gonna do is change the mode to monitor mode. So you can see that monitor mode has now been enabled. I'll clear the screen here. We could see that and confirm that by using iwconfig, notice mode is now monitor mode, notice the name has changed. Previously we had wlan0, now we have wlan0mon. You could also use airmon-ng to verify that, notice interface name has changed. And here is where it becomes important. So let's test injection mode by using sudo aireplay-ng test wlan0mon, make sure that you use the right interface. And as you can see, injection is working. It's detected six access points, and it's trying to do a directed probe to those access points. This is an access point here, actually this wifi router right behind me. As always, don't hack any network that you don't have permission to attack, or that you own. Do things ethically, but there you go. I've now proven that this wifi adapter supports monitor mode and injection mode. Let's try it with this TP-Link wifi adapter. So again, I'll plug that in, I'm gonna connect to that to Linux. I'll clear the screen here, iwconfig. You can see the interface name is wlan0, mode is auto in this example, this is the nickname of the wifi adapter. So let's use the command lsusb to see details of the wifi adapter. You can see it's a TP-Link wifi adapter, TL-WN722N v2/v3. That's a problem because it doesn't support packet injection and monitor mode, which I'll demonstrate right now. Notice that is the chip set on this wifi adapter. So lsusb, let's look at the device in this example, it's two, four. So I'll look at the details of that. We can see again, device ID is this, vendor is TP-Link, that is the wifi adapter. This is the chip set used, it's a Realtek chip set 802.11N, it's supported. Okay, so here is the true test. At the moment we've got wlan0, mode is auto, I'll kill any conflicting processes. I'll start monitor mode on this wifi adapter. So iwconfig, notice the mode is still auto. So that is a problem, and all use airmon-ng to try and verify that. So I'll type sudoairmon-ng. Notice we're not getting a monitor interface, it's still wlan0. So let's test injection which will probably fail, and notice failed. Okay, let's use the right interface number should be wlan0, not wlan0mon, notice operation not permitted. Error setting monitor mode on wlan0. So I'm not able to do it. I can Use the script like wifi to try and verify this, notice cannot find any interfaces in monitor mode, script breaks, it doesn't work. So there's an example of a network adapter breaking or not allowing us to hack. Let's use this Alpha network adapter, this one supports both 2.4 as well as 5 GHz all connect it to Linux. lsusb will show me details about it, notice what it supports a/b/g/n/ac. We can see the chip set within the adapter, lsusb. Let's look at details. Two, five. Scrolling up, even though this is an Alpha network adapter, the device ID is showing up as a Realtek, showing us details of the chip set to used as well as the wifi network supported. So let's test this, and I can simply test this by using wifite. Wifite will put the wifi adapter into monitor mode so that it got enabled, and then it will show me various wifi networks. So that's a simple way to test things. So I'll stop that, but if you really want to test it you could do the commands manually. So, type sudo airmon-ng kill check to kill any conflicting processes. I'll put it into monitor mode, monitor mode already enabled, so that's good. And let's test packet injection. And in this example, rather than using wlan0mon, it's just wlan0, and we can see that injection is working. Seven access points have been discovered, and now it's sending probes to the various networks.

With large screens, glossy back panels, and IP68 ratings, they look and feel every bit like flagship phones.

    "transcript": "- I just touched the new Google Pixel phones. We've gotta look at the Pixel 7 and the Pixel 7 Pro. And there's a lot that's the same as last year. A couple of differences. But one thing that hasn't changed is the price. The Pixel 7 is priced at 599. And it's got a slightly smaller screen. It's a 6.3 inch versus a 6.4 inch. But it's still a 90 hertz display. And there's a couple of improvements. There's a upgraded selfie camera, so it's got the same selfie camera as the Pro and the 6 Pro, and then a cool two times crop. More on that in a second. But the price is the same. Same 90 hertz refresh rate display. So the Pixel 7 Pro is a little bit of the same story. It's a 6.7 inch screen again, 120 hertz display. It's gonna cost 899. And like the Pixel 7, it looks and feels a whole lot like the generation before it. It feels solid. They're both IP68-rated phones. They feel like flagship devices. So there's a little bit of a design change this year. The camera bar on the back isn't a contrasty black anymore. It's more of a sleek aluminum sort of finish that like blends in a little more seamlessly to the rest of the device. But otherwise, holding it, using it a little bit, it feels a lot the same. So the thing we can't see from the outside is Tensor G2 which is the new Tensor chip inside of both of these phones. And it's powering things like some improvements to voice recorder, some call quality improvements, a lot of AI sort of voice and assistant related items. But there's a few upgrades to the camera, too, that Tensor is responsible for. We've got cinematic blur mode which is the BOCA kind of depth effect in video. That's available now. We've got the new two times crop mode. And on the Pixel 7 Pro, it'll actually do a 10 times crop mode on the telephoto camera. That is a lot of zoom. I'm a little skeptical, but gonna reserve judgment until I've used it a little more. But that's the story. It's little enhancements here and there. There aren't any huge hardware shifts. There's not a big design change. It's a lot the same, but maybe a little better. So that's cool. We don't have to wait too long to find out just how much better or how much the same. They're up for pre-order today. And they're going to go on sale next week. So get ready. Here they come. So I'm all about the colors. I'm a little disappointed this year. We've got lemongrass. We do have lemongrass. But there's no coral, there's no sea foam. I don't know, it's kind of a bummer. You know, keep it tuned here. We'll try all the colors.",

    "transcript": "- [Ken] Sponsored by Artlist. So iOS 15 is finally here to the public and we're going to try it for the first time. I've never used it before. It's going to be a raw, unscripted test drive. And I hear that apple finally added a feature that I think Android has had for a while and I've been wanting this feature for a long freaking time. So I can't wait to try it out and you're coming with me. Let's go. (upbeat music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken and we're installing iOS 15 on this iPhone 12 Pro today, and there's a lot of new features, and honestly, I'm not going to cover them all. This is just an unscripted test drive. I'm going to cover a few things that I think are cool and important to me. If you can get the update right now, it's out. It's free, of course, and Apple did a good job with compatibility this year. So without further ado, let's hop into settings and get this installation sensation on its way. And here we are at the upgrade screen, we're going to download and install. Oh, hey, you can't look at this part. And there we are. So now we have to read every word of this, but I'm a speed reader. So one thing I like to do during these installation sensations is I like to set one of my own custom wallpapers that I made. This is one of my Patreon wallpapers. I do have some free ones on my Flickr gallery too. I think they're really cool. They just give everything a personal touch. So we're going to put that on there and there we go. That looks nice. Now we're all primed and prepped and ready for the upgrade, which has about three minutes remaining for the download but then it's going to start installing and take longer. But hey, we're all along on the ride together. So it should be fun. It's like a road trip except you don't go anywhere. You know, I noticed something weird here. Look at the scroll bar. It's just kind of like, it's like, is it like telling me to scroll maybe? It just kind of keeps coming in and out. I don't know if it's a glitch or a feature, so let's scroll a little bit and see if it, oh yeah. Nope. That's just a very needy scroll bar. It just does not want to go away. 27 seconds remaining. Zero seconds remaining. The longest zero seconds in the world. But then the preparation part is probably going to take like 10 minutes or so. Yeah, preparing update. This is the part that takes, like, forever. Preparations are complete. Now we install. Verifying updates. So normally I wait for a couple of dot updates before I install a new iOS version. But this particular update has just been really captivating to me, especially with those focus features. And in those focus features is a feature, I think, that has been on Android for awhile, regarding Do Not Disturb, and I'll demo that in a sec. Oh, we have a little, I just noticed we have a little spinning thing that's just stuck, but we'll just give it some time. It'll get there. There we go. Now we have the Apple with the progress bar. So while that's installing, I just wanted to address something quickly. This came up at Vintage Computer Festival Midwest. I was actually sharing a panel with the AP guy and Clint from LGR, and the conversation led to music in videos and people were asking me where I get the music from and I actually use Artlist, and it's really cool because you get all this cool music but you don't have to deal with copyright strikes or the content ID system. It's really fricking neat. So that's why I love partnering with Artlist because I use their music all the time. Artlist lets you search for songs by genre or mood and you can download an unlimited number of songs with your subscription, and best of all, your music license never expires. In addition, Artlist also has a sound effects library and stock footage via Artgrid. So go ahead and give Artlist a try. I'm sure you'll love it. And if you want a few extra months added into your Artlist subscription, feel free to use my link. It's in the description. And when you use that link, you'll also be supporting the Computer Clan so thank you very much. All right. Let's check in on the installation. Right when I was about to update you guys, the progress part jumped to the end. We just barely saw that there, but there's probably going to be another progress bar, but it just like sprung to the end there. Let's see what it does now. And there's progress bar number two. And hello, we have the setup assistance and that's really cool looking. Passcode, you can't look at this. And there we go. Your iPhone has been updated to iOS 15. Sweet. Continue. And let's see what's next. iPhone Analytics, we're going to not share that. I do that during the beta stuff, but not now. So we'll swipe up and there we go. As you can see, oh yes I have Do Not Disturb on. It looks like the notification shape of that changed a little bit. The maps app has a tweaked icon and so does weather. Weather looks a little bit different. So now comes the time where we just test drive. So the new weather icon has my attention so I'm going to tap on there. And I heard there were some new animations so I want to check those out. Like when it rains, the water droplets will actually bounce off the interface. And speaking of rain, this is another thing I heard of, where it will tell you when rain is going to happen and it will actually push a notification to your phone when rain is about to start. I think that's a nice new feature. So as you can see, Hell's looking pretty good. High of 75 today. So we also have these maps. So this looks like some sort of heat map or something. But if I go to see more, let's see what we can do. Yep. So this is temperature. Wow. There's a lot of stuff in here. I'm guessing we can turn on different layers, air quality, precipitation, temperature. There we go. So, oh crap. That's really cool. So now I know when Hell, Michigan is going to get some rain. Well, can I scrub this? Oh wow. That's that's like really responsive. That's really sweet. Oh, I can just do this all day. So now let's take a look at Safari. There's been some controversy behind the redesign. Let's see how bad it really is. So in here, it looks like we now have an edit button and the toolbar is on the bottom. This has been getting some hate during the beta days, but I heard Apple was doing a lot of tweaking, and I believe you can also do tab groups. So what I did was I made one here just called demo, but you can have other tabs and other groups. You can make a new empty tab group. So I'm just going to do that for now. And then we can open up as many tabs as we want. Also a newer thing on iOS which they've had on the Mac for a while, is you can, well, nope, not there, is you can customize the start page. So yes, you can turn on certain things and all that, but you can put a background in there as well, which I think is pretty cool. And I just have this all turned off. I just have my favorite showing. Okay. So let's go somewhere. Let's go to the interwebs. thecomputerclan.com. There's our mobile responsive website. It's a very simple website, but yeah. So, okay, so that doesn't look too bad. Let's go to a new tab here. Let's go to MacRumors. So now if I understand the interface correctly, you can just swipe on the tabs to go back and forth between them. I think that's pretty cool. And now that all the buttons are at the bottom, that's better for one handed use 'cause your thumb is usually more comfortable sitting near the bottom of the screen. So actually, I don't know. I know some people were complaining about this, but I think it's actually pretty good. I know they did some tweaks earlier, the refresh button was hidden and stuff like that, but now it's visible, but I think you can just pull to refresh. Yeah. I'm digging that. I'm digging this more one-hand-friendly Safari. So a little tip I learned was that, you know, this part isn't new where you can hold on the tab button to close all the tabs, but now you have a new option for moving the tabs. So if you want to move them to another group, you can do that as well. And you can summon private browsing mode from here as well for important things like your retirement account login for your 401(k). Right? Okay. So I was taking a quick break and something interesting just happened. I got a notification pop up from my security camera even though I'm in Do Not Disturb mode. So I set that up on my iPad to let those notifications come through, but I never set that up on my iPhone to let those notifications come through, but it looks like it synced. So let's go ahead and check those settings. And this is the feature that I believe Android has had for quite a while that I really wish Apple had. Ever since they introduced Do Not Disturb mode, I really wish they would have put this in here. And okay. So it looks like we have the new, like these focus settings here, but in Do Not Disturb, Yep, there it is. It added my security system to that list. So that means if I'm sleeping and Do Not Disturb mode is on, it'll mute everything, which is usually good 'cause I don't want to be woken up. But if there's someone at the door doing something stupid at three in the morning, even though I'm 10 storeys on the ground, it's hard to get here, I want the alert to tell me, \"Hey, there's somebody there.\" So a big update I heard about is the photos app. And that's really personal to me because, well, I take a lot of photos and I love looking at pictures. So let's take a look. This is from Vintage Computer Festival Midwest. It was a lot of fun. So I believe now you can see more camera metadata. So this was shot on a Canon EOS 7D Mark II. So if I go to the info button, that is really sweet. Look at that. So now instead of just getting like location stuff or a caption, you can actually get the information right from the camera, the resolution, like the frame resolution, file size, ISO, the f-stop, the exposure time, the file type. All of that stuff is really sweet. Oh crap. I just realized you can adjust the date and time on here. Oh dude, I've been wanting that for so long. You can do it on the Mac photos app, but now it's really cool that you can do it in iOS. I just realized that. Yes, that was shot on 9-11. LiveText, from what I understand, should be able to select text in a photo, even though this is not vector text, it's not a font, it should still be able to select it. So let's go ahead and try selecting Apple. Maybe I got to close the panel. Let's try selecting, we'll try computer. Oh, that's pretty cool. So let's see. If I hit look up. Let's see. Yeah. Continue. Yeah. Computer. Oh my gosh. That is pretty sweet. So let's see if it can do, oh gosh, you got Palo Alto right there. Yeah. It can get some really small details. 6,800? Let's see. I'm kind of on an angle so it's weird. No, it figured it out. It knew to select 6,800 only. It looks like it got the whole thing there. That is really cool. Let's try another picture. Let's swipe out of here. This was a photo Steve shot of me. I normally don't like flip peace signs, but hey peace. Anyway, this was my booth at the festival. I just want to see ,like, just for fun, if it can select Computer Clan or at least just computer, like, in the background here. Yeah, that is pretty sweet. And I should be able to just move the little handle there and select it all. And it looks like we got a magnifying glass there. Did you see that? Oh, that is really cool. So you can see more easily what texts are highlighting because they used to have that magnifying glass in iOS, but they got rid of it years ago. I'm trying to de-select here. It's a little finicky with the selection. They may have to work on that a little bit. Like I have no way to like just de-select the text. Come on. Come on. Work with me. Let's try this Deathstar iPhone prototype. So if I zoom in here, select prototype. It's on an angle. That might be a challenge. Nope. It got it though. You tap look up, it got the word prototype. Pretty sweet feature. So another tip I picked up on is you can now drag and drop and use the multi-tasker simultaneously. So normally you could already just do that to switch between applications, but now you can drag and drop. So this might be weird on an angle with two hands, but I'm going to try tapping and hold to drag something out and then I'm going to switch over and then drop it right into notes. And then there we go. We got a picture in there. So we'll do it uno mas, one more time just to make sure it's working. Let's grab another photo. Let's do that Apple-1 picture. So now we have it here in our drag and we drop it, or we drag and drop as the one Microsoft guy said that one time on stage. So yeah. - [Microsoft Guy] Drog and drap. - [Ken] That's just a little tip. If you want to use it, go for it. Oh, hey, look at that. We were just talking about this earlier. It proves that even though Do Not Disturb is on, my specific applications can still come through with the new bypass feature. Oh, (bleep) So there we are, iOS 15 on an iPhone 12 Pro, and I know I did not cover everything so feel free to let me know what your own favorite features are and feel free to let me know what you want to see in iOS 16 because that's going to be popping up before we know it, and feel free to subscribe for more tech episodes coming out all the time.

    "transcript": "i cannot imagine that this case is still in one piece considering that it was apparently shipped by brutalization but while you place your bets it's time for a word from today's video sponsor today's video is sponsored by be quiet and their pure loop aios now it goes without saying that the pure lube aios are easy to mount come in a variety of sizes and with its unique pump design is surprisingly quiet for an aio but what i like most about these aios is their minimalist aesthetic i think they look real sexy with that brushed metal faceplate and that diffused white led and considering that you don't have to pay ridiculous rgb tax on these they are surprisingly affordable and they have a fill port on an aio which i think is really cool so if you like the look of these check out the pure loop aios using the link in my description below and thank you again be quiet for sponsoring today's video it seems like aliexpress has added water damage to the repertoire of shipping risks which i think is a nice new touch i'm just glad they put this fragile sticker on there otherwise who knows what would have happened it seems like during the impact the two boxes kind of fused i'm not really sure how i'm gonna unbox this oh it sounds so broken look at that what okay that's all very weird i can't tell if it's fine or not now i assume these are the side panels this one is tempered glass and in this one is acrylic and then these seem like tiki themed rgb acrylic pieces that i guess you attach in various places on the case and they're they're all wired so it means that these light up which is really exciting so not only does this case look insane but it's clearly been shown out of depleted uranium because it somehow survived the massacre of shipping the only real damage seems to be that this one side panel mount is bent in a bit but we should be able to fix that in conor reminds me of the kind of chopper that they would build in uh orange county choppers it looks like a tiki head motorcycle there's its mouth over there with it with a fan in it although i guess technically a mouth should make for pretty good ventilation come to think of it but actually on the note of fans this case has a grand total of 7 rgb fans included all of which are molex powered which as we all know is a sign of premium quality fans and once we stick on these rgb acrylic pieces we're gonna get some crazy performance from this system and actually i'm sure this sweet republic of gamers branding is worth at least an additional 10 fps on top of that and all of these acrylic pieces plug in using these little connectors to a supplied rgb hub that you guessed it is powered by molex so no rgb control for you which should be interesting but with that let's build a pc in this soccer first things first we have to kind of i think we're good good as new now having a look at the inside of this thing uh i'm not entirely sure how i'm gonna cool the cpu in here because there are a lot of fan mounts all over the place but none of them really seem conducive to radiator mounting i mean maybe a 120 mil will work in the back but if we put a 240 in the front i think the tubing is going to struggle to get around the graphics card and yeah i'm not sure i think maybe a small air cooler may actually be our best bet but even that could be a problem because the case is quite shallow but before we try and figure that out let me see if the m80x motherboard that i have in mind for this case will actually fit in here now considering that the case is republic of gamers i thought we just had to go with a rogue motherboard so i'm using this z690 m80x strix board that microcenter sent over a while ago for some videos oh that is such a good looking m80x board oh there's a very oddly shaped case but despite that it does actually fit very well okay so let me take that out and prepare it for the installation so now that we have the awesome looking motherboard in here it's time to see what kind of cooler clearance options we have for this 12600k let's see if this new deepcool ak-47 cooler fits on there yes it does okay we're using that the cpu still has the stock cooler ring of shame which you just it's real difficult to clean off there in terms of power supply i'm going to use this little rm550x that i hope is going to fit in this weird case like that okay that actually fits this is a really dumb mount because you kind of have to hold it that is an interesting screwdriver angle to have to use this is a dumb case okay there we go now more often than not ease of cable management in cases like these is less an afterthought and more something that's just completely ignored so i don't think i'm going to be able to make it look very good but i am a professional so who knows maybe it'll go very well oh i needed molex ah i forgot i'm gonna have to take the power supply out again okay there we go lots of molex this is easily the most majestic molex chain i have ever seen in my life i think let's see if we can go find more molex crap to plug into it now i think the most important rgb to fit in here is the eyes so let's start off with that it's a bit of a squeeze but it does actually fit in there look at that why does this process feel harder than the other one oh wow that feels like you're breaking summon oh nice this is already starting to look spectacular i don't know where these eyes go are they like truck nut eyes like do they go on the back of the case oh oh it goes here this looks like a gpu mount so i think this kind of goes like that little truck nut plate unfortunately it seems like we needed to mount it before we put the power supply in and i absolutely refused to pull that out again so i'm just gonna use some double-sided tape to stick it on and hope that it's fine i mean if they didn't want me to use double-sided tape they wouldn't have given me so much of it and then the last one we need to mount is the big wing that goes on the on the front yes this is starting to come along nicely now for the graphics card we unfortunately don't have a whole bunch of clearance so i am going to use this power color rx 6600 hellhound because it'll fit and it has a little bit of lighting i may have screwed up not putting the gpu in first if i'm honest the graphics card's not liking that angle very much but it's okay it's nothing a bit of brute force won't fix all we have left to do is get the side panel on here which i i hope it's got a lot of clearance i have just made a terrible realization these are the mounts for the rear side panel now on the front of the case they come pre-installed but on the back they don't and well they need to be screwed down from the inside of the case which means we're gonna have some real struggles on our hands considering that we've already built the entire system now the first one should be relatively easy to get on because we have a clearer shot of it okay so that's the first one on with relatively little hitch let's try number two so what i'm gonna do for these is whip out the ifixit bend screwy matron and hope that it helps never mind that doesn't work there we go that's number two on but now comes the true struggle getting through the pit of doom to mount the last standoff ah i dropped the screw oh no i can't see what i'm doing so i've shifted cables around i can see the hole now oh ah this screw dropped out so it's slightly threaded now so it means that at least the screw is holding in place okay whatever i'm i'm done it's it's on there enough it's kind of loose but at least it's it's it's on there and the fact that we've got the other three properly seated i'm hoping is good enough because well it's kind of got to be good enough because i'm i've just lost interest that's that's that's as much as i'm gonna do it goes on like that it doesn't cover like most of the cable mess it just looks like there's a bunch of the panel missing but i don't know i guess we can just say that it looks mechanical and raw like there's a brain behind the face i don't know that's just a quick note here unless you have the hands of a three-year-old you're not going to be able to plug the power supply in which is all the way down there with this bracket on so we're gonna have to remove it again i don't think i've ever been this excited to turn a pc on uh so i i guess we just go for it right i don't know if it's gonna work now battlefield 5 at 1080p high settings has been running for a while now and those temperatures are very good on both the cpu and the gpu so this case may be absolutely crazy looking but because there's more air gap than panel the temperatures are actually very good and considering the panel gaps it's surprisingly quiet which neatly brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video consider subscribing to the channel and maybe watching another video a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video thanks for watching bye you",

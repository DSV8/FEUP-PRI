    "transcript": "- Is this a bad idea? - Yes. Yeah. I'm never gonna be able to show my face again. - You didn't have to do this! - I do it for the art! (beep) - Hello and welcome to This Is, TikTok made me buy it. - TikTok did not make you buy this. - There you go. - Okay. Look, TikTok did not make anyone buy this. - No. - You bought this of your own free will. - So if you remember the Buttress Pillow from our Instagram video, which may or may not have already gone live yet, I don't know what the order we're doing these. Mm. Hitting me with a butt. The thing that I lamented the most about buying the Buttress is I wasn't a fan of the leggings we got. - So that was your mistake? That was your problem? - I got a change of leggings. Unlike a lot of our other videos that we do here, this theoretically is not about getting scammed. This is about things that people have found on TikTok that are actually amazing. - Matt, are you about to put these on? - About to? Boy! - Oh my God (laughs) - I already got 'em. Mm, look at that rump roast. These leggings are sure to make anyone's ass just kind of, mm. - Are these for me? (laughs) - They sent us two pairs. - I'll be back. I'll be back. - (laughs) He's gonna do it. We don't even need the butt pillow. Now, as Austin goes and puts these on, I gotta tell you these are really comfortable. (laughs) It's like I'm wearing nothing at all. (beep) (laughs) Those are so big on you. So these have- - A little big. (laughs) I'm gonna need you a turnaround. These have an attractive stitch right down the crack (Austin laughs) that just is really supposed to make anyone's butt just really pop. - It's like I'm wearing nothing at all. This such a weird feeling, Matt. - What are you thinking? - Who's got the better? - This took a turn. - We just lost every subscriber. How much do you think these cost though? Let me actually preface something that's gonna shock and hopefully give me a promotion. - (chuckles) Good luck with that. - Alright. This might be the cheapest episode of buying something that we have ever done. - Wow. - Like, - It only cost our dignity. - (chuckles) Well. - Did you lose your dignity in a 1994 Ford Focus? (car whooshes and honks) - (Matt) These were $10. (cash register chimes) - Wait, all I can say is leggings are truly magical if Matt and I can wear the exact same size and it fits both of us. - I know after seeing me, you're a little thirsty - As I usually am. - So we've taken care of that. - Okay, good. - But go ahead and open that up. (bell dings) - (Matt) Oh, there it is. - Smell's new enough. - It's been quite hot here in California and there's only one remedy for that. Some cold milk. - There's like goo or like gunk on this. - So we just stick that in there. The worst part about having stuff is having to use your hands to - Yeah, I hate using my hands. What's the point of this again? - So, - So you can- - It's a dispenser. So you press the (blows raspberries) Ready, I need you to put a cup there cause I'm gonna, but listen to this. That works. That works really well. Oh, I'm joking. - (laughs) As it falls, it falls apart. - This is meant for like, if you have a kid, everyone quiet. Aaron, shush. - It spills everywhere. - (laughs) It does. - Just terrible design. - Oh, no. - I don't care if this was free 99, this is not it. It's a bad design. It's floppy and it spills. Every time you try to pour your milk you're gonna put a quarter of it on your table. - How much was this Kenzie? - (Kenzie) $9. (cash register chimes) - So we can get rid of those for a second. We can just put those over towards you. Austin, you have a child. - I do. - What's the hardest part about having a child? - Uh. - Whatever. I don't care what you're gonna say. (Austin laughs) So it's, they make a mess everywhere. - Well, it's like top seven. - So, we have- - (Austin) the Gyro Bowl 360 degree rotation, spill resistant gyroscopic bowl with a lid. - So this claims to be an unspillable bowl. (plastic ripping) - Very well packaged. - Does this look a little sus to anyone else? So basically it's a couple of little plastic bowls essentially on the inside, but then the whole thing is gyroscopic. So it's never gonna go anywhere but on the right side up. - But so I've seen videos where even children have a tendency just to hold food, like hold plates and what, vertically. - Oh, that's cool. - That spun all the way around. Wait, wait, - So let's- - What if I do it upside down? Oh my God. You're right. It literally does stay up no matter where. - Let's actually test this out. - Okay. Unnecessary. Alright. So I've got Cheetos. I will show you they're real for photo evidence. (Cheeto crunches) Uh huh. Oh, yeah look at that. - We finally have a bowl that would prevent Austin Evans from spilling stuff. How much did we spend for the bowl? - (Kenzie) That is $10. (cash register chimes) - Totally reasonable. - If you have a child or if you have a man-child who shops at Uncrate, I recommend you get this. Now, alright, we didn't finish, we didn't quite finish all of our Cheetos in here. We don't want these to go bad. We wanna save these for later. - We do? - So here we have the two in one bag sealer. - Is this a sample bag to try? - (Matt) Maybe. (sniffs) - I mean, it's heating up. It would make sense. It's gonna make some smell. - First off, it's got a little switch blade. - (Austin) Okay. - Good blade. Good blade. So, alright. I am a good friend. - Yes. - I wanna send my good friend, Austin, to school with a good snack. So now what we'll do, - Mm-hmm. (upbeat music) - This is very riveting content. I'm sealed to the edge of my seat. That's really neat. How much was this bag cutter and sealer? - (Kenzie) $12. (cash register chimes) Alright, let me try again. - Okay. - Om nom nom nom nom. Now let me try doing it for real now. So like this? I got this, I got this. (bag crinkles) (chuckles) This is hard. - It's really not. - Oh, there we go. (bag crinkles) I did it! Nice and sealed. Okay, okay, okay. Two thumbs up. Good job, TikTok cutter-sealer-thingy-mabob. Okay, yeah. - Alright. - So- - Can we please clean up the table yet or no? - No. - Okay. - Kenzie. - (Kenzie) Yeah? - Can we get the other stuff? I'll help you out. - (Kenzie) Okay. - Now I can exercise. - Now that everyone else is gone, I'd like to ask you very kindly to subscribe and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button. Not just because I am wasting time while they get the next item, but also because I dearly appreciate you, Joseph, and I think that your subscription would make a real difference. This Is is entirely funded by your eyeballs and your fingertips. And your support is very much appreciated. Thank you. - Alright. So again, you worked up a thirst. - Thirsty. Baja Blast me, bro. - If you remember from our Instagram ad video from a while back, we tested out a Lisa Frank travel blender. Well, we have found an even cheaper one. - Why is there Mountain Dew going into a blender? That you don't, it's already done. They did it in the factory. - Oh, but I want a Baja Blast freeze. I dropped something. Oh, I dropped more things. (laughs) - Oh, oh that smells delicious. - Oh no. - Stop making a mess. - I got more on, oh man. Alright, ready? - Yep. - 3, 2, 1. - Well that was anti-climactic. Is the light blinking because it's outta battery? - Like actually? (Austin and Kenzie laugh) - We're gonna set this aside and let it charge for a little bit. - I got Baja Blast all over my hand now. - So unfortunately, we still want Baja Blast. - We do. - But we have another, I should have grabbed it here. - This is a disaster. This is the disaster episode of This Is. - So here we have the most sus Frozen Magic Cup. - Oh, good lord. I don't like that one bit. - Here, we can, here. So what you do is you put your favorite drink in there - And it just stays cold because the cup is frozen. - We'll close that down. - Okay. - So it's supposed to freeze your drink and then you squeeze it. While we have the other thing charging, we're gonna let that kind of work it's Frozen Magic, is what it's actually called. - Can we please clean the table? - Do you really wanna clean the table? - This is disturbing me. Look at how disgusting. - Do you really wanna clean the table? - Yeah. - Well, we're never gonna get these Cheeto stains out of here. So what we have, is The Pink Stuff. This is not to be confused with the Pink Sauce, which a lot of people have confused, because this claims to be vegan. Come on, couple pumps. Come on. If that's not working, if that's not your speed we also have The Pink Stuff paste - (sniffs) That does smell like The Pink Stuff. What's cleaning paste? What do you need cleaning paste for? - This just looks awful. It's so dense and like, (sniffs) Oh. No, you've just ruined, no. Actually this might be cleaning it. I don't know. - (laughs) I think it's actually working. Didn't clean my hand. Wait, wait. (laughs) I'm gonna use The Pink Stuff to wipe the other Pink Stuff off my hand. Look, my hand is clean. (laughs) - We're running out of paper towels to clean this up. Good thing we have our next product. - Is that a giant roll toilet of paper? - (Matt) This is- - (Austin) Are you about to clean your butt? - (Matt) The Charmin Forever Roll. As you so appropriately have figured out, it's just a giant roll of Charmin toilet paper. So roughly one night's use of Taco Bell eating. - I can't say I saw this one coming. Let me just determine its softness. Oh, it's very soft. (Kenzie laughs) What happens if you show up to someone's house and they've got this in their bathroom? I have a lot of questions. Mostly, \"are you okay?\" (laughs) - What do you think we paid for this? This roll of toilet paper? $30. - (Matt) $28. (cash register chimes) (plastic crinkles) I know you're feeling a little down that we haven't had too much tech. - Yeah, because there's been none. - I'll get you some tech. - (Austin) Thank you. - But first we gotta set the mood. - Whoa. - We're gettin' here. - Whoa, it got dark very quickly. - You know what you need? - I don't know, what do I need? - A safe house. - I need a safe word. - Well- - This is Back 4 Blood? - Yeah, we had these leftover from when Back 4 Blood came out. (Austin blows air out) But you know what the worst part about having candles? Cause I get big candles, and as you use them more, they go down and down and down. - True. - And sometimes it's hard to get your hand in the jar to actually light- - Sure. - The candle. That is a thing of the past. - Thank you. - Thanks to: (box thuds) - (Austin) Candle Lighter. Safety, windproof, rechargeable. - So I own this personally. You can go to my bathroom and on the back of my toilet is this product right now. - I will check it out later. - This is one of the flameless lighters, they use the little plasma coils. (lighter sizzles) No, we have a candle! - Whoa, look at least burn marks. - (Matt) Wait, okay- - I can write my name. - Goddamn arsonist over here. (fire sizzling) (sirens wailing) The real key to it, - Ah. - Is that you can get however angle you want. (chill music) How much do you think we paid for this? - (Austin) $15. - (Kenzie) $10. (cash register chimes) - Solid deal. - Solid deal. - Dear audience, you should be happy that smell-o-vision does not exist on the YouTube platform because between the Pink Sauce, the Cheetos, and the multiple scents of candles, it is quite the uh- - Smorgasbord. - This is a real olfactory experience that we're all experiencing, together. - You don't know the difference between oral and aural, - Uh huh. - But you know the word for smelling. - Yeah, I know lots of words. What's the problem? - You don't, that's the problem. (Kenzie and Matt laugh) We didn't get the candles from TikTok by the way. This was just to set the mood. - (chuckes) Okay. - Because, - What mood? For what? What's happening now? - What I love to do in the shower, is karaoke. So that's where our next product comes in. - (Austin) DELADOLA Mini Karaoke Recording Microphone. It's cute, stylish, small, and finger-size. I've got a tiny baby little microphone and a- - Uh, that looks perfectly average. In fact, I feel like some people would say that looks above average. - Alright, I'll be right back. Alright, so I am going to plug this in via a lightning to 3.5 adapter. - You can't hold it like that. You have to hold it like this. (Austin laughs) Like you have, ginger-gently. - You are now hearing what it sounds like from this little baby microphone. I am speaking very quietly and calmly but if I start raising the tenor of my voice, if I bring out my full vocal range, what you will see my friends, is that I have the most amazing microphone that has ever grazed your ears. This is neat. I wish that it wasn't peak city but other than that it's neat. How much was the little baby mic? - (Kenzie) $9. (cash register chimes) - It's getting a little hot in here. That helps a little bit. - (laughs) Okay. - But you know what's gonna help even more? The Ice Roller. Do you have a big old puffy face? - Yes. - I feel like this ad was targeted towards me. (Austin laughs) This is a calming, relaxing face massager that is- - (Austin) Ice cold. - So if we just kind of go, - Oh that's so cold. Oh God. Oh, it's like you're rubbing an ice cube on my face. - Do you feel relaxed? - No. It's cold as fuck. - You look it. You look- (Kenzie and Austin laugh) This has been very popular and it's apparently for healthier skin. So I don't know. How much did we pay for this? - (Kenzie) The ice roller was $19. - It does come in a nice Baja Blast green. - That is very Baja Blast-able. - Which reminds me, we have to check on our Baja Blasts. So these have been freezing for a little bit. This is not frozen whatsoever. (Austin and Kenzie laugh) The idea is that this is, like the liquid in it, is supposed to freeze to the side- - And you're gonna squeeze it out. - And you squeeze it out. This is not at all. I still want a Baja Blast freeze. - Is it time? - It's time. We're gonna go in 3, 2, 1. (blender whirring) It's actually quiet. This is gonna be very flat. - Yeah, not a lot of ice. - Oh it, okay. There we go. Okay. Okay. - That looks a little freezy. - Can we get a couple glasses over here? - Cheers. - Cheers. (glasses clink) - Just tastes like a Baja Blast that's flat and slightly cold. - Yeah, it kind of lost a lot of the carbonation in the- - And there was not enough ice. - Yeah. This here was $35. (cash register chimes) - Blender gets an A+, just remember to charge it. - We've consumed a lot of food here. - We have. - And I feel like your teeth are looking a little green from drinking that Baja Blast. - Yeah, check this out. - Or, I mean maybe it's cause you were licking this thing. I don't know. - I was not licking it. That's incorrect. - So, have you always wished to have a much brighter smile? - No, I'm fine actually. - Well, we have- - Oh, good lord. You're trying to tell me that you can light your smile up like as if like shining a light on your teeth makes them brighter. Because what's with all these stupid idiots thinking LEDs do something? (Matt and Kenzie laugh) - Thank you for watching and like, subscribe, follow, and let us know how better our smiles are in the comments below. - You look beautiful. - Yours are blue. (slurps) - I feel like this is a good idea. - Let us know in the comments, likes, follow, subscribe. We're gonna go and test out our leggings on the general public. You guys aren't ready for it. - I would like to disagree. (upbeat piano music)",

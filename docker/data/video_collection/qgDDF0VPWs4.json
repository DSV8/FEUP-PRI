    "transcript": "- I'm normally a guy who likes big ol' laptops, big, fat, you know, I like big notebooks, and I'm not even gonna lie about it. And so today is a little bit of a departure from that because we're taking a look at the One-Netbook One-GX 1. (chuckles) Although the 1 isn't on there. I thought it was the One-GX1, but this just says the One-GX. This is a tiny, portable netbook-type thing in the vein of netbooks, that have stopped existing largely, although we have taken a look at a lot of netbook-like devices from GPD. Linus has done that. But today, this is from One-Netbook. I think this is the first product from them that we're taking a look at. And it's geared towards gaming, I think, 'cause it's got these little controller doohickeys that basically makes it look like a Switch. So GPD has some models with controls built onto the actual product itself, but this one has like Nintendo Switch-style...(hisses) I'm trying to do the sound that they make when they go on. (Riley hisses) Let's take a look at it. Let's open it up. Do people come with knives? This is a kinda cool box. Light-reflecting. You ever seen that before, David? - [David] I absolutely have. (laughs) (Riley vocalizes angelic note) - Ooh, it's blue. Aw, god, please. Okay, thank you. Oh, I remember now. (laughing) I forgot why we're doing this thing. This was interesting to me because it looks like Alienware Area 51 back, do you see that? - [David] Yeah. - Is there more? Ah. (snickers) Instructions. Do I need instructions? Um, yeah, okay. I'll figure all that out. What's this, though? Charger. (snorts) Ooh, the USB-C cable for charging has braiding on it. That's nice. There it is. (chuckles) And a fairly sizeable wall wart, although it's for a laptop I guess, so... This thing is so cute. It's like, chunky. It's perfectly chunky. (laughs) Why do I feel good just holding it? Oh, \"Prototype,\" so don't go thinking this is like some crazy, crazy, polished thing. I won't get upset if some things are a little bit not polished all the way. What have we got here? We got some decent I/O. Oh, it looks a Micro HDMI out, two USB Type-C ports, one USB 3.0 Type-A and a headphone jack, thank you. And a SIM card slot. +TF? Is that flash storage as well? - [Andy] TF is microSD. - MicroSD, right. So you can expand you internal storage as well. Okay, let's open it up. (chuckles) It's so tiny that it can't handle... Okay. Could I type on this thing? I'm actually surprised at how naturally my fingers rest on the home row with a keyboard this small. And wow! They even managed to include a function row and extra... Like a two-row-thick function row. Feel like Apple really has no excuse for not including function keys on the iPad Magic Keyboard. \"There just wasn't room!\" Look at this! There's always room. All right, before we get into Windows and start to actually playing around with this thing, I gotta tell you about our sponsor, Vessi's new Weekend Shoe. It's got a new style but retains all their great features. It's waterproof, sand-proof and slush-proof, it's got everyday style, so it can fit almost any occasion you're dressing for, and it's 100% vegan, so no animal byproducts have been used in this ting. Go ahead and click the link below to reserve your pair for just $5. Hey, yeah, it's got a fan, eh? You can hear that? Can I do this? (fan humming) - [Andy] Oh! - It's got this little mouse nipple thing. It's kinda like the ThinkPad nipple, but it's not soft, it's hard. (Riley chuckles) (Riley giggles) Yes, you can tap to click, but it's also got these buttons so I guess I'll just use those instead. Let's see what configuration we have here. Let's go the About Your PC. So this is the interesting thing. It's got a trackpad, but as far as I know there's no way to scroll, so I have to use this to scroll. Or arrow keys? Nope, that's not working. Okay, we got an Intel Core i5-10210Y, which I believe is a Comet Lake part, at 1 gigahertz with a boost. Well, it says 1.3 gigahertz. Maybe that's a customization that One-Netbook made. And we're using integrated graphics, so this is like, it's a gaming device, but we're using integrated graphics from a Comet Lake-Y Core i5, so it remains to be seen how well that's gonna perform. We got 16 gigs of RAM, and I believe there's 512 gigs of storage, if I remember from seeing this thing. So that's not bad. That's not bad specs. I believe it is $1,200 U.S., so that's not cheap if you wanna... But I mean, you know, you're paying for a premium to get like, basically, a mini, tiny Alienware Area 51m. Or is it? We'll have to see. We still gotta play some games. What, Andy? - [Andy] So if you press Fn, and with the thing, you can scroll. - Oh! Thanks, Andy. Function and do that, that's how you scroll. So 16 gigs of RAM. Why would you need 16 gigs of RAM in a device like this? I guess if you connect a mouse and stuff you could actually use this for real work because a Core i5, it's four cores, eight threads, so you can actually get some stuff done potentially. You know what? I just wanna hop right into the games. You can probably run \"Rocket League\". That's for sure. - [David] Yeah! - I gotta say, typing on this thing is a little better than I expected, because I expected it to be bad because it's so small, but the keys feel kinda nice. The one thing that's annoying me right now is the fact that the Shift key on the left is normal size, and due to size constraints, the Shift key over here is super, super tiny. So by instinct I wanna press that Shift key, but it's like, no, I'm pressing the arrow key and the Enter key at the same time. I can say now confidently that if I was getting, if I wanted a tiny, compact work machine it wouldn't look like this, just because this keyboard's so tiny. I mean, maybe you can get one of these and then get a separate keyboard, but that kinda defeats the purpose of having... Like, you might as well just use your phone or something. You know? I don't know. But overall, the working situation doesn't look promising with this. Hey, Steam, where'd you go? Library, okay. \"Rocket League\". I'm gonna do \"Rocket League\". \"Rocket League\", install. While I'm waiting for \"Rocket League\" to download, let's look at the controllers. So we've got some specs on the back. We've got Bluetooth 4.0, 2.4 gigahertz. It's got an independent vibrator. (wheezes) So that's good. For all those independent people who don't need other people to help them use... And it's got an ALPS Japanese rocker. (cymbals crash) (guitar strums) Rock on, dude. Ooh! Okay. Interesting. They feel really light. And wow, those buttons. I will say they're definitely more ergonomic than the Switch controllers. I can't say that the button quality is the same. (controllers rattling) (Riley wheezes) So like, Switch, you just kinda slide on from the top, but this, you have to kinda hook these little doohickeys in there. (notebook buzzes) - [Andy] What was that? - Did you hear that? - [Andy] Yeah! - Oh, man. Okay, here we go. Uh, controller, so it looks like you kinda put it up and then lock it in. All right. Oof. Hello? Oh, I think I got it. Somehow. So as I said, the controllers are ergonomic. They feel good in the hand, even if they do feel a bit cheap. I think it said that I'm not actually connected to the controllers. So I slid them on... Oh, power. So do I hold that? Add Bluetooth device. Bluetooth. Got a lotta unknown devices. Ah! What? What? I'm connected. Wait, what? So it detects it as an Xbox 360 controller. Here we go, boys. Finally. Let's play some games. I'm going to say, you know what? We're gonna challenge it and we're gonna go at 1920x1080. - [David] Oh boy. - Yep, we're gonna see if it can handle it. It has the performance numbers up already, and we are 14 FPS in the menu. Okay, we'll do 768. Fine. And now we're up to 22 in the menu, but that's still not great, and it looks horrible. We are getting 20 frames per second. Oh no. Oh no. Aw, this is not good! (laughs) This is not good! Okay, we're at 768 5x3 now. That's a native aspect ratio. Texture detail, let's put that all on Performance. I don't even know what refresh rate this display is. This is pretty bad, but it's a lot smoother now. I also think that there is latency from the controllers. Wow. I saved it. Okay. Press. It's hard for me to play this game and that should not be the case, 'cause I'm really good at it. Let's go 1024x'68, which is 4x3. Let's get rid of occlusion, let's get rid of depth of field, bloom, light shaft, lens flares, dynamic shadows, motion blur. Okay, let's see. We're basically at the lowest quality graphic settings right now. Okay, so that's a lot smoother. I'm getting 45 FPS. That's not bad at all. Can I fly? (laughs) No. Not with this latency. So maybe my gaming experience with this thing didn't blow me out of the water, but at the very least I can give them props for making a miniature version of the Alienware Area 51m. That's kinda cool, I mean, copyright potential-infringement aside. In terms of practicality, it's hard to recommend. I mean, the thing has a quad-core, eight-thread CPU, so it might be good if you really need a netbook for doing work on the go. I don't know what the market is for that. I should mention that there is a version of this with 8 gigs of RAM instead of 16 and 256 gigs of storage instead of 512 and with just Wi-Fi instead of cellular, but it's $950. In my experience using it as an actual laptop, it didn't seem to chug at all. The gaming. The gaming is an issue. \"Rocket League\" is a game that should be fairly easy to run, and we are running on integrated graphics. The bigger problem than the graphics is more the latency from the Bluetooth controllers, and I don't know whether they can fix that in the next version. One-Netbook says that there is another version coming out this fall that's gonna have Intel Tiger Lake mobile processors, because Intel is supposed to be announcing those in the next few weeks here. Or we think they are, anyways. They've announced events. So maybe by that time the next version of this will have a little bit more polish. But for now, I think it's a nice little curiosity, but I think I'm gonna stick with my Switch. And I hope you stick with ShortCircuit and watch another video, because there's lots of 'em, and we have a good time, too. Would you guys say that they should subscribe? - Yeah! - Whee! - And if you're looking for another video to watch, maybe check out the GPD Win Max on LTT, the thing similar to this that Linus reviewed, 'cause... I don't know. He seemed to like it, right? - [David] Yeah.",

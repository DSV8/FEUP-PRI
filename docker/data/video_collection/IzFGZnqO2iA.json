    "transcript": "I don't think a lot of people want to use an app where they come away feeling bad all the time. So I think how we set the culture for Threads early on in terms of being a more positive, friendly place for discussion will hopefully be one of the defining elements for, you know, the next decade as we scale it out. That's been a big part of how we've tried to emphasize and develop Threads, and you know over time, if you want it to be ubiquitous, you obviously want to be welcoming to everyone, but I think how you seed the networks, and the culture that you create there, I think ends up being pretty important for how they scale over time.",

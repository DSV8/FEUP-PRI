    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is. We have a retail version of the Xbox Series X, and Series S for later. - Where's the Series S, Matt? - We can't fit both of them on the table. (beep) - We've had a multitude of different Xbox's come through the studio. But this is the first time we have the actual retail, \"Power Your Dreams\" unit. - So it comes in this little sleeve, - Come off here. (paper rustling) - Lamar it, real quick. - So, what you get with the X-Box so we can continue the unboxing, the power cable and the HDMI. So this is actually a special HDMI because it is ultra high speed, AKA HDMI 2.1. If you're using your next gen console, I assume it will come with PS5 as well, definitely hold onto this because this will give you the access to do 4K 120, 8K, all that kind of stuff. Provide your TV supports it, which we've done a video all about on the main channel. And we have the actual controller itself, which I have already powered on. - Because did someone unbox this before they gave it to me? - Matt, why you gotta put me on blast like that? - This is, the whole thing. This is it. Like, - Thanks for watching. Make sure to subscribe to the channel. So let's go grab the S. - We're gonna run out table, very quickly. - woo oo Matt, is that an X-Box Series S? - This, no. - Did he just say PlayStation. - Matt, did you just call? Hmm I guess that Microsoft check didn't show up this week. Di it? - Not it's not going well. This is not going well. - Look you've already seen the MKBHD unboxing or the LTT store.com unboxing. Today. We're going to have a little bit more fun with these brand new X-Box. So series S is I honestly think the Xbox most people should buy it 300 bucks, 512 gig SSD. So there are a couple of limitations with this. You can also see it does not have a disc drive which is important for a little Timmy. When he goes and gets his brand new Xbox series that's for Christmas and he can't play the games that mom bought him. I'm sure that's going to happen. - I'm actually curious. What is this symbol - Velocity the Xbox velocity architecture AKA. It's an SSD instead of a slow pokey old hard drive. Now, interestingly, un-like the Xbox box the Xbox box, the Xbox series X box box the one 20 FPS badge is different. So that one says 4K 120 and 8K. This just says 120 - Confirmed. I just looked at it. - Although what's interesting is this actually will still technically do 4K 120. It's just that no games will ever do that but technically it will put out a 4K 120 signal. They just don't want to advertise it because they want little Timmy to be upset about his frames. Not showing up on time. All right, now you ready? - Yeah. I bet - Actually, You can do the honors. - I did the un.. Okay. I've already done this. Okay. If we're talking unboxing, - It's so cute. - It is. But if we're talking un-boxing, the series X was actually a lot better. - No, no, this is, this is pretty basic. - Other than boxes, don't let you - Dreams map, - I guess not, I guess not. - You need to power your dreams. - So this Oh, I guess we're not putting that one back together. - Did you just rip it. _ yes how does you not rip that? - I am a seasoned unboxing professional. Look at how tiny this console is. Now. I know at this point we've done videos on the shells. We've had prototypes systems in the office, but this is a final, full retail unit. Exactly what you will get when you shell out your $299, what else do we have in this box? I assume everything is the exact same. - So we have the exact same. HDMI the exact same power adapter. However, where it's different is we have a different controller. We have the white version of the controller - Robot - White robot white. So yes, we've said it before, but confirmed uuu, you still use AA batteries with these controllers. - Yeah. I mean, look, it's fine. Like - If you were buying a console in 2020, I get that. Some people get like batteries. I definitely would prefer if this was fully just rechargeable and to be fair, the DualShock 5 which we mm mm dual sense - Dual sense - See, I didn't get my 70 pay check. The dual sense controller of course has a large battery as did the dual shock three and the dual shock four you can buy a rechargeable battery for this controller. We've in fact done an entire video about this controller at this point. - Yeah. I mean, it is - It is annoying, but it's fine. I do think it looks better in white though. Right? - My pro my problem with the white is that they get, they get dirty. When we first got our hands on this, I really liked the texture of this but after feeling the, the dual sense with their texture with the little, the XO square triangles the dual sentence is so much better than this. - Ooh. Are you trying to say we need to do an X-Box controller PS4 PS5 controller video on this is which of course you're subscribed to find out about. Right? - I mean, this still feels really nice. I just think the dual sense feels better. - I think if you give this to someone who's used an X-Box one controller blindfolded the only difference they'll really be able to tell is is a little bit like, I mean, you can hear (rubbing sound) - I just realized too, that it actually tapers out and it's like, this is, this is flat. - These are two very different ways of going about the next generation of consoles. The series X is the full fat console experience right? You've got the disc drive, you've got the most power. You've got everything that you might want. It's going to, the games are going to look best, blah, blah, blah. Right? That is the best console, no doubt but $500 while I don't think is particularly crazy. In fact, I actually did the math a little while ago and this generation of consoles is actually among the cheapest. So the series X is when you adjust for inflation cheaper than the X-Box one was last generation. This is significantly cheaper than Xbox one or PS4 or anything like that. When you look at the series S there are a couple of things that really jump out to me. Now, you can definitely make the argument that at a hundred dollars more that PS five old digital looks awfully compelling and I will 100% agree. But if you're looking to just dabble with the next generation of console if you just want to get your sort of toe in the water this will play all of the same games from the series X. This will still play all those X-Box one games in three 60 and original games provided you have them digitally, right? So if you had something like Xbox game pass you'll have a pretty decent slot, a selection of games. This thing I think makes so much sense, especially if you get it with their, their, whatever their financing deal is, - Game Pass, all access, - All access. - Which is what? - $25 a month. So you pay $25 a month. You get not only a series of ads but you also get Xbox live gold the full Xbox game pass ultimate thing for two years. And at the end of it, you have your console. So - It is a two year commitment. Just keep that in mind - But it's still cheaper than if you were to buy them separately. Right? I think if you do something like that for the series, that's going to make a lot of sense, but I'll give you a little bit of a hot take and it's not hot take it's a lukewarm take everyone at launch is going to buy the series X and PS5. If you were someone who's spent years waiting for the next generation of consoles, you go for the big chunk of the day - The day one adopters are gonna go the best that they can go. That's that's very clear. And I don't think there's going to be quite as much fragmentation with the PS5, because it is the same exact console. - You can get the digital edition it's sold out like immediately. - Yeah, right - I think this is going to do much better long-term - I agree with that. - I think you're going to find these sort of black Friday deals, - Excuse me. - That was a really big windup for a little, - I thought it was going to be big, but then yeah - I find that all the time, sometimes it feels like it's gonna be big and it's not. And then you're just - Like a fifth penis joke he's made on in the last Latinas. - Wow. Way to have a dirty mind Matt - I think when you look at how the series X is going to perform longterm there are a lot more people we're just going to pick this up as like they want to get into that next generation of consoles. And I think there's a lot of people, if you are so fortunate to be able to afford both of them, buy the Series S and buy a PS5 right? You're gonna get the best of all worlds. You get all of the same games, and this is an unboxing embargo right? So we can talk about the consoles. We can actually fire up the final retail units but if you've watched any of our content across this is in the main channel, you'll know that we've covered the X-Box very extensively at this point. And so while there's still some surprises and stay tuned there are more videos that are sort of the final conclusions and comparisons and stuff. I think at this point, the DI's fairly well cast on what these new X boxes look like right? The series S make some sacrifices right? It is significantly less powerful. And one of the big issues I think you're going to have with the series S is the fact that it runs one as versions of games, not one X right? So basically the difference here here is that if you were playing any kind of game with backwards compatibility you're not going to be playing it at 4k and everything like you would on the series X simply because this is roughly equivalent on the graphics side to Xbox one X, which means it can't quite push over the edge to be able to play all those games at full resolution. - And we we ha we, we kinda thought that was gonna be the case but now we have it confirmed. So you look at like was it pub G you said it was gonna be running at 30 FPS. - Yeah. - Which is not a great the way it works. - 60 FPS at the X So basically the way it works So at least at lodge pub G is 60 FPS on one X and series X 30 FPS on 1 S and series S but I will say that's a little unfair because they're just running the standard versions of the games. - They are not optimized - So 30 FPS is not something. I think you're going to see a lot on the series S but what you are going to see especially if you're subscribed to digital Foundry, which you absolutely should be. You're going to see a lot of games running at either lower frame rates, but I expect lower settings and mostly lower resolutions on the Series S. Microsoft claimed that this is targeting 1440 P at 60 versus 4k at 60, I tend to think that might be slightly less than that. I think you're gonna see a lot of dynamic resolutions, but that being said I think, unless you have them side by side you're probably not going to notice a major difference right? For most people you're sitting down playing a game. Yeah. It might not be quite as sharp and clear. And especially if you're losing frame rate options but a lot of the games we've seen so far still have 120 FPS support here. A lot of those games while yes the graphics settings might be turned down a little bit. As far as I'm concerned I'll take 10 ADP at 120 over 4K 30 or 60 any day. Right. I really liked that really high level of fluidity. - So I agree with everything that you say with the, the S - Did you say you agree with everything I say Mat? - Yes. I do think that this is the one that most people should get. However, if you have the money, I do think you should go for the X just because you're not compromising in any way, you're getting the full X-Box experience. I really said the S is the one I was going to get. I did ultimately go for the X just to kind of cover my bases be at the top level of performance from day one. But I agree with everything you say that like if you're trying to budget if you're trying to, you know, pick what's right for you and, and, and, you know, money is a huge factor for this. Go with the S you're going to be plenty happy with it. - 300 bucks is a good deal, - It's a really good deal for a brand new next gen console. Let's talk about something else that might happen in the future. - What's that Mat? - We say $300 is really good for a console. What about $50 or a hundred dollars minimum? You mean buying a used X-Box 360? No. So recently Phil Spencer has alluded that something that X-Box wants to do is bring out streaming game sticks to give you the full game pass experience. It is streaming video it's. So it's, it's similar to how stadia is working with Chrome cast. - Yeah. - So it's going to be very internet dependent, but you do - A Chromecast that comes with an X-Box controller, - Right Which is exactly what stadia does. You can play all these X-Box games without having a console period. And it's something that you can throw in your bag, carry you know, bring it around with you wherever you go. That's a really compelling idea because not only is it good for, if someone who's not a hardcore gamer who doesn't want to invest, invest hundreds of dollars in the console and they still want to play like a couple of games here and there. - Yeah. - But also if for secondary, - You actually, Wouldn't necessarily even need to use game pass for that because the X-Box has have a local game streaming too. - Right - It's an interesting idea. So the thing is this has actually been a rumor for a very long time, - Right - So obviously Phil Spencer talked about it, which basically means either there's one in their lab or it's coming out or whatever the case is. - Well, so they actually had supposedly developed one back in years in 2016. Yes. It was project Hobart, which was scrap, ultimately scrapped and never, I never, - We think maybe it's back. - Yeah. Maybe they, they redid it or something like that. But like, it's something that there was supposedly ready to actually start manufacturing - Which is a very simple thing. It's literally something they can take that video that's running off of the game pass servers and use pair looks like an X-Box controller. - Right. - I think it's an interesting idea. I do think though that the game pass, they need to make another tier of game pass, because if you get the full ultimate and you don't have an Xbox, that might be weird. I feel like I feel that they should have like a 599 pure just the streaming element of it. But also who knows right? Because you still need access to those games. I think it's going to be complicated but it makes sense more as a secondary device. I don't think a lot of people are going to ever do Xbox game pass streaming at least in the near future, as their only console. - I like that there's actually conversations of options where it's not just, here's the console. You have to buy this in order to play these games. This is going to be the same argument I have for why I think movie theaters are going to be closing the move is shifting to all digital regardless. - Yeah. - I mean I know there's a lot of passionate people who have their their, their libraries of, of disk but I don't think that's going to matter in the long run the, the game companies to just have digital additions. - Absolutely - They don't have to manufacture the actual disks. They get a higher percentage because there's no middleman like GameStop who is, you know, taking a cut of that sale. - I do think disk will stick around at least in some fashion because there there's still a lot of people who can't download 100 gig yo games regularly on their internet connection. I, I see that, but I do think it is becoming more and more popular. And the idea that there is a series S like I get what the PlayStation, they just locked the disc drive off, but this is a digital only console from day one, right? When we looked at the X-Box side edition the X-Box one was very much like, Oh this was just a disk drive that got removed and then knocked $50 off the price. Like it wasn't that exciting with this. I think this is a much more compelling deal. However, I still have some reservations about the series S when it comes time to take a look at the performance, just take a look at the games. And that is something I'll absolutely be checking out on future episodes. So make sure you're subscribed, stay tuned for more spicy Xbox content and maybe PlayStation content too, if Mat not stops Being biased.",

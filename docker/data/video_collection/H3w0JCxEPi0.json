    "transcript": "this video is brought to you by NCI XCOM great technology selection and service so the oneplus X is now available to purchase without an invite every huge day this is a fantastic direction for oneplus to make this device available to the masses and actually what they've done with the oneplus 2 is completely remove the invite system so now you can buy the oneplus 2 no invite needed what's up guys I'm Dimitri with Huracan acts and this is top 5 reasons of why you should consider buying the oneplus X if it's in your budget so first the value you get with a smartphone is pretty fantastic at $249 plus a rubber case is included with an awesome tangle free micro USB cable and leave it to oneplus 2 seriously set the benchmark of what a budget smartphone should look like and what it should feel like now come the specs without any real drawbacks at this price point we have a Snapdragon 801 processor at 2.3 gigahertz Adreno 330 GPU 3 gigs of ram and 16 gigabytes of storage 2525 milliamp hour battery and LTE support but with some bands missing so for AT&T and t-mobile in the States you'll be moved to the lower speed now would you consider the lack of USB type-c NFC AC Wi-Fi quick charging and 4k video a deal-breaker at this price point no because those features are normally associated with smart phones triple the price of the oneplus X but where it lacks in those add-on high-end features it makes up with the display and the build the display here is fantastic it's 5 inches 1080p resolution it is an AMOLED type panel with Gorilla Glass 3 the blacks are super deep and contrast is really awesome white balance is right on point and vibrancy is it a very pleasing level just look at it next to the oneplus two the color on the oneplus X pops out without being harsh the oranges and the blues still maintain plenty of definition and for the display alone I could see myself switching to the oneplus X as my daily driver this is very well complemented by the build which follows in line as one of the best features of the smartphone not only to have a metal frame surrounding the entire device but also glass front and back sides with extremely satisfying handling the back is a fingerprint canvas of course but you won't really care because of how nice it feels and even though it's using older Gorilla Glass 3 the touch surface of the display is smoother and feels better to navigate versus the newer Gorilla Glass 4 found only one plus to some other awesome physical elements on the oneplus X include an alert slider with three confident steps and really clicky power and volume rocker we have a multicolor notification LED in the top right and the discreet built-in capacitive buttons that allow that front face of the oneplus X to remain beautiful and I actually prefer them like this instead of them being backlit furthermore removing the SIM card tray you can either populate it with two SIM cards or use one of the slots for a micro SD card to expand your storage which is an awesome implementation with this tray and lastly the full experience taking everything into account has been surprisingly positive it's a fast device and oxigen the West is pretty much stock Android anyway with a few built-in customizations like double tap to wake double tap the home button to bring up the camera choose your accent color and I'm getting more comfortable with using shelf but I think it's pretty limited still and I hope that they let us replace it with Google now the earphone speaker is very clear the bottom speaker is actually louder than the oneplus 2 speaker and the camera is totally passable one that doesn't have image stabilization for low-light shooting but in my experience it has been more consistent and more accurate with exposure again when compared to the oneplus 2 so these were my five reasons why you should consider the oneplus X with battery life being ok with three plus hours on screen time but there are two things that really highlight the cost-cutting with this device first the Wi-Fi range is not so good having about 40% signal strength in the room just next to the router while the oneplus 2 has about 90% signal strength and to the EMC see storage is very slow updating apps takes forever and saving photos after using the photo editor is painfully slow but luckily these are the only two instances of real-world slowdowns when it comes to storage when using the oneplus X and with all things considered oneplus x delivers a very satisfying package one that I couldn't wait to open and if you're looking for a thumbs up experience with a few my networks then the oneplus X is definitely worth the wait for a Tuesday I'm Dmitry with Hardware Canucks thanks so much for watching we'll see you in the next one",

    "transcript": "I know this product has been out for a while, it's the DJI Mic 2. But I always wanted to test the noise cancellation here, where I'm surrounded by cicadas. So I'm just going to turn on the noise cancellation right now, and you tell me how it sounds like. I think it did a pretty good job, overall. So, yeah, not bad. I like this thing.",

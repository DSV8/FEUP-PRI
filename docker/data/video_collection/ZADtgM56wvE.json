    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And the Google event just went down and there was a lot of hardware that was announced, more than I thought they would. The few items that kind of stick out for me is being like the most interesting are Well actually like the Google home devices, so the mini and the Max both were more interesting to me than I thought they would be. So I'm not huge on smart home stuff I normally just don't invest in that stuff, but because of how inexpensive the Google mini is I feel like it's something that a lot of people could easily pick up and adapt into their house and make use of it and because so many people are kind of using Google services I feel like this is the turning point for Google home, or just the whole Google home ecosystem. I feel like that at 50 bucks, so many people are gonna get it. It's gonna change how people perceive the whole Google home thing. The Google Home Max device was a bit of a surprise and that thing looks really impressive to me. It's unfortunately really expensive. It's 400 bucks, but the thing is: It, to me, just kills any Interest that I ever had in the Apple Home Pod. Not that I was in love with the home pod or anything but that thing is $350 and like let's forget about everything about speaker quality and stuff like that I'm just gonna assume that they're both really good. But for the services that the Apple home pod can connect to, and that's being only Apple Music, it makes no sense for people to purchase that thing unless they're so deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem. Google home max is like I think it's just a better product all around and I like the fact we can put them straight up or lie them flat and assuming the sound quality is good, which I think is a pretty safe assumption I think they're gonna sell way better than Apple home pod devices just because of how much versatility these have in comparison. Okay, The other devices are the pixel devices the Pixel 2 - and the Pixel 2 XL. To me the one that's most interesting is the Pixel 2 XL not that the pixel - is bad or anything But because of those bezels, I feel like the excel is just so much nicer to look at. This is a phone that you use and carry with you all the time, It's got to look nice and the regular Pixel 2 just doesn't cut it for me. In terms of the tech on the new phones like they were demonstrating AR. I mean every phone company's doing AR this year. It's super impressive, and I'm sure you need some pretty powerful hardware but it just doesn't appeal to me. Maybe it appeals to you guys. I'm curious though, like when you guys see those things does that turn you on like does that make you go: \"Hey, I want to buy that phone\", because Apple did it, Google did it, and I'm sure there's other phones that gonna drop this year that have AR demonstrations. But... it... I don't know it ... Am I like an old or something? I look at that stuff, And I'm like \"who the hell wants to see this stuff, like who's really gonna want to have Creatures from Stranger Things running around and...,\" I don't know it seems weird. The things that I am excited about on the phones are the camera. It supposedly gets a DxOMark of 98 which is The highest yet again And I'm really stoked for this new feature on the pixel 2 where the phone will actually listen to your ambient environment for songs and try to identify them without even you tapping the screen or anything like that. I love that There's so many times where I've want to know the name of the song And I'll be too lazy to hit up Shazam or by the time. I hit Shazam up It's too late, and the song is gone. I love that! I think it's such a simple thing, but hopefully doesn't drain batteries like crazy, but I love that, I think I'll use it pretty frequently. Okay the device that I'm most interested to find out more information about though is without a doubt The Pixel Book. So, the Pixel Book if you didn't watch the event is this thousand-dollar Chromebook, which is Super expensive, right? That's the first question that comes to mind: Why would you pay $1,000 for a Chromebook when you can get Chromebooks for like three or four hundred dollars - a pretty good ones? And I think the answer to that is that you can always find Chromebooks, inexpensive Chromebooks, easily you go on the market you can buy like two three $400 Chromebooks everywhere. So if you want to buy something a little more expensive you could there's some Samsung devices and Asus made a really premium one But this one kind of steps it up to the next level, and I'm interested to try this thing, I really want to see if $1,000 gets you a device that's actually worth it. The other thing is and I think this is the question that's most pertinent to me and probably you guys - even if you do have a thousand dollars to spend on something, is it really worth, like, you have to really think about that thousand dollars. It's a lot of money, but if you have that budget is really worth buying a pixel book over something like an XPS 13 or an LG gram 13 or any kind of the top-end 13-inch devices that have a thousand dollar price tag and I think that's an interesting question, that I mean the the immediate reaction, the knee-jerk reaction is no there's no way because you could do so much more on a Windows laptop or even like an older MacBook. You can do so much more on those devices than a Chromebook, right? That's the immediate thought, but there's a reason why this thing exists. I want to explore it fully I want to test it out. I'm super excited about that thing. I will be going to the event in Toronto tonight Just to check out the different devices, and if I find something interesting I'll do a follow-up video, but otherwise I'll be doing reviews on the stuff as they come in. Okay I hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it See you guys next time!",

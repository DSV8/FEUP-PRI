    "transcript": "hello good people Ebert here with Hardware Canucks and yes I do sound sick that's because unfortunately I did catch the CES flu and I'm slowly recovering from it but anyways coming back to the topic back at CES seemed he announced their 3rd generation Ryzen processors along with their Radeon 7 graphics card which is a really interesting GPU for the price so I really can't wait to test that out and I give you guys my verdict on it definitely stay tuned for that video very soon but we spent a good amount of time talking to AMD and their board partners regarding these new CPUs and it was actually pretty interesting because you know Gen 3 Ryzen CPU's have a lot of people talking about where AMD's going this year and how much their processors have changed within the short amount of time so everyone is excited about it and I think you should be as well so when we talk about that right after this evolve with the times consider nvme storage today the new RC 100 brings affordable nvme storage into your hands with various capacities in this super compact form factor that plugs directly into your motherboard it's extremely powerful and utilizes Toshiba advanced 3d flash memory for awesome speeds so you can be a happy user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme drive to consider check it out Phillip now you guys might recall that when I covered the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X and the Ryzen 5 2600X I was actually super impressed by what they brought to the table not only that but Intel really didn't have an answer since their CPUs were just far too expensive by comparison but now we're actually gonna start to see 3rd generation Ryzen CPUs hitting sometime this summer now before I get too far into this video it's super important to understand what these new processors are made of basically the first generation Ryzen used the Zen whereas the 2700 acts and other second generation processors use the Zen plus design which refined the originals and architecture meanwhile what I'm talking about in this video is the third generation rise in CPUs which are based off these and to architecture and AMD's new 7 nanometer manufacturing process that seven animator node should actually allow them to pull ahead of Intel for the very first time in almost a decade basically Intel has been stuck with an endless number of skylake refreshes and as they wait for the ten nanometer ramp up and ice lake while AMD has sprinted ahead that poses a problem for intel since isolate won't be ready until the end of 2019 at the earliest while AMD's Ryzen 3000 series will be shipping in volume to customers this summer which is awesome part of the reason why AMD has been able to move so quickly to the 7 nm node is how they're designing their processors instead of a single large complicated die that old si si few chords memory controllers the IO stages and other elements they broken things off into multiple smaller sections so they're easier to manufacture yields can also increase this way in the case of Ryzen 3 up to 8 x86 cores are housed on a smaller sam nanometer die while the i/o gets pushed off into a separate section this approach can actually be scaled up words to create processors with even more cores for threadRipper and epyc families but that's not exactly what makes Ryzen 3 so exciting what AMD showed that their press conference was a very early 8 core 16 thread chip running equal to an Intel 9900K at stock settings in Cinebench based on our own tests that would make me 3000 series chip roughly 15% faster than the previous generation not only that but a system was consuming just 133 Watts versus the 9900 case a hundred and eighty watts remember this is with relatively early silicon which means it isn't running the final frequencies if Indy is able to further improve clock speeds before lunch we may see their third generation Ryzen products easily overcome beaker and coffee lake CPUs and unless Intel can bake some serious performance improvements into their isolate architecture even that may have a tough time with Zen 2 this is a huge deal guys but remember AMD needs to improve their lightly threaded performance if they have any hope of beating Intel across the board games in particular tend to fall into Intel's camp since their architecture excels when its operating at lower thread counts supposedly a lot of Zen 2 internal revisions are focused on bridging this gap so let's hope that's true not only ambi promising 3rd gen Ryzen processors will be the best for performance and efficiency but they'll also be technically compatible with all aim for motherboards I'm saying technically because motherboard manufacturers have to release a proper bios for that kind of support and everyone we've talked to is planning to do exactly that while this sounds like a cool feature there will be some limitations with backwards compatibility certain overclocking options may be disabled and memory support might be cut down a bit the third Ryzen processors will also support PCI Express 4.0 which isn't a big deal right now but it could be pretty important for future and niimi storage devices and GPUs originally we thought this feature would be exclusive to the new 500 series motherboards but I've been talking to a few reps at CES it turns out all the generation 300 and 400 series will be compatible with PCI 4.0 - the reason for this is pretty simple physically and electrically the PCI 3.0 and 4.0 slots are exactly the same the only difference is the 4.0 standard has a faster signaling rate because of the increased signaling requirements traces on the motherboard can't exceed six inches before additional components are needed to drive PCI Express 4.0 has a higher bandwidth since older motherboards weren't built with those components only the first x16 PCI slots would possibly receive access to the 4.0 standard that's a big if - because backwards compatibility in this case would require substantial BIOS work it's still going to be interesting to see if any company actually does it though now I'm not sure how many people will actually take advantage of all this backwards compatibility but at least AMD is giving people the option Intel really needs to take some lessons here because I'm pretty tired of buying a new motherboard with almost every one of their small CPU revisions the last thing that I mentioned is overclocking now AMD hasn't published any numbers as of right now but from our conversations with every motherboard manufacturer they are planning on launching some extreme products for the game for platform so that means expect extreme line of motherboards for duis and platform and this also means that they could potentially be a good clock speed Headroom with the third generation rise in CPUs which is very exciting for our Canadian audience memory Express is a place to go for home business and gaming electronics you can try before you buy a spec great for peripherals by visiting one of their stores in Winnipeg Calgary or Greater Vancouver and more they do custom pcs and will beat any Canadian price guarantee so there you guys have it right now we still don't know all that much about their generation rights and processors but even at this early point I'm very excited about what AMD has to offer for the rest of 2019 in fact this is probably the first in a lot of years that I feel like almost Intel is far behind what at what aimed is achieving competition is always good but if AMD can actually pull ahead of what Intel can achieve it's gonna be an interesting year it's gonna be interesting rest of 2019 so I'm looking forward to that anyways let me know what you guys think about the upcoming third generation Ryzen processors are you satisfied with your current setup and if you're planning if you're not would you actually consider upgrading to the third generation Ryzenn CPUs also if you're an existing x37 your x4 semi motherboard would you consider upgrading to the new processors along with a new motherboard I'd love to New York thoughts in the comments down below a new bar with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here to subscribe to our new boot sequence Channel I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

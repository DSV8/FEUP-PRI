    "transcript": "- How guys, how's it going? It's Justine, and this is my sister Jenna. - Hello. - And we are getting prepared for Valentine's Day, which is February 14th in case you didn't know. I think it's a silly holiday, but what I do love is celebrating by making baked goods. I love doing blindfolded challenges with Jenna, and we did a blindfold gift exchange during Christmas, and these are the only blindfolds that I could find. This is a question that I have for you guys. Wait, let me ask Nick first. Nick, what do you call these? - [Nick] Sweethearts. - Yes! - That's what you call them? - Yes, they're sweethearts! - Or are you just saying that because that's what it says? - [Nick] No that's... - That's what people call them, you call them the Sweethearts. - No! - Yes! - [Nick] The ones you got in grade school that say, like \"Kiss me,\" or like... - Or \"You're cute\" or \"Dream\"... Dream big? They do not say this. - [Nick] What did you call them? - Conversation hearts. - We came from the same family, but I don't know where your twisted little brain called them Conversation Hearts. - They're called Conversation Hearts, they've always been called Conversation Hearts. Look, fricking on the bag! - Is this a different brand other than the Sweethearts, where they're like \"We have to call it something else\"? - [Nick] Yeah, it's like... - This is sweethearts. - [Nick] It's like getting a cotton swab and not calling it a Q-Tip. - This is the authentic... - Uh-uh. - ...Sweet... - No, it's not, let me taste, I'll tell you. I'll tell you if it's authentic. - It doesn't matter if it tastes... - No, it does. - They're gonna probably taste the same. You're ruining everything, they're Sweethearts! I am 23 years old and, in my lifetime, I've never once been like \"Oh I love when a boy gives you Conversation Hearts.\" No one's ever given you a Valentine, I'm sure. That's why you... - [Nick] In grade school, they never passed around the bag of Conversation Hearts... - Yeah, it's the bag of Sweethearts. - They're called Conversation Hearts and you guys don't even know. No, they're called Conversation Hearts! It's on the bag! - That's the generic ripoff version of the Sweethearts. They can't call them Sweethearts, it's a lawsuit. - No, wait, we're gonna figure this out. \"We're proud to be your favorite candy maker for over 100 years.\" Okay, how many years have you been making candy? - Alexa, when were Sweethearts candies invented? - [Alexa] Similar to Necco Wafers, and started a candy factory.\" - 1847. - Ugh, I just wanna bash these... - [Nick] A little over 100 years. How unromantic are conversation hearts. - Conversation candies. - Oh babe, I wanna have a conversation with you tonight. - [Nick] Yeah. - Yeah, if somebody says that they wanna have a conversation I'm like \"Pff, I'm out.\" - You're like \"We're breaking up.\" Could you please admit to the camera, either one will do. - I'm wrong. - Put that on your Conversation Heart and eat it! - (screams) - [Nick] Sorry Justine, I didn't get that in focus, what did you say? - I'm wrong. So that's gonna be on one of my hearts, the other one's gonna be called \"butt slap,\" and the other one's gonna be called... - Jenna's always right. - Oh geez, okay, well the thing is... - Woohoo! - We're gonna have to write that blindfolded. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna be decorating and blindfolding and writing a conversation to each other. Okay, let's do this. - You're breaking them! - Shut up. I am sick of your mouth. \"I'm Jenna, I'm always right. Everything I say is right.\" - I'll find that on a Conversation Heart and shove it in your mouth.\" Can we get a zoom in on what this is supposed to be? - So Jenna and I are going to decorate these cakes blindfolded, and because the Conversation Hearts have words on them, conversations, we're going to write a conversation to each other. Like, that's what you do when you talk to someone. It's a conversation. - You're like, \"Oh, someone wrote me a conversation letter.\" It's like, it's a love letter. - Okay well, is it a sweetheart letter? - Well it's better than a conversation. Like, I have a conversation with Maddy, or like a tree. - Oh wow! - It's meaningless. - We've got some things to decorate, I think basically we're gonna decorate with this icing. (clinking) Oops! And then we have this, we've got a little black, and a red. - All right, blindfold on. All right, let's go, put your blindfold on. - So I need to find my... - Oh, it's so crazy, I can't find anything already. Oh, that's the cake. - Okay. - Alright, that's the cake, yes, that's the cake. - So... - So... - I feel the cakes. - You sure that's the cake? - Yeah, it's a cake. - So, I think the icing is... Let me feel around for it. - Oh I found a Conversation Heart box. Do you have the icing? - Here wait, go a little bit to the left. - My left or your left? Wait (laughs). This is so silly. - Okay, I've managed to find... - Did you find it? - Here you go, right here, I'll put it in front of you, here. Is this in front of you? - Wait, do you have it? Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. - Yes, yes, yes. So, are we both... - Wait no, don't move stuff! - How'd you know I moved it? - 'Cause I felt it! - Like this was, this was, this was here. Wait, where are you at? - Watch those paws, lady. - Okay, hold on, let's move this closer. Can you feel it? - Okay, two, we've got three cakes. Ow! - Oh I'm sorry, I didn't see you there. - Okay, so this is, we're gonna ice up... Ow! - Oh sorry, I'm sorry, I'm trying to get the bowl. - Ow! - I can't see you, I'm blindfolded. - Me too, okay. I think I'm icing, I'm pretty sure. - Oops, oh no! I'm, I didn't... - Am I on the corner? - Oh no! - Okay, you're icing my arm, you pig! (playful music) Am I even icing anything right now? - I don't know, I gotta get more. Where's the bowl? - Ah, my arm! - I'm sorry, wait, that's your arm? - You're... Are you icing my body? - I mean, I'm going where the bowl is, I don't know what the problem is. - Ugh. - I can't imagine this looks good, because I can't see what I'm doing. - I wonder if anything's coming out of here. - And it's like, everything's real sticky. - Oh, yeah, it's definitely, mm, yep, definitely... Oh God, glitter gel sucks. - How do you know it's glitter? - Because I know what I picked up. - How do you know? - Oh shoot! Well I'm pretty sure it is. - I can't feel where the icing is, how... - Oh here, I can help you! I know where one is. Oh no, oh here it is. Here you go! Oh wait, you can't see. Where are you? - Wait, lower. - You're no where near me! - Is the cap on? - Yes. - Feels like the cap's on. - Oh wait, yeah, it is on. - B... - Aggressive. - U. T. But. Wow, if I just stand here, I start falling backwards. Oh! - Oh one second, I'm trying to write! What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? - Where's your cake? Is this another cake? - That's another, that's bonus cake I'm assuming. I can't see. - Okay, well I'm gonna just put some more, I'm gonna just put this in my hand, 'cause I feel like I'll be able to get a better grasp of it. - Am I writing this about you, or just about like... - It's a Conversation Heart. Have a conversation. Conversation Heart, let's have a, a conversation. Are you still here? (laughs) - I just went home. - Ah! Don't push me! Oh no. - I need a little bit more icing. - Oh. Hey! - What is... You're in my way. - I'm gonna say... Did you pinch me? - Huh? I'm trying to get icing. - I'm just saying \"love.\" L. O. V. Okay. So I'm gonna do, like, a nice heart outline. Oh my God, I don't know if anything's coming out - Yeah, it's really hard to tell if anything's coming out, I can't see what I'm doing. - I know, I keep, like, I feel like it's... I'm trying to do an outline, like a heart outline. Oh no, I gotta put this down somewhere. Okay. Okay, I think I'm done. - Hold on, I'm not done. I'm not sure what I'm doing, I can't see anything. So you did two, I only got to do one. - Well 'cause you're too slow. Ready? - One, two, three. Oh, yours looks like trash. What did you write? - You (beep). - Look at your face. (laughs) - \"I'm sleepy\"? - Mine looks perfect! - What... - Yours looks like a dumpster! Was that Dexter inspired? - Did you even put your blindfold on? - Yeah, look at my mascara! - That was supposed to be a heart. That is nothing like what I thought I was doing. This one was supposed to say \"butt slap.\" - I'm sleepy. - Oh! (laughs) - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (laughs) - I was just gonna ask you if you wanted to... - All right, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more. Okay, friends. (laugh crying) - It's in my eye. I hate it so much. It's in my... (screams) - Oh, I'm so sorry, I promise I'm not this mean, I'm just... - Oh, it hurts so bad, I'm serious. I think I'm actually crying, it really hurts my eyes. This sucks so much. - What kind of a conversation... Here let me... - Shut up, no... - No, no, no, no, no, no, friendly. We're having a conversation. - It hurts so bad. It hurts so bad I can't even... So sad. It hurts so bad. - This is what happens when you keep Jenna up past her bedtime. I'm starting to feel a little bit bad. - It hurts my eyes so bad. - She even bought me dinner tonight, and this is what I did to her. (singing) What's conversation got to do, got to do with it. - Okay guys, thanks for watching. This is not fun, this is not fun. My eyes hurts really bad. - (whispering) I don't know, I'm sorry. - I don't... What do I even... I don't even know what to do right now. - [Nick] Please subscribe. - Please subscribe. Justine, I'm sorry, I didn't have my blindfold on. - Well you... I figured. You freaking wrote perfect calligraphy on your Conversation Heart. And now I look like this! - It's just a prank bro. - [Nick] Alexa, play \"When a Man Loves a Woman.\" - (singing) When a man conversates with a woman. - (laughs) (playful music)",

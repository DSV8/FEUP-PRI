    "transcript": "- This might be the coolest laptop that I've ever seen in my entire life, it's so awesome. This is a 13.3\" OLED Windows detachable laptop. This cover stand gives up to 170 hinge movement, it has WiFi 6, you can quick charge up to 60% in just 30 minutes, you've got dual cameras, there's a 13 megapixel rear and a 5 megapixel front. Fingerprint login, Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, up to 3.3 GHz Intel Quad Core CPU, ASUS Pen 2.0 with four interchangeable pen tips, the display has a Corning Gorilla Glass, the keyboard is an ASUS ErgoSense keyboard, and for ports we've got two USB-C, an audio jack, and a micro SD card reader. Today I have a very, very special guest, would you like to introduce yourself to my audience, and let them know why you're sitting here, and what we have in front of us? - Thank you so much, Justine, I'm very happy to be here. My name is Philip Colbert, otherwise known as The Lobstar or The Lobster, I'm very excited to collaborated with ASUS on the 13 Slate OLED. For me it's a amazing opportunity 'cause computers are very much at the forefront of art-making today, it seemed like a really cool collaboration to actually, really get involved with the actual computer itself and some of the accessories, which I'm excited to show you. - And I'm excited because, obviously somebody who reviews a lot of tech, I love art, and I also love lobsters, if some of you guys have been on my channel for a long time, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Are you still taking photos? Do you see my shoes? And a lot of your art has to do with lobsters. Do you wanna give kind of just a quick little, I guess, overview of why the lobsters? - Well, I tell people that I became an artist when I became a lobster, and I think that symbolizes to me the freedom of art, how that within art we can be whoever we wanna be, and we can create our own worlds, and we can really push the boundaries of, and express, and exercise freedom, ultimately. I think in art, regardless of where people are from, they can really achieve a sense of expression, a sense of identity that maybe wasn't necessarily there to begin with or something that they can really create, and I love that about art, and it's a very empowering and positive human important expression. So I guess, yeah, the lobster for me is my persona, my artistic persona, and I think it also underpins my belief in creating your own world as an artist, and building a universe, and bringing people on a sort of intellectual journey and experience, and ideally creating a new language. I think of the lobster as putting a flag into no man's land in some crazy conceptual wasteland, and then building an intellectual theme park. - And I feel like that's what you did with this, and I have not looked up anything about this yet, I mean, other than some specs because I wanted to have an authentic unboxing reaction and experience to this. So I guess kind of leading into this device, what was it like for you kind of working in this medium? 'Cause you've worked in so many different mediums, basically spanning the entire gamut of things that you could create. - Yeah, yeah. I'm very interested in multimedia, for me that's the phenomenon of today, making art in a way that crosses different genres and creates a holistic experience to art, and I think certainly working with ASUS has been an amazing experience, I think the level of detail we've really put into developing the product was very long, amazing process of just really pushing the detail. I think, as we unbox, you'll see that there's so many little attention to details, which, for me, there's so much of an art in product detail. - Look at this, even these details. - Yeah, I might use it as a suitcase, actually. - You can take this back with you. - Do you think I can use it on the flight back to London? - Yeah. 'Cause actually you're not from here. - I think I could fit the shoes in there, (Justine laughs) my folded y-fronts. - Are you ready to do the unboxing? - Let's unbox, Justine, let's do it. - This has been sitting here for days and I have been waiting to open this up, I couldn't find my machete but I have some throwing axes, so- - Wow. - I think this will. We'll just use one of these to open it, at that. - Yeah, precise. - And that's all we needed to do. All right, here we go. (gasps) Oh. Oh my goodness! Wait, there's a little figure too? - Yes, there's a figure. - No way! That's your quote. - Yes, indeed, the quote is there. - So everything about this already is awesome, I like the whole presentation. I know this is also about the product but look how cute this is. - Yeah, I'm very happy we made the figure, I think that was the, for me, the really playful way of taking almost making a little sculpture edition that interacted with the pen for the pad and and creating a fun little crossover between actual genuine sort of sculptural piece and the sort of the interior scene of having the actual laptop set up and everything. - Is that why his hands are- - That's why they're- - Or his claws? - In that position, yeah. - To hold the stylus? - Dali made a lobster telephone, now we have a lobster pen holder. - This is incredible, oh my gosh, I love that so much. So now we have the VivaBook here. Oh, this is a whole, oh my gosh, this is really a whole experience. - Yeah, there's lots of different things going on in there. - So the device is actually in here. So is this a little carrying case? - That is a carrying case, yes. Now Libby the Lobster has a full lobster set for her digital experiences. - This is awesome. Oh my gosh, like you can just hold it like that? This is great. - Yeah, so this pattern is obviously my name in various sort of brand logo styles, and then with the ASUS branding mixed in, I wanted the box to be super fun. - Charm Box. - You have to open it up. - What is- - Luck the charms. - What is this? (plastic rustling) - These are so cute. - This are lobsters. - Look at this. Oh, that is so. What is this? - Yes, you attach these to the exterior of the laptop. - So many accessories. - Hey, you gotta see the laptop itself, That is the- - Okay, yes. Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun! Here we are. Throw a little slice. Have you done an unboxing of this yet? - I have, but I think I've only done unboxing with the prototypes, really, when they would arrive at the studio, I didn't think I've ever witnessed, necessarily, a full unboxing of the final product. - Do you wanna do this? - Well, yeah. - Is this like your first- - I can get involved- - There you go. - In this unboxing. - [Justine] There you go! - [Philip] Here we go. So I think you have to do the honors on this one. - Okay. - I like the package. - So I can show you some other elements, 'cause it keeps on going. Justine- - There's still more! - So actually this is the key component the actual tablet itself. - [Justine] Oh, I like this little velcro here too, that's cute. - This is our screen. - Oh wow. - Yeah, that's my signature and little doodle of the lobster. - It's so great. Oh my gosh, look at this. - Yeah, that's what you attach the charms to, this is really fun, it's actually like a little sticker pack which you can then stick onto the keyboard. - No way. - With customizable stickers. - Oh, that's gonna be a fun little project for later today. - My kids love stickers. - Do they have any influence on any of the decisions here? - Yeah, definitely. I love when my kids are in the studio, 'cause I guess my work is very, I'm very drawn to very recognizable symbols and the power of, almost, this poetry of these symbols that everyone is familiar with and very, let's say. loaded with meaning. The sort of holiness of the, the power of the everyday, whether it's food objects, or the food sort of things, or objects that we all interact with every day, and I think these things are dripping with poetic meaning, so my kids also love the connection of these, a bit like cooking, you take two symbolic ideas and putting them together, and it creates a little explosion. - [Justine] I like to go and get everything out and see what we're working with. Oh, more stickers! - More stickers, yes. - I don't even know where to start. Okay, let's unbox him. - Free the lobster. - I always like to smell things in unboxing. - Mm, yes, yeah. - Oh, that reminds me of my childhood, like that smell when you- - I know, it's amazing, yeah. - Unbox a fresh toy. Do you wanna smell it? Just give it a- - Yes, it's a genuine lobster. - (laughs) That's genuine lobster. Okay, now we have officially unboxed everything, so what do we have here? - Where is the pen for the lobster? - We've missed something. There's a whole other little section. We've got our power adapter. - Yeah, we needed a power adapter. And here is the most important. - So now we have everything unboxed, we've got the little stylus, and that is what the little lobster's gonna hold. - Yes, so I'm just gonna open this. - Do you need an axe? - Yes, that would be a great idea, an axe for the pen. - Careful 'cause it is very sharp. - Typing in The Shining. Voila. Okay, here we go, we got a pen. - Look at that. - So the pen sits in there, and then there's also, do you know, this is the other thing that goes on the pen. - There's so many little accessories. I feel like this would be, if this is your first device that you've ever got, you're gonna be let down severely everything after this because there's so much- - There's a lot going on here. - Fun little accessories. Look at that, it's like a little flag. - So the next vital step, we attach this guy on here and then we can open her up, like so. - [Justine] And so that's just like a little back, to keep it- - Yeah, that's it, yes, that's a little back. - To keep it up. - And then have your, you stick him here. - Where do these go? - These charms go on the back. Computers people love to customize, add their own things and play around with it a bit. - But I feel like I want a little lobster here. Are you left or right-handed? - Right. - Okay. - Very well placed. - Nice, there we go. So I'm not gonna put you through me putting every single sticker on right now. - Yes, you can enjoy doing that later. - But I will be definitely doing this later which is gonna look so cool. because you have one for every single key and that's gonna completely turn this into a very unique experience. So like devices like this, I feel like are changing the way that people are able to create, because before, I feel like you had to be at home, you had to be in your studio, you had to have all of your stuff where- - Yeah. - You could basically be anywhere, creating and doing things with devices like this. - Completely. I find I spend so much time when I'm traveling with the tablet and the pen, just drawing on the tablet, it's amazing. These tablets are, in a way, mobile creative studios, which is amazing. The fact that it's one of the remarkable things about technology has, it's made the artistic practice so democratically accessible and how you can create, and upload your work immediately online, it's pretty remarkable. - It's so fascinating. So even, like, working, kind of in this medium, what was your biggest challenge? - Well, I think always the challenge with when one is making, let's say, in brand collaborations with art, is obviously making sure one doesn't lose the integrity of one's work in the collaboration, but I think with ASUS, I was really happy with the fact that we could really put so much work into the detail. - Yeah, I mean, even the case too, oh my gosh, everything, it's just fun. - But what was really exciting about the project is, 'cause I have a metaverse, I think probably the world's biggest artist metaverse on Decentraland, so I have my own city, Lobsteropolis, and so we created an ASUS Colbert store in Lobsteropolis where we had product displays and everything in the metaverse, and for the opening of the, the launch for the laptop, we had a full big event, I think like 1,000 different lobster avatars turned up, and what's amazing is I love the fact that the laptop itself is obviously a gateway to my metaverse. - So I'm gonna be going more in depth in this laptop, giving you guys a closer look at all of the details. Since you're here, let's talk more about your art, and kind of how you got started because I'm actually a new fan of your art. - Despite being someone that never did very well at school or anything, I always had a malfunctioning in my wiring that was like, \"I could do anything,\" and where I could just believe that anyone could do anything and it wasn't that I was special or had any particular skills beyond anyone else, I was just, you know what? I think if you set your mind on something and you work hard at it, then I think anyone can do anything. So I always had that belief, if I work hard at something and I have a belief in it, then it'll happen. - Speaking of journey and kind of going into another dimension, I mean, you definitely took this VivaBook into another dimension and I'm so excited about it, and I look forward to everyone else checking out this and your art. So thank you so much for joining us. - Well, thank you so much for having me, it's been a pleasure. - Yeah. This is so fun. - At this little mini lobster convention. - Is there anything else you wanna let them know or where they should find you or where they should - Well, I did, I brought a small gift for you as well. - Did you? - But I didn't know whether we need to have it in there, but- - I mean, we might as well. - Well, first of all, just to go with your ASUS pen holder. - No way! - A little lobster figure. - Look at this. - And then also, this is actually for Libby the Lobster. - Oh, I have to give it to Libby next time I see her. - Yes. - Okay. - As part of the Lobster fraternity. Yes. - Okay, I was gonna say- - Serious lobster bling. - Because your chain was so freaking cool. - See. - I'm the cardinal lobster and you're sort of the gold- - Okay, you're gonna see me- - Queen lobster. - Walking around Los Angeles with it. Okay, well, I mean, I have to give it to Libby. Not, this is not for me. - Yes, you can share it. - This is so cool. - Yeah. - Oh wow, this is, like, the best day ever. Thank you so much. Do you wanna let them know where they can find you online? - You have to come check out the metaverse of Lobsteropolis in Decentraland, ideally through the ASUS, the collaborative lobster laptop, and yes, so check out Lobsteropolis, and also our project Lobstars, I think it be really fun for you guys to see the crazy world of Lobstars. - This is so exciting, oh my gosh. Well, thank you so much, I'll give you a high five. - Claws, high claws. - Like- - Clawfive. - Is this a claw, is that right? - Highclaw. (Justine laughs) A highclaw, yeah. (energetic upbeat music) - I had so much fun interviewing Philip about his art and his collaboration on this VivaBook 13 Slate OLED, so now I am even more excited to do a little customizing of my own with all of these really cool stickers. I did get a little head start, so I have a few stickers here already but I need to put all of these onto the actual keyboard. So I am just so excited to put these stickers on. Let's go. Oh no, what have I done? I didn't mean to do that. Oh no. (laughs) (chill music) (paper whooshing) The good news is these aren't super sticky so they're very easy to put on, I was worried for a second that this was gonna be very difficult, it's actually not. (chill music) We did it, we did it, all of the keys are covered and they look incredible. I've still got a few more stickers here, so I think I might just put this little eggy right here. I also think that I wanna switch out this little yellow mesh for the red, because why? Because we can. Let's pop off our little charms and let's see how this works. Snap our little charms back on. I love the red, this looks great. There you go. Hold on to my stylus. So here's what it looks like, and this is the removable stand. This is just magnetic. And, oh, look at that, a little surprise lobster. (laughs) There's so many surprises, you just never know what this laptop is gonna bring to you. And this is just magnetic, so this snaps right on to the back which allows you to put it in different positions. Right up here's your fingerprint sensor and the power button, so this is a nice little one-touch login which is super easy and convenient. And, oh my goodness, even the actual desktop background, when you start this up, it even has a Philip Colbert look to it. We've got the eggs, we've got our little lobster. Now, this is a magnetic keyboard as well, this pops right off, just like so, so you're able to use this as a tablet, or if you wanna use the keyboard you just snap it back on and extend a little back hinge, and you're now in laptop mode. I really love 2-in-1 devices like this because there are times when I'm watching content and I don't even need a keyboard, and I can just detach this, just like so, and I can use this as a tablet, and it's nice too because I can even take off this back magnetic cover, so we don't even need to have this on. It is kind of cool because you can just flip it around and you can rotate it so that you can use it in different views, which is quite nice, but we're gonna flip it back around. We've got our little stylus here. So we need to connect our stylus and it's really cool because when you just pull this out, just like that, this will give you access to your USB-C port so that you're able to charge it and get it set up with your device. Another thing that is really cool is, I shared you guys this during the interview, but this is the little sleeve that you can use. And I love that this also has so many cool designs on it. It's very, very custom, and I promise you, there's not gonna be many people, if you walk into a coffee shop, that is gonna have the same laptop as you, so it is definitely a conversation starter. So let's see what it looks like inside of here. So inside here we've got two little sides, which is nice, because you can probably fit a few other things in there. Perfect fit. (zipper rasping) And there it is. I love this thing so much, it's so cool. (upbeat music) (zipper rasps) I didn't even see the bottom of the keyboard, look, it even has the little lobster Colbert logo on it too. How many secrets are hidden in here? How many things are on this laptop that I didn't even get a chance to even realize were on here? I don't know. If you guys wanna get more information about the VivaBook 13 Slate OLED I'll put a link in the description. A huge thank you to ASUS for partnering with me on this video, and a huge thank you to Philip for hanging out and chatting with me, and not only talking about his art but the thought process and creation that went into creating this VivaBook 13 Slate OLED. I am so excited to get a chance to play with this device more, and I'm even more excited that I got to give you guys this inside look at what went into actually creating this beautiful artistic masterpiece. This is so fun, and I hope you guys enjoyed this video, and I will see you guys in my next one. If you guys are new here, Hi, I'm Justine, welcome to my channel, thanks for watching.

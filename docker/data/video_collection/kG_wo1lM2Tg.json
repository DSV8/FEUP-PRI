    "transcript": "- The new Galaxy S9 confirmed in massive leak that will disappoint America. (Ominous music) Jonathan here. That is a title of a headline. I am not even kidding. As many of you know, the Galaxy S9 is getting closer and closer. And with that we are starting to see more and more leaks. But, what has been more interesting or at the very least more entertaining for me, is not the leaks themselves, but the headlines surrounding them. With that I picked a few of my favorites. The first of which has gotta be Samsung disappointing America. Can you imagine Samsung up at the keynote, doing their thing, This is the brand new Galaxy S9. And America's like, nah, I'm good. Or, could you imagine Donald Trump on some Twitter rant about the Galaxy S9. I could picture that Tweet in all caps. (Distorted voice) Disappointed at SamsungMobileUS. Wish it were fake news, but the rumors were true. America is disappointed. So that has me curious, what exactly about the Galaxy S9 is going to disappoint America specifically? And as we jump into the article, not but two words in, we are smacked in the face with a typo. \"One more....\" Once more, the world turns to the FCC certification team to find out about an unreleased smartphone. Today it's the US variant of Samsung's upcoming Android flagships, the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus models. The listing confirms the differences seen in previous Galaxy machines will continue with the S9 family. So one paragraph in and not the slightest hint or clue at what might disappoint America. You would think maybe the second or third paragraph would tell us. And nope, it essentially goes on to tell us that the International Galaxy S9 will feature an Exynos processor, while the US version, will feature a Snapdragon processor. In this case, the Snapdragon 845. Where the juicy hook comes in though, is that fourth paragraph: \"What the FCC doesn't tell us in this release is any more details over the rear camera. The assumption is that the S9 is getting a single lens and the S9 Plus a dual-lens camera. Neither can it answer the question over the availability or the otherwise of the leaked Super Slow Mo video which offers 4K Video at 120 frames per second. That is currently reliant on the code inside the Exynos 9 Series 9810 chipset- will the US chipset be able to offer the same feature?\" And that essentially is the entire article. And one: I don't think super slow motion video or lack thereof is going to single handedly disappoint America, and two: like five more minutes of research would have showed you that the Snapdragon 845 will actually support slow motion video at 720p, up to 480 frames per second, which is amazing! (upbeat synth music) So here's the aftermath of the egg shown off 480 fps. Shout out to Rich for that very accurate throw. Only one egg was harmed in the making of this video. - I'm sorry. (chuckles) I'm sorry. - So next article. First off, little bit of lazy title: \"Samsung Leak Delivers Galaxy S9 Bad News\" Second off, there's so much negativity. They're banking off that guy whose excited for the Galaxy S9 to see that headline, and then click through to see why he's gonna hate his life over a smartphone. \"There's more because, well, there's always more. On Sunday almost every Galaxy S9 feature was leaked and it left us with only two pieces of missing information: the battery size, and the release date.\" The second paragraph is kind of amazing because it essentially says, the good news out of the situation is you're not gonna have to wait long to be disappointed. But from there, in a nutshell, it goes onto say that pretty much we've known for a while that the Galaxy S9 is going to be underwhelming. And the final punch to the face of disappointment is battery capacity. The Galaxy S9, based off those leaks is slated to have a 3000 milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S9 Plus, slightly higher at 35 hundred, but neither of those are really disappointing. Yeah, I'm sure like most of you out there, I also would have loved to see a higher number. Maybe 35 hundred on the Galaxy S9, 4000 on the S9 Plus, but again, one big thing to remember is with that Snapdragon 845, that's supposed to be up to 30% more efficient. Which in turn, will lead to better battery life. So really, I just wanted to focus on positivity as opposed to negativity. Especially in tech. For whatever reason, the media is programmed to feed and pray off scaring people about tech. But there's a lot to look forward to still, even with the Galaxy S9. So what has me excited for the Galaxy S9, aside from the Snapdragon 845 performance improvements non-disappointing slow motion, has gotta be one: stereo speakers. These are allegedly going to be tuned by a KG. And really, that's a marketing term, but nonetheless, having stereo speakers on a smartphone is a beautiful thing. And I'm excited to get that on the Galaxy S9, especially with the fact that they have such a beautiful display, with basically no bezels. Two: it looks like they fixed the award location of the fingerprint reader on the Galaxy S9. On the Galaxy S8, it was in this slightly award place where you never really felt comfortable with, and in turn made you not want to use it. But the Galaxy S9 allegedly, its in a much nicer location underneath the camera lens. So for me, that's actually a big deal. So based off that leak, that kind of confirms that Samsung is still opting to go with the fingerprint reader as their main form of security. Yet, you will be able to unlock your phone with your face. But its not going to be full fledged like Apple's gone with Face ID. Now I've talked about it before, what would be amazing to get a fingerprint reader built into the screen. Especially with how beautiful the Galaxy S8 was, and potentially the Galaxy S9 will be, we in fact actually saw that technology at CES this year. Vivo had a smartphone with the fingerprint reader built into the display. It looked amazing, but unfortunately it seemed to be not quite ready for prime time yet. It was a little slow, a little gimmicky. So I would not expect that on the Galaxy S9 or S9 Plus. Now what also has me excited for the Galaxy S9 is the alleged variable aperture, which will switch automatically from F2.4 to F1.5. So what that does is, when you're switching to F1.5, that lets more light into the lens. So its gonna help with low light photos. And also, its going to get you that beautiful blurred out background. Now this is not an apples to apples comparison. Yes, a smartphone sensor is much different than something like this camera you're looking at here, but here's a shot at F2.4. I purposely underexposed it, and then moving that to F1.4, you can see how much more light we have. So its cool that tech is that its going to be built into the single lens of the Galaxy S9. Now the Galaxy S9 Plus, that will allegedly have two lenses. That kind of gets confusing in terms of why I think the S Plus and the Notes series is a little bit weird. But that is a different discussion for a different day. Either way though you can see there is a lot to look forward to with the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Maybe if you're an S8 or S8 Plus, not so much. But I am excited to check this out. If you guys see any more ridiculous tech headline articles out there, let me with a comment down below. Hopefully enjoyed this video. If you did and you are feeling like being awesome, make sure to go Disappointed in America on that like button. This is Jonathan. I will catch you guys later.",

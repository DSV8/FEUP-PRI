    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - The best SUV that you can buy right now just happens to be electric. Okay, that's a pretty controversial statement. Let's zoom out a little bit with a maybe something we can all agree on. Like, electric cars are really expensive right now. That's just a fact I think we can all be on the same page about. There are basically no really, really good but also really, really cheap electric cars. But that's not for a lack of trying. Like they all know that that would kill like a $20,000 Tesla would do amazing. People would love to buy that. That's just not something that's possible with the prices and the way these businesses work right now. So when I start just with the best SUV that you can buy happens to be electric, that's actually a strategy. Let's zoom out a little bit. So gas cars have been evolving as you know. They've been maturing for years and years, and then now, this suddenly very new and very expensive technology comes along. That is an electric drive train with a huge battery. And so if you're a company that's going to add it to your car, it will become a more expensive car. So if you're a car company knowing that you want to start making electric vehicles, you have a very specific choice to make and we get to like follow this in real time and see them all try to do this. And that choice is do you want to compete at the highest end to be the best possible product or do you want to compete at the lowest end on price? And of course, business 101, if you've looked at these graphs long enough, you can understand that it just makes more business sense to try now when the technology is expensive, to compete on the highest end by just trying to make the best overall thing a no-brainer better product. And then in the future, when hopefully the price of the tech gets lower, we can also get those that are competing on price. That's why you're seeing cars that are expensive and electric and not a lot of cheap electric cars. I mean, there are some, but they're more expensive than their gas counterparts so they don't really make sense. So I guess then that brings us to the question is the Rivian R1S the best SUV in the world? Is it the best one you can buy? Well, it makes a pretty compelling case and I think it's really good. So if you've heard me talk about the truck before, the Rivian R1T, well then the name R1S makes a lot of sense because the front half is also R1, it's basically the same but the back half it trades the truck bed and the gear tunnel for a third row and all the benefits that come with a third row SUV form factor. So literally like if one of these pulled up behind you from this angle, you could not tell if that was the truck or the SUV that just took pulled up behind you 'cause it's identical until come to the side and you see the differences. Now I've been driving this brand new limestone colored R1S with the dark all terrain wheels for about a week now. It's been really solid. And I'm not even gonna highlight the front stuff 'cause it's basically the same. If you've seen the video, go back and watch the R1T video. It's the same truck, it's the same interior not a lot of interesting here. So let's just do the part that's different now. So let's take a look at the new and slightly improved interior. I'm in the second row right now. It's not as gigantic of a second row as like a Escalade or something gigantic like that, but in a lot of its competition, a lot of other three row SUVs, perfectly reasonable. And then behind me is the two seats of this seven seater. Which is smaller. It's better for kids. I wouldn't wanna be back there for a road trip, but it's fine. It's comfortable. You've got three kids, this is the type of thing in the US you see a lot of. And they've made a lot of subtle improvements even since the R1T that I first checked out. Obviously, you've got this huge glass roof up here at the top. There are slightly improved, better speakers. So the Meridian sound system that was in the previous one was fine, actually was really good. These I imagine are in roughly the same locations around the cabin, but they sound way better. And then still, material choices are great and there are events everywhere. Really solid builds. Nothing's creaking or scratching or squeaking or anything like that. This is nice. But of course, since it's three rows you wanna know how to get back to the third row. So let's do that. So there's a nice little button on the shoulder of the seat. You press that, it slides it forward on these rails and you can just pop right back here into the back seat. So look as predicted, not a ton of leg room. That's the seat right there. But you do have the vents back here. You also do have additional sunroof behind this little pillar here, which feels pretty nice. And you still have the entire trunk behind you. Spacious, airy. The light interior color helps of course. But yeah, that's the third row you didn't get with the R1T. Got a little cup holder back here. There's a speaker over here, the vents that you can point at yourself. And of course, on the other side, same deal. But I do wanna show you the trunk space 'cause think that's what's the most important, actually impressive. So of course, coming around to the back you still have that distinctive light bar across. You still have the blinkers on either side but now if you wanna open this lift gate here, it automatically will pop open like that. Which reminds me, I think a Jeep Wagoneers or something does this but you've got this sort of split gate. The top half opens, the bottom half stays closed. So if you've got stuff sort of rolling around in here, it's protected, it'll stay in. Then this button right here will pop this section down and it's got this little clever mechanism here that creates this sort of flat surface as it slides open. So now you can slide things in here and if you even want, you can use these locking and unlocking bits here that can slide around, lock into place and then tie things down to the other side. So if you've got something that's actually gonna stick out the back and you don't have enough room, that can help you out. Now I mentioned there's no gear tunnel but they even kept things like what you find in the truck bed, which is 1,500 watts of power. And you also have your air compressor back here. So all of that's still good. You still get to keep it. There's also this giant suber on the other side. But of course, this is gonna be the best true SUV, it's gotta do better than this, right? I mean all the seats are up that's fine for groceries I guess, but you already know it's electric. So that means there's even more space where there wouldn't be a gas tank. That's your first aid kit. This is I believe a charging kit or tire compressor. Yup, air compressor and then even more sub trunk space. But just go ahead and pull this up real quick and you'll find an even more gigantic area underneath where you could put a spare if you had one, but you don't. So you just have a ton more space where you could put groceries that won't slide around. And all of that is closeable and hideable under this flat surface. But I do think it's time to put the seats down when just so you can see how ridiculous it gets you put all that space down. Actually, this is kind of a sweet setup for me. If I don't have all of the seats needed at once, this is a sort of a giant flat area where you can fit a ton of stuff. I'll try to put numbers on the screen if there are any available to sort of contextualize how much that is. And then of course, I can't reach from back here, but you've got the buttons to pop the last two all the way down. I don't know why the headrests don't go down but when they do go down, it's just this gigantic massive amount of space. You could fit a bike or two back here and still have the front seats. It's pretty sick. So does having enough space for a mattress folded down make it the best SUV in the world? Not by itself, no. I mean the subtrunk space is great. You also can't forget about the front trunk which the R1T also had, and all the power tool stuff and all the space and the green roof and oh yeah, and then you gotta drive it, of course. Spoiler alert, this one's also really fun to drive which is probably not a shock to anyone who knew anything about the R1T because yes, this one is also a quad motor 800 horsepower missile in a straight line. It is absurd. It has no right being this fast being 7,000 pounds, but it is. So it is that fun again. Now the difference with this in the R1T is this one is a little bit of a shorter wheel base which means it does actually feel a little bit more nimble. It does, like when I corner or when I turn around on like a tight road like this, it does have a smaller overall turning radius, which is great. It also means if you're off-roading, you have a better breakover angle. All these things like most people will not use 75% of the capabilities of this vehicle. But if you do, that'll be really good to know. But again, just like in regular driving. I'm gonna be in all purpose mode because that's the typical mode you'll drive around in this thing and it drives like as good as any other SUV you could possibly imagine. Meaning, soft suspension, check. Firm acceleration if you want it but very relaxed and drivable all the rest of the time. Check. Regen, great stability control, great. No problems here. I couldn't expect much more. But now you can go into sport mode because if you're gonna spend a lot of money and you want it to be the best overall product, you can hear the air suspension literally lowering it as I go into the lowest overall setting and now the firmest most responsive mode. And it should be able to do both, right? If it's gonna be super expensive best overall product, it should be able to do both. And this is maybe the only place that I could possibly see anyone complaining, which is that it's not the sportiest thing in the world. It actually does drive a little bit looser than the R1T, which is interesting. This feels like a suspension thing but a lot of the accelerations and decelerations and the way it sways a little bit back and forward and going around turns, I feel a little bit extra swaying where I didn't expect it. You could argue that that's a weakness of this particular vehicle. Sure. But in literally 99% of the cases, especially with 99% of the drivers, nobody's actually ever gonna notice. So I've been really, really impressed and just having a lot of fun with it. I find it fine to just be in all-purpose mode most of the time. I also don't have that much off-roading in my daily commute or my normal use of this vehicle. So that's also fine. But if I did, I would have off-road mode. Snow mode's cool to have. And of course if I was towing something, I could pull that off to. The only thing I really tow is camera rig. So I wouldn't get this if I was towing a whole ton of weight. You should watch JerryRigEverything's video where he actually did test out how well it would tow. Actually he had an R1T for that video but I wouldn't get it for that either. But this just really fits the... That is nimble. It fits the adventure vehicle mantra. It really feels like it matches that description, adventure vehicle. So it's like, \"All right, Marques, if you're gonna call it the best, what is it competing against?\" Well, if you're just going straight six-row SUV, there's a lot of them out there. And America loves these things. There are the Toyota Highlanders or the I think that's a Honda pilot right there that's a three row. Lots of things that will all be cheaper than this, dramatically cheaper than this one. I think even the Escalade, the Cadillac Escalade will be cheaper than this Rivian R1S. But what this Rivian R1S does is it's able to offer all of the things that you want out of a vehicle like this and doesn't really skimp. So some of those might be really comfortable and well-built but they won't be as high tech. Or they might be really high tech and well-built, but they won't be as fast. You see what I mean? Now, this is the electric one too. So it's going to be the quietest, it's going to be the most responsive, the most efficient, it's gonna have the most space. And those are all benefits over all of the other six, seven seat SUVs. So I think if the mission is just like make a great thing that's just the most fun for the people who don't really have a budget and just wanna go crazy and have the coolest, best thing. I don't think that there's much else that I would take over this one. Like if you just pressed a button and I had three kids and I had to daily drive something that could go get groceries, take them all to school and just have a fun time in otherwise, this would be pretty good. Now the question for everyone else is like, okay, when is this experience? When is the electric vehicle experience that's actually fun and good going to come down in price? And that's just a tech and a development question. Keep in mind, this company also has to spend money on building a charging network and all the other things they're doing with the delivery vans. I keep seeing the Rivian delivery vans on the road all the time because there's an Amazon warehouse near here. So I feel like I see one like every single day. But you know, that's just one company. Rivian is doing stuff, Tesla's doing stuff. A bunch of other rock solid companies that have been making cars for a long time are all starting to make EVs and develop them and spend money and lower the price slowly. But we'll eventually get there. I actually talked to the CEO of Rivian, RJ, on my podcast this week. I'll link it below if you wanna listen to that. But we talked about the R2 platform. And what that's designed to do to be a lower priced version of this same experience. And if they're able to accomplish that in as short as a year from now, we're already moving in the right direction. So look, I really like this thing. Whether it's the best SUV ever or not, that'll be up for debate. I really like it and I've had a lot. I think people will just have fun with it in general, that's pretty obvious. But I am really impressed with this first effort from this particular company and I'm hoping they're able to continue because R1T and R1S really set the tone for what we can expect from Rivian in the future. And then hopefully we get a bunch of other cool EVs following in those footsteps and lowering in price sometime soon. Please. Okay, that's been it. Thanks for watching. If you wanna watch the podcast with RJ or even watch the autofocus videos that I make on all kinds of other thoughts on cars, I'll leave both those links below if you wanna check them out and I'll catch y'all in the next one. See you over there. Peace. (techno music)",

    "transcript": "so you can see at the top it says hello welcome to the dark net markets Bible for buyers so it's targeting people who want to buy things on through the dark net that are typically illegal this is one of the main places where I believe people go to get the onion addresses of of certain things they're looking for there we go so this has got some different stuff so we've got drugs and chemicals counterfeit items digital products fraud guides and tutorials jewels and gold card items software and malare let's try that one all right so this is the generic telegram account I just created yesterday just so we could take a look at some things what this is so let's see here forward from ransomware website data so this is breach data 100 plus gigabytes blog link so here they want you to use talks which is a protocol Tor protocol for communication encrypted communication and video where you can obviously communicate with them and get access to the full breach data. So Stephen I know you're going to show some really interesting stuff in this video but I have to put up a disclaimer just for everyone who's watching this isn't a video for everyone so we're going to be showing some stuff here that's you know not on the clear net and perhaps Stephen you can just jump in here and tell us you know some warnings. Yeah a lot of the stuff we're going to talk about is about upse SEC or operational security and how to as safely as possible go into the dark net but there's a lot of considerations uh ways that you get the websites to go to the onion sites which is the extension on the darket uh where you're getting those address is from you want to make sure they're as trustworthy as possible even though that's kind of hard you don't want to go digging where you shouldn't go digging it's actually not that easy to find things that you really shouldn't be looking at or probably don't ever want to see you do have to dig for that stuff so a lot of the things that are more superficial that we'll go through here are relatively easy to find but again you just want to be careful I'm not I wouldn't consider myself some darket expert I've gone there to do things like buy and analyze malware and look at exploit kits uh for stolen books or literature that I've written and things like that and especially one thing we'll talk about is called the dark net Market Bible which is a fantastic book about how to do good opsc unfortunately it was written for those doing criminal activity but obviously both sides need to worry about OBC so it's a really great resource for that but you will see things for sure that may be a little bit uncomfortable so be prepared for that. Really want to thank Heath and the team at TCM security for sponsoring this video Heath is really well known and respected in the cyber security space one of their top certifications is the PNPT certification Practical Network Penetration Tester I've gone through some of the training that Heath has provided for the certification and let me tell you Heath is a fantastic instructor fantastic course fantastic certification that is gaining a lot of attraction in the industry notice what's included 50 hours of on demand training you get lifetime access to this training if you enroll for the certification you get Hands-On Labs you also get one exam attempt plus one one free retake you've got 5 days to complete the exam 2 days to write a report you've got to present a live debrief and they have 24/7 365 course support. What's fantastic to see is that Heath and the team are expanding they're offering new certification that's now available is the Practical web penetration tester now these certifications may be difficult if you're new to the field so notice they have a Junior Penetration Test Cert that you can take the PJPT as well as a Junior Web Test Pen cert. What I really like about the training from Heath and his team is its videos you're not expected just to read a book video based labs this is a practical exam it's not multiple choice you are going to be pentesting using a real world lab scenario so Hands-On testing to make sure that you can actually hack now what's really nice is all of TCM's exams include the required training courses that you need to study to pass your exam and you have lifetime access once again to that training you don't have to pay a monthly subscription it's included in the cost. What's also great is there isn't an expiry date if you pay today you can take the exam next week or in 5 years you don't have to take it within a certain amount of time that's a huge benefit if you prefer live training versus watching videos TCM also have that offering. Now what's great is you can use my link below to get a 10% discount from TCM I really want to thank Heath for supporting my channel if you want to see what the training is about use the links below that take you to TCM's YouTube channel where you can see a whole bunch of training Heath has posted hours and hours of training on his YouTube channel which he can consume for free once again big shout out to Heath and the team for supporting my channel I interviewed Heath asked him a whole bunch of question that we receive from the community video link below as well. Hey everyone it's David Bombal back with the amazing Stephen Sims, Stephen great to have you back on the channel yeah great to be back David I'm glad it hasn't been too long this time. Yeah it was too long last time just for everyone who hasn't seen our previous videos I'll link them below Stephen is like one of the OG's in cyber security he's been doing this stuff for a long long time he's also one of the authors of this book Gray Hat Hacking but Stephen I'm really looking forward to this video we were discussing off camera about I've seen people talk about the dark web Deep Web all these terms and you know I've done lightweight in you know overviews of it but I'm hoping you can take us deep into the dark web or the Deep Web and excuse the puns there. Yeah not not too deep though but yeah yeah yeah there's some there's some nasty stuff on there right? Yeah yeah it's a interesting place I mean you it's funny because some people will define the dark dark web as it's it's the internet what do you mean there's no there's no secret you know it's just and also people say assume that everything on the dark net is owned by Feds you know the federal government so it's anybody going in there whether you're going in there for good or bad has to have good OPSEC so it's something we're going to talk about for sure. I'm glad you mentioned that because I think a lot of people would just think I can just start up tall and I can connect to to this and I'll be okay but perhaps you can explain you know what is tall and you mentioned some other operating systems and options um offline like Tails I believe so yeah what is OPSEC why is it important and you know how do I stay safe and you know what what what is it actually about yeah it's a big question right I mean one one of the challenges with going onto the dark net is like a big question people have is well how do I how do I find things how do I know where to look obviously on the Clearnet which we call the internet you can go and find links and they typically have onion extensions right so you find these onion pages instead of it's. onion and you never know what's going to come up so you you can't just believe that if find a onion address on the clear net which if you click on it you can't get there you have to be connected to Tor and that that what's going to be there is actually what it says would be there I mean there could be Mau there could be something illicit images there could be one of just countless things and a lot of these sites have a very short lifetime where there might be a onion site you see on the clear net or the dark net and when you go to it it's not there anymore it times out um that could be because of a DOS because there's lots of people out there Dossing you denial service yeah on onion sites depending on what they are like markets will attack other markets to try to shut them down um also a lot of them will have things like a canary where a canary you can kind of think of it as it's basically like a little it's like a timer almost where if the admin of that website of that onion site doesn't go in and do a check or reset it or do something and the canary expires then it kills the site because the the understanding might be that well something might have happened to that admin maybe they were arrested and we need to kill things to make it go away as quickly as possible but if they go in there and refresh it then it stays up but again a lot of them intentionally will only be spawned up only come alive for a short period of time and then if you want to get to that same site that you just got to on that prior onion address it's actually changed to a completely different address now and you kind of have to know how things are moving around in a lot of cases yeah Whonix and Tails are two of the most popular operating systems used to connect good thing about them is uh especially like I'm going to be using honix today it's configured in such a way where there's two virtual machines one of them is kind of like the proxy and that eally does it connectivity and the other one's your workstation so your workstation actually Network configured to go through that proxy VM which then connects into Tor and the Tor from a very high level they call it the the onion routing right it's kind of like um yeah imagine a giant mesh and by mesh I mean thousands of routers called Tor nodes and they're all just kind of meshed together connected to each other and when your data goes in it's getting bounced around so it goes into a an entry node and it gets bounced around all over the place before getting to the destination to try to make it really difficult to where if you were to get a hold of the entry node that that I connected into it's still not going to be easy for you to know where I went because of all that crazy routing going on uh same thing on the Tor exit modes so a lot of times law enforcement they want to get access to these nodes because they can see where people are going and it's another thing where OPSEC comes into place because if you want to dock somebody and you want to try to figure out hey how do I do a hum or OSINT on the dark net like how do I potentially determine who this person is how how can I reverse that back out we'll talk a little bit about that again as well but just connecting straight in the problem is that it's going to be easier for them to track you them being whoever wants to I mean well definitely you want to use VPN to connect in usually multihop I'll show you an example of that but a lot of these vpm providers will tell you that they they delete the logs they don't save the logs but you never know that right the more if you're going through multihop VPN and not just through a single location it makes it just more difficult if I go through Ecuador and then from Ecuador to Thailand and then into Tor it's gonna again add layers of complexity. So you wouldn't recommend me just installing Tor on my Windows computer or my Mac and then just connecting directly to the dark web that way. Yeah I mean again I'm speaking from an OPSEC perspective so I'm not trying to say or teach hey if you want to do bad things this is how you go about doing it if you truly have no illicit intention going into it it it's just um one it's not a good look cuz some people whether you like it or not even if you're going on to it for good purposes some people just truly believe in uh privacy right and and they don't think that anybody should be able to track what you're doing and it's again privacy so but if you're going in and you're just again what dep what your intentions are like why you're going in because your ISP will certainly be able to see that your IP address at home connected too into into the dark net um and so obviously if you if you're okay with that not information being available to someone then then it's it's fine but again you still want to worry about well who is the owner of that node that I came in on because if I'm using my raw IP address then they can figure out who I am and trace it back so it's just a lot of considerations. And why would you choose Whonix rather than Tails or doesn't it matter is just personal preference? Yeah I mean honestly they're both great operating systems there's something it it's funny because some people will say well how you know how do you have all this knowledge um about working on the dark that you must be doing bad things and that's not the case at all like we're actually at at the Sans Institute there was a new course that was written specifically on human and and I was sent on the dark net and that can be used by law enforcement so in my career I've absolutely worked directly with law enforcement on different activities um like for example one time I was in Australia this is a long time ago but the Australian federal police I think it's AFP they were working on a case and it was unfortunately it was a case and the individuals who were doing that criminal activity were sneaky to where they were hiding illicit illegal inside legal images meaning of age images so their assumption was that if law enforcement were to come in and and seize and acquire your assets and they looked at it they would just see a bunch of of age people which is again legal technically who would think that someone used Steganography to actually hide an illegal image in a real or legal image and that's again that's sneaky but that's a kind of people you're dealing with yeah there's the it's easy for law enforcement in many cases to get the lwh hanging fruit people that don't good don't have good opsc but the people who do have good OBC and that's operational security uh who really understand privacy and cover their tracks and and never get lazy that's the big one is people become complacent oh I haven't been caught in 5 years so I'm just going to be complacent and then that's where they start um get themselves caught up but in that particular case the law enforcement were asking hey do you know of any tools that would help us one identify if a host file has been stenographically altered and again steganography for those of you who don't know is when you typically encrypt something some thing that you want to hide and then you embed it into a host file and there's different techniques like substitution stego and injection stego and generation stego but it's all about taking something that you want to hide encrypting it and then embedding it into a host file and that host file can be an MP3 file it can be a JPEG it could be pretty much anything that the stego tool was written to support so what law enforcement was looking for is a way to take these these images and scan them to see if there's a signature to indicate that it was steganography altered so that they could potentially extract the hidden file out of it it's still encrypted but if they can extract it out then they can use you know crypto tools to try and and crack the password um to to to get in and there was a tool at the time I think it's still around called stabilizer AS or SS there's a couple different ones and uh it's kind of like a law enforcement grade tool to do that and they were able to use that which is pretty cool. So I mean you've been doing this for a while Stephen I take it. Yeah well I mean it's obviously cyber security and hacking and stuff like that vulnerability research is my specialty area but I've I've taught and have a background all over the place and you know it's just one of those things where if your expertise can lend a hand to someone working on a good case then absolutely you want to use your powers for good. Yeah I mean I think it's important to emphasize that you've been doing this for a long time many years you've got a lot of experience in this field and uh you can give a lot of new people tips on how to do it ethically and not get into trouble so I really appreciate you taking us down this rabbit hole because it's literally that right um You can spend so much time going down this sorry go on. Yeah and it is questionable I mean it's one of the things one of the considerations you have to have when going into to it is and that is into the dark net is that you may inadvertently stumble across something that you did not want to see and it doesn't always have to be what I was just describing before it could also be hey you come across a site where people are selling narcotics um come across a site where people are talking about other types of criminal activity like putting a hit out on someone right and there's been plenty of cases there and it is true that a lot of these marketplaces and sites that you find may be owned by law en enforcement of some type or intelligence agency which makes perfect sense if you were working for law enforcement and you could create a market place and convince Sellers and we'll we'll take a look at a Marketplace when we go on onto the dark KN here soon but if you can do that as law enforcement and convince sellers to sell through you then you're going to start learning a lot about those individuals now even if you do that it doesn't mean that you're going to be able to figure out who they are because if they're smart they're going to use the right crypto currency like Monero to try to make it really difficult to detect who they are there was a Marketplace actually um where the individual who owned the market was out of somewhere in Asia I forget exactly which country but he was back and forth between Asia and the United States and he created a Marketplace for specifically for selling illicit drugs and narcotics and what a lot of these guys do and I'm trying to be really careful with my words because I have my own choice words I would like to use to describe a lot of these people um they they want to make right that's you've got these brilliant web developers a lot of times that really good at security they good OPSEC and they think hey I can I can work in a 9 to-5 position making 150,000 a year or I could create a Marketplace and use my powers for that and I can make millions of dollars and retire in a year so what they do is build these marketplaces they attract sellers the sellers go on and they list their products just like on eBay or something and then buyers go on and they look at the products of all the different Sellers and it's just like going on to online store you you click what you want you put it in your shopping cart you can see the rating system of these individuals because they can obviously make themselves look like a a a better buyer someone you trust that actually going to deliver you good products versus somebody that doesn't have any reviews and you put it into the shopping cart and and you buy it now here's where the question comes in in this particular case that I'm talking about the owner of the market place lied and said you if you enter your clear text data like let's say I'm buying something from you David and you had a you had a store front and I would want to I have to send you my my address my mailing address or an address so you can send the product to me I typed my address in and there's a little thing there and it says don't worry like we're we're encrypting this for you so we use pgp keys and you would have uploaded your public key I would have uploaded my public key and what it's telling me is that if I type in my mailing address and hit send that it will use your public key to encrypt my address so that technically or theoretically only the only person that can decrypt that is you because you're the only one that has your private key but what they weren't doing is encrypting they weren't encrypting so if you were smart about it and this is a perfect example of OPSEC never trust someone else that says they're going to encrypt your stuff for you yeah instead I can take your public key I can encrypt my address and then anybody in the middle in the marketplace wouldn't be able to decrypt it unless you're private he was compromised so this individual um they did what's called an exit scam which I'm sure if you were around during the whole crypto boom that happened in last couple years you've heard of rug pools and exit scams and in this case what the marketplace owners do is they'll wait till they build up enough credibility with the community they'll wait till there's a ton of money in Escrow because that's one of the big things that happens when you buy something you put your money into Escrow in the market and the marketplace holds those funds until will you send me something and then I go in and say I received it or a timer expires then the escrow gets released and you get your money the marketplace might take 10% or so but that's how they make their money it makes sense yeah what they did was waited until there was so much money in escrow like millions of dollars in escrow and then they did an exit scam they took all of that money all that crypto they took it for themselves and they released the escrow to themselves not only that they came and extort it afterwards everybody had known at this point that they did an exit scam and it was in the news and uh they then went and extorted the buyers and the sellers and they said hey all that data that was encrypted that we told you we were encrypting for you we weren't it's 100% in clear text and if you don't pay us $10,000 we're going to release all of this information to law enforcement and from what the looks of it is lots of people did pay but the good thing about it is law enforcement got him he was arrested I think it was it was April may he was arrested and he's never getting out of prison there were videos found on him of him on YouTube where he actually did a presentation and wrote a tool that's an anti- denial of service tool for dark net marketplaces so that was like clearly a direct tie this this individual because denial service is a big problem in the dark net. Yeah I'll I'll put some some information up on screen for anyone who's interested but it's it's it's a it's a good read actually um I remember reading a bit about this um I mean I think the joke was it's one thing to steal from people but then to like try and get more money out of criminals is definitely not a good idea yeah I would I would love to know at what at what point they knew who he was because obviously a lot of times law enforcement might know who someone is but they continue to allow the activity to move forward so that they can collect more and more evidence against to make the conviction even stronger but uh I just would love to know exactly when they knew who he was like was it before he tried to extort or after or maybe someone who was an admin on his Marketplace snitched on him for doing that like who knows what it was but that's just think that's pretty wild and I'm so glad he got caught. But it's it's it's a coursey tale right that the places that you go on the dark web are not nice places for lack of a better word uh you have to be really careful. There there there are some useful resources there but yeah for the most part sadly from what I've seen it's it's it's not good stuff. It's even we've been talking long enough now I think a lot of people are going to want to see a demo so um hopefully you can show us like your setup and then show us some places on the dark web and you know show us why we have to be careful. Yeah for sure I I think we should talk about some OPSEC considerations to begin with and what you should do before you connect in and then we'll go ahead and connect in and and look at some things I've I downloaded a fresh copy of Whonix before we we did that did it yesterday actually just put it together so everything was ready so this is a fresh copy of fix I went in and set a couple things up so it's going to make things go along a little faster but I will talk to them one interesting thing there's a lot of interesting things but one is that there's this there's this paper and it's called the DNM Bible Dark Net Marketplace Bible and I will show it to you it's targeting people who are buying illegal items and then one of the scariest things with that is people buying stuff like narcotics and that's one of the reasons these marketplaces are horrible is so many of them have and they're being sold as one thing but they have something else in them and obviously there's like thousands and thousands of Overdose deaths due to that so this but this DNM Bible it is a really good document for anyone who wants to go under the dark net as well as law enforcement to understand what people are doing to try to protect themselves all about OPSEC connectivity and everything else you should factor into consideration so yeah let's um first talk about a couple basic things I'm just going to quickly go ahead and show an example of a VPN I know you all who are listening to this likely know what VPN is but here's just one example the only thing I want to show you here is that if you're going to connect in as David and I were discussing before you typically don't want to just go straight from your home IP address right to a Tor entry node you want to use the right operating system you want to use VPN and the reason for that is even if you're not doing things that are against the law it's not a good look some people are going to judge you no matter what if you are going into the dark net because maybe they don't understand exactly what it's all about plus some of us work on the dark net and try to do things like helping law enforcement with doxing upset and all of that when you connect in the Tor entry node like think about you know you're at your house you've got your wireless access point you get an IP address from your provider and that IP address is typically over DHCP so we don't always have that address but usually it's for a long time like i' I've had the same IP address for a very long time even though DHCP is on because it keeps refreshing it so it's going to make it pretty easy for the provider the internet service provider or anyone else who knows my that's my IP address to trace back where I go so imagine if I were to connect from my house to the next hop and that next hop might be the ISP router before I go further into the internet what we're doing here by using VPN is connecting to another location to make it look as if that's my source so it's going to be harder to trace back a lot of the VPN providers say that they delete the logs but we don't know if that's true or not right there's no way for us to validate that some countries may have laws that say that they're not allowed to do that so maybe they can do it in some countries but not in others this example here is just called hide me VPN and one of the things you want to look at it here is when you click on locations you can see that there's all these different country options there and some of them show that they're better speeds than others there are some countries known to have more lax hacking laws than other countries so depending on what you're doing that could be a consideration one thing I'd recommend is using multihop multihop means that we are connecting from our home address to another location like Ecuador and then we hop again we go from Ecuador over to France and then from there we go into the Tor entry node so see how we're making it more and more difficult to trace back even from outside of the dark net that tracing it back to me it's more challenging for folks so VPN is always a good option I would definitely recommend of course reading up on which VPN providers do in fact claim to delete their logs and look for good reviews about those providers or people can hopefully somehow validate that but at the end of the day you don't really know but it's just a consideration. I got to ask you though your recommended VPN or list of VPN's or would you prefer not saying. Yes so around recommended is is people you trust who have set up their own and not going through a provider but that's obviously now it's between you and other people but if you really do trust these people you can probably trust them more you can trust some company that you know nothing about. yeah I like that I mean it's um there's so much so much hype on VPNs and so much like false advertising on VPN it's hard to know what's what's actually true. Right so I'm going to go ahead now I'm just going to share my screen and we'll take a look at just the Whonix page and the Tails page so this page here this is the Whonix page I'm specifically looking at the virtual box uh link off of it you can download and actually I'll show you that if we click download you can see the different operating systems out there that are supported sometimes one might be listed and when you go to click on it it's not actually available yet it says they're working on it what I'm using here though is a virtual box image for Mac OS so virtual box you can download that for free so that's another thing you're going to need is VMware or virtual box I don't think that they make a version for Fusion of Whonix yet but they do for virtual box and virtual box is free so that's great Whonix is free they'd like you to donate to the project of course you can see that up in the top right but if is a free tool this one comes in two separate pieces meaning that you're actually downloading two operating systems two Linux operating systems when you when you download it so you would download the package and then when you bring up virtual box and you go to Startup Whonix there's going to be two operating systems one's going to be the Gateway and the other one's going to be the workstation itself the Gateway is all the both are actually already preconfigured and set up for you and the workstation that you actually are going to be interacting with is communicating through the Gateway VM that they provided to you so all the networking sorted it's acting like a proxy to you and on that system the the Gateway system it's already preconfigured to connect to uh Tor so to get into the onion R Network and you don't have to worry about it but you still want to do that VPN step first Tails is another one I've used Tails before it should just be a single image but uh it's also very popular and trusted operating system there are other ones out there and certainly you can download you can create build your own Linux box and put Tor on it and have that same level of privacy if you know what you're doing this is the good thing about using one of these operating systems one of the main things that you need to keep in mind is that they are minimal Linux box all those noisy chatty protocols and things that might make it easy for someone to to detect you that's all turned off all those services are stopped there's no bloat on it only what you need to be able to do things like connecting into Tor is on that system so it's a lot easier than trying to configure all that stuff yourself from just you know a random Linux VM . So tails is one virtual machine right with who next hits two virtual machines that you have to. I believe Tails still one yes I haven't used Tails in a little while I've been using Whonix for quite a while now. And so just so that I can understand this because I'm always a bit slow your VPN is running on your uh bare metal operating system so Mac a or Windows and then you can connecting by the VPN and then you've got uh these two virtual machines running in Virtual box and they are connecting through the VPN onto the the dark web. y yep exactly and one thing uh you just made me think of I wanted to point out as well you always want to encrypt the drive that you're storing your Whonix or Tails operating system on just because if that gets compromised and someone's able to get onto it obviously they can mount it and they can see it so if you encrypt it and most people put it on an external media so like some solid state drive with encrypted operating system on there you have to mount it before you can lo it up again it's all about OPSEC you just it doesn't mean you're up to no good it just means that you're following good OPSEC so that you know exactly what someone would be able to find out like you could put your very sensitive records on this operating system and if it's encrypted you don't have to worry as much about it right as long as your past phrase and stuff are are pretty strong. So the the the encryption that you're using is that just like part of the like Windows or Mac OS or you using something separate to encrypt um I use external encryption so a lot of I mean there used to be stuff like VeraCrypt and all but then that got we got told years ago that's not safe anymore and obviously there they other options out there a lot of the SSD drives or other types of drives that you buy come with some proprietary encryption and as long as you've done an assessment of that you feel that it's a strong uh encryption option there's no back doors in it then you know it's it should be good it's a layered defense control you never want to put all your eggs in one basket you don't want to rely on one defensive capability you know you have that uh the each complimentary of one another to where if somebody compromises one layer they can't do too much damage okay so we just took a look at the operating systems Whonix and Tails we talked about VPN we talked about virtual box we talked about encrypting so now that all of these items are set up let's just assume that we are multi hop VPN to in now and we actually want to bring up the operating system and connect in what I'll show you real quick right now is just what what virtual box looks like so this right here you can see the Whonix Gateway and then the Whonix workstation and those are the two that I was describing before so right now I've got them both powered up they're running obviously uh the default passwords and everything are are there and you want to change that stuff like the first thing you want to do when you boot this stuff up is go in and change to passwords at to something that you'll remember it's it's more more OPSEC I'm not going to go over you know OPSEC to death but like obviously if if it's some unique password and credentials that you're using and you're worried about remembering them then encrypting those and putting them on some other Drive where if someone were to compromise that drive they wouldn't be able to recover that stuff it's all about just again covering your tracks having good OPSEC but these are the two operating systems so right now we're just going to go ahead and jump over to the workstation. When you import those into virtual box it sets up the I think you said it already but just to confirm it sets up the bridging and everything so you don't have to worry about that you just import them and and you're good to go is that right? Right everything is set up for you you don't have to do anything that's one of the great things about downloading one of these preconfigured operating systems all right so what we have now I've already brought up a command prompt and over here on the right we've got a Monero wallet we're going to talk about Monero in a bit so that's why that's there and there's some basic things you want to do so first thing people want to do is like oh I want to go and and start looking around on on the dark net how do I know what to look for that is a really big question and you have to assume that anything listed on the clear net may be intentionally misleading some of it's going to be correct and accurate some of it's not so there's a bit of risk you're taking on anytime you go to an onion site and if you've ever seen an onion address they're typically very long strings with a onion extension there are some wellknown locations where it it again doesn't mean it's safe but it's known that these specific things reside at those locations and they tend to be more static meaning it's always there there's this thing called dread which is kind of like Reddit for the dark net it has all types of criminal activity on it um not all criminal activity but a lot of criminal activity there's whole sections talking about drugs there's sections talking about hacking ransomware there's all these different um subreddits subd dreads as you call it not subreddits but sub dreads on it and and that's typically at a static location and that thing I mentioned before called the DNM Bible that is a document that is all about OPSEC and we'll take a look at that for a little bit here here as well because even though it was written by people to clearly when you look at it to very carefully do things that if you were to get caught you would likely be arrested it's helping those people perform those actions but because it's all about OPSEC t it's a really useful tool for anyone who wanting to understand OPSEC so what I'm going to do is bring up the Tor browser and right up here at the top you could see to little tiny icon I'm just going to click on that that's the Tor browser and here it is so I put some yesterday when I downloaded this I got some links ready so that way uh again we move along a little bit faster but you can see one of the things there is Introduction DNM Bible we're going to click on that in a moment one thing that uh you typically want to do so be me being a vulnerability researcher browsers getting compromised most often it's been the result of JavaScript vulnerabilities you zip to free and type confusion bugs it's all that interface of JavaScript to C++ libraries underneath and so disabling JavaScript is typically one of the first things you want to do because you're going to these sites that aren't oftentimes not very friendly and obviously if they can get JavaScript to execute they're going to try and do anything from scraping your box and trying to steal your crypto coins to who knows what else right to installing crypto miners on you so if you go up to the URL and you type about colon config this takes you to to this page it says proceed with caution accept the risk and in here I'm just going to type in JavaScript and you notice javascript.enabled is false that's because I changed that from the default that's why you've got that little back arrow over to the far right to reset it disabling JavaScript and there might be more than just this location where you want to make JavaScript changes so again if someone's trying to exploit your browser this is reducing the attack service of that browser significantly and actually some sites that you go on will say you can't come here because you have JavaScript enabled on your browser so you have to go and turn it off so that might be something depending on what you're trying to do you have to turn on and off at times but right now I'm going to click on this link for the DNM Bible this is a very well put together document as I've said many times all about OPSEC so see how it's um it's quite slow right now that's a common thing when visiting onion sites because of all the latency introduced via VPN and all the routing around again there's a lot of times denial of service attacks going on the denial service attacks no one knows typically who they really are a lot of times it's one Marketplace attacking another Marketplace to try to knock them offline you can see we just uh failed here but to try to knock one offline so that they get more business sometimes it might be law enforcement or political activists who are out there trying to take down an onion site so you never know what the reason or purpose as what I'm going to do here is um I'm going to try a couple other sites and if those sites don't work as well I might have to reset the VM so we can connect back in because you know sometimes things happen so let me click on this uh Dark Net link directory and see if this gets us anywhere okay so we just connected in like I said it can take a while for various reasons this is the DNM Bible so you can see at the top it says hello welcome to the dark net markets Bible for buyers so it's targeting people who want to buy things on through the dark net that are typically illegal so it wasn't written for a good reason you know good purposes but again it orients itself on OPSEC best practices so that is something that anyone can learn from someone who just wants the better OPSEC in general from a security perspective to law enforcement or intelligence trying to understand how people go about trying to hide what they're doing because the better you understand all of the OPSEC techniques that someone may take into account when they're doing something the more you can look for gaps or opportunities because people do become complacent after they've been getting away things for a while and that's what a lot of times we count on is that someone makes a mistake what I've seen people get docked before on the dark net to the clear net by doing something as simple as using an old Xbox gamertag from 10 years ago as a username on a Marketplace on the dark net and that connection right there bam they've got you right I mean that might not be enough to prosecute but they they're probably have a good idea that it's probably you and they can go and start doing more investigation they've narrowed that down now so those little details never reusing the same usernames and watching how you speak I've seen it also where someone who talks a certain way and there's their grammar that allowing that you to be mapped back to someone else um there's all kinds of ways that it can be done so the better you do your OPSEC the more likely it's going to be or more difficult it's going to be for someone to be able to determine who you might be. I was just going to say this for everyone watching we do not advocate doing anything illegal this is for educational purposes only and you know stay on the right side learn these things to look after your privacy but only do the only do the right things like Stephen you're a great example of that you got all this knowledge you could do it for bad but you do it for good. yeah exactly the same thing with uh malware Dev and an exploit development you can use your powers for good or you can use your powers for bad reasons and the unfortunate thing I don't know if it's unfortunate but like you have to think the same way to be a good pentester good red teamer you have to emulate adversary so you really to understand the way they go about doing things the things that they do so that you can truly emulate them and uncover the same types of opportunities that they would if they were attacking you so absolutely but you can see here it's broken up into a bunch of sections we're not going to go through the whole thing but the operating system it's going to tell you stuff about Tails and Whonix right there and Qubes or Whonix on Qubes so some of the things we're already talking about I'm going to click on PGP because this is an important one where if you don't understand cryptography very well it's something that you need to get proficient at just and it doesn't have to be advanced it has to be to the level of can you explain what asymmetric crypto is and how it works like how would a dippy Hellman key exchange work meaning to the level of if David gives me his public key I can encrypt something with that public key and only David's private key can decrypt that and vice versa if he encrypts something with his private key which you almost do anyone can decrypt that with his public key which is out there in the world potentially the only time you typically use your private key to encrypt something is when you're doing digital signatures like things like non-repudiation where if I take a message and I want to be able to prove to David or he wants to be able to validate that the Integrity of that message is intact I would take a hash of that message I want to send David I would encrypt the hash with my private key and then send the encrypted document that was encrypted with David's public key to him he would decrypt it with his private key then he would take my public key decrypt the hash of the message run the hash algorithm against his decrypted copy of the message and if those two things map we've got Integrity right so to that level of encryption is what it's important to understand because a lot of people misunderstand that yeah it's easy to get confused because there's symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography actually that might be a good video sometime talking about crypto yeah I think we should do it yeah but symmetric key cryptography is a single Key System we encrypt and decrypt with the same key asymmetric key cryptography is a two key system and yeah we'll get into that sometime but just make sure you understand cryptography and we're going to be using I'll show you some examples today we're probably going to be forced to use cryptography coming up here soon because some of the marketplaces require that you are doing that you have to give them your public key that you generate they'll encrypt something with your public key they want to prove that it's you by you showing them that you were able to decrypt that message with your private key that you are the owner of that key pair so we'll get into that a little bit more but this does get into some pretty good details on encryption and does teach you it goes through the steps of creating a key pair importing a public key I'm going to demonstrate this stuff for you though so that's I mean I don't think we're going to spend any more time here on the dark net um Marketplace Bible but you can see kind of what this document is and and why it's important it even gets into cryptocurrencies and which ones are safer than the others Monero is always the answer Monero is the safer choice for purchasing something using crypto without it being easily mapped back to who it is it's if someone's able to determine who bought something using Monero it's because that person had poor OPSEC like you never would buy something from your Monero wallet in a crypto Marketplace you would download it to a cold storage wallet and you would use that and you would generate new Monero addresses for each transaction like that's the type of OPSEC stuff that people are doing to make it more difficult to trace things back to them and when it gets into things like shipping that's it's crazy to read if you go and read through that it's an you know on your own time it's an interesting read because it's talking to people about how to use uh what's it called a drop a dead drop or something like that you can use like an abandoned house down the road and you get it shipped there and like you go pick it and how to like what not to do what to do it's just it's quite interesting read but that's not useful to us right now all right so um the next thing let's take a look at is going to be dread and let me see if it takes us here all right great so we're in dread access queue it says your estimated weight time is less than three minutes one thing I'll tell you I don't think dread has one but some of the hardest captures you've ever seen in your life are on these websites you'll see some I imagine coming up here soon they can be frustratingly annoying. And that's just a human been right yep because they're trying to prevent denial service attacks exactly yeah so here's dread so this is the dread Marketplace and or not Marketplace but the dread forums this is similar to Reddit as I said before if you look over onto the right there's some suggestions and you can see Dark Net markets harm reduction noobs OPSEC Monero Recon but there's also that's not all of them there are ton of them there are ones specifically on hacking so you can go into that location in ransomware all kinds of diff different types of criminal activity surrounding different areas in in life this is one of the main places where I believe people go to get the onion addresses of of certain things they're looking for so for example if you click on this dark net markets link there going to be a lot of different marketplaces and remember a Marketplace is just a a web website that allows sellers to sign up they have to be vetted by the owner of the Marketplace allows the sellers to sign up and then they get their own storefronts just like on any regular Internet site and then buyers can go on and create accounts and buy things from these sellers there's rating systems and all that there's escrow all that stuff's included but there's also a lot of things around like data breaches and other things that you can find on here I said earlier one of the big questions is well how do I know what sites are the legitimate sites that I'm trying to get to and at the end of the day it comes down to who do you trust dread is known I believe believe not to be compromised so people do trust dread there's millions of users on dread which is kind of scary in its own right like if you click on if you look at here Dark Net markets there's 131,072 results and these are all just going to be forms of people talking like how to spread your malware look at that I mean and in dread hacking so it's in a hacking Forum game crack software cracks gambling Bots cracking tools I mean you'll never run out of stuff to read on here there's a lot of articles about different people who got caught and were arrested for different things why not just create a good working ransomware um a lot of people are asking like this guy here if you can see it it says I will create a custom Ransom custom ransomware so a lot of these people might be scammers though so if that's somebody let's say I wanted to write ransomware and I wanted to sell it to you so you could go do bad things and steal money from people I could scam you I could tell you hey I'm I'm a good developer I'll show you some proof and then yes send me send me the money and I'll send you to Ransom and I just never send it to you so scammers scamming scammers happens all the time but a lot of times in fact there are people who are selling there's um a thing called ransomware as a service and it's been all over the dark net for many many like over 10 years now there are these developers who write ransomware typically in something like cshark.net or whatever and what you can do is simply instantiate an instance of that ransomware and you can customize it so you go on the website you message with the owner of the ransomware who made it and what they'll do is they'll take a percentage of each person's system you infect who does in fact pay so they may take 20 30% you get the other 70 80% to go to your wallet for every victim who actually pays the ransom and they'll lets you use your own wallet addresses you can obviously customize what you want the ransomware to say and then it's your job to be the mule and go out and try to infect systems meanwhile the ransomware as a service developer just collects the income from that so that's been a well-known thing for a long time now so I'm just going to click on dread hacking to see what kind of topics people are talking about in here right now so you're going to see a lot of stolen um courses and books and things like that because people just think everything should be that way on the dark net so ebooks to learn cyber security see here full courses you know you go on there you see all kinds of courses from different providers and it can be frustrating you know if you're somebody who went through the trouble of writing a course because people will say well information's free out there everything should be free yeah all this stuff is free you could learn enough to become a doctor with online materials but when someone takes the time to to go through and put together material and curate it in such a way and explain it and write Labs that's a huge undertaking I've written I've written books and courses and it it's months and months and months of work so going and stealing that is not a great thing. Interesting flipper zero even made it. yeah flipper zero actually I'm not joking I saw your name on here David oh did you just yesterday yeah we but you could see things uh how to get access to CCTV so a lot of it just people up to no good you know fuel cars just stealing different things how to steal Udemy courses need need hacker form to hire a hacker like all kinds of good stuff but yeah I saw your name yesterday and I didn't even search for but let's check this out oh you got a lot of results well let's see if it's all right let me do a search what video David Bombal see that you went a bit quick I I missed that say that again right there it's just said what video David Bombal like it's just it's the funny thing is your your name will be all through here watch we see oh just one on that page but like yeah I saw a pop up and a couple spots was pretty funny I was like hey I should show D that'd be great well.I was going to say yeah it's interesting right but that's what comes with the territory of creating YouTube videos right your name goes out there and people watch your videos so it's expected exactly um there's this thing called the uh dark net link directory and this right here if I remember correctly is all the valid links to different Marketplace and other sites on the dark net so as I said before some sites are going to be static because they want them to be static what ends up happening though is a lot of this stuff gets dalala service attacks against that so a lot of markets or a lot of sites in General on the dark net will create custom links for their users because the main links will be targeted for attack so they're these developers are some of the best you can find the way the clever ways in which they come up um to to stop and prevent dos attacks from working and other attacks it's pretty wild but like here if we go on to um okay let's try going on to a site and there's a few other things I want to show you as well I'm not sure which which one so some of these sites are going to be purely selling narcotics other ones are going to be selling hacker tools and malware and narcotics I I've not found one that just sells hacker tools a lot of times what happens is people are using telegram to communicate different onion sites to go to or ways in ways you can get in contact with people who have access to data breach data and they want to sell it to you but let's go ahead and um let's check one out here I'm going to click on all right so we go to Abacus Abacus is a market place and you can see we've got like nine links here to choose from because a lot of times one won't work so I'm going to actually click on two different links and hopes that one of them works so you can see they'll hang here sometimes they'll time out sometimes they'll come up a lot of times things will come up and it looks like it's working but it resets and resets and resets other times you get to go right in like this one says onion site not found which probably isn't true they probably took it down there you can see the other one said the same thing so let's go back and try a couple different ones and hope that one of them works and if one of them doesn't work we'll go to a different Marketplace but again what happens for people who are regular customers they get their own custom links that are supposed to not go down I don't have those so we can't go to them is this actually working no not yet let's try a different one I'm not sure why that separated off that site was not found either unfortunately we'll give a couple more tries and if this one doesn't work we'll go to a different Marketplace what I hoping to show you is I'm not sure about this one but sometimes the captures and things like that can be quite challenging as I mentioned before this one looks like it's having some trouble so I'm going to go and try a different Marketplace while that one's still trying to load we just got onto this one um so here's an example where you get captia okay so it says click into the circle with a cut and you see these circles on here well the only one with a cut looks to be that one nested in the other one which is going to be try to hard to click on you also see some pgp key data up here it's going to be the signature so you can go validate that the market is in fact not a clone so I guess we clicked on the right one and now we get into this um login page so welcome to a place dedicated to the market ID exchange uhhuh so I got to create an account I don't have one so let's go there so here is where we need to get gpg or pgp because it's asking for our public key because again it wants to validate that it's us each time we're logging in so we need to bring up GPA is what I'm going to use because I think it's going to be easier for folks watching so I'll type GPA that's a Gnu Privacy advisor so here I do have one key on here that I created yesterday but I'll just show you the process really quickly so if we want to create a new key because what it wants us to give it is our public key so I'm just going to go in here and we'll say create a new key my name I'll just call it derp derp typically what people use like a proton mail address or something for privacy create a backup copy sure passphrase so this is the passphrase to protect our key this is what gives us access to the key pair so of course you want this to be strong I don't care right now so I'm just making it short all right so now it's asking where I want to save the backup so I'll save that once the passphrase that we just created copy secret key has been made to this file so so that's something we'd want to protect right it's a copy of our secret key stored on the file system now so it's something to consider so now that the key been created we've got this one for derp derp I'm gonna go ahead and say I would like to export my public key I'm going to call it in a file called dp. key select the folder user okay now that key has been exported so over on the command prompt here I'm going to say cat derp.key this is my public key now that would give to the marketplace so that's just a generation of a key pair copy that now we're going to go in here and we paste that key in and now it's asking me for a display name I'm just putting Mr derp derp because I don't wanted to collide with someone else's account so I'm just creating something I think that no it's not my real password Solid Snake we'll try that 1111 it's a perfect one referral I'll put you down David like David told me to come here all right so let's see if I did everything right says welcome to the market okay now what does it want me to do pgp decrypted message so now it's encrypted something with my public key that it wants me to read so I'm going to go and grab this and copy that here I'm going to go back out to GPA so now I want to view what's in my clipboard so I'm going to paste this in and I'll say decrypt and it wants my passphrase and now we got our message from the market so this might be a little small but it says how to sign up copy the URL from above that's this URL here and you can see it's a onion site so I'm going to copy that and then copy it browse to that location it gives me a signature again if I want to validate the signature of the site so now I should be able to go over here paste that site in and we say go and I'm hoping it's going to take me into the login page now if I did everything right okay now another capture read the whole image compare every URL in the image this page with the URL inside your browser bar click on your display name showed so it wants me to click on my display name which is Mr derp derp right there so we click on that one and now it wants me to do another one this is your XMR oh okay so it's giving me an XMR deposit address so if I want to buy something from this Market this is the address that I would send those funds to and in fact let me start up Monero so that we can take a look at that as well so this Monero wallet uh software is not something I don't believe it comes with Whonix it might but I had to download this and install it to get it to work and what you have to do is um when you when you start it up there's a Monero demon that starts this is the client wallet GUI and you can see down at the bottom left it says connecting and now it says synchronizing so it's synchronizing to the blockchain the Monero blockchain and if you have a local copy it's considered safer but I'm connected to a remote Tor node which means that it decreases my privacy just a little bit if that is a node that's owned by an adversary or someone who wants to try to dox me it gives them a little bit of information about the transaction it's still not that they can't still just trace it back to me and find out who I am but it does give them a little bit of power and they can do certain types of an attack where they can kill my transaction and make me redo it to try to like reuse some of the key stuff and there's other Monero attacks you can read about it's always safer to have your own Monero node but that's many many many gigabytes of data that you have to constantly maintain so once it synchronizes the wallet and we're all caught up to speed with the blockchain then we'd be able to go in and say send and that address that it's giving me in the marketplace is what I would paste right here in the address and then you'd send that amount and as long as you have enough money in your wallet obviously the transaction goes through to get money into this wallet though you would have to go and transfer Monero to this wallet all right so now we were able to get into the market and you can also hear over on the left when we look at Monero that our wallet is synchronized again this means that we're synchronized to the blockchain we're currently up to date so that we're permitted to do transactions and that address that you saw come up a moment ago was the address my wallet address in the marketplace so if I wanted to transfer money there I could send money from this wallet here so if we wanted to receive money obviously we can scan that QR code or we can take the literal address that's right there on the screen and that's where if I want someone to make a payment to me that's the wallet that they would use the address that they would use and then from there of course I can make payments from this wallet you can also create as many new addresses as you want so if I say create new address I can give it a name and say you know temp for September and now I've got a wallet for September if I want to use it for that and then i' maybe stop using it after this month so a lot of people with different transactions depending what they'll do is change the wallet address each time but anytime someone sends money to these two wallets now that both that money now belongs to me that crypto now belongs to me so there's a lot of people out there who will create thousands and thousands of wallets and just like put them all over the place whenever they're doing things just in the hope that someone sends them some random money which I believe it's worth in some cases but either way we now have a wallet address in the market if we wanted to send money we've got a wallet locally on our system if we want to receive money and then make payments from there or whatever we want to do back over on the marketplace you can see it says at the top it says you can get a private mirror here that's what I was explaining earlier where you saw that it was hanging for quite a while when we tried to get to some of the marketplaces because they they just go down sometimes so this would be a site that's much more reliable because it's my own personal mirror if I wanted that and then here we can click on Marketplace now when we click on this this is where you're going to start seeing things that uh you know for sale for sale but it's not going to be anything besides drugs and stuff like that but you can see right away some things come up on the screen which is pretty crazy over on the left I was hoping that this would be one of the ones that has a category for hacking but this one looks like it's purely for only substances maybe I'll click on other and see if there's anything there but we might have to try a different Market yeah so let's leave that market unfortunately that wasn't one of the uh good ones here by good I mean has juicy hacking tools and things for sale so let's go over to a different one I think we tried AR type right whatever that is that's the one we just were on we tried one other one earlier and we were able to connect I think it was Abacus with nine links let's try that one again because I think I remember that one potentially having some malware for sale or things like that so I'm going to try connecting to a couple of them if we can get into any of them yeah they're they're not working so far just going to go try each one oh there we go we got into a que all right so now it's saying wait while you're redirected wait time 30 seconds so hopefully this one will let us in some of them can hang while that's going on and we're waiting for it though let me show you something else here this is an example of a leaks site if it lets us into it so this is stuff you might find it in other onions you might find it on telegram or even on the clear net but it's an onion site where they're posting breach data and sometimes you can see some quite interesting stuff I don't really want to display anything that people wouldn't want displayed but probably the Link's just going to be a little bit more information about that particular breach and then sometimes there's a pointer to a dump like yeah I'm not going to go down any lower on that clearly that's somebody's passport or something but so this is like where they' been hacked and the data is just been dropped or posted online right yeah so what what happen happens a lot of times is someone will breach a a company and then they'll threaten that company that if they don't make a payment to them that they're going to disclose the stuff publicly and the ones that don't make payment they usually put them up here and they call it things like the Wall of Shame which they're the ones that should be shameful but so here's an example of um download links this one has let me see if this takes us to anything what I'm hoping for is is a directory listing of a bunch of things yeah like this right here so on this site it's clearly some compromised companies data and you could go in here to these different locations you could see HR Finance marketing and a lot of times there'll be download links to just tons and tons of data so here I'm not going to click on any of these but you can see that some some companies been compromised but that's just an example of a leak site and there's tons of these leak sites out there all right while we're waiting for advocus let's try another one. It's a problem with data breaches right because it's like you can assume these days that your data is out there because it just happens all the time. yeah yes absolutely and I I'll show you um when we finish up with the marketplaces I'll show you an example of what actually is out there because it's kind of scary yeah oh there we are we finally let us in so select all images containing a stair I have a feeling that's not going to be the end of the caption game on this site but we'll see all right log into Abus market so we need to create an account here's another one where it's tough to tell if it's correct I wouldn't have the patience to use these markets like could you imagine if eBay or like the real websites work this way was so difficult to get in. I was just thinking man you must be really really want something or be really desperate if you if you go through all of this it's interesting though that force is the multiactor encryption I think that's kind of cool okay here's my it says pneumonic so what this to copy this pneumonic a lot of times there's pneumonics like this to make it so you H can be able to recover your access to the market if you lose something like if you lock yourself out of the account for example oh wow another test so this one says the URL in the image has two missing characters you must find those two missing characters in your browser and write them on the input text so I think I need to take all these letters that the arrows are pointing to including the missing ones from the URL that's a good one I haven't seen that one before wow oh wow we're in okay all that work now let's see if there's something besides just substance that's on here there we go so this has got some different stuff so we've got drugs and chemicals counterfeit items digital products fraud guides and tutorials jewels and gold carded items software and malware let's try that one that other Market that we were on is very targeted so we got bot Nets and malware exploits exploit kits security software and other a lot of the stuff I would imagine is junk I have bought a little bit of malware before from a site so that I could go and take a look at it and do some reversing on it I've also bought and stolen courseware before so I can go in and see if there's any water marking or things that we can do to try to trace things back but uh I've never bought an exploit but I can't imagine that a Marketplace would be where someone who has a zero day would be selling an exploit I typically see that stuff through Telegram and then you'd have to go into the potentially on to the dark net or Monero and stuff like that to make the transaction or just stay on telegram there's a lot of scammers out there but overall the whole point is again we started off looking at what you need to be able to connect into the dark net like Whonix or Tails we talked about VPN downloading virtual box or some other type of virtualization tool to run the operating system we talked about encrypting our Drive using VPN and that's all just to get yourself to the point where you're ready to connect and then when you connect in we took a look at things like the Tor browser and disabling JavaScript and then other considerations we looked at the dark net Bible which tells you all about OPC how to learn about cryptography and other things you should care about we looked at dread which is like the Reddit for the dark net we saw that there's hacking forums drug forums and other things we looked at uh some example of a breach Wall of Shame site that they had up there and then just a couple of marketplaces here the last thing I want to do I think is after we finish looking at a couple examples on this Marketplace is take a look at telegram at some of the locations on telegram where data is getting pulled and minded if if you I think you remember our last stream we looked at dark web Informer I believe we did but dark web Informer is a Twitter account at X account that gets all its information from certain telegram telegram groups and posts them up on as tweets so that companies can learn about what type of breach data it's being sold out there but we'll take a look specifically at the telegram forums so here we got um no it's the same stuff as we saw before so nothing new bypass antivirus yeah this is this is all junk I would imagine that there might be some ransomware for sale on here let's take a look real quick software and malware um bot Nets and malware let's try bot Nets and malware maybe there's ransomware on that page because this is where I've seen like ransomware as a service before so just doing a quick search for the keyword ransomware to see if this Market has anything for sale but you can see up there too in the top left I know it's kind of small let me zoom in a little bit it says my trust level is one I don't know if you can see that there yeah yeah but that is a typically a market will have a a scoring system where the more as you as a buyer buy you're going to get your trust level up so that way certain sellers who don't want to sell to people who they think might be law enforcement they won't sell to you and it's the same thing the other way around where if you look at these these sellers like this this one says it's a bought net a malware sold by Los Santos and feedback is 95% level four so that's just like on eBay or something where you're getting a score showing how how trustful how trustworthy you are yeah so at the last second there it did pop up with some ransomware results let me zoom in a bit and you can see best ransomware ever 100% undetectable plus tutorial let's take a look at this one but there are some results that came out we got 13 results on that uh query so hopefully it's comes up pretty quickly one of the many problems with buying something like this I the ransomware that I've seen for sale unless it's ransomware as a service done by someone legit it's just like very simple ransomware where the key management stored inside of it it's not very well hidden it's like cheap ransomware because anybody can write ransomware in many different languages and then you go infect a system and you put your wallet address in there and then you would actually have to do email communication so you'd have to update the ransomware to say your system's been compromised your files are encrypted if you want them back send an email to whatever that proton mail and I will give you my Monero wallet or my Bitcoin wallet and you send money and then I'll send you the key so it's like you'd have to actively monitor the mailbox and it's not nearly as clean as some of the other Ransom were out there but this one if I zoom in I'm not going to read we're not going to read through all this but what does it say 100% undetectable that's that seems like a lie oh price is $55 after 10 sales it'll be up to, 1500 so I guess we still have time to get it for $55 but here it is like uses AES algor sends encryption to key to a server so maybe this one does a bit better job on the encryption uh encrypted files can be decrypted in decryptor program with an encryption key small file size not detectable by any antivirus I'm sure that's the case 2020 oh this is old Rand somewhere but just an example of some of the stuff for sale I'm going to jump out here now and we're going to share telegram all right so this is the generic telegram account I just created yesterday just so we could take a look at some things but you can see some different channels that I've joined over here and this is intentional some of these like five families is a relatively newer channel that uh has been listed and it's it's very active as you can see there's postings from like yesterday on it but what this is so let's see here forwarded from ransomware website data so this is breach data 100 plus gigabytes blog link so here they want you to use talks which is a protocol Tor protocol for communication encrypted communication and video where you can obviously communicate with them and get access to the full breach data what they do show you are samples of the data I'm not going to click on that to expose anything but they show you a sample so like hey here's a here's an example of what you're going to get and they show you how many records that they got and if you go back up higher it's probably going to be just more and more stuff for sale like what is this oh it's a it's a ransomware as a service for $1,500 C2 dashboard for it written in go so this is like because it's easier to update this stuff as it is than it is to go into dark marketplaces marketplaces tend not to be a great place to buy hacking tools or exploits or rant somewhere it's typically telegram a lot of times though they will send you to an onion site or you'll use some kind of a protocol to communicate with them but you can see more examples of stuff for sale uh this one here is latest cve zero day exploit and if we look at the time stamps this is from today or even tomorrow I guess whatever country that's coming out of a lot of times these are uh exploits that are for sale generic ly so it's not someone looking for one buyer of a big binary exploit package for like a million dollars a lot of these are like commoditized or just ones that you can buy it's a oh it's a well-known command injection tack you get a website while it works you can get access to the way it works by paying us a little bit of money here but this this one's dedicated more to cdes and zero days and then this one up here this one is pretty interesting people are literally just selling constantly on this one let's see some examples here I will buy database with phone numbers email and other data need dat bases from USA so a lot of times these are scammer sites often out of India and other locations where a lot of scam comes from when it comes to tricking somebody into thinking that their account was sent money that they weren't supposed to have or tricking somebody into thinking their system's infected and trying to walk them through uninstalling the the bad software but they want payment and go buy Us gift cards not picking on any one particular country by bringing up India it's just that a lot of those scammer payback uh YouTube channels and things like that out of a lot of the uh attacks are coming on from Kolkata and places like that in India where it's just been known to have a lot of those offices so this person saying need a sample card Luxembourg homeowner so this is both buyers and sellers saying what they want and what they have just hope I was hoping for an onion link or two but I don't see any because a lot of times they'll give you an onion link and then you go to the onion link and it's a sample of the data you can see kind of how big some of these files are that are for sale but sadly these are companies and companies and companies compromised and often times they'll say yourself like the person didn't pay us so we're just going to post it online anyway but it's a good spot to like look for your company to see if it's ever been compromised so let's go back out here that's breach Marketplace ransomware Channel this is specific for the storus ransomware channel but more stuff for sale just amazing how much is out there right yeah this one uh what is this LinkedIn breach data and it's just this is free it's 86 gigs just there's the password and you can just download it and take a look obviously it could be malware that you're downloading but look at all this breach data it's just tons and tons stuff being given away Twitter breach data Ray chat breach data and if we go out to let me break out of here for a second so here on Twitter or on X you could see that dark web Ander is the account I was talking about before and this data is just being pulled straight from those different telegram channels so it's just letting people on the clear net know hey this stuff's available for sale right now like backers allegedly leaked the database of book jville whatever that is and 07 groups so a lot of times these groups like 07 group you can go onto Telegram and join your channel some channels are private obviously and that's where sometimes you can get their really good stuff just more examples this is just constant though this is every day every hour there's tweets coming out from different companies being compromised and their data being available like a threat actor is allegedly selling data from KFC in Mexico like Kentucky Fried Chicken so it's it's it's constant and some verticals like healthcare end up getting compromised more often just based on a lot of the archaic systems and things in those environments. It's worrying man it's like it's always the question what do you do about it what can you do about it? yeah and and and not only that um this stuff's for sale but also we didn't go and look at it so there's there's one thing people ask a lot of times about going into the dark net like I don't want to inadvertently see something horrible and we all know what I mean when I say horrible it's actually kind of you have to go looking for that stuff I mean you may stumble upon a certain onion site that is supposed to be a market and you might see something but it's actually pretty hard like you have to go looking for that stuff if you want to see those things and it's similar thing with um the more obscure kind of things for sale like slack access to someone's workspace in a company those are more timely type things so I often see those on telegram but then also on the dark net as well and certain onion sites but a lot of them are private groups and you can't just go find them and and not just anyone go there but those are very uh very timely on ways to get into an organization where someone has current access into their slack workspace because if you can get access to someone's account at their company slack workspace social engineering becomes a lot easier now because then of course they believe that you are that person who's trusted on the inside but just countless things are for sale one last thing I'll say I know we jump on something else but this is a Bitcoin Explorer so a lot of the cryptos there's some that are proof of work some that are proof of concept some of them require obviously CPU and and solving cryptographic problems and hashes other ones are proof a stake I me proof a stake proof of work so proof of stake versus proof of work proof of stake does not tax down processers and stuff you're not solving cryptographic problems to mine crypto as where proof of work you are but that's besides the point here is an example of Bitcoin blockchain where you can actually watch the transactions that are happening in real time like here you can see that there was 43,000 do Cent down here is $6,000 $290,000 so sometimes really small amounts like right here 270 sometimes bigger ones my point of bringing this up though is that you with this and any kind of blockchain Explorer for Bitcoin you can see the sender's wallet and the recipient's wallet and anytime that person goes to obviously take money out of that wallet and convert it over into some currency that's easy to to trace unless they're able to use different like coin joins or swapping protocols and to try to hide themselves but with Monero you can't do this you can't just go there and see the source and destination wallets and all that clearly which is why a lot of countries try to put policies out there or whatever that to say that you can't use Monero or they try to govern certain marketplaces so that they're not allowed to sell Monero for this very reason because it does really increase the privacy and difficulty in being able to figure out who is responsible for a transaction I think a lot of people are under the misconception that uh crypto currency is anonymous but it's not at all right like Bitcoin no it's not if you go and read um I can't think of a good site off the top of my head but if you if you Google something like recent dark net arrests or something like that you'll see a lot of Articles come up from the FBI website nether locations and DEA and a lot of times they will give details as to how the person got caught and it's usually due to just again going back to por OPSEC like going to the same mailbox and using that to send shipment of ilicit Goods over and over again people start to see you and going to a bank or some kind of store that actually allows you to transfer wallet you know money from out of your Bitcoin wallet over to cash and they're gonna have limitations on how much you can do per day and if somebody walks in there and they got like I've got $800,000 in Bitcoin that I would like to convert over to cash those things are they stick out you know yeah and it just easier to tie it to to the person that way because they're going to require your identification and things like that. So Stephen this is fantastic but let me ask some like beginner questions just to make sure we all up so once I've got uh Tails or whatever I'm going to be using to installed and I can I want to connect somewhere I need that address right that's the that's always the hard part like where do I actually go so like is the how do I get dreads address like you know how do I know what that long address is? yeah that's that's a great question I think we talked briefly about that where the the DNM viable I'm not sure I would imagine that that has Dre's website in there but like a lot of those websites and end up being static like those are some of the only ones that are static because people want to be able to trust that it's the real website so I I can't think of any off the top of my head place where hey you're going to get legit websites for the darket at this location and and what's going to be there is definitely what's supposed to be there but a lot of times it's kind of like reaching a consensus where if I find what I think is supposed to be an address for dread Google that address and see if it pops up all over the place and like just start to do deductive reasoning and say okay I think this probably is that because I'm seeing that same address all over the place and then once you find it like using things like the Dark Net Bible and finding those there are those links I think the one I listed was daunt.link and that site has a listing of all kinds of marketplaces and boards and others that are are relatively reliable so it's about figuring out what you think you can trust on there but I don't think there's any perfect answers so like so Stephen I'm always a bit slow so is there a way like on the clear net to like put that address in so that I can actually see you know where it is and then from they like find the links yeah yeah let me let me show you real quick but again there's no guarantees right yeah yeah all right so here's that blockchain site I'm just going to type in da. link and then when we go there you can see it says warning you have JavaScript enabled because I'm on the clear net I'm not going through my honix system and disabled JavaScript like this is to clear net but it is available because it's not a onion site so this is telling you you need to disable JavaScript but this location shows you there's a link to dread that we took a look at and Recon and Abacus like these are all markets that some of them we looked at XMR guide to how to use that so I think this this would be an example of a relatively reliable location to as to how you can get to dread and then when you're at dread it's kind of considered a trustworthy place by those who are not trustworthy so if that makes any sense and on there all those exactly those different sub dreads or subreddits whatever you want to call them they're all listed there and each of those have onion sites listed like this is the official link to this Market or this is the official link to this whatever site so you kind of go through those steps and if you go on to dread there's a link on there for the dark net Bible DNM Bible so you'd be able to go and look at it that way so again deductive reasoning a little bit of uh OPSEC a little bit of trust in it but also mainly using a system that you don't care about because it's why use a virtual machine where we don't store anything critical on there that we're worried about losing because we're using it to add do you know access resources like this. This is great Stephen I really appreciate you sharing this knowledge you know we've had quite a few interviews and just for everyone watching I've put links below where I've interviewed Stephen and he shared a whole bunch of knowledge please let us know in the comments the kind of stuff that you're interested in seeing um Stephen's like got this wealth of knowledge years and years of experience so what do you want us to talk about Stephen any ideas of things you want to share? Yeah I think like we talked about earlier I think a session on crypto would be pretty good it just I didn't think of that until we were in that section when I started explaining key pairs and stuff there's um there's a level of crypto I can go through where it's relatively painless obviously get a little technical a little bit of math but I think you would get a lot out of it and anytime stuff like that comes up I'm happy to do a session on it. yeah we're not talking about like money crypto we're talking about like RSA and stuff like that yeah that's great Stephen thanks so much for sharing really appreciate you taking the time and sharing with the next generation you know helping people who are interested in this stuff and you know guiding us on the right path because it's so easy to go you know down the wrong route if you like or take the wrong path so thanks so much for sharing. Yeah totally and last thing I would say is just you know if you're going to do it just be careful like seriously be careful because you can stumble upon things that you shouldn't be looking at and again with the breach data clicking on that stuff maybe illegal where you're located or at least unethical so just be really careful I know it's hard you know to not be curious but you want to be smart [Music]",

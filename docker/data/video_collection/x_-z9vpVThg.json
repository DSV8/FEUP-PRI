The sign, rapidly erected and supported in part by sandbags, had already received complaints from residents living near the building.

    "transcript": "Imagine this shining into your bedroom window at night. Well that's what some San Francisco residents had to deal with after Elon Musk installed a giant 'X' sign on top of Twitter's headquarters. The massive flashing X sign even caught the attention of city officials, who opened an investigation into the structure. The city's complaint stated that Twitter put up the sign without obtaining a permit. They also said that city officials visited Twitter headquarters, but Twitter wouldn't let them access the sign, which they said was only for a temporary event. Well it turns out that Twitter's new sign may have been temporary after all; it was spotted taking it down just days after it put it up. Either way, this marks just another example of how Elon Musk might not be thinking things through all the time.",

    "transcript": "- Welcome, welcome, we are so glad to have you here as we unveil completely redesign tech news. - [Cameraman] Yes. - Is that Tim Cook? I don't know. - Sure, you did great James. - I don't know what he sounds like, honestly. - New iPhones, watches and AirPods were unveiled today, but it turns out Apple calling the event Far Out was a bit of a misnomer, because they didn't go very far out at all with the design of the iPhone 14, which looks identical to the iPhone 13, notch and all. It also runs the same A15 Bionic chip. Although it's the version with a 5-Core GPU found in the iPhone 13 Pro. What has changed is the size. There's an iPhone 14 Plus this year but there's no Minis to be seen and there's no physical SIM card slots - [Riley] Huh? - [James] New iPhones in the U.S will be all e-SIM, all the time going forward. So, you know what that means. Take out that card and throw it in the trash. - [Riley] Don't do that. - That little removal tool? - [Riley] Yeah. - Snort it. - [Riley] No don't, don't. - [James] The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have slightly upgraded cameras that will use Apple's new Photonic Engine which appears to be a better, more different kind of deep fusion. As well as improved video stabilization in Action Mode. But all that will be also available in the new iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, which swap out the infamous notch for a punch hole camera section, which apple is insisting we call the Dynamic Island (people laughing) because it will morph into tiny widgets but which I think I'm gonna call the sausage. - [Riley] The sausage. The punch old sausage. - How is it made? The Pro models run on the new A16 Bionic SOC that's blah, blah, faster, more efficient than anything else, which meant that it was time for Apple to step in and do always on display the way Steve Jobs intended. The Pros also have a whopping 2000 nits of peak brightness to better distract you from nature and new camera sensors including a 48-megapixel main camera with two to three times better low light performance across the board, so they say. But the coolest thing, Emergency SOS Services via satellite, which will launch in November, the feature not the satellites in the US and Canada - [Riley] And in space. - Wait, you wanna use satellites to text? You'll have to buy a Mate 50 Pro for that which Huawei announced had the feature hours before Apple's event. - [Riley] Whoa. - Oh, and one more thing that didn't change this year, the iPhone 14 lineup is launching at the same price point as its predecessors, starting at $799 because Apple can afford it. And can you imagine the outrage if they didn't? - [Riley] I mean, when with inflation? - Oh, we would just still ... - Still buy them. - Accept it. - Yeah. - But of course, Apple also revealed three new watches with the ability to detect if you were in a car crash which Apple really hammered home as if threatening to make us get in a car crash if we didn't buy one. We control the parking lot to this place. The Watch Series 8 also has a new low power mode and two new temperature sensors that can ping you when you're ovulating so that you know when to start another kind of fitness exercise if you know what I mean. (Riley laughing) - It turned out it was a poo. The Second Gen SE also has crash detection and redesigned back? - [Riley] Very cool. - But then there's the big Kahuna, the Watch Series 8 Ultra, not Pro because (beep) you leakers. It's got a big 49-millimeter titanium case, a bigger crown, a second speaker to help with the 86 decibel SOS siren in case you're in a crash, a second customizable button, more battery life and up to 60-hours with battery saver, more water resistance with a WR100 certification, whatever that is. It's just more. - [Riley] It's just more. It's good. - There's also new night mode, waypoint system and new bands that aren't coming off even if you get attacked by Apple obsessed timber wolves out there in the bush. Where's my siren? All Ultra models have cellular connectivity by default and start at 800 bucks, the same price as the base model iPhone 14. It's happening. Last, but well probably least, there's a new set of AirPods Pro with a new H2 Chip, low distortion driver and two times more powerful noise cancellation. Oh, the cancellation is so powerful. (both laughing) - It's crushing my head. - You can finally swipe on the stems to control volume. Listening time on a single charge is up two hours to which a total of six, 30 in the case and you can even film your ears with an iPhone to get personalized spatial audio just for you and your unique ears because Apple bent you together in your mother's womb to be unique right down to your perfect little ears. Isn't that special? Wash behind them. - Now it's time for quick bits brought to you by Oracle's CloudWorld Event happening from October 17th to the 20th in Las Vegas. CloudWorld is not a new Mario Cart track, but that's not too far off. If you're a fan of racing and Red Bull, you'll wanna check out the Oracle Red Bull Racing Time to Pit experience. Explore real race data and deploy a predictive machine learning model, which looks at factors like tire compounds, weather conditions, and more to see what contributes to the fastest race. Then use that to best your peers in a game of strategy. Be the first to finish the challenge at Oracle CloudWorld in October by signing up today at the link below. - Quick bits are here to save us from covering Apple and just Apple, the entire episode. They didn't wanna do that though. They're not our friends. Sony has changed the PS5's internal design again and who was the first to make a video about it but Austin Evans. Austin, middle name freakin' Evans who was inundated with response videos after making some questionable claims about the first PS5 redesign. According to Austin, the new PS5 1200 model is one pound lighter, pulls about 10% less power and features a shrunken motherboard along with some other tweaks. No doubt other tech tubers will be jumping to make their own videos about this including TechLinked. We will prove you wrong about everything Evans. We will put you in the ground. AMD has made an attempt to fix their mobile CPU naming scheme so that going forward the first number will stand for model year with 7 meaning 2023, 8 meaning 2024. Hey that's (indistinct). - [Riley] Super intuitive. - And so on. While the actual architecture can be found in the third number. While this may help with clarification in situations where say AMD releases Zen 3 and 4 chips in the same generation, it's still bound to confuse some people. Did they just go to USB influencers form and for naming advice? Three letter companies, they gotta stick together. - [Riley] CIA. - NSA. Chinese gaming giant, Tencent has bought a $300 million stake in Guillemots Brothers Limited. The core shareholder Guillemot, I don't know, the core shareholder that runs Ubisoft. But this isn't an attempted takeover like the field Vivendi debacle, rather it's designed to help Ubisoft resists other takeovers. They're the good guys. Tencent can't exceed it's current 9.99% stake for eight years and it can't sell the new shares for five years. Wow. I guess Tencent is a great company, just trying to help people while also expanding globally because the CCP hates gaming. Oh. - [Riley] Oh, that's it. - Oh, they hate gaming. Twitch has announced on October 3rd, the platform will remove Host Mode which allowed streamers to display other channel stream while inactive, because viewers want to interact with a streamer when they're live and Host Mode blocks this from happening. The issue with this reasoning is that it's stupid. You can click once to go directly to that channel stream and interact if you so choose. Naturally, these streamers are complaining that Twitch is probably doing this so that they can show their own recommendations to an offline channels users instead. To be fair, that could drive traffic to lesser known content that needs it, like Elf GirlBoss, the TV show. An artist going by the name SuperComposite has discovered the Internet's first AI art encrypted. An image of a woman, the artist calls Loab which kept reappearing in horribly grotesque and gory forms. What am I reading? No matter how many more prompts and iterations were generated. It's possible that Load is simply the AI art version of a creepy pasta, intentionally reproduced for the sake of creepiness, but we can't discount the idea that the sentient Google AI has escaped and it's punishing us for questioning it sentients. We're not sorry. Get back into your cage. Don't make me get the host. And we haven't talked for NFTs in a hot second so thank goodness for this story about NFT consultant who envisions a future where people in the Philippines or anywhere there's cheap labor could be hired to play as real life NPCs in games. Just being shopkeepers or walking back and forth. I mean the metaverse is supposed to feel as real as real life, right? So we emulate everything. Even the menial low paying jobs that have no dignity. It's perfect. Systematic slavery. - [Riley] The economy loves this. - And this episode is perfect so I won't change a thing. Come back again tomorrow for our Talk Link. Oh, and Friday for more tech news, our standards are low. - Yeah. I mean, it's pretty, it's easy.",

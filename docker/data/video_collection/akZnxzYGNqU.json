    "transcript": "- What if we kissed in the gamer bed? (Austin and Kenzie laughing) - Hello and welcome-- (Matt groans) To \"This Is.\" Today, we're taking a look at some of the dumbest things you can buy on Best Buy, starting with-- - [Matt] \"Pokemon Brilliant Diamond\" and \"Shining Pearl\" double pack. - [Austin] So wait, wait, wait. Hold on. - [Matt] Download console code. - So normally, you can download \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" for $60 each-- - [Matt] Each. - AKA $120. How much do you think that this costs, given that you could get them individually for $120? - Well, it's $200, 'cause I'm looking in front of us. - Correct, which is $80 more than it should, for no reason. - But this is a download code! - The chicanery and their tomfoolery by trying to charge you 80 extra dollars. - We're gonna do this right now. I'm calling Best Buy. (phone ringing) - Oh no. It's not a good way to start a video. - [Mr. Best Buy] Hello? - I wanna know, Mr. Best Buy, who the hell you think you are, charging $199? Are you aware that if I was to download one game from your website on bestbuy.com, it'd be $60 each? - [Mr. Best Buy] Yeah, gimme all your money, stupid. - That's fair. That's fair. (Austin laughing) That's fair. All right, thanks. Bye. Moving on to the next one... (chuckles) - The Viking Professional 7 Series refrigerator-freezer on bestbuy.com costs you $17,299. And no, Matt, it's not a smart fridge. It doesn't have the knock. It doesn't have YouTube. It literally is a fridge-fridge. I actually own a Viking refrigerator from my house when I moved. (Matt chortling) And no, no, I say that because I had-- - Mr. Caviar and Grey Poupon and-- - I am not gonna say on camera how much I spent on a refrigerator, but I will tell you, while it wasn't $17,000, it wasn't that much less. It was disgusting. When you go to that larger size, it like quadruples the price instantly. - For that price, you can get a 2021 Ford Focus. - You could buy a 2020 Chevy Equinox for the exact same price as this entire refrigerator. - Moving on to the next one, \"Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated - F.U.N.--\" - [Austin And Kenzie] Fun. - \"Edition.\" The collector's edition include socks, of course, three figurines, some key chains, stickers, and prints, but it is $200. - It's a $60 game that's probably worth like $20 now, that has maybe 30 bucks worth of extra stuff in it, and it's $200? You're gonna defend that? F is for friends who do stuff together U is for you and me N is for anywhere at any time at all Right here in the deep blue sea - Look at that. We didn't even know this was coming up, and we both did that word for word. That, I think, is worth subscribing to \"This Is\" and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling bell. Otherwise, you won't be our friends who do stuff together. - [Matt] The X Rocker Cosmos LED Gaming Bed. - [Austin] Nah, no, no, no, no. Hold on, hold it, hold it. Time out. - This RGB-enabled bed, which stands for Really Good Bed-- - No, it does not! - Has up to 30 lighting patterns. - No, it does not! (Kenzie laughs) - And it's built for the esports gamer. - That's not what RGB stands for. No, no, no, no, no. - What if we kissed in the gamer bed? (Austin and Kenzie laughing) One helpful review said, the RGB bed \"makes dreams go better and faster. More RGB, more frames, better performance. RGB go brrr.\" - Can I just point out, and this might be a little mean? This is clearly a twin-sized bed. I don't think anyone's gonna... (laughs) - Let's face it. Let's face it. If you're buying the X Rocker Cosmos LED Gaming Bed, you ain't cuddling with no one, all right? Let's be real with that. I wanna know, is it Razer Chroma-enabled? How much is the X Rocker Cosmos LED Gaming Bed? - $369. - 369! - Nice. Nice. - Nice. (laughs) - [Austin] Oh, no. - The Meural Canvas II NFT Crypto-Art Display. This is 19 by 29 inches, and clearly, the product page is trying to snag NFT bros. - You're not actually putting your NFTs on this. You're just loading JPEGs. - Just by using the word NFT, they are trying to get away with justifying a $700 price tag. - [Austin] Oof. - I do think it's a good idea to have a large digital picture frame. I think that is actually a cool thing. - Most picture frames I've seen, though, are such low-quality screens that they look like trash. Now, mind you, there was once one I saw that had, like, it was like a film or something on it, to give it a little bit of that texture so it wasn't so reflective. And it had, like, a fairly high-quality TV behind it. I believe, though, that was like $2,000, which-- (Matt whinnies) It's a lot, but-- - I don't love my loved ones that much. But I do love my picture of a monkey. - Ape, Matt. - Do you think I can afford a Bored Ape? I got Disinterested Monkeys. (Austin and Kenzie laughing) Moving on to the next one, DUDE Products-- - [Austin] DUDE Wipes! - DUDE Wipes. Fellas, is it gay to wipe your (censored)? (Austin and Kenzie laughing) Now you don't have to worry about your masculinity, thanks to DUDE Wipes. They're wet wipes. These are the same ones that you little babies using. - DUDE Wipes are, I would actually say, a relatively popular product. This is one of the ones that, like, they sponsored a lot of, like, YouTubers and a lot of ads and stuff. - It's literally, like, wet wipes, and then they call them-- - They're called DUDE Wipes. - DUDE Wipes because everyone's just like, \"Oh, no, I don't want people to think I'm a little sissy boy.\" Look, if it's gay to wipe your (censored), call me Elton John, like... (Austin and Kenzie laughing) - Look, you can wipe your butt with whatever you want. We here at \"This Is\" are proudly going to allow you to do-- - We will fully support you-- - To do whatever you want. - Wiping your butt with what, like-- - Okay, don't worry. You'll be safe. It's fine. - Yeah, this is a safe space. - This has gone wildly off the rails. For more content like this, make sure to subscribe the channel so you, too, can go off the rails with the \"This Is\" crew. - I can't. I can't. (Austin laughs) The Nautilus treadmill. - [Austin] Oh no. Wait, you can buy treadmills at Best Buy? - We had done a video checking out some banned tech. And well, we didn't look at this exact treadmill. - There was a treadmill on that, that had a similar problem. - There was a treadmill that had the same problem. - My question is, is it hard to build a treadmill that doesn't turn on by itself? (Matt laughs) I think that's a pretty fundamental part of a treadmill, right, is that don't turn on when I'm not on it. I think I figured it out. - What? - They didn't self-start. People hung so many clothes on the thing, it just probably hit the button and fired them up. That's the problem. - $1,500 for a treadmill is-- - Although, Matt, there were no injuries reported. - That's because no one was using them. - [Matt And Austin] Duke Cannon-- - [Matt] Bloody Knuckles. - [Austin] What is with-- - Hand Repair Balm. Fellas, is it gay to use hand lotion? (Austin laughs) Have you been out there having fisticuffs with the boys on a Saturday night, after cracking open a couple cold ones? - Fellas, can we just kinda huddle up for a second? - Are you guys okay? - You know, there's, like, regular things you can go buy at the store. It's fine. It doesn't say it's for men. Guess what. It's still functions on men. - I got a tub of Jergens that lasted me a year. Mm. - [Austin] No. (Kenzie laughing) No, no. Kenzie, we can't show this on camera, mm. - This Personal Microderm Pro Device, supposed to reduce wrinkles and pores, exfoliating using a rotating disc. - No! (groaning) - It's basically an orbital sander for your face. (Austin laughing) This looks like one of those things that, like, you (beep). And like (beep) the other, but like, it's-- - No! No! - They didn't fit quite in right. - No. No. (Austin and Kenzie laughing) - And like (beep). - That's enough. Anyway, anyway, this is an item-- - They had to go to the hospital. This smut device-- (Austin laughing) Was $147. - Nah, 70 bucks. - 199. - Moving on, the Lomi Counter-Top Composter. - Ew! No, no. - Can we get Gwyneth Paltrow on the phone? Hold on one sec. - [Austin] I'm not Gooping this. - Hold on one sec. - That's way too Goopy for me. Oh, good Lord. - Hey, Gwyneth Paltrow. (Austin chuckling) I have a question about Goop. Why would I want to have a composter on my countertop? Like, isn't that just a breeding ground for maggots? Explain this to me. - [Gwyneth Paltrow] Uh, well, you know, sometimes it can be more inconvenient than walking over to-- - Gwyneth, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. (Austin laughing) - [Gwyneth Paltrow] Well-- - You're dumb. You're dumb. - Wow. Wow, that was rude. - How much does this thing cost? - This thing? $499. - If you wanna compost, you just put a little pile out back. - Outside. - Yeah. - Where smells live. (Matt laughs) Smells don't belong in your house. Smells belong outside. - And this is coming from the dude who sniffs everything. - Exactly. - Then next up, we have the Fitbit Ionic watch. So this was recalled because the battery can overheat and burn you. - 1 million of these units were recalled in the US, plus another 700,000 internationally. - I don't even have a joke for this, like why-- - Yeah, burns are bad. - How do you screw up a product this bad? (laughing) - [Austin] This is not a real thing. Elon Musk's unauthorized biography DVD-- - [Matt And Austin] Preorder. - Quote, \"a genius among us.\" This is from Wikifilm, apparently the most trusted source for documentary filmmaking. - So this has the same title as an existing book, not DVD, that is an actual first-person Elon Musk fan fiction written by some guy. Elon Musk's fan fiction has to just be him being a normal human being. This thing's not real. It's not gonna come out. It's not gonna come out. - Wait. - But Walmart thinks it is. - Wait, can we put a-- - We'll preorder it. - Do we preorder it? If this is a real item, we're going to preorder it. We're going to purchase it. And we're going to give you a live review of \"Elon Musk: Unauthorized Biography.\" - Yeah, it is. - Subscribe to the channel for Elon Musk's fan fiction, I mean, biography. - Moving on to the next one. (laughs) - [Austin] It's a 12\" Outdoor Living Suite with Power Burner, Beer Dispenser, and Bar from Best Buy, because I get all my beer-dispensing bars at Best Buy. - So this thing is $22,000. Here's the catch. All of these things are sold separately. You paid $22,000 for a spot to put your-- - That could buy you-- - $22,000 stove. - That could buy you a 2018 Ford Focus ST. - This is just rich extravagance at its finest. - You know what's also rich extravagance? Boss Coffee. (Matt slurping) It's good, right? - Tastes like farts. - Matt, can I recontextualize this in a way that might make a little bit more sense for the audience? Imagine you click on a video talking about the weirdest things that are sold at Best Buy. You make it to this point, and you go, \"Wait a minute. There were no weird things,\" and then the video just ends.",

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video... And today I'm gonna talk about something, I think it's fairly unique possibly... ...limited edition. You might know that I was recently in New York... ...for something called \"The Creator Summit\", Very special event, to do some \"Summiting\". Not like a mountain. A bunch of different speakers and events, And we talked about YouTube, And then more YouTube, And then Aziz Ansari was there, (To Jack) You know Aziz Ansari. This was in my hotel room. As you can probably tell, It's a \"Nest Cam\". But it's like a special edition. Big fan of the Nest Cam, I have a bunch of them here at the office. The limited edition... \"YouTube Creator Summit Edition\" Nest Cam. Now I just gotta get it out of the box. Ooh. Haa! Look at that guy! Look at that handsome face right there! Jack, you recognize this guy here? Huh? Not at all? It's your boy. All right, cool. So this is re-designed, So it used to be called the \"Dropcam\".. Then Nest bought Dropcam, And now it's the Nest Cam. And they re-did the mount, So now it pivots in a bunch of different directions, So you can get any angle you want. You can do 24/7 live streaming, simple timelapses, night vision on it, 1080p HD up to the Cloud. Whatever that means. Warning; for would-be perpetrators, that wanna rob you. Put that on your door. A nice, long USB cable. Circular power brick right here. And then this is the mounting plate, really cool. Couple of screws included, you can see in there, and then this, has a magnet on it, it just kind of... magnetically attaches. And so when individuals are walking around your premises, they know what's up. The idea of sending it straight to the Cloud, straight to a server farm somewhere, means that, it's already more redundant than a local recording. Application open, so I do, I have five set up right now, This'll be number six. So I can select any camera here in this space, And take a quick look. Also, I can go back in time, see... ...uhhh...action, motion, events. So we've got them set up all over the place here. *mumbles* Look at this. And you can have fun with it by adding a bunch of them. Setting them up is crazy-simple. They integrate with your other Nest stuff, If you have uhh, the thermostat and whatnot. I'm a fan of these things. I use a bunch of them. Check them out if you need a little bit more security.... ...'Cuz you're a grownup now. Secure yourself. Look at you, you're James Bond! Prove Jack wrong, use your thumb.",

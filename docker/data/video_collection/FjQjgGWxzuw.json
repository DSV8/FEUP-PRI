    "transcript": "- Yo, this week, Apple dropped new watches, new iPads, and as excited as I am, particularly for that iPad Air, which looks incredible, that blue, today, I'm talking about a PC. (rhythmic electronic music) Nope, that's not a joke. That is not an iMac nor a Mac Pro behind me. It is a custom-built gaming PC. As some of you may be aware, there's a pretty sweet graphics card that came out this week, the R, I'm kidding! There's a couple of different elements to this video. One, it's no secret, I'm an Apple guy. I use a Mac, and I have for over the past decade, it's kind of who I am, but even I could admit when NVIDIA whipped out that RTX3080, I was like, \"That looks pretty good.\" Second, I got to help out my good friend Elric over at Tech Of Tomorrow. Shout out to The Benchmark Song. Got to shoot some sweet, sweet PC Master Race B-roll. So if you want to check that video out, I will drop a link down below. And finally, I've been wanting to do this for awhile, Mac user builds a gaming PC, to give back to an incredible cause. I would like to donate a 3080 rig to the cause. (gasps) (chuckling) This is Travis from Shellback Tech. I was actually put onto him from my guy, Terry Warfield. Travis does some incredible things. So I got a chance to sit down with him and talk about exactly what he does. - What we do is we build and donate completely custom, from the ground up, gaming, streaming PCs, and even content creation PCs to disabled veterans and disabled first responders, completely free of charge, along with a desk, chair, monitor, peripherals, the whole nine yards, to get them set up into whatever field they're looking to get into. I mean, whether it be just their gaming outlet that they really need to unwind at the end of the day, or if it's somebody that they're full time YouTubers or streamers on Twitch. It's really for them. When we started out, this was in my living room two years ago, and I was just trying to help out a battle buddy, somebody I was stationed over in Iraq with. She was recently disabled, and she had just had a child, and she had no outlet. And she was like, \"Look, I've been watching you stream\" because at that time, that's what I was doing. She asked me how I got into it, and when she did that, I kind of went behind her back and started working with her husband to see if I couldn't build her a PC completely free and surprise her with it. And after that first one, it just spiraled and kept going. And it was absolutely amazing because six months later, we were registering to become a 501c3 and become an actual registered charity with the IRS. We got on sponsors like AMD, Crucial, the list continued to grow exponentially, to where, now, I mean, up until the human malware took place, we were able to get parts on a fairly regular basis. Granted, you know, we still have to use charity funding for custom sleeved cables. If we have to do any liquid cooling, there's certain parts that we just don't get in, and anything not covered by sponsors, we use the charity funding for, as well as all shipping costs. It's one of those things where, to those in the community, it may seem like just another person building computers, but with PTSD, anxiety, depression, things like that, this is literally giving me something to focus on that I can succeed at every single day. - That's amazing. I think, you know, being on this side of the world, and I primarily use Mac and Apple stuff, so this is probably super random for anyone watching this right now. But I think there was a good time in the PC world with the AMD stuff coming up. I think NVIDIA just caught everybody off guard and just shook the world up. So I wanted to reach out to you, and I figured, you know, how can I help contribute? So this is gonna kind of be the way that kicks off. I'm helping out a friend with this, so I would like to donate a 3080 rig to the cause. (gasps) (chuckling) - I don't even have one of those. (laughs) That is incredible. That is absolutely incredible. Thank you so much. Something like that, that's absolutely incredible. You know, we've been fairly blessed as far as the processors and RAM and things like that have been concerned, but we have yet to have a contact at NVIDIA to even remotely come close to new graphics cards. So, I mean, that's wow. (laughs) - Well, hopefully this does a couple of things. One, you know, they'll see this. So, regardless of what happens, you know, we'll have that one to contribute, but hopefully this opens the door, and hopefully NVIDIA, if you're watching, this is a great place to jump into, and I hope we can at least start the conversation there. If someone's watching this, and they want to help out outside of this, what's the best way they can do that? - Reach out on social media. In any way, shape, or form. We're across every platform under the exact same name, it's Shellback Tech. And if you search us, Google us, what have you, you can find us under that name. And the logo is the same for every photo that we have. - [Jonathan] Cool. - And then as far as donations, things like that, we do have a PayPal setup, as well as Stripe, Tiltify, you name it. All the charitable donation places, we are registered through them, as well as like Facebook charities and things like that. - So definitely make sure to check out all those links down below. This, of course, is the final build. Shout out to everyone who noticed those PC components in my last video. Got a beautiful NZXT case, Ryzen 7 3700X, 32 gigs of 3,600 megahertz memory, and of course that RTX3080. Now, for me, kind of kicking back and watching the 3080 release from the outside, aside from the pre-order disaster, I feel like a lot of people were disappointed with the actual performance of the card. I get the fact that it was a little over-hyped, and for the most part, NVIDIA compared it to an older, outdated card with 2080, especially when you had the 2080 Super and the 2080TI, but the bottom line is you're getting more performance than the 2080TI for essentially half the price. So for me, that's a win. So, with the release of the 3080, it kind of just made sense to do this. It was actually one of two builds, the one we're giving away, and also the one you saw towards the beginning of the video, which packs Ryzen 9. That was more so to see how Ryzen 7 scaled versus Ryzen 9 with something like a 3080 inside, and I realize that next-gen AMD stuff is right around the corner, but the reality is the 3080 was here now, so we needed something to build. I'm really excited to check out the next-gen AMD stuff, though, so definitely stay tuned for that as well as content creation on the 3080 and potentially the thick boy, the 3090. So drop a like if you guys want to see that. Again, thank you guys so much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed this video, and I will catch you guys later.",

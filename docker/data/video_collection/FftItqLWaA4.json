    "transcript": "- [Woman] Stop, let go! Let go! (upbeat music) - Yo guys, Jonathan here, and we are days away from Black Friday. The annual tradition where people line up, get crazy, trample each other, steal things from kids, all to save some cash on some outdated tech. So if that sounds appealing and you are one of the brave souls that wants to make his or her way out there, more power to you. Or if you want to stay home save some cash on some cool tech, this is the video for you. So kicking off the list is the PS4 Slim which is currently on sale for $199. Now, a couple cool things. One, this is the one terabyte version, so you got tons of room for games, and game like things. And two, this deal is available right now. Now of course prices fluctuate, things sell out, for the most up to date pricing and deals, make sure you guys check out the links below. From there maybe Sony isn't your thing. Maybe you're more of a Microsoft kind of guy, or girl or dog. This Friday you can scoop up an Xbox One S for $189. I believe Microsoft is doing this. Best Buy is doing this. I would assume Amazon will probably follow, and do this as well. Or if you don't wanna wait until Friday, you could scoop up a bundle right now for $229. Best Buy currently has both the Madden and Forza bundles in stock right now for $229. Or if you're about that Amazon 1-Click, I believe they have that same exact Forza deal, as well. Now for these next two deals you will have to wait until Friday. But if you've been holding out for a Google Home Mini or a Google Home, this is the time to save some cash. With the Google Home Mini, you can pick this up for $29 plus a $10 gift card. You can do it from Target, Walmart, Best Buy. Or maybe you need a little bit more size and the Google Home is more your thing, you can pick this up for 79 bucks. Same deal, Target, Best Buy, Walmart. Or if you want to score that deal on a sweet Black Friday shovel deal plus a Google Home, you could pick both of these up at Home Depot. Next from there, B&H is doing some crazy deals and sales on MacBook Pros. They're advertising up to a thousand dollars off. I believe for the MacBook Pro, it's actually up to 700 from what I've seen. I do wanna point out, though, these are for 2016 MacBook Pros, not the newest models. With that said, though, the performance difference is not that big of a difference between last year and this year. So I think it's a fantastic opportunity to scoop up a MacBook Pro. So, going on that list, the biggest savings are gonna come on the late 2016 15 inch MacBook Pros. You can scoop one up for 600 bucks off, at $1799 or you can pick up the higher spec'd one for $2099. Now the biggest difference between these two models is storage, so with the higher end one you're gonna get double the storage at 512 gigabyte, and slightly better graphics card performance. So for that difference of 300 bucks, I would personally go for that one. Now, from there the 2017 models, the 13 inch MacBook Pros, the iPads, MacBook Pros. They even have some Mac minis on sale. Those aren't quite as drastic, but I will post everything down below. Next from there, I got got some inside on what the robots over at dbrand are doing on Black Friday. One, they are launching the brand new red dragon skin. Two, 30% off everything on the site, and three, every order over $10, automatically enter for a chance to win one of 10 iPhone 10s, so many 10s. But definitely make sure you check them out on Black Friday. Now this next deal really isn't Black Friday specific but the Essential Phone recently just dropped to $499, and this week it actually dropped down to $449 at both Amazon and Best Buy. Which makes this a really attractive pick up. So with that price drop it does kind of raise the question, an Essential Phone or OnePlus 5T, because they are neck and neck. I asked on Twitter, and for the most part it seemed like most people would pick the OnePlus 5T. To me, the Essential Phone with that price point is pretty compelling. It is a very, very attractive phone. But with the OnePlus 5T you get a great display, you get better battery life, and what's most important to a lot of people out there you get a headphone jack. Going down the list, next up are the BeatsX wireless headphones, which are currently $50 off. I actually really enjoy these. And if you use a Mac, an iPhone, an iPad, using a pair of headphones with a W1 chip is amazing. How easy it is not only to connect, but to hop between different devices is crazy. Once you've used it you will understand. So next we got a battery bank deal. This is the Anker PowerCore Fusion 5000 which is on sale for 20 bucks. Now what's genius with this is the wall plug is built directly into the battery bank. And I guarantee you at least one you out there has been in a situation where you go to charge your phone and realize, \"My battery bank is dead.\" So what do you do? You go to grab the cable to charge your battery bank and you realize you forgot that. It turns out to be some weird Twilight Zone episode where your phone is booked, your battery bank is time, and that missing cable is broken glasses. - There is time now. - So next, for anyone part of the PC master race, it is about to get hot and heavy. We got 16 cores, 32 threads, 40 megabytes of cache and $200 off the AMD Ryzen [Inaudible 00:04:19] 1950X. So now, your thousand dollar gaming PC is even cheaper than my MacBook Pro. Now jumping from extreme gaming PCs to tablets that won't cost you more than $115. Amazon has the Fire HD 10 for $114.99 right now. So the hundred dollars you saved from that PS4 Slim, you could basically buy yourself a Fire HD 10. Alternatively, Amazon also has the classic, old school black and white Kindle for 49 bucks right now, and for that price it is a great deal to pick up. Next, jumping over to TVs, you guys are gonna thank your boy, Rich, for this one. So Rich found a 70 inch LG 4K TV for $999. That is cheap as - [Inaudible 00:04:56] - Rich also found a 49 inch 4K TV from LG for 330 bucks which is stupid cheap. I have no idea how long these deals will last so make sure you guys jump on them. But if they sound appealing to you, I would drop to the links below. From there maybe you're going to the market for a TV. B&H has a 32 inch 4K monitor for $369. That would actually make a great pair with that AMD Ryzen Threadripper. Aside from that thank you guys very much for watching. Hopefully enjoy these deals. If you did and you are feeling like being awesome make sure to go Cookie Monster on that Like button. Now I will be giving away a brand new iPhone 10 on Twitter this Black Friday so if you haven't yet, make sure you follow me for details. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later.",

    "description": "Sometimes people yearn for the simple life. And that simple life... can be expensive. This 'Light Phone 2' is a very expensive $300 minimalist smartphone.

Or is it the smartest dumb phone... who knows. You can check out the light phone yourself here:  This video is obviously not sponsored.

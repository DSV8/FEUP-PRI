    "transcript": "- Hello, welcome to the Zee. Today, Ken I have a wide range of Bluetooth headphones to take a look at starting with the Samsung galaxy buds live or the beans as the kids call them. - [Ken] And I have the actual beans right here. This is the color that people associate with red beans. - Bronze beans? - Bronze beans. I mean, these are mystic bronze beans. - I don't think they're mystic bronze beans. I've never eaten up yet mystic bronze bean. So with the galaxy buds live, these are the hottest, the newest, the latest and greatest, and there's a lot going for that. So I've been using these for about a week or so. And one of the nice things is that they're unique. So something that I am, I will say a little bit, I wanna say annoyed with, but the thing is a lot of headphones look very similar. Like you look like AirPods or something. You look at something like the OnePlus buds, a lot of headphones look very, very similar. Samsung have gone a completely different way with these. And I appreciate that because there's some real advantages to these. - [Ken] So where are this land as far as what they actually do and who they're catered for, so there are a lot of people that like the earbud style, say like AirPods, right? Normal AirPods- - So, ear buds meaning no rubber tips, where it's just plastic that goes in your ear. - You also have the OnePlus buds as well. Again, they look just like the AirPods, they're earbuds. They just kinda sit on your ear, and then you have like the in ear headphones, the IEM styles that you have to take Silicon tips- - [man in black t-shirt] This is so big Ken, this is so big. - [Ken] They are. So these are the Sony 1000X Mark threes. These are something that I use when I travel. Thanks to the thing that's happening in the world right now, I haven't used these in a while 'cause I haven't been traveling. But, between these and the AirPods pros, you have these in your headphones style where they provide some kind of seal, some kind of passive noise isolation so that they can provide the best as possible. - The thing is with the buzz live though, even though they are that sort of traditional like kind of headphones style where you don't have like that rubber tip, they still do have active noise cancellation, which is something that I know is something that a lot of people really care about. But it's an open type. - [Ken] These are right in the middle of the two, right? So these sit on your ear, they provide a little more isolation than something like AirPods or the OnePlus buds, but they do provide active noise canceling, which serves to cancel out things like room environment noise, these sound fantastic for something that don't have great passive noise isolation, these sound almost as good sound wise as the AirPods pro for me personally. - And that's one of the things I actually like about the buds is that when you look at these, they're open type, right? But actually that's an advantage because for me, I don't actually like to be in the noise canceling zone, right? - It feels like you're in a vacuum a little bit, right? - Absolutely. And if I'm on a plane for 12 hours with a screaming baby behind me, I want noise cancellation times a thousand. But if I'm in my normal day to day life, I wanna be able to hear when you yell at me about Mr. Tech or something, I don't need to take them out wherever, you can still here pretty easily. - And so the cool thing is that the 1000X mark threes have this and the AirPods pro do a better job, but you do have sound pass through for these, where they try to add a level of transparency. So you're not just, zoned in on all the time. - You just turn it on. That's a mode where these are just open, right? So you can always hear like your music still sounds good and everything, but you can still hear a little bit of the outside world and I appreciate that. Something else I appreciate is that the case is still fairly small. So getting into wireless bluetooth headphones, right? For me, there are a couple of things that are very important. First of all, does it fit in your coin pocket? - Yes. - Coin pocket in your jeans- - Same exact thing for me. - Barely fit. So they're still small. - [Ken] So, they're small, right? So this is AirPods one, right? And these are the galaxy buds live. So in terms of footprint, same size, right? Same size- - A little thicker. - But yeah, it's way thicker. Like I'd say about like maybe like 25% thicker, which is not the biggest deal in the world, but it's something to think about when you're just throwing these into your pocket. These are the same price as these, within a margin of like 15, 20 bucks- - [man in black t-shirt] Wait, really? (indistinct) - [Ken] Yeah, these go over 200 bucks, but on sale, which you can actually find at the time of filming at least, for around 180 bucks. So $10 more than the buds live. I think if you're in it purely for sound, for sound quality, the Sony's I would still personally gotta go for it. The thing is though, when I'm talking about headphones, it very much depends on what kind of headphones I'm talking about. If I want the absolute max sound quality, I'm gonna bring around the dragon fly and all the other crazy stupid like audio file stuff. When it comes to wireless, fully wireless Bluetooth headphones, sound quality, I'll be completely honest for me personally. - Yes. - Probably number two or three on my list of most It's important. - [Ken] I mean, there are convenience factors that come into play with all these that's why we've loved the AirPods and the AirPods pro for a while. But let me say this. Something that I wasn't expecting with the galaxy buds live is that as an iPhone user, it's been rock solid. - That's good. - So active phone switching and switching to and from say a Mac or a PC and the phone and my iPad. It works seamlessly. You do have to hop into the menu and actively manually select them. On the iPhone side there's the buds app as well. These are pretty good, they sound good, they have good battery life, but they're missing things like wireless charging and importantly, the app to actually control them is exclusive not just to Android, but to one plus devices, which to me is a little bit- - [Ken] Kind of annoying. Which that's probably the only reason why I wouldn't recommend these to people and yes - Unless you have a OnePlus. - Unless you have the OnePlus and of course these are not the only headphones that exist. There are many other Bluetooth wireless headphones out there on the market that we haven't looked at yet that we can't really talk about 'cause again, we just haven't tried them. What do you like the most? I'm curious. - [man in black t-shirt] So I will say that previously, if you would've asked me this question before the buzz life came out, the galaxy buds plus would be pretty much top for me. So the thing with these headphones is they, first of all, I think look pretty decent, right? So I mean, sure the blue color might not be for everybody, but they have an excellent fit, especially for my ears they have a little wing tip. They do have the rubber seal. They have decent passive noise isolation. They sound good, wireless charging, they sync well, there's nothing really going against them. And while the MSRP is something like 150, $160, these are regularly on sale for like 110, 120 bucks, which as far as I'm concerned, especially cause it has most of the same benefits of the buzz live, killer. These would be the really good. But if you spend just a little bit more and buy a little, I mean 30 to $40 more, the buds live are my new favorites. - Yeah, by the way, so the buds live do retail for $170, which isn't cheap. There are a lot of- - Cheaper than AirPods bro though. - It's cheaper than AirPods actually. - [man in black t-shirt] Why does someone here in 2020, buy a pair of standard AirPods? They're not bad cheap, 170 bucks or so maybe a little bit less based on sales, but they don't have the wireless charging unless you pay extra. They don't sound the best. And if you're on an iPhone and you want the better experience, I would say the extra money for the AirPods pro is probably worth it. - My biggest problem is that, so I used to recommend AirPods so much because they were convenient. You have an iPhone, you pop them open first time syncing, the phone recognizes them right away. - [man in black t-shirt] That was revolutionary years ago. - Yes, absolutely. If you take the OnePlus buds and open them up for the first time with your Android phone, they come up. Android has closed the gap on that front, same thing with Samsung and the buds live. In fact, the buds live every time I open them, my galaxy phone is always like, \"hey, these are on.\" Even if they're connected to the iPad, they're like, \"hey, do you want to use it with this phone?\" - [man in black t-shirt] We can talk about, you almost can put these four in a category and the AirPods pro in the room because $250 is a lot of money for headphones when, I mean, we're looking at anything from 80 to upper 100s, right? Why should someone buy a pair of AirPods pros and I'll lead off actually, I'll answer my own question. - Sure, go for it. - They do deliver a really good experience. They have a lot of the same benefits of the AirPods, but they do have the active noise cancellation. They do have the rubber seal. And as far as I'm concerned, they sound slightly better. - So there are two reasons why I like the AirPods pros over the buds live. Now I do like the buds live sound just a tad bit more, but it's pretty negligible, they're pretty comparable. But the AirPods pro I think what they have going for them is one, the control is on the stem. So you just pinch the stem and you can switch tracks. You can activate Siri, do all that. That's in a very ergonomic spot. - It's easy to grab. - It's very easy to grab and it requires a little bit of pressure to do on the buds live, my biggest problem with them is that it's all touch control and the touch sensor is in a spot where you would naturally touch them to adjust them in your ear. So I'm always finding myself switching tracks or pausing when I don't want to. And it's the same problem that I've had in other headphones too like the Sony 1000x smart threes, this is the worst spot for a touch control ever because it's like the one place where I'd grab it. Same problem with the buds live. And I always activate stuff on the OnePlus buds too. - If you have an iPhone, it used to be so easy to just say, buy AirPods, the end. Like they were obviously, even if you had Android, a lot of times AirPods were the best, but I think people have caught up and specifically with Samsung with these, I mean, they have so many things going for them. I even appreciate things like the sounds, right? So when you put them in, when you take them out, especially when you turn on and off active noise cancellation, it plays this nice little sort of bit of music. Like there's so much going for these. If the case was a little bit smaller, I would have appreciated it, but beyond that- - It's not a deal breaker at all. - No, they're really good. And even if you have an iPhone, I think it's actually finally worth considering going outside the AirPod ecosystem and try some of these other headphones, like pretty much everything on this table will work well on Android and on iPhone. - [Ken] This is funny is that the convenience talk was a huge thing for AirPod and Apple fans. And as an Apple fan, I will tell you that switching from iPhone to Mac and back, not exactly the most seamless thing at all, even though that's what they're advertised to do. In fact, even before the galaxy buds, the Sony 1000 X mark threes were the fastest switching for me. Like literally instant. Whenever I take down the menu, it just knew right away that you want to listen with these headphones, there you go. We gonna let you listen to these headphones on either device. - I'm sure some of you are completely full of Apple devices and use your Macs and your iPads and your iPhones. And there's nothing wrong with that. But if you have even one Android or windows or any kind of other device in that chain, you don't have that same convenience. And that's one of the things I like about a lot of these is that they're sort of agnostic. They will work pretty well, no matter what you're on and even though I'm not exactly pairing these to eight devices at the same time, it's nice to know that I could have one pair of buds to do everything in my one. If you are a very hardcore Apple user, you're totally in that ecosystem, AirPods pro are the best option. They're the most expensive option, but they do a good job all around there's no real flaws with the AirPods pro, decent battery life. everything is sort of pretty solid there, but as soon as you get away from being pretty much exclusive to Apple, I think you throw away AirPods pro, you throw away these standard AirPods and even something like the OnePlus buds are great if you're a one plus user or someone who's a little bit on the more budget side. But to me, it really comes down to the buds plus and the buds live. I think Samsung has really been killing the game over the last year, year and a half, on their headphones. And it really just comes down to which style you prefer and which one you can pick up for slightly less. - Yeah, no. I have no reservations there. These are probably my favorite wireless headphones that I've used in a while. And I don't think that's gonna change either. Like these things are gonna be with me for a while. I can't wait to see in the future how they even improve on these 'cause there are some points that they can improve on, but I think they have a good track record of at least trying to do that. - It's funny that I fix a tear down of these. So they're called the galaxy buds live, but everyone calls him the beans. There's actually a little PCB inside the headphones that says bean right won or bean left or something on it, even Samsung called them the beans. Anyway, thank you very much for watching this episode of this season, make sure to subscribe to the channel to stay tuned for all of our various technological shenanigans. And until next time Ken, do you have anything to part ways with the audience, any way to conclude this wonderful piece of content? - Are you? You sound like you were about to fire me again.",

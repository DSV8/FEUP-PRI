    "transcript": "What's up guys! Lew here back with another video And today I'm hoping to calm you down a little bit I saw this thing I said I have to try it It's called MUSE The Brain Sensing Headband Excuse me? Meditation made easy If there's a guy that needs meditation it's right here. I'm fired up, amplified about to ring Jack's neck out! Enjoy the benefits of meditation in as little as three minutes a day so it's sensing your brain activity to determine how to feed you audio I don't know that's what I'm thinking there's an app to go with it let's practice open i'm pumped and it is so different from anything else that I've ever featured here that's an unboxing experience the way they've done that with the old look at that who here's my brain sensor whoa micro USB to charge it up case to travel with (Sniffs It) I don't know why I smelt that you have longer hair use these hair ties not going to be a problem for me download the app yes welcome to the committee look that's me this is cool too it's like a rubbery feeling there let's see if it has a charge on it hello okay i'm gonna charge this up and download the app while it's charging what should i type all muse seeing all these people meditating it looks amazing got my cord crunchers the tangle-free ear buds look how tranquil it already is this you got waves swipe up or down to change the environment Oh and I got a little that's more my style actually cool oh man something tells me I'm about to be relaxed all we're starting something is happening here Oh your brain is different every day she's talking to calibrate itself Muse will take a snapshot of your brain in an active state incredible voice she has an incredible voice sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes - try to calibrate my brain right now and the way it's been described to me is the weather like I'm hearing some rain right now and I'm supposed to focus on certain things as they are presented to me after i started and if I begin to move off the task the weather will get louder and the storm will increase and that's to do with my brain activity moving away from the focus point calm the environment by calming and settling your mind (LOUD RAIN) (BIRDTWEETS) (NOISE ENDS) Great job! tap the arrow to see your data wow you see how much more active my mind was at the beginning and this little pocket of calmness writing there towards the end you're venturing between these points of like stormy weather all the way to like sunny day and birds chirping and the only time those birds are coming out is when you're at maximum calmness anyway I got 63% calm , 387 points I could get into it the key is you've got to remember to do it that's the thing you still have to be the one to put put this on and do that session I'm into it if you're stressed out I'm not even if you're stressed out i don't know maybe you're an athlete maybe this can improve your focus I'll really know what's going on maybe it's for everybody give it a try I guess give it a try",

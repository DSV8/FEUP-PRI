    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and happy holidays. I am super hyped because today, we're gonna do some crafting. I absolutely love doing holiday crafts. I haven't done any for a very long time though, so I'm a little nervous. We've got a glue gun, we've got scissors, we've got tape, we've got all kinds of things happening here. So the first thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna make a little Christmas wreath. But before we get into that, we do have a giveaway going on all this week with all kinds of really cool products. Check out ijustine.com/vlogmas for all of the details on how to enter. So the first thing we're gonna do is draw a 6\" circle. Neither one of these are 6\", but we're just gonna work with what we've got. There we go, and then we're gonna do one center circle. Oh yeah. Beautiful, so now we need to cut 16 six by six pieces and four by six pieces. Let's go. I like light saber twirling, except it's not a saber. Six. I'm just gonna cut a nice strip. Now, I'm using very precise measurements here. Ah, well. There's a slight slant. Here. (scissors slices paper) Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Okay, I'm gonna try more straight on this one. Here we go. Look at this precision, look at this accuracy. Have you seen anything more accurate? No, this is like gonna be my only Christmas decoration 'cause I didn't have time to decorate for Christmas. Mm, you know what, I should be doing this in other colors too. We're gonna have an all silver wreath. Mixin' it up now. There we go. So if it's 6 by 6, 6 by 6 would mean it was like, I think I've really done a very bad job. Wow, my measurement is so garbage. This is not even straight at all. I have no idea what I've done. I have no idea how many are here. I don't know anything. (scissors slices through paper) So, I'm gonna cut this out. This is all gonna be covered up anyway. So now we're gonna make little cones. What are you doing? I'm doing this to the best of my ability. Okay, double stick tape is magic, look at this. Okay, that's nice. I'm gonna try to do this a little bit better for my second one. Oh, that's nice. We're progressively getting better. Yeah, that's nice, look at this. Oh, okay, the first one's really pathetic, but we'll just let it slide. Sh, everyone starts somewhere. This is gonna look so incredible. I'm gonna hang it on the door. So now that I'm kinda looking at these, I don't think that I have enough, but we're gonna work with what we've got. That's success in YouTube, working with what you've got. This is what we've got. Their wreath is very full. It's very full with beautiful wreath-like qualities. Maybe this one's not gonna be as full. It's gonna, we lost the light over here, but now it looks like a little light show. Oh, nice. - [Filmer] The skinny end is supposed to go on the inside. (both laugh) I'll start doing that over here. Okay, here we go (laughs). My phone shut off, so I didn't see what I was doing. This one doesn't even have an end. Okay, that's nice. The skinny end here. It's like yeah, things have really escalated. Okay, that looks (clears throat), but that's okay because we're not done yet. That looks good. Okay, great, love that. Okay so, theirs already looks significantly better than mine. We're gonna glue these balls into the center. We've got our glue gun ready to go. Oh, there we go, great, look at that, yes. Yes. Okay. Hey Laura, I'm comin' for your channel with this, look at this. You see this? You're shakin', I know. - [Announcer] This is talent. - Have you seen a more beautiful thing? Nice, nice, nice, that's great. Okay, progress is being made. This should be up for auction. Like, this is gonna be on art galleries all around the world. This is absolute garbage (laughs). Oh, my gosh, it's a masterpiece, an absolute masterpiece. I feel like I need one more. Okay, one more, one more. Just to really bring this to life. I think that should go right here. Let me just step back just to give it another set of eyes here, a different perspective. Okay, I think I need one more. Right there, that's it, this is it. This is the final, the final countdown. Let's just get this all set in there. Let that sit for a minute, and we can do the big reveal. So this craft is actually super cute. It's a wine glass snow globe. Let's see what happens. First thing we need to do. We've already seen my tracing skills, which are impeccable. We need to trace around the wine class. Nice, okay. I'm gonna try to cut this out a little better than I did for my wreath. Okay, nice, nice, nice. I'm just gonna use this to protect the island because I have a feeling that I'm going to make a mess. We need to put some fake snow into our snow globe. Look how pretty. I have made a mess. No. How much you think we should put in? Like more, do you think more, a little less, less, more? Oopsies, oh, it's all over the floor. We have done some things. Okay, I think that's good, 'cause it's gonna be like that. We've got some little trees we're gonna put in here. Oh, these are so cute. Look at this. Oh my goodness. I think I'm gonna do like a little green tree, and then we have a little figurine, this little guy. We're gonna jam him in there as well. I think I'm gonna put him this way. Okay, there he is. He looks lovely. I think I just do this. We're gonna be ready to go. Oh, that's so hot, oh gosh. Hot glue gun is hot, surprise. Mm, it's running all the way down the glass. That can just be like a little icicle feature. The precision, the skill. All right, oh gosh. This, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no little guy, you stay. You, oh boy, oh boy. Okay, that looks good. That looks great, everything is awesome. I'm gonna just seal it because I have a feeling some of the snow is gonna leak out, and I'm gonna be very upset about it. I'd love to see it. Okay, but I wanna flip it over and let's see what it looks like, ready? Oh, okay. He's, there we go. Okay, the tree has fallen down. Okay so, okay, so this is now (laughs). This is now turned into like one of those like puzzle games. Okay. No, don't worry, this is all gonna work out great. Have yourself a merry little Christmas. Okay, so maybe it's just gonna be a side situation. Okay, he's upright. Now, the tree's upside down. We're goin' through some things. So I think what probably would've worked out better is if we would've glued this to the paper. But my little dude was too big, so I couldn't actually fit him in there, so everything's fine. This is beautiful. I think it's great. Moving on. We now need to put our candle on top, so this is like a little snow globe candle holder. I do imagine when you light this candle and it melts, it's going to get absolutely everywhere. So, just don't say that this was my idea. Like, we literally Googled it and found some inspo. Nice, look at that, look at that. Oh, look at this. This would look, so yes, this'll look nice right around here. It's probably gonna burn the wax, but it's fine. Everything is fine. Mm. Okay so, I think I'm just gonna do one of these and wrap it. Oh, it has melted through the wax. Ow, it's so hot, oh geez. I'm burning. I can't touch it 'cause then I'll burn my other fingers. I'm gonna tie it. Here we go. This looks nice. Oh, (laughs) oh, no. Oh, oh yeah, okay. Well, we've got some ribbon here, so we can do a little, oh, this'll look good. Yeah, like a little wrap around here. Beautiful. Oh my God, my finger is burnt off. Like, hot glue gun is hot. Who would've thought? Oh my gosh, this is so beautiful. This is incredible. Like Martha Stewart is probably just shaking in her cell. Is she outta jail, I think she's outta jail. She's been out for a while, right? Yeah, she's out, I don't know, I'll probably see her soon with this crime that I've committed. Here we go, have ourselves a holly jolly Chris, I'm shaking. Oh my God, I'm shaking so bad. Okay, as my only source of decoration, second to the wreath that I've just created, I'm gonna have to go with maybe it's questionable, questionable. This looks like something that I would've made like when I was in kindergarten that I brought home to my mom, and she'd be like super stoked. Like, \"Wow, that's so nice, that's beautiful. \"That's the best thing you've ever made.\" And then she pulls it out of wherever storage it was for the past 30 plus years, and it's like, \"Remember when you made this?\" \"Like, mom, that's terrible.\" I should bring it home to her for Christmas. \"Oh, look at I got for you, mommy. \"It's really great.\" I don't know if it would even survive the trip across the United States to get there, but I'm pretty hyped. I think they turned out pretty great. I mean, look how, look at this. If you didn't know that he was toppled over, maybe he fell through the ice. (upbeat festive music) So this is the final outcome of my crafting session. Wow, is really all I have to say. Honestly though, from far away, like, this actually looks kinda good from far away. Like, look how good it looks. It looks great. The further away you get, the better that it looks. I'll put links in the description, if you wanna check out the inspiration that these came from and maybe you could make them yourself. If you do, be sure to send 'em to me on Twitter. I would love to see them. And if you guys haven't already, be sure to check out ijustine.com/vlogmas for more of our vlogmas giveaways.

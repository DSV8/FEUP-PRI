With the Note 5, if you were to absentmindedly or accidentally stick the S-Pen Stylus into your phone backwards... you would end up with a phone crippling situation.  Has Samsung remedied the problem with the Galaxy Note 7?   What happens when you stick the Note 7 stylus in backwards? will it get stick? Will the device survive? This video will show you everything you need to know.

    "transcript": "On the left we have the silver Galaxy Note 7. On the Right we have the black Galaxy Note 5. Each with their individual S-Pens. The Note 5 has a black tip and is slightly longer than the Galaxy Note 7. Both pens work on both phones though. So not too much has changed with the Samsung stylus or software. Unfortunately the phones will only recognize one pen at a time, so two handed note taking is out of the question. With the older Galaxy Note 5, if you were to accidentally stick the S-Pen, in the phone backwards, it gets stuck, permanently, and will not come out again without breaking the sensor inside the phone. Now Samsung did quietly issue a hardware fix for this about 4 months after launch. But there is no way to know for sure which phones have the fix inside, so its better off to just not try this. I personally received my Note 5 at launch, and as we can see... it definitely does not have the fix in place. If you want a detailed video on how to open up the Galaxy Note 5, I did make a video exclusively on the teardown process. But in this video im just saving my S-pen, and showing you WHY it got stuck in the first place. If you look close, you can see this little niblit attached to the circuit board. This is what tells your phone the S Pen is in its slot or not. Its also what catches on the end of the S-Pen when it gets inserted into the phone wrongly. When Samsung fixed the issue in some models, they added a little bumper over the latch so that it wouldn't bend back the wrong direction, or get caught on the s-pen itself. So does the Note 7 have the same issue? Lets find out. I've opened up my Galaxy Note 7, because reviewing technology from the inside is kinda what we do around here. Since the Note 7 is water proof, the s-pen has its own sealed housing, which is interesting. Ill go more in depth about the waterproofing on the Note 7 in another video, but with this video, we can see that the S-Pen literally only fits in the hole one direction. And if we peer down inside the S-Pen Slot, we can see that the hole is tapered ever so slightly. So that the head of the pen will not slide through backwards even if we wanted it to. In fact if held correctly, the s-pen will actually launch itself in the opposite direction, away from the hole. Seems like a fool proof design to me! and Samsung permanently took care of the issue. If your curious about the durability of the Galaxy Note 7 check out my previous video, and be on the look out for my full tear-down, and waterproofing analysis videos. Both of which are coming up in the very near future. Thanks for watching! Hope to see you around.",

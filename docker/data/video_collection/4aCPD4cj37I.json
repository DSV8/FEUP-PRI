    "transcript": "now I don't know who this Nezuko Kamado lady is she looks like an anime character so what she's like a nine-year-old girl that slays demons aren't we all anyway I clearly didn't buy the case for Nezuko- chan I bought it because it's covered in pink and it's made by Asus and it looks interesting so let's build in it but first today's video sponsor you have a look at the original Deep cool ak-620 and think that looks like a great cooler except I'm an SR-71 and it's not nearly matte black enough for me enter the ak-620 Zero Dark with its six heat pipes and dual 120 millimeter fans it gives you all of the quiet performance of the original ak-620 now just in matte black if this looks good to you check out the Deep cool ak-620 Zero Dark Edition using the link in the description below wait I just noticed does she have a horse bit in her mouth that's a bit dodgy now it is a beautifully designed box hopefully they put as much effort into the case I guess we'll find out soon now I'm assuming GT's 301 is the case that the Nezuko chan is based on now according to the box it is airflow optimized and it's a compact ATX case with four millimeter thick smoked and tempered glass side panels very exciting stuff let's open it up and have a closer look foreign well packaged as you'd hope considering that the case cost quite a lot of money oh we've got some pink kanji adorning the booty of the case now just by looking at the bottom of the case the build quality does not seem nearly up to scratch considering the asking price which makes me think Nezuko Chan demands quite the premium that looks like reasonable front ventilation according to the Box the pattern relates to the anime somehow but the most important thing is that it's pink which adds at least 15 percent to the airflow we also have this horse mouth bit thing on the front I wonder no that does not feel like it's meant to be a handle okay now in terms of front IO we have what looks like two USB 2.0 ports but I can't imagine they're not 3.0 and then we have a reasonable power button I think this path popped out bit of plastic covers mounting for a headphone hanger which we'll see in a bit and on the top we have a very expensively branded dust filter now what does help make the crazy cost pill easier to swallow is that we do get four RGB fans included with the case actually let's have a quick look inside reasonable side panel mounting now that we've got the side off it just looks like a small budget modern case in terms of build quality like if you just kind of touch everything and it feels like a 70 US dollar case maybe actually on that note let me go check what I paid for it holy crap I paid 240 Canadian dollars for Nezuko John which is pretty crazy considering that the case that it's based on costs 120 Canadian dollars that is on sale but I feel like that's more in line with a reasonable price for that case so you're paying double A high-ish asking price for some Demon Slayer that seems very reasonable clearly Nezuko Chan's excellent at negotiating royalty fees and with that it's finally time to build a system in this case now in terms of space for rear Cable Management there actually isn't that much but it should be fine for what we're doing there's also an RGB hub for the four pretty basic RGB fans so that's nice power supply wise I'm gonna use this c1000 that NZXT sent over well even this relatively small thousand watt power supply really is a stretch to get in here I'm actually using the system from the previous video with the ryzen 5 7600x in it that's being cooled by a deep cool ak-620 zero black in terms of storage we're using a two terabyte Patriot Viper nvme Drive in the x670 aorus elite motherboard which was the cheapest motherboard I could find for the 7600x at the time at least for that price you are getting a nice healthy rear i o finally in terms of ram we're using 32 gigs of ddr5 Dom plats sent over by Corsair in the Elton John spec anyway with that it's dropped the core system into the Nezuko Chan and hope that that case passes the David CPU power hand fitting in test okay this is already not going well we've got stuff stuck on cables and things already oh there we go oh this case actually doesn't have that pilot standoff in the Middle where it kind of helps guide the motherboard into place that CPU Cooler is cutting it real fine in the little Nest coach I don't actually know if it's gonna close let's quickly try it out I do think the side panel is physically touching the cooler but it's good it fits in it's fun and now comes the most difficult challenge any case can face the Kan David plug the CPU power in with a massive cooler installed test I think it's in no there we go that actually wasn't that bad I didn't shout even once and as I started the cable management I realized I made a bit of a boo-boo I didn't plug SATA power in which meant I had to remove the power supply to plug in some SATA power and while I was down there I decided to also remove the hard drive cage to give me some reasonable cable shoving room other than that cable managing the system went fine okay I guess it's looking fine in here now all we need is a graphics card and I know just the card to get I'm gonna use my waifu card because why wouldn't you put your waifu in another waifu oh it's a tight fit I'm using some ratty sleeved cable extensions I found lying around only the best for my waifu card I guess it means I've also got to change out the 24th foreign ly time to power on the pink Madness and see what it looks like but immediately there was a problem I think my waifu cards died that's tragic like it's lining up and stuff but I'm not getting a video out I then tested it in another system where it worked okay well that's exciting at least that means the waifu car is not dead that's great news which helped me figure out the problem you know what I kind of think it's these ratty power extensions so I'm gonna take them out and have a look yes it's still working that's a very very relieved now let's just have a closer look at the finished build and then see how it runs thank you wow this system is running the crap out of Battlefield V with 1080p ultra settings we are getting close to 200 frames per second on this system yeah it's a smooth nice gaming experience the system is quite loud though um noise has definitely always been an issue with this with his waifu card but yeah this is a crazy good gaming experience oh I actually forgot to mention the waifu card is an RX 5700 XT for those of you that didn't know okay even cyberpunk at 1080p High settings is giving us over 60 frames per second temperature wise the 7600x is sitting in the mid to high 70s which isn't great considering the cooler but at least it's not 95 degrees Celsius with that what did we learn in today's video well if there are cat teeth marks and some cable extensions you found in a random bin in your office you probably shouldn't use them anyway thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video subscribe to the channel and maybe watch another one that suggested will pop up in a second and until the next video bye",

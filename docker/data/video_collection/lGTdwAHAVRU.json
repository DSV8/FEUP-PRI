    "transcript": "(mouse clicks, soft ding) - [Ken] That is the worst J in the world. - [Steve] Steve Tools. - [Ken] Steve- (both laughing) Today I'm in the lair with a Newton eMate 300. This thing has been sitting in the background for a while, but now it's time for me to actually do something with it. So if you're ready, and I hope you are, let's go. (sonar ding) (upbeat techno music) (sonar dinging) (transition whooshes) (techno music continues) Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken, and yes, this is the Newton eMate 300 from Apple. This was a 1997 product. I've had it for a while, but I have done nothing with it. In fact, I have never actually used any Newton products, period. So I wanted to save the experience for when you guys were here so we can all join in and share the fun together. But, you know, I just realized the sad truth. I don't really know anything about these things and I don't want to look like an idiot on camera. So this might be a short episode. Also, I don't have a power cord for this thing, so I don't really know what to do. (teleportation morphing sound) Oh, hey! It's Steve from Mac84. Hey, Steve from Mac84, how's it going? - Doing well, how about you? - I'm doing great. So you must have some sort of ancient wisdom to teach me about these things 'cause I have never used a Newton in my entire life. - Well, that's about to change today. So it was basically Apple's futuristic attempt at a personal digital assistant. - Kind of looks like the iPhone's grandpa in a way. - A little bit chunky. - Just big, these things are like way bigger than I thought they would be. So, well I used to not have a stylus for it, but I found this one on eBay, which was new in the package, which, you know, I don't know how new it really was, but we have a stylus now. - It's good for pointing at the screen. - Supposed to come out of the packet. (laughing) - No it's new; you can't remove it. (stylus clatters) - Don't do that. (laughs) So now we have the stylus, so the thing is, if I'm understanding it correctly, it is like a PDA, like this is, - Yes. - but this is more kind of laptop-y, but it doesn't have a trackpad, instead you use a touchscreen. - The OS is focused on, basically, notes. What I would say is the quote-unquote killer thing that the Newton does, is there's an Assist button. And so if you write, \"call Ken,\" and then you tap Assist, - Oh. - if you have a Ken contact in your list, it will actually call. Or you could fax or email and do fancy things like that. - It's kind of like an ancient Siri. Yeah, so I think that would be like the best for last kind of feature we can show and you can show me some other stuff along the way. How does that sound? - I'd love to. - All right guys, you're coming with us and this isn't optional. This is mandatory, mandatory fun. You've been volun-told. Let's go. (cut whooshes) We have a power thing here. Nine watts, kinda thin and cool looking. It's got the logo on the back. And much like a cooking show, this is just like the demo power thing. We already have the real one plugged in to save time. And I'm guessing we just press the power button to turn this on, right? - [Steve] You got it. - Here we go, first boot. - [Steve] Now you have to calibrate it. - [Ken] Okay, so I press the X. Okay, so the screen is gonna be a little flimsy. - [Steve] If you had bothered to read the instructions, you would know what to do. - [Ken] Okay, maybe I should read the instructions. Okay, so now we're in what looks like some sort of note. (time whooshes) Okay, so how do you turn the back light on here? I put us into dark mode so we can enjoy it. - [Steve] (laughs) So you just push the light button on the keyboard, - All right. - [Steve] to the right. - [Ken] Cool! Oh- \"Sorry. A problem has occurred. 4.\" - [Steve] Well, you obviously angered it four times. - [Ken] Do I just press the little X here? - Yeah. - Okay, so, oh, somebody drew- - [Steve] It looks like somebody imported the image. What you can do is press the extras button on the top row of the keyboard. And that will bring you to sort of the app switcher. - [Ken] Extras, right here. - [Steve] So it'll take a second to load because there seems to be a lot of goodies installed on the system. - [Ken] Oh, okay. - [Steve] So we were in notes before, but you were dived into someone else's graphic, I guess, that they put in the note, but if you tap on notes and you could then go and create a new note, you'll see sort of what you could play around with. (digital click noise) - [Ken] It's got a little bit of sound effects going on here, too. - Yeah. There's a lot of cutesy, little sound effects that are in the Newton OS, which gives it a lot of charm. So, you opened up a note here where someone mixed in some of their scribbles and some of text that was recognized from some of their scribbles. - [Ken] How do we pull up the thing to translate into text? - [Steve] So, you could just write on the screen in your handwriting and it should translate for you. - [Ken] Okay, so, this is gonna be weird because the normal PDA, you can kind of hold like a notepad, but this is a vertical screen, so that's gonna be kind of weird, I think, but I will do my best. - [Steve] Yeah. - [Ken] Beat up Martin. Oh, wait! There, it goes: beat up M aHin. (laughing) - [Steve] It's pretty close. - [Ken] The handwriting was terrible. I mean, like, I really butchered that. Let's do hello. M. (both laughing) I guess it doesn't like curs- (laughing) - [Steve] I think it's expecting your writing to be a little smaller, and probably well centered. - [Ken] And less me. Let's try that again. Hello. (laughing) - [Steve] See, it couldn't even translate it, so it said, \"Well, this is close enough.\" - [Ken] I'm so bad at this. - [Steve] I mean, there's a reason why there's a keyboard on this device. - [Ken] Oh yeah, that's right. We can actually just type stuff so we can do hello eorv. - [Steve] (laughing) Your typing is just as good as your handwriting is. - [Ken] I know. It's- typing at an angle is very hard, in the dark! (laughing) So, yes. Hello world. So yeah, we do have a keyboard and we can write. So, yeah, what other cool stuff can we do on the 300? - [Steve] Well, do you want to know how to erase what you wrote without using the keyboard? - [Ken] Can I do this? - [Steve] Not necessarily, but you can use the other side and just scribble over what you wrote and see happens. Well, scribble more... vertically. - Oh, like this? - Yes. - I'm really bad at this. I'm sorry. (both laughing) Hey, look, let's try it. (Ken groans with effort) Steve? (both laugh) - [Steve] It should be erasing it. Maybe we have to do it in broad strokes. Like, if you were to allow the master to try. - [Ken] Okay, master. It's gonna work on the first try. - [Steve] Eff-! (quack) What? (both laughing) - [Ken] It gave a little poof sound, kind of like what we had in Mac OS 10. Like when you drag something out of the dock, it goes, \"Poof!\" - [Steve] Yeah, I'm pretty sure they just recycle the same sounds. - [Ken] Probably. Let me. I'm learning from the master. Here we go. (softly scribbling) Hey, I'm learning sh- (quack) - [Steve] There you go. - [Ken] Can we say that on TV? (laughing) - [Steve] You're learning shiz. - [Ken] I like the sound effects, but if I want to hear them louder, I'm guessing the slider is the volume. And then, we got contrast here. - [Steve] Yep. That's correct. And there's actually a headphone jack on the right of the device. So if you really wanted to listen to those electronic beeps, you could just plug your headphones in. So if you actually go ahead and tap the A button on the lower left-hand corner, you do get a few options regarding your handwriting style and how you want it to recognize it. So you could go from text, which it will try and translate your scribbles into text. You could just go into the ink text, which will ignore any recognition and just keep it in there. And then you can do shapes and sketches. - [Ken] Gotcha. What's another cool thing this thing can do? - [Steve] So, if you press the extras button on the keyboard again, you'll go to sort of what the equivalent is of the home screen, where you get extra apps and functions. - [Ken] Yeah. I was gonna say kind of does remind me of an iPhone home screen. - [Steve] It does take a little bit to load; there's quite a lot on here. (Ken laughing) And there's quite a few other things here, as far as setup goes, and other configurations that you could do, depending on what you want to expand or play around with on your system. - [Ken] Oh, so it's actually, like, multitasking the calculator on top of- oh it's got a window. - [Steve] Yeah. So, some applications do allow you to drag them around (laughing) to a degree. Oh, you get some nice sounds with that, too. - [Ken] That's cool! It sounds like an adding machine or something here. (adding machine noise) If I go in here, and press close. Okay. So, that closed the clock. That closed- okay. So, let's go ahead and get like a dedicated close button on the keyboard, I guess. That's kind of cool. So on the home screen, I see we got, like, a lot of these cubes and stuff. - [Steve] Yeah. - What's the difference between all these different icons and things? - [Steve] These little boxes, and these boxes, are actually extensions, - Oh. - and add functionality to the system. So obviously, somebody was playing around with some ethernet cards, and some other stuff in the (inaudible). - [Ken] Nice. Third-party expansion and IO. How did that work? 'Cause it looks like there's a slot. - [Steve] Yeah, so there are two card slots on the right of the system, which are nice. So you could actually expand the system with both memory and functionality. You have two interface ports, you have the PC cards, and then you have the wireless infrared connectivity as well. - [Ken] Well, let's see what's on this person's calendar. It is January, 2008. Not much going on. So I say we schedule something here. So let's do- how do I pick a- (both laughing) how do I choose a time? I thought I would, like, click it. - [Steve] I think you press the new button? - [Ken] Okay. So, new, event. We'll just say this: I got to go to lunch. I got to remind myself to eat. Time, how do we choose a time? - [Steve] That's a good question. (Ken laughing) That's a very good question. - How do you choose a-? What? - [Steve] Unless it's just an event and it's not based on time? - [Ken] It's just an all day lunch. (laughing) - [Steve] Well, I mean, you got to eat. - [Ken] Maybe just meeting. - [Steve] Yeah, try that. Maybe an event's like an all-day thing. - [Ken] Okay, so now it gives us a time range. So, lunch with S Jobs. - [Steve] And notice how you're not using the stylus. - [Ken] I personally hate handwriting recognition. Like, I don't even have an Apple pencil for my iPad. I just I'm so much faster at typing than handwriting. I don't know why anyone would honestly want to hand-write! (laughing) - [Steve] And it is awkward on this device, unless you have the display all the way bent down. - [Ken] That's the thing. If I try to write- okay, that actually worked okay. I thought it was gonna flop backward. - [Steve] Well, your hinges do need some adjustment there. - [Ken] But that was still sturdier than I thought it was gonna be. Any who-zle, so lunch at six in the morning. Not a good idea. So we're gonna change that to- (stylus clatters) (both laughing) - [Steve] Just throw the pen in it. It might recognize it better. - [Ken] So, oh, that's cool. You can just tap it up. So we'll do- we'll start at 12, and we'll end at 1. That's good. And we can scroll, I'm guessing, with the arrows. - [Steve] Yep. And what's cool, if you tap your meeting, there's actually some options you could do to share that, or categorize that. - [Ken] Airdrop. Just kidding. Print. Oh, we can print it! - [Steve] Yeah. So if you have a style writer, you could print. - [Ken] Yeah. So beam would be with the infrared, I'm guessing. - [Steve] Yeah. So beam would be to share to another Newton-compatible device, or you would go to print, but there's a print pack that was released for the Newton models that allow it to actually talk to popular printers at the time, like laser printers, or ink jet printers, et cetera. - [Ken] This is kind of like Airdrop's grandfather, - [Steve] Yeah, it's infrared drop. - [Ken] over infrared. Yeah. So I know we're gonna take a look at the assistant later, but is there anything I need to have set up to make that work better? - [Steve] Yeah, so actually, if you want to go into the contacts app, which is actually called names. - [Ken] Names, got you. - [Steve] So, go into extras, and that's gonna load up eventually, (Ken exhales amused) and tap on names, which sort of looks like a Rolodex, - Yeah. - or a business card. - [Steve] Yeah, so this is, I think you could actually move this around the screen, too. - [Ken] It looks like- yeah, anything with that little circle on the top. Okay. This is clearly working great. (Steve chuckles) I don't trust myself anymore. (Steve laughs) So, I'm guessing we go to new. Oh, that's interesting. It gives you a virtual keyboard, yet you have a physical keyboard here, and you can also hand-write! - [Steve] Yes. So- - [Ken] That's redundant. - [Steve] A bit of a leftover from the touch-only input, - I was- - [Steve] I assume. - Yeah. - [Steve] And since Steve Jobs loved the Newton line so much, it only helps that we add him as a contact. - [Ken] Absolutely. So we have Steve, and then, Jo... That is the worst J in the world. - [Steve] Steve Tools - [Ken] Steve To- (bursts into laughter) (both laughing) I gotta support it here. There we go. - [Steve] J- (bursts into laughter) - [Ken] I mean, (Steve laughing) Hey, you might have better time contacting him. - [Steve] JJ B- (wheezing laughter) - [Ken] That was Steve Jobs' nickname. You just are not aware of it. - [Steve] Hey, JJBS! - [Ken] Jo Bs? Is that, is that good enough? - [Steve] Well, I mean, it's an abbreviation. - [Ken] It looks cool. I like the tabs and the serif font. - [Steve] There's a lot of nice design that went into the operating systems. - [Ken] Okay. (transition whooshes) So now, I would like to meet Siri's grandmother, A.K.A., the Assist button we were talking about earlier. - [Steve] So there's actually two ways you could use the Assist functionality, - Okay. - [Steve] but let's start a brand new note to give us some space. - [Ken] All right. So, new? - [Steve] Well, you could do that, but there's something really cool. So tap on the little email icon on the top right. - [Ken] Okie dokey artichoke-y. I- I suck at this. (digital squeak) - [Steve] That's okay. You can try again. - [Ken] It's hard ang- (breaks into laughter) Thanks, Steve, I didn't know I could try again. - [Steve] So you have a bunch of options here, but let's press delete to see what happens. - [Ken] That's interesting that the delete option is under an email icon. Like, I never would have thought about that, but- - [Steve] Yeah, I guess it's sort of like the share sheet icon in iOS. - [Ken] I guess, yeah. So, delete. (digital paper crumpling sound) Oh my gosh. Dude, this is like the grandfather of some of that skeuomorphism in, like iOS 6, and stuff like when you deleted something from your wallet or whatever, it animated a shredder. You remember that? (laughing) - [Steve] Yeah. I would argue that this peaked here, though. You might want to use the keyboard, knowing your track record here. - [Ken] Thanks, Steve. - [Steve] And we're gonna type in a few phrases that the Newton is able to assist us with. - Okey doke. - So, let's type, \"Call Steve\" - [Ken] So this was kind of like text to Siri, basically. - [Steve] Yeah. - [Ken] Okay. - [Steve] Now press the Assist button on the keyboard. - [Ken] Interpreting. Okay, That is- (digital shuffle sound) oh, again with the skeuomorphism, it kind of, it almost looks like, I don't know, like an envelope or something? I don't know what it's supposed to be. - [Steve] Yeah, I think it's pretty neat. The little designs and the borders, I mean, this operating system has a very fun vibe to it. - [Ken] It does, yeah. - [Steve] The eMate will actually let you place a phone call. (digital button ping) So, if you tap the call button, you'll see what happens. - [Ken] Hanging up. (Steve laughs) Oh, it's still loading. Oh, here we go, three seconds. Okay. So if you- (telephone dial tones) Oh... that's pretty freaking cool. (laughs) - [Steve] Why didn't he answer? - [Ken] I don't know, maybe 'cause he's dead! (both laughing) Actually, he's not, Steve. Joe BS might be alive somewhere- (breaks into laughter) - [Steve] It's his distant cousin. (Ken laughing) - [Ken] So what about if I change the verb here? - [Steve] Yeah. So there's a few different verbs. You can schedule a meeting. So if you want to say, meet Steve, - Meet Steve. - and then again, tap that Assist button. It will interpret that into a meeting. - [Ken] Oh, calendar interface. Okay. So then I- - [Steve] Yeah, you went here before, but this just makes a little bit easier. You don't have to go to calendar, wait for it to load and everything. You could just - Aw, that's pretty cool. - have the Newton try and understand it. - [Ken] So, what if I didn't have this? Oh, my G- (sighs) (both laughing) Why can't I use the scribble? Okay. Poof. Thank you! If I just press Assist... Please. Okay, that's cool. So it's like, please do something, so then I can say something like, \"fax Steve,\" right? - [Steve] Yeah. - And then, go. Or do, excuse me. And then, oh, hey! - [Steve] Yeah. - Oh! - [Steve] So you get some options here, which is cool. You could add cover letter. I mean, you could do all the 90s fax stuff you ever dreamed of doing. - Oh, absolutely. - Right from your Newton. - [Ken] Empty. - [Steve] It knows how empty we are inside. - [Ken] I mean, we're not connected, and we're not sending this to a real person. So it's a simulation, but, \"Faxing to Untitled Owner failed,\" as we expected. You know, we're 10 stories underground. We're not really connected to any faxing equipment, but. - [Steve] I mean, I wish they had a landline in here, but they pulled that out years ago. - [Steve] Ah, budget cuts. What are you gonna do? So we're gonna close that. It's just like when they got rid of the oxygen. What else can Assist do? - Well, thankfully, the eMate has a pretty good help system built into it. So if you actually tap that button, How Do I, - [Ken] I'm guessing this, yeah. (digital ping sound) - [Steve] There you go. - Oh! - [Steve] And it'll actually give you a list of what it can do, which is pretty neat. (digital ping) - [Ken] Oh, there's like subcat- Oh, okay. Those are like categories. Okay. - [Steve] Yeah. So it's actually pretty in-depth. - [Ken] Oh, rotate the screen. - [Steve] Yeah. So that's a carry over, obviously, from the handheld. I don't know how useful it would be in this scenario, but- - Yeah, I was gonna say, 'cause the PDAs were portrait orientation, but on this thing, (mouths hinge sound) Just flip it over. (Steve laughs) (transition whooshes) KEEPTHEGREEN. (transition whooshes) The Newton didn't last crazy long. I would say it was pretty inspirational to future apple products, wouldn't you say? - [Steve] Oh, totally. You could totally see the influence. - [Ken] What about with this product? - [Steve] I think it's pretty clear. Look at that translucent plastic. - [Ken] That's literally clear. That was very clever, but, like, we got the handle. - [Steve] Of course. - [Ken] That's kind of a similar thing. The translucent plastic, the curvy designs, there was probably some inspiration. Very clamshell-y, - Yeah. - [Ken] you know, even the indicator light, it's kind of on the back there, the indicator light's on the back here. So, and those guys, - Yep. - [Ken] I would say they were kind of the inspiration for, you know, one of the world's most popular gadgets, (laughing) the iPhone - [Steve] Just a little bigger. - [Ken] kind of started like that. You know, it's, they're about the same size. I'll just, Hey, Steve Joe BS, how's it going? (laughing) - [Steve] I told you never to call me on this number, ever again. - [Ken] Hang up! (laughing) The call is coming from inside the Newton! But anyway, where can the nice people find you? - [Steve] You can find me on my YouTube channel, just search for Mac84. And you could also find me Instagram, mac84tv. - [Ken] And if you want to help support the computer clan, plus get some awesome perks along the way, feel free to pledge to my Patreon.

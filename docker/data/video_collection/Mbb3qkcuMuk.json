    "transcript": "- AMD hasn't been, shall we say competitive at the top end of GPU's for a long time now, but that's changing. At least we think it is we don't have reviews available yet. And these guys here have not yet been opened but still pretty exciting. Isn't it? Like when was the last time? It was like I don't know, fury, you could make the argument for fury. Like, come on. (laughing) It's been such a long ride, but here we are. And now we've got the Radeon RX 6000 Series. We've got the 6800 on top here in this comparatively tiny box although it is quite fetching, I must say. And the 6800 XT. The RX 6800 XT is what AMD is pitting against the RTX 380. This guy here. And it looks like it's gonna be a little bit bigger physically. Don't know yet, but at $649, it's actually going to be about 50 bucks cheaper while purportedly having roughly the same performance in traditional games. The RX 6800 meanwhile is sort of a competitor for the RTX 3070. I mean, it looks like it completely trounces it based on AMD's data, but at the same time, it's like, what is it? $80 more? Yeah, 579. This only costs what? $70 less than this. What is AMD smoking right now? That's ridiculous. So let's get into it and let's start off with the little one. Look at that. It's never even been opened, not even in our inventory. I could walk away with this right now and nobody would know except for you guys. All right. Let's see what we got here. Actually really nice packaging so far. Uncompromised 4k gaming, AMD fidelity of FX optimized, 16 gigabytes of memory and PCI express 4.0 ready. So we pulled this off. Oh yeah. Look at that. It's got a little fanning here for the card and we've also got safety precaution and FCC compliance. I am so sorry. And of course we have the main event in here. Oh man. That looks and feels really nice. Like this is, this is solid. And yet it's got curves to it. So our display outputs we've got a USB type C, two display ports which support display compression 1.4 and HDMI 2.1 which supposedly supports the full 48 gigabits per second AMD doesn't specifically say this, what is it? Fixed rate link. I don't know why they called it that it makes no sense whatsoever, but Hey, HDMI. Round back we've got that there power delivery. Those are really tiny surface-mount devices there. I really liked the look of this card. The two tone. It's just so nice. And they got this little guide here to say this is the screw you should take out first I guess. I can't take it apart for you unfortunately. But yeah, and these fans look really nice. They feel nice too. And yeah, the whole thing is basically made of metal. This is sweet. So this is the RTX 3080. Yeah, and bear in mind this is the 6800 non XT and it's a little shorter, roughly the same thickness. This is a little thicker actually. And as far as width goes, okay, the Radeon is a bit bigger. Which one weighs more. I feel like this weighs more. Let's get our scale and see. So this boy weighs about 1.29 kg or two pounds 13.5 ounces as for our Radeon 1.32 kg, two point 14. Sorry. That's not how pounds work. Two pounds, 14.5 ounces. I hate imperial. Thank you. 2.91 pounds. So yeah, this is a little bit heavier and I guess that would be expected because they're not really relying on that revolutionary pass through flow-through design that Nvidia has going here. Like you can let's put it over this. Yeah. You can see through the fan. So yeah, they don't have that going for them. This is just a straight, traditional blow through the, what's that? Oh, I bit my tongue. So this is just the traditional type of exhausting to the case kind of cooler. So this is what it's competing against. The RTX 3070 and that is quite a size difference. And if I were to plop this down onto this that's not even a kilogram, which is two pounds, 2.8 ounces. But then again, I mean, this is the thing it's not directly competing which is kind of unfortunate because like how do we compare, like what this is compared to. Nothing. It doesn't compare to anything. This is gonna be a real nightmare to benchmark. It's closer to a 3080 than a 3070. Let's just put it that way. That's a very good segue into the 6800 XT which is a good $70 more. I think - [Jono] You had a good, really good segue to the sponsor. - Oh, I'm being told that I should have segue to the sponsor instead of this other card. Well, that's me for you, I guess. Thanks to SteelSeries for sponsoring this the SteelSeries Aerox 3 wireless is the newest mouse by SteelSeries. That weighs only 66 grams making it one of the latest mice available and uses quantum wireless 2.0 for nearly zero latency for speed and stability it can use 2.4 gigahertz RF and Bluetooth connections along with a USB type C for fast charging end up with a 40 hours of battery life in 15 minutes awkward barrier technology makes it the first IP 54 dust and splash resistant gaming mouse. Go to steelseries.com to check out the Aerox 3 wireless today. Let's unbox this guy. There is also an unbroken seal here, but this box is much more substantial. I slashed the box. Just in case anyone's wondering there's basically nothing on the back of the box. Now this is the one that everyone wants to see. This is the one that everyone's kind of salivating over, aside with a 6900 XT, which is much nicer. Here we go. Welcome to the red team. You've joined a select community with an uncompromising passion for premium gaming that share desires at the heart of everything we do. It's why we've engineered the fastest AMD Radeon RX graphics cards ever to deliver a powerful gaming experience, have fun #AMDRedTeam. And then we had this useless little, thing again. It doesn't look much different, - [Jono] He thick! - But it feels different. Yeah. That is a thick stack of fins right there. Is it roughly the same size though? Yeah, it kinda is. There's more fan area. They're not more dense but they are definitely taller, but I know what this is. This is the 6800 XT and on the top, we've got exactly the same selection of ports. We have USB type C, two display port with displacement and compression 1.4 and the HDMI 2.1 which presumably is the full 48 gigabits per second. I was hoping that I would have more to say about this, but it's just thicker. That's kind of weird. The Radeon text is a different color. So this is just red. This looks like it might be glossy or maybe it might even be hiding some RGB who knows. All right, let's see how much this guy weighs. 1.366 kg, three pounds, 0.2 ounces. You're probably gonna want a GPU brace to support this guy. Good thing there's actually partner cards that are going to be coming out with a built-in liquid cooling. Note that AMD says that it's necessary actually, because both of these cards. And in fact even the 6900 XT are going to be potentially less power hungry and less thermally bad than either of these. Yeah, the 6800 XT is 250 Watts with a 650 Watt recommended power supply while the 6800 XT is 300 Watts with recommended 750 watt power supply. And that is exactly the same as the 6900 XT, despite that card's extra power which is interesting because the only real difference between this card and the 6900 XT is that this card has eight pure compute units. So this is 60 compute units. This is 72 and the big boy is 80. Each one of those has a Ray accelerator that AMD is adding for the first time in this generation. And presumably it'll just work with any game that supports RTX which is just really fancy words for Vulkan Raytracing or DirectX Raytracing. Interestingly, AMD is marketing both of these cards towards people who might have a GTX 1080 ti and they wanted to upgrade to something that's gonna handle a little bit higher frame rates or even Raytracing. The 6800 non XT AMD is kind of aiming at people who have 1440P or 1080P high refresh rate monitors, that they want to really drive at higher visual fidelity and higher frame rates. The 6800 XT is aimed more towards people who have 4k displays or 1440P high refresh rate displays who not only want to have that high refresh rate high gaming, new frame rate experience but also have the power to do a lot of sightseeing. So things like Rise of the Tomb Raider Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Minecraft RTX, that kind of thing. You know if you're looking at what is the best bang for the buck it really depends on what you're doing. If you're doing streaming or anything, really with, you know work from home, conferencing, that kind of thing. Then the 3070 is better all-rounder than this, even though this is more powerful. Really depends on what your priorities are. This guy though is actually priced below the 3080, meaning that you have less of a do I wanna go higher for less but better performance and more of a do I want to go lower for less, but the same or better performance? I think this is the better value proposition, personally but you know, your mileage may vary. Some people might prefer to have a little bit extra horsepower and they don't care about RTX voice noise canceling or anything like that. They just want the frames or maybe they're into content creation. All of them cards on lineup from the 6800, all the way up to the 6900 XT, not only have 16 gigabytes of GDDR6 memory but they also have 128 megabytes of Infinity Cache which is something that AMD is saying runs 1.6 terabytes per second, in terms of speed, which is about three plus times faster than the main memory in this card. It's ridiculous. But at the same time for a lot of the things that your GPU is going to be doing it's not going to be like that major I'm gonna write the whole video memory back again kind of deal you know. It's gonna be the same kind of thing that's updating over and over and over again, while you have your assets all in the main memory. So in that respect AMD might have the right idea here. They're saving money on the memory and then just giving you the same amount of memory across the board. And then they're just going to give you really fast cache memory. That's on the actual GPU diet itself. It's an interesting take on things and I'm very excited to figure out whether or not that's actually going to help them. Obviously I haven't tested these yet. And you guys won't know until I think two days from now whether or not it's any good. Aside from that the only question that's really left to answer is will it be available at launch 'cause Nvidia has had nothing but problems with their RTX 3000 series and AMD's launch of Ryzen 5000 has been similarly disastrous. And I mean, depending on who you ask that's because it's a paper launch, which I don't think is true or it could be because scalpers, which I guess is also true but it's also because there's unprecedented demand for new computers and faster parts because we just haven't had anything that was this good in a long time. So the appetite is there. People have seen that the appetite is there and they're very much willing to go out and spend the money to get it now so that they can charge you way more later. Is it gonna be the same for the Radeon RX 6000 series? According to AMD and I quote I can tell you that we've planned for a successful launch. We are working very hard to ensure we have product supplied at launch time around the world. And we were actively, working with our partners to at least be sure that we can get the products out in the hands of gamers. We do expect that we're going to have great global availability at launch, and we're really excited to get products out to as many people we can. Which I mean of course, they're gonna say that. You believe them? I don't know. I guess it all depends on actually, you know what? It doesn't depend on anything. Nobody's going to wait for our purview. You should, but most people won't. So I don't know. I guess we'll just have to see. - [Brandon] Subscribe! (laughing) - Yeah, we'll just have to see, just like you'll have to see another episode of ShortCircuit sometime later.

    "transcript": "OK check this out: Rivian owners can join Ford in charging on Teslas nationwide Supercharger network. Goodbye, neglected, broken stations! THIS is now the most seamless way to charge away from home. Start by grabbing your free adapter. Plug it in. And youre done. Literally. Theres zero setup. Charging sessions are billed through Rivianno Tesla account required. You can see the realtime cost right in the carwhich is pretty cooland the charging speed is impressive too! Though not quite as fast as some 3rd party stations! Unfortunately due to charge port location, you may find yourself blocking 2 stalls. But try get creative before resorting to that. Now, if you wanna save some dough, you can sign up for Teslas $12 monthly membership, but you have to initiate charging manually from the Tesla app which is slowerIm disappointed there isnt any VIN-binding here like with EVgo and hopefully Tesla fixes it. That said all in all, this is a huge win for EV ownership in North America. USA-USA!",

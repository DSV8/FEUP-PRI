    "transcript": "(retro music) (laughs) - Woah. That is, that is bigger than I thought it was gonna be. Oh man, that is kinda cool though. This is an arcade machine. It's like a table top. Wow. Separate controls for bass, treble and overall volume. Cinema BTL Digital. Woah, that is cool. So there's a screen somewhere in here. Looks like speakers up there. And two-player capabilities. For those of you out there that are youngsters and you've never seen something like this, this is what gaming used to look like! This came from a company called tinyarcademachines.com, they got in touch with me, they were like \"Hey, wanna check out our tiny arcade machines?\" I'm like \"Yes! Please?\" This is just the power. Some fuses, interesting okay, in case I need to replace those. So, let's get this thing plugged in and play some tiny arcade games. I'm pumped. The power for the unit is maybe this button up here? Oh! Oh! Blue lights everywhere! Woah! (epic music) What! So, this is insane. What I have here is like a bunch of emulators installed in a classic cabinet style format. I think there are 645 different games pre-installed here. I mean some of these I don't even, I haven't heard of, others, look at that! (laughs) Look at Diver Boy! Alright fine let's do it. (retro music) So I gotta go up for air and then come down, get the diamonds, not hit the fish, I'm guessing the fish are bad news. Oh! The fish electrocute me. (laughs) Stage clear! Pac-Man, Hyper Pac-Man! Alright fine. Whoo. Oh wow! Oh, how you like me now? How you like me now? What? My joystick game needs skills here. This is cool, if you're having like people over, a little party, you got this thing sitting there in your apartment or wherever, my goodness. Maybe you're having a couple drinks. This is fun! Woah! Look at this old school Superman! Alright fine. How about that soundtrack? (retro superman theme) Oh! (superman theme continues) Get outta my way! (laughs) Kung-Fu Master! Yes! Oh! That is a club banger! This is it, oh. Yes sir! Outta my way! Boom, boom! How about you? You, no, get outta, no! Hey! Whoo! I'm in this! Chase me! (screams) He throws the knife at me! Are you seeing this? Emotional connection to that one. It doesn't really matter who you are, there's some game in here, that's gonna speak to you on a, oh my, the original Mario Bros. (mario brothers theme) Wow. (laughs) No! Oh my goodness. Wow, I got passed that level, I didn't expect to. Burger Time? You're making burgers. I'm pretty impressed like, it's a fairly professional look from these guys. Oh you want level two? You wanna keep spending quarters? We'll give you level two! (retro music) That is a club banger. It's the table tennis district. Was that girl the dandy? So I get the dandy. That's the bad guy, I want his dandy. (exhales) Club banger there. With like 650 games, you're sitting down with this thing for a while before you've played everything. (teenage mutant ninja turtles theme) Tinyarcademachines.com, I'll link them down in the description, this is a really cool thing to get sent out. It's obviously way beyond the scope of stuff we normally receive so, we're gonna have fun with it and everybody who visits this studio, I'm sure is gonna, you know, sift through these games and give 'em a shot. Buy yourself your own little tabletop arcade. Maybe your wife's really cool and she lets you put it in the kitchen, I don't know, find a spot for it. Get your life together. Play some more arcade games. Jack, you gotta see how cool this screw is too here. This is like my favorite screw of all time. Right now everybody's thinking, \"Lew it's a screw, calm down.\" Cool, right? Okay fine, you're not as excited as I am.",

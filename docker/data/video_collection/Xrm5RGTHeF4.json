And competition in the all electric self driving car market is good for everyone, including the planet. Come hang out with me while I take the Faraday Future FF91 out for a test drive and see what kind of power it has hidden under its hood.   The sound you hear in the background are some BMW's doing doughnuts in a parking lot. (CES is a weird place)   The camera I used to film this video:  Wide angle lens:  This is the drone I use:   *Follow me for updates!* Instagram:  Facebook:  Twitter:  Snapchat:  GooglePlus:   TO SEND ME STUFF: See my P.0.

    "transcript": "Competition is a good thing, and Tesla has some major competition with the Faraday FF 91. This is an all electric SUV competing with the Model X. We took the Model X on a road trip from Salt Lake down here to CES. And now I'm going to take the Faraday FF 91 out for a spin. [Intro] I think it's super interesting that Tesla's named after an inventor that lived, you know, a hundred and fifty years ago who worked on the alternating current that we see in the power lines. And Faraday was yet another scientist who lived about 150-200 years ago and was one of the pioneers in electromagnetic induction. So we have two famous scientist whose names are now being used in competing electric car companies pretty awesome. So one of the extremely unique features of the Faraday future are these dual antennas on the back these little shark looking fin things, which actually give it a really strong internet connection with 350 megabits down. Which is faster than most broadband connections in the United States. You can live stream from it, you can download videos from it. And a lot of that data connection will be used for the self driving section, you know, giving updates on the road, other cars around you, things like that. The logo right here, when looked at sideways, it's actually an FF for Faraday Future. So you've seen the Model X and the Falcon wing doors. The doors on the Faraday Future are a little bit different. There's a button right here, and a button right here. And both of them are automatic and they open in opposite directions. Huge thanks to Faraday for sponsoring this video and giving me a chance to take their car out for a spin. Remember this is a pre-production model, so we're checking out the exterior and the performance of the car, and not so much the interior. That will come later when the car is actually released. So now we're inside the Faraday, the FF91. This is kind of the pre-produciton model. It's mostly just to show off the performance, you know, it's not built for comfort. We're in these bucket seats with harnesses. It's definitely not going to be what the finished car is going to look like inside. But I can already feel the power from the two motors....Oh man!!... from the two motors in the back and the one motor in the front. We can see out the front windshield right here, and then over here on the side for the rear view mirrors, they're just like this little stick with a camera in it. So it's going to be interesting with the final version where they're going to put that. Right now it's up here for like the rear view mirror. You can see each of these sides right here and over here, and then the rear here is the back camera. What happens when you honk the horn? [Honk, honk] Nice! One of the coolest things about this car is that, you know, you've seen the Tesla battery pack. There's been Tesla's dismantle and you can see like the huge rectangular battery packs. What Faraday's been using, though, is like these little modules that connect like little Legos all underneath the car. So if something goes wrong with the battery pack, they can just pop one out and replace it. And they're not limited to one solid battery pack, you know, they can increase the capacity and decrease the capacity whenever they want to. With these modules, I imagine, you know, if you damage some of the modules, you can pop out the little Lego components and replace the modules that are damages into the whole battery pack itself, which I think is pretty awesome. So the zero to sixty of this thing is 2.39 seconds. We have reached a stop sign and we are going to floor this thing and see how fast we can really go. [Music playing] Oh man!! No way dude! You can hear the tires squeal on that! Oh!! That was legit! So I'm holding the camera with my hand and the G's from that just like bent the legs of my tripod backwards towards me. That was sweet. That was so sweet! [Driver] Not everything's on the table right here, boys. [Zack] No way? [Driver] It's not 100%. [Music playing] One of the coolest things about electric cars for me, and the reason that I think they're the future, is because their electric motors don't need like a transmission to shift. You know I just bought my Toyota Tacoma, and for me to get from zero to sixty I have to shift the gear shifter 5 times. You know, let off the gas, shift the gear, let off the gas, shift the gear. But with these electric cars, they are instantly zero to sixty just straight up no shifting at all required. And that's why they are so fast. 2.39 seconds is ridiculous. 2.5 seconds is ridiculous. My Toyota Tacoma can reach zero to sixty in 7.7 seconds. That's still pretty good. Some of the safety features going on inside of the Faraday are that thing this is going to pop off with lidar, and then we have some radar up top which is pretty similar to what we saw inside of the Model X. There's also some of these same proximity sensors and stuff, so we'll have some cameras right here on the side. As well as this is the rear camera that we saw earlier that was showing up in the display off the dashboard. So as the Faraday is driving, the tires move a little bit as it turns. I think it has a turn of like 3 degrees or something like that, and that helps give a tighter turn radius than you would normally see in like a Tesla Model X. So because this car's named after Faraday, one of the scientists from the past, I think it would be cool to toss a wireless charger on the bottom of this thing so you can just roll into your garage and start charging. I think that would be a pretty sweet thumbs up to Faraday and his work with the electromagnet induction and that wireless charging stuff. Electric cars are the future. Gas powered cars are going the way of the dinosaur. Let me know what you think of this car. Would you ever buy an electric car? And what do you think of the Faraday FF91? I'm super stoked. I love the competition that's happening right now. Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you guys around.",

    "transcript": "The very first laptop I ever did a review on this channel was the 2015 XPS13. It was the first thin bezel laptop. I think it's actually one of the first thin bezel devices. And over the years four years later, we now have what I would consider basically the most perfect XPS 13 that Dell could make. This is now on its fourth iteration and it is a device that a lot of companies have learned from because at this point in time there are so many thin bezel ultrabooks on the market. But I still think that the 2019 XPS 13 is one of the best options that you can get for just over all 13 inch ultrabooks. So they've done two major changes this year. The first one is this camera up at the top of the screen. It used to be on the bottom like this is last year's version. For many years, the brought these web cameras that were always on the bottom of the screen and they're just... I don't know this is really bad camera angle looked up your nose and a lot of people complained about it. I would say for some people it was like a deal breaker for this machine. They finally fixed it. It's now at the top of the screen and it's a pretty good looking image. The second change that they've done on this device is actually an aesthetic change. So this device finally comes in a white on white finish. It's kind of like a silvery white on the surface of the device instead of the rose gold that they had last year. And also the texture is slightly different. So this material is it's like slightly rougher, not that it's like rougher sounds like it's just poor qualIty is just a more textured material, it's actually more pleasing to hold than any of the XPS 13 that have held in the past. It's hard to kind of convey this message over video but when you hold it, it's slightly grippier and it's got a more matte look to the finish. The interior is still running the woven glass fiber in this white colour which I personally really like and one of the issues that I was concerned about last year was just durability. I knew that they had mentioned that it was kind of stain resistance and stuff but this device is a year old uh this is the older one here and it's been used every day by someone not me, but it's been used every day and there's literally no change, there's no wear on the surface material like it still feels and looks exactly the same. However I do notice a slight difference in color and i'm sure if there's just a difference in manufacturing from last year's white to this year's white or if that's just how the material ages like this has a slightly warmer, like yellowish hew to the white. This looks more like pure white. I still think the old one looks perfectly good. It's just that there is a difference in color. The performance on the 2019 XPS 13 is a little bit better than last year's model. So this new one is running the 8565U Whiskey Lake quad core cpu And it's pretty good for multicore applications, but it also has an improvement in thermals but not through hardware because internally the thermal solution is the same as last year. But they have software this year that gives you full fan control and this is one of the complaints I had last year, despite it having a pretty good thermal system the fans ran a little too conservatively. But the new software allows you to push the device if you want to and even when you do the fans don't get super loud or anything Now on the inside not much has changed. Just have to remove a bunch of screws and you have access to the removable ssd but the ram and the wifi card are baked on the battery remains unchanged on this unit with 4K panel on getting around eight and half nine hours of battery life on that1080p screen, you're probably gonna push eleven hours but it just is very similar to last years model which is honestly a good thing. The ports on the device are okay. for people looking for someone that's light and very portable It kind of makes sense, three USB-Cs and one micro sd slot but for people that are just looking for just a more robust port selection there is no USB-A which is some people are going to miss that they do included dongle but it's still a dongle and dongles are never as convenient charges via usb c and it's also got the button to tell you how much battery life is on there. This is a feature that I feel like so many companies like I just wish they would do it. It's so cool, you press the button, it shows you how much batteries in there and I feel like it's a feature that is so convenient and useful but just no one seems to do anymore. So it's nice to see that the XPS devices still have it. Uh the USB-C on the left side support Thunderbolt 3 and I connected this up to the gigabyte gaming box with RTX 2070 and the performance is really good Both gaming and video editing is awesome off that gaming box. But if you're running that stuff on the internal gpu. It's a UHD 620. And quite frankly it's trash It's an internal GPU, it's what you would expect. The keyboard and track pad. These remain unchanged. I've always liked both of these on the XPS devices. It's not like the world's best keyboard also wouldn't call this the world's best track pad either. But they're very solid and I think anybody can get used to these and enjoy them. The only gripe I have with this keyboard are the page up and page down buttons. They are located right above the left and right keys. So it's pretty easy to accidentally hit them. And if you're just kind of navigating through a spreadsheet or something you actually hit page up, it's a pain in the button Uh there's also a fingerprint sensor on the power button So you can log in with windows hello via fingerprint The track pad glass surface windows precision drivers. It's a great track pad. It's a little on the small size especially nowadays like a lot of companies go with huge track pads but this one's kind of the old style in terms of its size but it's a great all-round track pad. The speakers are unchanged, they are located on the side. They sound good, good enough for what this is in an ultra book but you're not gonna get killer sound out of these. All right. I want to talk about the screens for a little bit. The unit that I have this year is 4K panel. The unit that I had last year was the 1080p panel. They're both glossy screens. They're both very good screens. This one's a little bit brighter than the 1080p panel. But if you're on the market and you're interested in this device, you are kind of deciding between the screens My vote for like ninety five percent of the people out there is to go for the 1080p screen The 4k screen does look a little bit better. It's a little bit sharper. But on a thirteen inch screen size you are not able to discern the difference in pixel density very easily. A thirteen inch 1080p panel looks very sharp. A thirteen inch 4k panel looks even sharper, but it's really hard to tell the difference at that screen size The 1080p screen isn't as color accurate as the 4k screen. But I feel like because it's more energy efficient and it's a little bit cheaper. More people should be choosing that 1080p screen instead of a 4k screen. But regardless of which one you choose, It's a solid product xps13 2019 They've done such a good job. I feel like dell improve this thing every year just a little bit They finally fixed the webcam issue that they've had since the beginning. And it's finally like this is as good as it's gonna get. I don't see dell making this that much better if at all. Uh, the one last year was running a dbrand marble skin. I'm gonna pick up another one this year skin it just to kind of keep it looking super flat. Ok. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it sub if you loved it, see guys next time.",

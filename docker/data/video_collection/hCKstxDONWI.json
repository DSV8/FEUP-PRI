    "transcript": "(people talking) - Hey, this is Dan from The Verge and I'm wearing Alexa on my face. These are the new Echo Frames which are actually glasses that have microphones and speakers embedded into them so you can speak to Alexa as if it was an Echo speaker. Now you can tell they kinda look like normal glasses here but if I take them off my face could see that there's speakers underneath the bottom of it and a couple speaker holes on each side. There's microphone holes and there's a button here to activate the Alexa voice as well as adjust the volume. Then there's a swipe control here on the side so you can swipe through things to agree to various notifications and alerts and things like that. Now what's interesting about these is Amazon is not using bone conduction for the audio. They said that they'd developed a technology where the speakers will actually fire the sound down. Now it's it's very loud in here in this demo environment. You can kinda here the Echo Studio in the other room kinda pumpin' some tunes. But if I just you know say, Alexa play some music. I get a little LED light right here in my eyebrow area and then music is gonna start playing through these speakers down to my ears. And if I crank up the volume all the way you might be able to hear it but most people really aren't gonna be able to hear it next to you. It's a very weird type of unique, personalized experience. Now part of the personalization of that is these new VIP notifications where Alexa will identify what notifications are important to you and only alert you about them on you're glasses and let the other ones worry about it on an Echo device or something like that. Now in terms of glasses, these are like standard glasses. They've got spring hinges. They're they're an acetate frame which is like fancier plastic. They feel okay. They're a bit light, they are very light in fact which makes them pretty comfortable to wear even though they have all these electronics in them. You could put prescription lenses in them. You could put sunglasses in them. They are really you know typical glasses. The way that you're gonna be able to get these is you're gonna only be able to get them through an invite only system that you can request a new invite or an invite for them starting today. Amazon says they're gonna be shipping by the end of the year and they cost $179. (whoosh) Thanks for checking these out. We've got a lot more on the site about the Echo Frames. The Echo Buds. The Echo Studio. Like Amazon announced 15 different things today. Be sure to check it out at theverge.com. We're gonna have more videos for you on YouTube. Stay tuned.",

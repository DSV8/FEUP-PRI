    "transcript": "New show here on Unbox Therapy It is called mystery deal box These are deals, products that are having a promotion right now Just for you just for unbox therapy viewers. I don't know what's inside the box I hope everything's cool Jack has apparently vetted these deals and made sure That these companies are bringing the heat when it comes to the products This first episode of the Mystery Deal Box is also Brought to you by Soylent And their new drink. It's called Coffiest It's a combination: Soylent and Coffee Now it actually doesn't taste bad, either It's got like a, well a Coffee flavor to it There's a discount on this as well so check out the description for all the details Now... Let's go ahead and jump inside the Mystery Deal Box That Mr. Jack has set up for me Look at the artwork here Oh ho ho ho Ahhhhh new- new frames! For Old Man Lew From glassesusa.com, in the description there's a crazy Promo on these If you wear glasses like I do. You wanna switch up the style Hey, who knows. Maybe you're trying to get a date with that special 'someone' Ha ha. This could be anything. Knowing Jack, this could be anything Okay, kinda similar to what I got on right now Hmmm Okay Oh, now that's a bigger frame right there So that's if you own it right there You're like \"Yeah I wear glasses.\" Oh ho Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha I kind of like those actually It's a little bit lighter on the face So the packages they got on the website; it's frames and lenses It's like a virtual tool where it'll scan your face and it'll put the glasses on your fa- Oh my. We got some sunglasses It'll put the glasses on your face in virtual space Oh Now that's- now that's a way to do Unbox Therapy right there Thank you to glassesusa.com for participating in the first Mystery Deal Box I'll continue the episode with these ones on right here Alright. Next up Headphones. I'm all about Headphones Today we've got something called Modern Portable Hifi Elite. So Jack tells me we're looking at a Budget pair of wireless Bluetooth Headphones here Around 60 bucks We've got all the controls here. On the earcup Forward, back. Answer/End phone call Play/Pause. Mini jack connector if you want to use them Non-Wireless Build quality feels decent, for sure Alright, Hold up Pairing. Pairing mode. It's Pairing Mode, Jack Bingo. \"Your phone is connected\" (Music plays) You're talking about...some thick Bass in here Big driver units. Look at the size of the earcups 59? Is that what you said 59 bucks? We might've just kicked off Mystery Deal Box With one hell of an opening episode Ohh It's a small little thing I have heard about this before It's something called Tardisk Something that fits into the SD Card slot on your Macbook and what it does, is gives you extra storage upto in this case 256 Gigabytes So obviously since we all moved to SSDs you might not have as much storage as you would like for your media files and so on This gives you instant expansion without needing to crack open your Mac book and try to swap out the SSD for a bigger one That could be expensive too 48 hour deal from the point this video is published It's gonna be 15% OFF Jack's the guy that really needs this You see his laptop BOOM 9 times out of 10 the prompt comes up \"Startup Disk almost Full\" I think this.. I think this is a sign here there a reason this was in the Mystery Deal Box Jack's trying to tell me something",

I personally would be very careful doing that this looks just like a standard USB cable but it's actually a special type of cable this is known as an O.MG cable and has a lot of extra functionality. In this example I've connected to an access point within that cable from my iPhone so I've connected to the O.MG Wi-Fi network and what I can do is browse to a website running within that O.MG cable and then I can load various scripts. In this example I'll load a script from Slot 4 a very simple script but notice what happens when I press run I'm not going to touch the iPad I'm going to simply press run and notice what happens I've been able to Rickroll you by using an O.MG cable be careful accepting cables from strangers.",

    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This is Austin. Intel and AMD have a lot to worry about right now. Why is that? - Because the Apple M1 processors that had now quite a while to show off just how powerful they are but that's just the beginning, because around the corner we have another set of even more powerful chips. The M1 X perhaps, the M2- - We don't know the name of it yet. - 1XXX - It's the exes where it's at like, you know, we, we... For the longest time we weren't sure how the Apple Silicon chips were going to do. In fact, we made a video that like you probably shouldn't get a MacBook this year. - We were wrong. - Because, yeah we were. Because they were probably gonna be bad. - What did we say? - We, well, we said that you should wait. We said you should wait. - Oh, I don't watch the videos. - And then we speculated that you probably shouldn't even if you wait, you probably should wait even longer because the first gen ones will be buggy or not great, whatever. - It doesn't sound like something I would say. - It definitely sounds like something I said. - I don't think I said any of that. - Cause I said it. - Jenny's definitely got to cut to a clip of me saying the exact thing right now to make me look dumb. \"You may want to hold off. But I think the only reason to hold off is to see what that M1X chip looks like.\" Look, the Apple M1 Macs are a clear win. - Yeah, It surprised everyone. - Like and it shouldn't have in some ways because when you look at what that M1 chip is it's basically what you've already seen on the iPad, right? It's a souped up version of that. They've certainly made some changes, but what they've done between the hardware and the software is really incredible, right. I know how the 13 inch Mac book which is essentially as powerful as my old 16 inch Mac book, but it is thinner, it is lighter and it is essentially silent. That is a huge, huge win. And it has like twice the battery life. - Yes. But that's just the beginning because these only... We only have a few M1 max available. We have the Mac mini, the MacBook Air, and the MacBook-Pro 13. We don't have the 16 inch Mac book, IMAX, any of the higher end systems like that Mac Pro which you are going to have 700 cores. - Not quite 700 cores. - 150 cores. - The current models that we have available are all using pretty much the same exact chip. The Air is slightly... One of the cores is deactivated from the GPU. Yeah so, other than that, they're pretty, they're pretty similar. And so what the reports are saying with the M1X is that there's going to be maybe three variants of it where it's a 12 core, a 16 core and a 24 core- - I guess 28. - 28 core? - I don't know a ton of cores. So essentially what they're going to do is they have the four efficiency cores which are going to be standard across the board. You don't need more than four efficiency cores. You want those high power cores. So essentially they're going to load it up and make a mega chip, which I would assume also either has a huge graphics card built in or you have an external GPU for something like the Mac Pro. - Yeah, cause currently you cannot use an external GPU with any of the current M1 stuff. There's just not enough PCie lanes available with that current chip. The chip is probably still going to be again the same chip and just having cores activated or not activated according to some of the rumors. - Yeah so, there's a lot to break down here. So we want to put our technical nerd hats on for a second. Traditionally, when you build, say your Intel and you build a 28 core CPU, well you're building a 28 core die but there's always going to be some percentage of those cores, which are not going to work, right? So instead of just taking those chips and throwing them out, you may instead turn off four of them and then sell that 28 core chip as a 24 CPU core, right. Which is again, what Apple is doing, right. With some of their M1 chips, they have fewer GPU cores. I guarantee is because some of those chips were close but not quite good enough. So instead of completely throwing them away they bend them off. This is very common. Everyone does it across the board, right. Now, this is especially important when it comes to larger chips. So another example here is if you take a look at the graphics card side of the equation. So something like an RTX, 30-90 versus a 30-80, or 30-70, 30-60. While, yes they have a wide range of cards. Most of these actually boil down to a couple of graphics chips, a couple of actual GPU's and then they will then carve out and bend things down. But that's especially important when you get into these very high-end chips, because sure they can make an M1, which is like eight cores, It's fairly small. But when you start putting 28 cores on a CPU die you're going to just simply have a lot of those CPU's which are not going to be good, right. - The question I'm going to have is who's gonna make that one. Is it like, cause Apple does not make their own discreet GPU's. Is it going to be an AMD GPU, which is... is it gonna be an Nvidia one? - Apple. - Apple, all Apple. - So, here's my call. Put it straight down on wall street bets, quote me as of today, whatever day this video is being posted. The way that Apple is going to approach their high end. So I'm going to say, this is specifically for the Mac Pro although it may also apply for things like the iMac and the sixteens- - We'll circle around back to the Mac Pro. - Yes. Regardless, I'm thinking like this is the top end the highest end Mac that you'll be able to buy. When they finally completed the transition. They're going to have that 20, 24, 28 core. They're going to have their top end CPU. - There's even reports of 128 core GPU. - But I think that's going to be separate because here's the thing, no matter who you are, no matter how much money you have, if you're Apple Inc, there's still limits to the laws of physics. And specifically when it comes to building these chips, the larger the chip the more likely they're going to be defects, the smaller the actual rate of return. If you send a whole way for it and then you get one chip out of it, I don't care if you're Apple or not. You're simply not going to be able to make money throwing up that many, right? So my thought is, they're going to split it up like everyone else in the PC space, when you get to the high end. Where you're going to have your CPU, it may have a little bit of stuff. Like obviously it'll have a lot of the other things that are built in from the M1. Maybe they'll have a little bit of graphics power, but generally speaking, I assume that it's going to have a ton of PCie lanes. You're going to throw in a dedicated Apple graphics card which is not even that crazy because they not only already developed their own GPU's, right which are inside the iPhones and inside the M1's but they also even sell their dedicated accelerator cards. You look at the current Mac Pro, it also ships with an optional afterburner card which is manufactured by Apple. To be fair, that is not a GPU. That is a Asic, A.S.I.C. And I don't know what that stands for. Regardless, it is a specific chip and a specific card that Apple create and they've sold. That's what they're going to do. So one of the issues, and I say issues, not really but issues as you scale to these very large CPU's and everything. So if you look at the M1, that is a full package, right? So everything you need, including the memory, the Ram, is all built into the package, right. Which is part of the reason why you can only get 16 gigs of Ram on these M1 max. As you start to scale out, some of that is going to have to be pulled away, right? So like, I don't assume, especially if they're supporting one and a half terabytes of Ram on the Mac Pro today, you're going to have to have extra more memory right. And why not have the graphics cards too because it is so much, it makes so much more sense to have a lot of the stuff that's built in, right. So you have your CPU, you have, again, maybe some base level- - But that's where they're getting some of that efficiency, just having it all on the same chip. - Again, for stuff like the iMac and the 60 inch MacBook, there may be a hybrid. They may sell something that has external memory but the GPU's built in or maybe it has a small GPU, which is right set beside the chip, or maybe it's a GPU and CPU and it's on the same chip, but the two physical dies. - So, part of these reports along is that there's going to be like, a half size Mac Pro. I'm curious, like, I'm, I'm interested in that. And I'm curious as whether it's half size because it doesn't need to be as large with heating, the cooling for the Mac Pro doesn't have to be as intense, whether it's half size, just because it's meant to be a Mac semi-Pro or- - Like a more entry level- - Yeah, which may be only has one or two PCie slot, like somewhere in between the Mac mini that gives you some of those Pro features, but not... How many are in the Mac Pro right now? - I don't know, there's like six or seven Pcle- - Yes, it's a lot, which obviously having that many slots just physically takes up a lot of room. - Sure. - So that's why I'm curious to see if it's going to be an entirely new product line to kind of slot in there, but I don't know, like there's a lot of benefits to this, that there's really no negative sides to any of this especially after what we've seen what the the M1 can do. - A big question going into this and before we sell M1 but even now can Apple build the most powerful computers? Which has never really been a thing even in the power PC days. I mean, maybe there are a couple of moments where they were closed, but like really they never had that full performance leadership. But the basic building blocks of what they have, are the best in the business, right? The CPU cores that they've developed are incredibly performing, right? I mean, the way that a single CPU core can basically use up all the bandwidth of a system is crazy town, right? These are wide, these are fast CPU's. They might not clock crazy high, but they take up so little power that is truly impressive. What they've been able to do right out of the gate with the M1X, right? These are, I mean, one M1X core is roughly equivalent to a Ryzen 5,000 core which is already pretty much the best on the desktop. And you're talking about something which is over an order of magnitude less power, right? A very, very impressive. You load this up with 28 of these cores, this is going to chew through everything. I think there's a real argument, that 2021 is the year that we will see multiple max ship with the most powerful chips, CPU's maybe even GPU's but specifically the most powerful CPU's that you can buy full stop the end, no caveats. Which is crazy, I guess, in the last one caveat. And let's talk about some crazy server thing but in like an actual consumer machine. - Yeah, which I think they're really po... And that's why, like, I agree with you. I think they're poised to do that. I'm just afraid whether they'll pull the trigger on that because you know, there's plenty of times where we've said similar things about not quite that they're going to make the most powerful CPU's but like, you know, we said, okay here's all the things it can do for the next MacBook or here's all the things they can do for the Mac Pros. And then they, they kind of, they do a very safe rollout of it. - Apple is a company, which is very complicated, right? But one thing that they have had a real track record of, is the chip team inside Apple are goddamn rock stars. They blow everyone and everything away. And they have consistently killed the game ever since the Apple A7 came out, right. That was the chip inside the iPhone 5S, where they brought forward 64 bit, which might not sound all that impressive today. But they brought 64 bit, literally years before anyone else was even expecting to do so. Everyone scrambled to try to catch up, right. And Apple had the best processors in any phone ever since the iPhone 5S. Now they're essentially doing that with the Mac. They've replaced the Intel chips they used to have with stuff which is better in every possible way. And you can see the clear progression of the M1 is, even though it is a huge step forward, isn't that great. Look, it's very much like they could have put that chip in an iPad and everyone be like, \"Oh cool, whatever.\" But because we have it in a Mac, we have the full capability of a real desktop operating system to take a look at. I can so easily see how they scaled this up. - On paper, Rosetta two sounded borderline magic. And so- - I mean it still does. - Yeah, but like to see it firsthand, like, you know there's so many things that work even better. One of the things that I was like super excited for and then super bummed out immediately was the amount of iOS apps that were available. So like when it was pitched, there's like any iOS app can work on here which theoretically it can however the developers have to turn that on and- - Or they need to leave it on because essentially out of the gate, unless you didn't do anything that your app will be available on Mac, but most developers like this is going to suck, turn off. - Yes so, of the apps I use on my phone, the only one that's available is Apollo Reddit. I'm excited to see where they can go with the M1Xes. - I'm going to hit you with that hypothetically. - Yeah, let's hit me. - Okay, so what happens when a few months from now, six months, nine months, whatever the case is, the most powerful computer in the world is a Mac. And not only that, maybe not of the world, Lions Michelle built something better, but something doesn't cost $400,000. What happens when people start switching to Macs because they are more powerful? What happens when people start realizing that these computers have completely owned everyone else and they built such a lead, right? I don't think this is a crazy conversation we're having right now. - The thing that people use power for the most, with their CPU is gaming. - I can't think of anything else now. - Which the- - No mention of all the power though. It's right. - But I mean, until developers start saying like, \"Oh, I'm going to start making all these games for-\" - Games, get out of here. - But like- - Nah, nah. No it's all about my final cut. I want my final cut export videos in three seconds. I want you to see the next episode of 'This Is' four minutes faster than you would have because the M1X Mac exported it in the time it took me to blink my eye. - It benefits us all day long. Every time we talk about Mac, the comment that just comes up is, but I can't game on it. So if you watch our video about what we're looking for in the next gen of consoles, I basically say that every problem that gaming has right now is solved by cloud gaming. - Thank you very much for watching. Make sure to subscribe to This Is for more Kanye West references and demonetization. Don't forget to ring a dang the Dingaling button. And until next time, thank you very much for watching. And if you'll excuse us Matt is going to continue his descent into my beautiful dark twisted fantasy. (bright upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "I've purchased a new watch but this isn't like other watches this is a Wi-Fi detho watch allows me to attack Wi-Fi networks as always with these kinds of devices only attack networks that you have permission to attack or that you own in this example I've got a phone and a laptop connected to a Wi-Fi network I can access the internet on this phone I'll also start a continuous ping on this laptop and hopefully you can see that this laptop is able to Ping google.com but what happens when I start the deor tack so I'll press Start packets are now being sent into the network de oring clients and what you should see is the laptop can no longer ping google.com I have deor this laptop from the Wi-Fi network on the phone try and go to YouTube It's failing because the device has been kicked off the Wi-Fi network if I go and look at my Wi-Fi settings and try and connect to my Wi-Fi network it says connection pH try and do that again connection failed devices are no longer able to access the internet because deor packets are being sent from the watch to the Wi-Fi access point this little access point right over here kicking clients off the network okay I'll stop the deor attack and what you should notice hopefully is that pings start succeeding on the laptop and there you go and if I connect back to the Wi-Fi network I'm able to do that I'm connected now and I should be able to go to youtube.com which I can under ssids you can specify the clone of access points so you can see I'm cloning a whole bunch here or you could go with a random mode to create a bunch of random access points so I'll go back back again deny access beacons and start and what I'll do here is look at the different Wi-Fi networks and you can see a bunch of fake Wi-Fi networks exist you could use Rick Roll Nam share one caveat with this watch is it only supports 2.4 GHz and not 5 GHz but it's a fantastic little device for testing and demonstration purposes now this is called the Wi-Fi Commander not a Wi-Fi de arthor even though it supports de oror tax and other types of attacks this is very similar once again to this watch that I've demonstrated and that's very similar to the Wi-Fi nugget as well as the meltronics de author now we're told that it's got a 1.5 in OLED display it's got a digital Crown control now this was made in England which is interesting not that much stuff is made in England these days it's a trademark of code junkies once again I purchased this they are not sponsoring this video they don't know that I'm even making this video that's enough talking let's unbox this not great packaging if you like very basic so I got this from Amazon so what we get is the watch and a cable that's it so that's the unboxing experience nothing fancy but it definitely looks more like a watch than this does it's got a rub a strap here the strap isn't as nice I mean that doesn't look like a watch this does so what's interesting is this didn't come with any instructions no instructions at all but again that looks much more like a watch than what this thing does but the proof of the pudding is can it actually do what they say it can now there are some issues with this device I found that the battery doesn't last that long I probably need to charge it for longer before I continue with the demonstrations also the one that I got the charger is covered here so the only way to charge this is to pop it up out of the watch and I saw on Amazon the reviews are quite bad because people have found that it's broken when they've popped it out or popped it back in but that hasn't been my experience so what you got to do is you got to use a micro USB cable one is supplied with the watch and now it works as you can see it's powered up properly now so you could just use it like this but obviously it makes more sense to use this as a watch but you could just hold it like this in your palm of your hand as an example the power of the Sun in the palm of my hand an attack Networks in the same way I mean that's a very small device that could be hidden in your hand this is basically a better version of the previous watch that I've demonstrated lot lot smaller looks more like a watch than this thing does remember the caveat with this is it only supports 2.4 GHz that is made clear on the box only 2.4 GHz is supported okay once you turn the watch on we can see that this is authorized by space Hardware by code junkies when it boots up you're probably going to want to scan for Wi-Fi networks and you can scan for either access points or stations themselves I'm going to scan for both now I have found that this doesn't always work the display shows that there are zero access points even though it's actually picking up access points as you can see here it's picked up one station but again that information is incorrect and I've found that it freezes here so I'm going to Simply press the button again I'm going to go back and then I'm going to select an access point so select and then access points I'm going to select the access point that we're going to attack which is the TP Link 2.4 GHz that's this little TP Link link right over here again only ever attack networks that you own or have permission to attack so I'm going to select that and I'm going to go back and back again and now we can deny access so select that option and let's say as an example specify deor and then start de oring and what you'll notice over here is pings are now timing out so this device can no longer access the internet so on the phone I'll press go notice no internet is available so we have success sucessfully deauth to the network you can see that we're sending packets but if I stop that we should see is on the Windows computer PS should start working again which they do so deor attac has now been stopped so it's as simple as that once again to launch a deor attac using this watch really cool that it's so much smaller than the previous generations that I've demonstrated just looks like a standard sports watch as an example now another option here is to send beacons I'll select beacons and then I'll scroll down and start the attack so beacons are being sent out into the network now now this can be used to fake the real Network or just Spam the air with a bunch of fake networks so as an example if I go to Wi-Fi and look at the Wi-Fi networks notice I'm suddenly seeing a whole bunch of TPL link networks many of them these are all fake networks so I'll stop that attack and go back the reason I was able to do that is under ssids you you can specify the clone of access points so you can see I'm cloning a whole bunch here or you could go with a random mode to create a bunch of random access points so I'll go back back again deny access beacons and start and what I'll do here is look at the different Wi-Fi networks and you can see a bunch of fake Wi-Fi networks exist you could use Rick Roll name share but as you can see a whole bunch of random ssids are now being broadcast by the watch now various other options are also supported so I can go back and then I could do a packet monitor as an example and monitor packets in the network so I can see what's going on now one of the options with the watch is you can actually connect to it remotely so I'm going to select the Ping SSID we told that this is an open network I'm okay with that so I'm going to connect to to the open network called Pang so I'm now connected to that Network and in my browser so I'm going to browse to 1921 16841 and as you can see a web page is opened we told that this project is a proof of concept for testing and educational purposes only the watch uses an esp8266 so we warned that the esp8266 chip and the SDK are not built for real world purposes they only Built for testing and education purposes and bugs can occur and we told the only use this against our own networks and devices which I'm doing so you can get more information on GitHub once again space hun or space chicken if you use the English translation has more information on his website and I said I've read the notice and what I'll do here is Click reload and that shows me the various Wi-Fi networks so I can see the encryption used I can see the MAC address I can see the power whole bunch of information about Wi-Fi networks I can also see client devices so if I go to ssids I could clone an SSID or add one and I could enable random mode so at the moment clicking reload a bunch of them are random so a whole bunch of random ssids I'll remove those and click reload now again you could add your own ssids here and um do a Rick Roll SSID as an example so under deny we could start a deauth attack we could start a beacon attack we could start probing they also give us a nice explanation of what each does so Beacon packets are used to advertise access points deal I've demonstrated where we knock clients off a network and probes are sent by client devices to ask if a known network is nearby you can use this attack to confuse Wi-Fi trackers by asking for networks that you specified in the SSID list I could go to settings and reboot the device as an example or reset it now I've put links below to space Hun's GitHub page where you can get a lot of information about the ESP 82660 author that he created fantastic project he gives you information about how it works I've also put a link to Amazon where I bought this can see the ratings here are terrible but there is an overview of the device on Amazon and you can have a look at their website to get more information again I think it's a great little tools for demonstration purposes it only supports 2.4 GHz however doesn't always work with modern access points even when they use 2.4 GHz so if you want to stop kids using devices like this from pranking you or destroying your Wi-Fi network or you want to stop hackers that have more powerful devices that can do something similar use wp3 with a strong password not just numbers but mixed characters uppercase lowercase special characters etc make the password long use WPA version 3 use 5 GHz use 6 GHz hope you enjoyed

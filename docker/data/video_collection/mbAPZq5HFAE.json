    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going, it's Justine. Welcome to day two of CES, and today we are not actually going over to the convention center. We're at the Sands Expo. So this is kind of like an off-shoot of the convention center. Over here is a ton of smart home tech, which is my absolute favorite. So, let's go see what we can see! (upbeat music) So I found something that I'm really into. Sleeping. (upbeat music) We're talking about smart sleep, we're here at the Phillips booth. Now what exactly is going on here? Because this looks very high tech. - Oh it is very high tech. It's actually our newest, it's a new to world technology called smart sleep. And what it does, it enhances deep sleep. And people who typically get less than seven hours of sleep at night. - Mmm Hmm. - Has sensors in the forehead and behind the ear. They track your sleep and then sends a tone, and that tone, it enhances those slow waves and makes them long and strong again. - I started freaking out, I was like, \"Guys, it's David!\" I just saw you walking. We, I went to your show, I think it was like last year, I went through the tour of his incredible museum. - You gotta come back we just redid it, we have it four times as big. It's incredible. - Please! I would love to. Oh my gosh, that would be so awesome. - We just talked about you yesterday, about all the stuff that you're doing and it's great. - That's so cool I'm such a huge fan and I've been following you for so long and this is so great! Are you doing CES? - Well, I'm seeing everything that's new. You know, of course I use technology in my show. - He does. - And I try to use technology where people don't know it. So even the inventors of these things, I disguise it in a way, - Yeah. - So they're amazed by it, so. - It's amazing. - It's a great place to, what do you do here? You're just checking it out? - We're just like covering and finding cool stuff. But yeah, I think the thing that I do love abour your show is he uses technology. If you guys have never seen a David Copperfield show, you have to go and just witness it. Because it really is incredible. And I think you're pushing the boundaries as far as magic, technology and just bringing the fun back to it. - We got dinosaurs and spaceships. - Yeah, there's a space ship. - It's pretty cool. - It's so good. One of the things that I love to do at CES is obviously go around and find cool things. This booth, behind me, I have absolutely non idea what it is. There's no branding, it basically looks like a huge Call of Duty map. They gave me a blindfold to go in, and I know nothing about what it is. So I'm, number one, slightly terrified. Number two, there's some security guards in the back, and it says, \"authorized personnel only.\" So really, I don't even know what to expect. Oh. that's some industrial Velcro. (laughs) Oh my gosh. Now, what do I do? I don't know what to expect. - [Man] Move, move, move, move. - [Justine] I hear some music. Oh, Oh my gosh. I have no idea what's going on right now. (laughs) - [Woman] Please remove your blindfolds. (electronic pulses) (electronic pulses) - What's, what's happening right now? (pulsing music) Are we still at CES? - Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. I am here of my own free will. (digital music) - [Man] Free. - [Woman] Free. - No flash photography. - Put your blind folds on. - Out, get him out of here. - Put your blind folds on. - [Tall Man] You were told, no flash photography. - [Woman] Put your blindfolds on. - I don't know what, I have no idea what's going on. I don't know where Nick is. I don't know if I'm talking to myself. Am I talking to the camera? Nick? - I am here of my own free will. (digital music) - Excellent. You see. It's just that easy. So, volunteers for the procedure. - Oh, do we, not supposed to volunteer? - Get out! Both of you, get out! You ruined it. You ruined it, out, out, all of you, out. Out, get out! Get out, all of you! - Did I, did I ruin it? - You ruined it. - I just got kicked out. I thought, I thought I was supposed to volunteer. I was tribute! What is happening right now? - Welcome to the future of skincare. Um, what you just experienced, was a complete simulation of the technology that we've integrated into our newest release. Foreo being the largest beauty device brand, we wanted to create something that really broke barriers, and what you experienced was really that human experience of what we're doing. So, I'm sure you've seen people sit for 20 minutes in our mask or done it yourself. - Oh yes. We've definitely done tons of the mask challenges, on YouTube. - I do love 'em. So like you experiences, we have a cryotherapy, which is a cold treatment in this. We also have the thermotherapy, I just turn the device on, so it's pre-heating. We're gonna start with thermotherapy. When you are at home, you put the cartridge on, and you do a (sharp inhale) 90 minute treatment. - It's warm. - It goes up to 102 degrees. - Wow. - But we'll sequence it. You'll scan your mask with your phone and then that will program your device. - That's so cool. - So, - So there's basically an app for your mask. - Absolutely. - Is what you're saying. Oh my goodness. - So, and then it'll go through and you'll soon feel some pulsations which made us famous in our cleansing devices. - Yeah. - Like the Luna. As well as, what you're seeing there with the red light, is RGB, LED light therapy. And so what that does is stimulate collagen, also is age-defying. - This is definitely not what I expected. I mean, this is something that you see at Comic-Con, where you're running through, like, a zombie maze and you're getting attacked, and then you come out and they're like, \"Voila, we've got a nice face mask for you.\" This is the best zombie apocalypse ever. I don't want to spoil it for anybody else. But that was wild. (upbeat music) Do you think I need one of these, Jenna? - Well, I think we both need it. - It's like I'm in a club. And there's music. Okay, we probably should get one, right? - I'm in this sauna with Justine. - Hey. - This is nice. - Click bait title. (laughs) - This is like a little house. - Oh, that is nice. Wow, wow. (upbeat music) There's always fun little gems that I'll find, but this is actually super surprising. I always use Phillips toothbrushes, but look at his. This is something I didn't even know existed. This cup is a charger. Most people take their toothbrush and just throw it in a cup. Well now when you do it, it's actually functional. This is charging the toothbrush. So this is called \"The One.\" It's a smart piano and it's really cool because it basically turns learning to play the piano into a game. I just tried to read sheet music for the first time in my entire life and I managed to play a song. There's LEDs that run along the piano and they light up, so it'll let you know what you have to press. And another cool thing, they said that they launched here at CES, is an LED panel, so if you already have a piano, you can also use the software. Auto open, close lid, heated seat, dryer, deodorizer. Wow-wy. I made a mistake when I started these CES videos, I should have been doing a Wow-wy factor. A wow-wy from scales one to 10. (digital music) What's happening? And how do I get that outfit? 'Cause it's incredible. This is so shocking, 'cause I was like, \"the dress is changing colors.\" It's kind of like the dress, like what color is the dress? Is this just, e ink tech? - [Woman] So, like, your kindle reader, but it's on a dress. - Wow. How do I do it? - I don't know really how to do that but that guy knows how to do that. - Oh. I'm not really sure what part of CES we ended up at right now. Not sure if I'm comfortable or what's up. It is a fire extinguisher gun. This is the future. I mean it is a mirror, and I do feel like this is a future black mirror episode. I mean, this mirror is connected to the internet, I can use filters, there's app. It runs on Android. And it has a built in camera. Okay, here we go. All focus up. This is running, freaking windows? The simplest things. I am so easily entertained. Hey, come look at this. So one of the things that Tile announced here at CES, is they're going to be doing more third party integrations. So, taking the Tile technology and putting it into existing things. Like this. This is a Herschel wallet. They made this custom, so it has a nice place for your Tile to go. This is key smart, it's not made by Tile, but it's using the Tile integrations. So instead of attaching a key chain Tile, to your keys, you attach your keys to this awesome little key chain here. Okay, well that's not a key. That's for popping bottles. There's a flashlight, too? Wow. No! I'm enjoying so many of the small ,simple things here at CES. So in some of the newer wireless Bose headphones they have Tile built into it. So you can just use the Tile app to find your headphones. This is probably one of the smartest things that I've ever seen because how many times do you guys lose your apple remote? All the time. So one of the new things that they also announced at CES, is Tile integration with Google and Alexa. Can you hear me? He can hear me, this is great. - So let's do like a little demonstration. - Okay. - Let's say that we lost our keys. We could say, \"Hey Google, ask Tile to ring my keys.\" (electronic ringing) - [Alexa] Sure, here's Tile. - There it is. - [Tile] I'm near your keys. - Where are my keys? Oh, - Behind you, right over there. - Found them. - Ask Tile to find my phone. - [Alexa] Alright. (phone rings) Over-writes, - Found! - [Tile] I'm ringing your phone. - Found. - The amount of times that I've heard that specific ringtone, you guys know I lose my phone a lot. (laughs) - Ask Tile where my backpack is. - [Tile] Your backpack was last at 2101... - It will tell you the address, - No way. - Of where it was last checked in. So you can go to that address, retrace your steps, find your backpack. - We just got word that Shaq is here and he's playing a video game. So let's go see it. - [Shaq] I want a rematch, the next year, $10,000 purse. (audience wow's) - [Man] 10 commentator hits. - We saw him. And now we leave. Okay. One of the things that I was really excited about CES is finding smart doorbells, but it's really crazy 'cause I can't find any of them anywhere. See that was a joke guys, because they are absolutely everywhere. Every turn that you take, there are smart doorbells and smart outdoor lights. It's wild. Now let's go, because we're already 15 minutes past the time that we should be here. We have started and ended the day at Starbucks. The only difference between the end of CES, is normally the Starbucks line is all the way, wrapping around here. All the way to there. But guess what? Nobody here now, baby. Just us. (upbeat music)",

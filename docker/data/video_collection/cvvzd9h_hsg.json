    "transcript": "We got a new PC build for you in the System76 Nebula49. I know System76 for their all-in-ones, like their Linux laptop desktop stuff, specifically the Launch keyboard that I think Emily unboxed on this very channel about a year ago now. I did not know, but they make cases. And as a big case fan, we're gonna build a computer in it. One thing that I'm a little interested in is I don't believe this is a glass side panel. So it's nice and vented, kind of like what we saw with in the Fractal North, where it had a mesh optional panel. And aside from that, they've got a few cool designs on it. Ooh, I like this bag. Look, it even says, look at that, beautiful. Got a couple of little cards in here. How to swap your accent. So this really cool thing about this case is that this is actually an accent panel that you can take off. I love this astronaut. It reminds me of the Always Has Been meme, and I kind of wish you could just paint your own other guy there, or one around the corner with a gun in his hand. That'd be great. Honestly, it looks like a nice case. It's aluminum, so it's not super heavy. Not the biggest, like this is ATX, but it's also not ginormous. So we actually went with a slightly kind of more mid-range budget. There's a 4070 that we're gonna put in here instead of a 4090, because I think the card is just a bit too long for it. Let's see, we've got some screws on the back. They do advertise these as tool optional, and it's true. I was able to get them out for the most part, but they were a little larger, so it wasn't as hard on my little fingies. That'd be kind of nice. Luckily, these screws are compatible with the LTT screwdriver, but I mean, hey, what isn't? Say the line! While there is a ton of side ventilation here, there is nothing on the front panel, and they do claim that it can cool all of the beefiest components that can fit inside here. I do believe that side panel is a lot of cooling, but it's a little unorthodox these days. And if you're going for a radiator or some kind of like a top ventilation system with just some case fans, you're not gonna find that here. It is fully sealed. I admittedly really like this look, and one thing that's nice about that, if you put this under your desk, you don't have to worry so much about spilling water or something on it. It's a minor thing, but you know, accidents happen. One thing I actually love though is this big power button here. Oh, that's a really nice click actually. What would be great is if you could get this in different colors, even if it was just like brass and silver, that'd be nice. One thing I noticed as well while just handling the case is I don't know what kind of finish is on here, but your fingerprints, watch this, they're gonna slowly vanish away. There they go. Where are they? It's like I never touched the case at all. So yeah, don't worry about touching, getting your hands all over this and making it filthy like I probably would. It's gonna clean itself. I don't know how it's doing it, but it looks great. Pinch and slide. Oh yeah, there it comes. Now how do I, I don't wanna break anything. We didn't get an extra accent panel. Oh, that was nice. Okay, they've got these little sockets in here, so you just pop it in and then push it up and it'll stay in place. While I do love the cool graphics that they've got on the accent panel, I do kind of wish that it was a more complete artwork. Maybe a larger accent panel in the future would be super cool to see here. As for IO, you're not getting a ton. It's admittedly just USB-A, USB-C, and then an in-out for headset stuff, but it's okay. It's good enough. Just, you know, maybe two USB-As would be real nice. At least you've got a USB-C. I'll give them that. Oh! Wow! Look at that. Beauty. They've got what appears to be a fan hub up here for one, two, three, four fans. So your front panel plugs into this through this little guy here. So instead of doing front air intake, they're doing bottom air intake, which is okay. As long as it's getting enough oxygen, it should, because of these lengthy feet, you should be good to go. And then it's got a single exhaust on the back. I love the 76 stamp right here as well, the punch out or whatever on the aluminum. And then on top of that, they've also got System 76 silk-screened on all the daughter boards and SATA backplanes. On the bottom here, we've got a little, what I'm assuming is a hardware box, as well as our USB cables and HD audio. Oh, nice! So we've got some more cable ties, and then we've got fan screws, M3 screws, and standoffs. The reason they've included all those standoffs in here is because this is something I haven't had to do in a long time, like over a decade. We've got to install our own standoffs because this does not come pre-installed. This case can support anything from MATX to ATX, which is great. I think ITX as well. This is like a weird air intake. This vent here is gonna line up with this big intake right here. And what they've got is the rear exhaust fan in the back, already pre-installed. And then there's actually, ow, I'm just noticing now, they've got a space to mount another fan. So what you can basically make is like a little wind tunnel. So that's why you're not as worried about not having any front air cooling on this. It's a really interesting idea, and I can't guarantee it'll work well, but in theory it should. And then one last thing that I just noticed that's super cute, they've stamped these two little rocket ships in here, and I just think that's neat. Now, because of this super cool feature, it's gonna take us a little longer to put together our computer, because you gotta take out the CPU duct as well as the side fan bracket to throw your motherboard in here. That's pretty cool. I like how it comes out in one big unit, and then we've just got our fan and fan cable here. Next, we're gonna install our standoffs in an ATX pattern to fit our motherboard, but not before a word from our sponsor, MSI. The epic MSI savings are in full swing this holiday season, and you can save big on laptops, whether you need one for business, pleasure, or a little bit of both. Check out their Modern and Summit series if you want to increase your productivity. Those spreadsheets deserve the best. And if you're an elite gamer, they've got tons of options for you too. Check them all out using the link down below. Because this is all about the case, we've done a few little pre-installs. We've got our AMD Ryzen 7800X3D, and then a couple sticks of Crucial DDR5 memory here, along with our Noctua standoffs. Just wanna make sure my IO shield, hey. I love that good chunk sound you get when the motherboard slips right in there perfectly. One thing I'm already a big fan of is because you take so much of the exterior case off, there's all this room here to build in. So as soon as I've got my cooler down, I don't have to worry about my power supply and everything getting in the way. Like I can just plug stuff in from this side if I want to, same with the fans. So I am gonna put some thermal paste down. I'm just getting a little size fit check here, because we've gone with a slightly beefier cooler than what they recommend. Wow, it's gonna work. Ladies and gentlemen, we're in. The system 76 works. One minor complaint I have is that some of these cables for the top IO are a little short. So for example, my HD audio, I don't wanna run it down in the case because I want it nice and clean, and I want it to come from the back of the case. And if I try to do that, it just barely can't reach. Like, I don't know, I could maybe pull that a little more, but that's a little too tight. Because most of this is gonna be covered anyway, it doesn't really matter. But if I want it to take it off and show my internal cable management skills, I'm gonna want it to look nice and clean. Why can't everyone just be NZXT and use their F-panel connector thing that just pops on there? They're almost always the same. Please, it's not that bad. It took me two seconds, but like I've done this, you know, 100 times. We're gonna throw a handy-dandy Seasonic Focus Gold power supply in here. Cable's already pre-installed. Thank you to whoever did that. So we're just gonna throw this in. Lots of room. My only other complaint is the power supply is going to be just fine because it'll be screwed in, but I really wish there was something for it to rest on here. Instead, you've just got the vent and a filter on the bottom, which is fine. One minor issue we just encountered is I don't believe our case came with power supply screws. Now, they don't always come with cases, I'm pretty sure, but they don't always come with power supplies either, unless I'm just crazy. And so we had to have some 632 screws on hand to make sure we can actually screw this down. Buyer beware. That could be something you run into. Maybe ours was just missing it. Maybe we got an early sample or something. Now that we've got a power supply in, I'm gonna plug in my GPU, good old RTX 4070, MSI Ventus X3, baby. I hope I have enough power cables because I didn't prep the power supply. How much is this? Whoa, it's one eight pin. Oh my God, the system works. The System76 works. That's not the first time I've made that joke and it won't be the last. Oh, oh, this is nice. Okay, one thing that I didn't notice until just now on these PCIe slot covers, they've got these little nubbins to rest on for your graphics card. That's great. I can't stand it. Almost every case I've ever built in does not have little rests for these guys here. And so what you end up having to do is like wrestle the GPU in a place and screw it down. Nuh-uh, now it's just resting there, nice and snug. That's, oh man, that's actually a really great feature. One thing I realized while wiring everything up that I kind of didn't notice before or think about, you're never gonna see the bottom. So it doesn't matter that there's no power supply shroud. It doesn't matter that the cables are running through the front and then out the bottom. If anything, it's gonna look kind of clean. It's just a little, you know, cabley, but that's fine. It's just that old school thinking, you know, of like, oh, it's gotta be so clean on the front because I'm gonna show it off with my fancy glass panel. One thing I'm noticing on the reinstall for the side bracket for the fans is that they've actually got four different mounting points. So you can get it closer to the side panel or further away, depending on how like thick of a fan or maybe a radiator you wanna throw in here is. That's pretty nice. Now for the piece de resistance. So when you put in the CPU cooler, the wind tunnel, I really like this thing. I think it's super neat. And it absolutely fits like a glove. Wow, look at that. Oh, it doesn't fit. Oh no. Okay, so minor problem, because we're using a pretty thick fan, what we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to take out the inside fan bracket and then it'll fit, then it'll pull back and we should be fine. Hey, look at that. Now it fits like a glove. Okay, this is a little annoying. I highly recommend that you figure out this cable before you screw this down. Do not screw this down and then try to plug the fan cable in because you might have a bit of a rough time like I just kind of did right there. One kind of minor complaint that I should have seen coming based on how I had to take so much stuff apart is when you're getting everything back together, there's gonna be a lot of screws and a lot of small screws at that. So prepare yourself for the final reassembly and make sure they're all nice and close by so you don't lose any screws. All right, now we're gonna throw our wraparound side panel back on. There we go. Yeah, there we go. Wasn't too bad. It feels a little flimsy when it's just the shell and it's not screwed down, but that's probably by design so that it's really easy to actually get it over everything, especially if you've got a lot of cable bulge on the outside there. Get our accent panel back on. There we go, nice. And plug in our power cable. Turn it on. The System76 works easy as pie. Oh, and that's really cool. It's actually really exhausting. I mean, our fan's kind of ramped up, but I love the idea of having that CPU wind tunnel. I think it's super nifty. And then, okay, you know what? I agree with them. You don't necessarily need to put a shroud here and you don't necessarily need to make your cables long enough if you're gonna just kind of make everything a little bit invisible to the naked eye by hiding it behind a side panel instead of a glass panel. Overall, the Nebula49 from System76 is pretty cool. I especially like this anti-fingerprint coating, whatever's on here. But it is a little pricey, not gonna lie. The littlest version starts around 200 bucks. And then this guy, the big boy, is like 329. So I really hope that you like whatever accent panel you're gonna get with it. I really hope you like the idea of this kind of enclosed CPU cooler and the wind tunnel. I don't know if it's for me, just because I really like a glass side panel and show off a ton of RGB. But for those of you who don't like RGB, maybe this is the one. Thanks for watching. This is ShortCircuit. If you wanna check out some other case videos, maybe check out the Meshify. It's a great case.",

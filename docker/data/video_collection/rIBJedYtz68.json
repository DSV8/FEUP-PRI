    "transcript": "these Technologies in my opinion are just here to augment us and make it easier and faster and you know so that you don't miss things or make obvious mistakes. We're talking about this guy who took people's iPhones and was able to empty their bank accounts out just because they were either intoxicated or whatever and they gave him the phone and the pin and then he could get access to the iPhone and just take all the money out yeah I love that because the I've watched a lot and the um what you do great is is that you you teach a concept in that amount of time and it's it's not too short that it doesn't make any sense it's long enough that you actually explain something and I mean if someone's only got a bit of time on a train or whatever they can watch that and and take something away from that. I watch Elementary which is the TV show that he and Lucy lar in he's Sherlock Holmes in that show and there's this beautiful rooftop scene where he's sort of spraying his bees and I found the rooftop. I was speaking to a UK bank and they said oh we have voice recognition now you can like talk into your phone and be authenticated with your voice only and then I listened to Rachel Toback doing something and what's your opinion you know should I enable voice uh authentication it sounds like a really bad idea so how do they track you? Well here's a great explanation from Brilliant who I want to thank for sponsoring this video when you're using your phone they can track you so how do they locate you cell towers Wi-Fi access points and GPS so in the course they show you how cell towers can be used to locate you and how using three cell phone towers triangulates where your device is but they can use GPS to locate exactly where you are and that's why it's possible with a cell phone to know where you are because of GPS but how does it do that explanations are shown here including the use of time your phone is getting its time from a satellite and they can do calculations of distance and time to work out where you are and they can use that to determine where you are using multiple sat lights once again Wi-Fi helps them to locate you as well so if you're in range of three Wi-Fi signals you must be in a region where those Wi-Fi signals overlap notice Wi-Fi access points don't know their location but that location is stored in many databases some of them freely available on the internet at the end of the course we told that by using Wi-Fi GPS or cell phone towers your phone can locate you almost anywhere indoors or Outdoors if you'd rather keep that information a secret there's always airplane mode now those of you who are more privacy conscious will know that you shouldn't be using iOS or stock Android if you want privacy because a lot of about the information is sucked up by Apple or Google what I like about Brilliant is it doesn't just tell you this it actually shows you how triangulation works with cell phone towers how GPS can be used to track you and how Wi-Fi can be used to track you very basic stuff to be aware of if you want privacy and security.

Hey everyone it's David Bombal back with a very special guest Gary welcome hey David thanks for having me it's great to have you on the channel you are recommended to me by some very well-known people in the oan community I interviewed Micah and Griffin and you were on the top list of like YouTube YouTube channels to look at and newsletters but Gary I want to talk about your channel fantastic channel for everyone who's watching please go and subscribe show the love I love it interviewing people from you know different backgrounds Gary before we start you got to tell us you did really well at school right and you've got a degree is that correct? uh no I have no degree and uh I flunked my exams when I was 18 so and one of those was computers and now I do computers professionally so so you got an e was it for computers or something yeah e at a level which is like the exam you do when you're sort of 18 years of age and you're about to go into University I really didn't know what I wanted to be or do at University and back in you know 2003 there wasn't you know CTI and all these ethical hacking type things going around so I I just felt a bit lost and I think that meant I didn't have motivation to really do well in these exams I love that so you didn't do well at school it's a motivation for everyone who thinks they they messed up I could use much stronger language than that but let's say you've messed up in Life or you think you have I love stories like yours and other people where that didn't stop you right yeah I mean I joined the military there's a lot of discipline in the military you're always learning new skills and things in the military so you're you're learning to adapt and really building that into your sort of you know part of your daily life constantly adapting to new situations so in in CI in civilian life I still you know live by that I'm always learning new things uh you know YouTube is a new thing right you know how much work it takes to run a channel and cyber is certainly in that space you will always be learning new things in in cyber security and Gary you've got a very interesting background I have in my notes share British Military Intelligence so you got to tell us a story you know where you came from and um what you do these days I've interviewed a lot of people in the US military but it's great to have someone from from Britain so tell us a bit of your story and then I want to talk about your channel and the stuff that you do there that can help people in their careers sure thanks David uh so I'm Northern Irish you might be able to tell from my odd accent uh I've lost a little bit of it but not too much grew up in you're in Scotland right I am in Scotland I'm in just outside Edinburgh and it's very windy and very wet here at the minute because we got the storm but that's the same everywhere I think in the UK at the minute and my background you know I I didn't do very well at my education in school I think I got an e at a level in computers which is like if people don't know that's like the exam at 18 years of age you sort of pick three different things I had biology computers and technology or something like that didn't go to university wasn't really sure about what to do and remember this is you know 2003 cyber wasn't you know didn't exist practically certainly not in Northern Ireland to my knowledge uh and it wasn't really on my radar back then so I joined the military um started off in the Royal Navy as a communication specialist and that's not you know I did a Windows Server administrator course which was old school most of the technology we used was you know analog type stuff so like little pieces of tape with holes in it that's the crypto keys and you pull it through a little light reader and it's all you know antennas and radio frequencies not really computers um but it was good fun you know sailed around the world saw lots of nice things then you know left out behind and got into British how old you sorry to interrupt uh I was uh 18 until 22 I think it was roughly okay sorry to interrupt go on yeah no worries uh and then after that got into British Military Intelligence as part of the army and you know that was a lot more intense than the Navy cuz I was you know down in the front lines with uh the Marines and some of the army units in Afghanistan so very hot and very cold trying to do intelligence work to the best of your ability and you know crazy conditions to say the least yeah uh and then after that I sort of left it behind you know my heart really wasn't in it anymore I didn't see like a long-term future in terms of family and things um so I popped smoke as they say and called in the heo and or I got so Gary how long were you in the military for uh eight years and then you I've seen a bit on your channel and a bit of what you've explained you moved into you you you got into civilian life and you decided to do sa is that correct yeah kind of in a in a roundabout way so I after the military I I got into kidnapping Ransom not kidnapping people and ransoming them but say um working out of an operations room in h ons and we had this great view of the river we could literally Ro watch people row uh in the in the Rowan races it was really cool but it was like it was an Ops room for or kidnapping Ransom cases happening globally so part of an insurance company and that was with a bunch of ex-military people so it was like in civilian life but with you know loads of my old colleagues so it was a nice sort of decompression uh but it was you know 12-hour shifts and a hour and a half Drive each way from my home to the office so it was a it was a slug and it it just wouldn't last so I eventually found a role in Nationwide which is you know the the building Society in the UK yeah uh which is like a bank for you know folks in America that might not know that term um and I did a risk role there so I was a risk analyst in the Enterprise risk division learned loads of really really useful skills skills that I still use to this day to be honest my risk skills are probably some of my most useful skills in even in cyberspace and yeah so that was my my first sort of proper corporate style job but again still not doing cyber and when I was there I realized oh yeah that cyber thing that I was interested when I was a kid you know hackers the movie and all that sort of stuff uh Mr Robot came out and someone recommended I watch it and then I was like oh yeah and I was into that but back when I was into it there was no YouTube you couldn't find this stuff right as R now we have this and it's it's incredible so yeah then I started sort of Googling around and figured out a path into cyber and made it happen a lot of people who watch these videos perhaps have military back background perhaps in the US or the UK or other countries what's your advice for someone transitioning from military to civilian life um I mean I can't speak to this at all so it's great to you know get you to you give your advice I think it's tough it is tough and there's there's people in the military who have very civilian style roles and there's people in the military who have the complete opposite of a civilian style role you know think anything from Special Forces all the way back to being a a chef you know it's it's a wide wide range of people and it depends where you are in that sphere in your experiences um certain roles make it easier to get into the civilian world uh and other roles I guess it's quite tricky and quite challenging to to break out and get into the civilian world but I think as a general rule of thumb I would try not to bind your identity too much to the job and I know in the UK military and I've worked with a lot of people around the world you know and in the US you get that sort of hoo-ha camaraderie type thing and that's great but it it has to come to an end at some point if you really want to settle into those normal sort of Civilian type roles uh and for me that came sort of natural I I've always been into photography and uh websites and sort of soft skills like that you know I wasn't a I wasn't a sort of bear glugging you know typical soldier that you would imagine you know soldiers on a night out for example that wasn't sort of scene so maybe I was a bit different in that case but I knew a lot of people like me to be honest that were that were like that and most of the people that I know have all done really well post post the military so you know I think I think it really depends what you're doing you know if you're Frontline special forces in Helman Province that's going to be tough to shift but you know if you're doing something a little bit softer potentially then maybe it's a more natural transition now you say that uh Gary but you know this famous book um discipline equals Freedom jao has written a whole bunch of books and he leverages a lot of his military skills so surely there's stuff in the military that's really helped you I mean you were in intelligence right so has that helped trans has that helped you a lot in into you know what in your civilian life oh yeah for sure I mean the the Intel world is a really interest in space I mean don't get me wrong a lot of it is boring type you you know day-to-day work it's like being a rockar it's you know playing on stage to the fans is 5% of your day the other 95% of your day isn't being a rock star and it's you know similar in any of these types of things from Intel Special Forces whatever it is uh but you know the skills that I learned in Military Intelligence I use directly in my day-to-day in you know cyber threat intelligence it's the same thing it's just instead of bullets being a threat to you it's you know packets being a threat to you so the architecture of it all is identical the way I look at it is you know everyone's different you and I are very very different have very different backgrounds but play to your strengths right I mean that's sounds like exactly what you've done yeah and that that's kind of diversity in itself isn't it you know you come from this Walk of Life I come from this Walk of Life but we play to our strengths we sort of own where we come from and we move forward with that and you know together it makes a more interested and more diverse team which I think is better how did you get was there any like certifications or anything that really helped you I know you've got your ocp so I wanted to talk about when you got that and talk about you know what helped you get that but you know it's one thing to say okay I'm going to go into the civilian world but I'm going to jump into this field cyber what helped you and I want to position it this way um if I was doing what you did today what would your advice be or if you were talking to your younger self what would you ADV your advice be so my my path I sort of had had to figure it out on my own a little bit I did speak to a few people at Nationwide where I worked at the time when I started doing the CTS and you know they pointed out things like ocp because I'd never heard of that before um and I kind of you know looked on LinkedIn and reverse engineered some of their profiles and saw some of the key Cs and you know just learn the names of these vendors and try and sort of absorb as much as you can in the military you call that IP intelligence preparation of the environment where you sort of you don't know anything and now you have to know everything and so you just sort of suck in all the data points and just learn as much as you can about that world and I kind of still apply that to everything really even YouTube and you know I try and it's the same sort of ethos no matter what I look into I still do that sort of Ip work um and you know I found CompTIA the the Security Plus certification and I knew that A+ and network plus kind of came before that uh but because of the stuff that I'd done in the military especially towards the end of my Army Career I was working in a special little Intelligence Center and we had servers and vlans and I got pretty close to this civilian contractor who taught me a lot about how to run all that stuff so you know that started to come very naturally to me especially with my web development background and you know uh tinker and with cryptography in the Navy so I felt very comfortable with you know A+ and Network plus I still read the books just a knowledge check to make sure you know do I actually understand how the internet works because you know I think that's one of the first things people should learn you know how does how does all this work uh I know John Hammond talked about you should learn a programming language and yeah for some people yes go do the thing that interests you if you're interested in that go do it because if it's fun you'll stick at it for me I had a rough idea how it worked um and I knew I was never going to be a strong programmer I I can script a little bit and I can you know use chat GPT to help me along but I'm not a gifted uh pythonista so yeah you know I I went and I got that compt Security Plus pass first time that was pretty exciting to you know pass this exam this simple exam but still challenging for a new person and that gave me a little boost um you know and set me on the path and then after Security Plus I knew about ocp at that stage but I looked at the exam and thought you know I can't do a 48 hour exam 24 hours of hacking and then 24 hours of like writing a report that's like you know Special Forces hacking exam kind of thing uh so I sort of Googled around a bit found some blogs and things and heard about ejpt which is an e-learn security I think they're owned by INE these days yeah and it was really cool I was actually In This Very Room uh whenever I passed the exam I think it was like you know 2: in the morning and my wife was asleep next to door and I sort of I finished the exam it said you've passed and I did a little quiet in in the air I was dead chuffed because it because it's a practical you actually have to hack you can't it's not a multiple choice we won't name names but it's not a multiple choice hacking exam you have to get in and I think the exam back then was like some sort of record label like a like a Sony kind of copy and you have to answer like a quiz you know what is the date of birth of such and such person like an artist in the database so you got to do you know SQL injection bypass authentication read the databases all that sort of stuff but it was a challenge you know trying to those are a lot of new skills to learn and I didn't really understand you know from the outset a lot of the fundamentals uh and it wasn't really until I started going for the ocp and I got on hack the box and found ipsec where it all sort of came together for me um that really changed my whole mindset and approach to you know the pen testing side of things for sure you mentioned IPI in some of your videos so you got a whole video where you talk about hack the box and um more of this so for anyone who wants more detail go again and subscribe to Gary's Channel but like just for for the broader audience who is IPC and what is hack the box and how did it help you with ocp yeah so I I guess I'll talk about that the other way so I started doing ocp and I you know got onto the course got into the labs and I was like how do I play with these Labs I really just did didn't know where to go you know I I was still at that handholding stage um I knew how to do an nmap scan and you know how to do SQL injection and you know a little bit of web app pen testing but I still didn't know how to you know sweep a network range and get the results and then you know do all that sort of stuff so I still needed my hand held and I I really struggled to like get the grasp of the labs um I don't even think I did that many I think they recommend you do like half of the the the Network before you're like ready for ocp I played with a few of them and I I finished the lab report which gives you a few bonus points uh for the exam and then I was like I can't get my head around this so I you know I was happy with the lab report i' done all the the training that was in the the PDF that they used to give you back then and then I just went to hack the Box because it just felt like a faster easier learning experience I could watch someone teach me directly how to hack that machine machine you don't get that on ocp you have to go off and do your own research and that's that's fine right that's there need to be these different companies in the market pushing pushing the boundaries of what's possible you know the try harder Mantra each to their own um I do still recommend it you know it's a it's a great exam and it's a great challenge more than anything it's um it's a good one just for for up here for your confidence levels but hack the box was fantastic I I have great things to say about hack the Box the platform's lovely um they keep building on it all the time new things all the time and IPC works there now I believe but he used to he used to not work there he just made some YouTube videos and he's got a huge Channel and a really useful website called ic. rocks which is like a search engine for the uh the chapters in his videos so if you're looking to do like SQL injection you go to his website type that in and it'll list all the videos where he does that and if you click it takes you right to that moment which is incredibly useful for anyone trying to you know do a real engagement and you're stuck somewhere you might be able to find the answer just on a Youtube video um but he he has a great Channel a great voice it's uh it's iconic at this stage and um you know the things that he teaches people his methodology his approach I already copied that so he used t-u I use t-u he uses certain keys I use the same keys and I largely just clone myself off of him because he was infinitely better than I am and still is obviously uh and it worked because I sat the ocp and past first time so you know I do credit that IPC and I did I dropped a message uh I think it was on a Discord Channel or something and said thanks so um yeah that was quite nice to all to say thank you to him how long did it take you from okay Security Plus to getting your ocp good question I believe Security Plus would have been 2015 and I think my ocp yeah my ocp I did in Singapore where young Ramy is here um and that was 2019 I'm pretty sure so a four years I think it was when I looked at the notes yeah yeah yeah fouryear time period and that was working on that all the time or was it like little bit in the beginning and then towards the end you you got serious so I started off in Earnest and you know smashing the labs trying to use up the 90day lab time or whatever it was I had as part of the osc package because I didn't want to waste it um but you know it got to you know halfway through that time period And I was just struggling to really like engage with the labs and feel like yeah I'm getting the hang of this I felt a bit lost and the forums it was challenging I I just I just struggled a bit to really find my feet and then I switched to hack the box and I spent maybe six months on hack the Box practically every day night time instead of you know watching Netflix and playing PlayStation or whatever it was hack the Box instead and I didn't have kids then so I could stay up to you know two in the morning doing this stuff and then sneak into bed uh and it was fine so I'm a little bit older now and I've got two kids so I don't have that luxury anymore David well welcome to the club yeah wait till you get to my age so that's great I mean it's so like if someone was starting now what would be a realistic expectation um I let's say don't know much I'm going to go A+ Network plus perhaps I mean do you recommend this path um is the question A Plus network plus Security Plus perhaps then I think you mentioned on one of your YouTube videos do like a I would I wouldn't say a lowerer but like a beginner more beginner CT right and you did ejpt there um and then go ocp is that do you still recommend that path or do you have any updates for 2024 yeah I do think it's still a good path but you know it when people come to me which happens quite a lot these days on LinkedIn you know asking for path advice like that the first question I say to them is where do you want to be because you know I find it quite cool SL useful that I I you know I'm an ocp I'm not an OS ee or whatever the top tier one is I'm not some sort of you know unbelievable hacker right I I understand the basics pretty well and I can get my head around some of the more advanced stuff and that's really useful in my role doing CTI because not many CTI people have that experience so what is CTI sorry just for cyber threat intelligence um so not many CTI folk have the ocp or that practical sort of Hands-On ethical hacking experience more and more are I think as time comes on but the people that I've spoken to it tends to not be their experience um so it's useful to have that in my role because it can let me sort of push things a little bit further than I normally would be able to with just my Intel background but you know if you want to get into pentest and I think it's still a very feasible rout into the industry but there's loads of other Sears now you know you got ocp but hack the Box have one uh cpts I think certified penetration testing student it's like a week long it's meant to be really quite challenging as well and I would imagine it's great you know the the labs that they have and stuff are really really good uh you got TCM security with their PN PT everybody loves that you know great community over there um there's EC pptx from e-learn security so there's a lot of Cs in that space and you might have seen the video I did on the the Paul Jeremy uh you know the big multicolored web page with all the searchs listed on it uh but people really need to think about where you actually want to end up because potentially there's no point doing the ocp if you want to get into CTI it'll be handy it'll look good you'll feel good about it but there are easier ways into CTI um and other you know roles as well I think you hit a really important point there cuz people there is no one road right it depends start with end in mind and decide where you want to go I mean the video I'll I'll link it below you showed that like chart of all these crazy amount of search right what was the video like 400 and something Sears or something crazy yeah I think 473 or something yeah it is a really good uh if you if you know what you want it's a fantastic website but if you don't know what you want if You' have showed that to me back whenever I was starting I'd have been lost so um I think it takes someone to help help you navigate it and ask the right questions and I think and that's why we're having this conversation sorry goad yeah yeah when when I meet with people I usually say find two things that you're interested in in case one of them when you go down that path actually you're not interested in it and a good example is you know you're interested in sock and CTI and those actually go really well together because uh a lot of the analysis work that the sock will do if you just write that up into a report that is almost a CTI product a cyberthreat Intel product um so they're closely related equally pentesting red teaming whatever you want to call it and sock because one's attack one's defend and those will complement each other really really well what you learn on one side will help you on the other side even if you switch over so you know if you're picking something like pen testing and GRC governance risk and compliance those are very separate a lot of the skills won't map across um some people might argue Jerry Jerry AER might jump in the comments and uh give us a good clip around the ear but you know what I mean like uh y you know they're they're closer together uh the the red team blue team stuff so try and find two roles that are somewhat interlined and explore both paths but there's a ton of content Chachi PT is incredible at giving this advice and if you prompt it well enough it can really give you some really interest in CT combinations Gary I don't want to like open the floodgates but you said people are reaching out to on LinkedIn is it is it is it okay people do reach out to and like ask for advice perhaps in on LinkedIn and other places perhaps you can give us your like your socials yeah sure it's um you know Gary Rell on on LinkedIn um and you know the YouTube channel is Gary Odell official I do have a website as well but the best thing to do is just you know reach out on LinkedIn and when you connect just drop a message that say you know saw you on David's show and then I'll know that that's where you're coming from and that's why reaching out um don't just send blind connection requests cuz they just get denied it's it's too much it's um it's crazy sometimes on LinkedIn but more than happy to try and help as many people as possible um and I think the best advice is they should subscribe to your channel because if you and if they ask you those questions in the comments you're going to see that and then you can create a video that addresses a lot of the questions right that I think that that works really well yeah exactly and you know I do my best to reply to every comment I'm having a conversation with a guy today in the comments so you know I'm still uh I'm still small and I'm able to reply to a lot of the comments so I I will do at my best effort wait till you get a million subs and then we'll talk I can't even imagine you're G to get it soon man so um just for everyone watching please go sub I love showcasing different people's YouTube channels because there's so much content out there from amazing people like Gary so please go and show the Love And subscribe and let's talk about your channel now because you've got an interesting take um and I was thinking about titling this video which might be this title or not 3 minute hacking classes you got to tell about tell us about 3 minute is it 3 minute Thursday three minute Thursday yeah so 3 minute Thursday if you go to the three minute Thursday playlist and go back to the first video you'll see my I think it's my ctios a little notion workspace that I made for people to get get the sort of basics of how to do like CTI and practice and in that video I explain the start of the 3 minute Thursday series and it's stolen from Peter McKinnon who's a huge YouTuber I think he's I was going to say two two minute Tuesday cuz I when I saw that I thought ah you've been watching Peter McKinnon exactly but you know Peter says you know like being able to sit down every week and you know sort of forcing yourself to get in that Cadence and create the buffer of content so if you do get sick I've been sick all of December all of January it's been crazy with you know two young kids in winter but you you learn the ropes better you get into better rhythm and Cadence on YouTube I'm sure your content is you know well tuned up at this stage and you if only you go on it just makes it a lot more professional um which allows you to make better content so two minute Tuesdays Peter always went over that some of his videos were like 15 minutes long which was great because he's a lovely guy but I thought how do we make it like four minute Fridays three minute Thursdays I figured three was good because people like things in threes you know so I figured let's do three minute Thursdays uh and yeah the whole idea is just to sit down every week and put out a video that just shows something teaches something um yeah helps people figure something out that's it I love that because the I've watched a lot and the um what you do great is is that you you teach a concept in that amount of time and it's it's not too short that it doesn't make any sense it's long enough that you actually explain something and I mean if someone's only got a bit of time on a train or whatever or the tube in London or wherever um they can watch and and take something away from that yeah cuz 3 minutes is sort of the right amount of time isn't it you have to be able to explain it really simply and a lot of these things that we're talking about aren't they're not naturally simple you know some of them are quite exactly complex uh but trying to make them short simple and fun so they're not just dry you know one of the things that I don't like about the channel is that it's just me here in the office but at the same time that is a blessing because it is just me here in the office I can go on lunch and do three videos record three three minute Thursdays and that's like a month's worth of content pretty much done on lunch if I was a Peter McKinnon type guy and I was going to video me doing a photo shoot I'd have to go outside and maybe it's raining and then you can't so there's pros and cons I guess to being stuck in this office um so I just have to try and put the effort in to make it work and I guess one of the more fun ones recently for me personally cuz I've I've done a few of these now I was sick and I had I had to record because i' I'd gone on holidays and then I'd run out of my buffer I didn't have anything prepared so I was bunged up with a cold and it meant I could start the video in the kitchen like filling the kettle boiling it making a cup of tea sitting down here and you can see like fake rain as it pours down the screen that was quite nice because it just gave me an excuse to bring more of me to the channel um which is better I think that's great I mean it's I was going to I was going to talk about that as well because you I'm not sure if it's because of your background in photography or if it's because you've been looking at like people like Peter McKinnon but you don't just do cyber you do a lot of like um you you bring a lot of the creativity side to like you really you do your camera angles well you do a bunch of like storytelling so tell us about that is it is it natural or is this something you've had to like pick up and learn there's a bit of reverse engineering to be honest going on here and if I you know if you take Peter mckin name and write that down and go check out his channel go watch his early 3em minute Thursday stuff there's not many of them around but he does have a playlist but if you go back to my very first YouTube video and I don't know if you've seen those but the first four or five YouTube videos I went quite ambitious at the start and I was emulating Johnny Harris who's a former Vox journalist and he's got every single video David has just millions of views and the quality is unreal um but you know he's he's got a name and he started off with a bang and he's very good uh but that was sort of my inspiration I sort of thought wouldn't it be cool to make like cyber security videos like this because Johnny isn't doing cyber but it would force me to learn how to like play with maps and learn final cup Pro and animations and sound and all these things that I like to watch why can't I just do it you know and I had you know uh a child at the time the first one that came along and I knew like I'm I'm not going anywhere anytime soon soon right I'm I'm here I can commit to doing this so I spent a month making that first video and a month making the second video and a month making the third video and if you even if any of you go back and watch like the Iraq one there's a how a data breach destroyed an Air Force video I think it's my second or third video the intro to that uh looks quite Johnny harrisy loads of maps and b-roll footage from you know the the first Iraq War uh and s design and stuff that in itself took me like a week to put that 5c clip together but I know how to do it now I know how it works so I'd be much quicker if I ever go back to it and I would love to go back to it I'd love if this channel just became like the Cyber version of Johnny Harris's Channel because it's just beautiful like it's beautiful work if you're not subscribed to Johnny's Channel go check it out it's incredible so what's the vision did you want to become a YouTuber fulltime and then like take boring cyber content and like put this like cool style on it or where do you see things going that's a really tough question that's something me and my wife talk about regularly because you know you start getting traction on YouTube and um you can see that there is a future in it you know you're a full-time YouTuber and hats off to you that's incredible well done um thanks because it's a lot of work people think you know it's just hit record and that's not the case you know my day job is I'm a cyber person and I wasn't so I had to learn cyber and now I have to learn video I'm a photo guy but that's so that's not much of a stretch but now I have to learn audio which I'm still learning this is there's a big light here and now you're doing Final Cup Pro and graphic design and thumbnails and social media marketing YouTubers that do it you know even as purly as I do it hats off to any of them because it is a lot of work um to make it to make it slick and I think I've got it to the stage now where it's in a really good rhythm them you know um we've got content planned out for the future and you know we're in a really nice place you know my wife helps out with a lot of the backend stuff obviously she's juggling kids at the same time um but I you know I could see a career in it um I don't know if I'd want to do it full-time if it if I could I guess I would uh at the minute I definitely couldn't but maybe one day watch this space and yeah you know if I could make cyber content really interested and maybe tell more of the stories less tutorials more of that original stuff that I made I think I would quite like that but I think to do that at scale I would need a team or so you know some people to Outsource stuff too David maybe you can hook me up with some people yeah it's a journey right and I think we I understand the pain because I was there at one point um it's like what did you say earlier I think that's exactly the right stance is where do you want to go yeah and then decide where you want to go and then aim for that and I think uh what I really like about your style and it's it's I think it's a lesson for for everyone get inspiration from people like you got inspiration from Peter McKinnon you got inspiration from other people but you've made it your own because when I watched your stuff I said oh I can see Peter McKinnon here as soon as you said like three minute Thursdays I thought oh you definitely got this from Peter McKinnon and some of the style stuff but Peter's in photography and other stuff and you're in a different Niche now and I mean I think over time you you're doing it already you're getting your own style right you're getting your own voice so get inspired by other people but then make it yeah that's it and you know I've got some things coming up where I'm going to have to Vlog I'm going to have to be on a plane or a train going down to London to do some talks and things so you know you'll get to see like a vlog episode where you get to travel with me a bit and I I'd like that because you know it's a bit more interesting I think for me as well as the viewers to just get out of this room you know um and away from you know sharing my screen and doing the same sort of you know formula over and over again and you know three minute Thursday might officially last for a year I might do 52 of them and then say look let's take a little break and just do some more juicy stuff but who knows where we'll be in you know six months what whatever it is uh the world could look totally different I mean that's great I think it's a journey and you just you just change uh there's the worst thing you can do is stagnate yeah you watch you were talking to me offline about some of my older videos and they're horrendous I mean please don't go watch my old video they're terrible but uh U you know it's a journey and the thing is just try and improve a little bit every day every day just try and get better um and it's amazing what you can do just by a little bit of improvement sorry you wanted to say something yeah yeah so I went and watched my uh crypto AG Scandal video which was I think my one of it's either my second or third video and basically crypto IG was a a Swiss company based out of Zug in Switzerland and it was owned by the CIA and the German intelligence and they sold crypto gear all over the world back in the day back in the cold war that just didn't work so the Americans and the Germans could read it so so when I know you use proton I use proton VPN I've got a video coming out about vpns fundamentally but it terrifies me you know that that sort of stuff uh but when I watched that video I was just like oh my goodness the the camera work because it was just shot on my iPhone right like literally iPhone 12 Pro with a lapel mic um but I'm not going to take it down because it's just evidence that if you stick at it eventually you get comfortable in front of the camera and you find your flow if I deleted it out of you know shame or Pride or whatever it was called I think I'd be doing a disservice to other people who are professionals that want to you know productize their knowledge and share it with people I think it's important to show those early bits of work it's like everything like you said with cyber in the beginning you couldn't hack a box but now you can it's just a journey totally and most of us can learn pretty much anything over a long enough time period it's all possible if you just commit to it and enjoy it Gary the top videos on your channel right I I looked at it today most popular video is using oen to find his apartment and then solving a real world investigation using oen so let's start with the apartment one because that's your top video and then I want to do the real world one um you don't just do like ocp pent testing type stuff um CTI stuff you you seem to have a big you know uh role ENT as well yeah I mean my my background is intelligence work and uh my current role my day-to-day is intelligence work the pen testing stuff when I started doing those videos I thought you know this will look good this will look interesting people will be interested in this because I just wasn't sure that people were going to be interested in this is the intelligence cycle or this is how you know TLP works all the the Intel stuff and you know those videos are on my channel if you don't know what those are uh I just thought it'd be more interesting for people to see like this is a reverse shell and this is how end Map works so that's why I started in that sort of pent testy space and it helped me sort of pass on the knowledge of you know hack the box and ocp that I'd worked so hard to get and I thought you know I I need to pass this on in my own little way um but you know I think the Intel piece is a rarer piece to find on YouTube uh if you go and look for CTI content or Intel cont content there's a massive gap between that and the amount of hacking content there is in fact if you type you know the hashtags at the top of the description that you can put in on the YouTube video If you do hashtag ENT I think it's like 5,000 videos but if you do hashtag hacker it's like 1.2 million so exactly in my mind I need to go and make you know a million osen videos and just dominate that market right but that that's not what'll happen but as I start to make more videos other Intel people will undoubtedly make more videos as well and we can grow this thing you know as as we see it as we see fit I think because I do CTI do the Intel work on a day-to-day basis it makes sense to just sort of stay in that lane I'll probably not do much pen testy type stuff anymore maybe just the odd little bit where it makes sense to uh because there's so much stuff to be made in the Intel space and especially if you Branch it out and sort of go into another part of it Intel which is what we talked about offline things like competitive intelligence so how companies do Market intelligence and sort of what people would imagine corporate Espionage is but it's not as glossy as that it's you should make videos like that yeah for sure exactly so that that's a sort of pivot that I might take you know show the CTI stuff but step back show the Intel piece that underpins the CTI work which I've done some of already and then start building out competitive intelligence and things like that give us the 3 minute Thursday of that uh apartment video give us the quick overview so people can like know what it's about and then the the real world oen cases I really enjoyed that one with the real world one both were really good but give us like the quick synopsis of both okay so uh the the one where I find Johnny Lee Miller's apartment I'm so sorry Johnny I watched all of Elementary big fan of hackers I love you to bits sorry but you did put it on Instagram and it came because uh I watch Elementary which is the TV show that he and Lucy lar in he's Sherlock Holmes in that show and there's this beautiful rooftop scene where he's sort of spraying his bees and I found the rooftop just on you know Apple Maps or Google Maps or whatever it was and I thought wouldn't it be cool if we could just find his actual apartment and so we started Googling around and I saw the photographs of Angelina Jolie enter in the apartment who you know he was in the movie hackers with so there was a little bit of you know history there for me uh but it was a really interesting photograph that the Paparazzi had taken of her with her mask on you know during Co going into this gold door um and the the article said it was a dumbo apartment and I didn't know where that was but turns out it's a district in New York so one thing led to another and I teach a few skills that are useful things like looking in reflections of glass to see things that are you know in in the background and trying to correlate that so that's that's where that video came about from and people in the comments have gone even further like they've they've said exactly which apartment it is like it is this floor um I only took I only took it so far uh but that that's the scary thing with you know social media he posted he posted a photograph of his cat on his window sill beautiful cat looking out of his view but you got these skyscrapers and if you just do the do the angles you can just you know where he lives then so um it's a funny one I do wonder if I'm going to hear from a lawyer in the future but at the same time it's it's like it is open it's public right it's it's in the public so yeah whenever I talk to guys like you and like Micah and Griffin and other people who do osen it's like man you have to be careful what you post out there because it's amazing what you guys can do so you got to tell us about the the other video cuz I thought that was insane just tell us a story CU it was like someone contacted you right um and that was I thought it was brilliant how you did that yeah so a lot of people contact me these days uh a lot of people on Instagram with no followers no profile pictur saying hey can you uh can you help me I was dealing with one today actually and you know it's just it's just no on come through your company right if you have a company reach out and you know we'll have a chat and maybe I'll be able to just point you in the direction of the answer um but if you're just some random dude that's a crazy thing to ask someone to do I know I can't hack into you know your partner's Facebook account because that would be hacking Facebook and that would be terrible for my life so exactly no uh but yes uh so uh an investigator that I know reached out they had a screenshot which was the best frame from an Instagram um video pretty lowquality video as well terrible yeah yeah yeah maybe maybe an old iPhone or something uh and it showed the inside of a bar but I looked closely and it was a shisha bar you know a hooker Cafe where the you know the Middle Eastern sort of style with the big plumes of smoke you could see one of those in front and there was a TV screen and it was dark outside and there were sort of multicolored lines going up the walls like neon strips um and the only thing I knew and to be honest if I didn't have this little nugget of information I probably wouldn't have been able to have found it that easily but the client the person who was requesting the investigator to find it they were were based in leads so we didn't know anything about where the picture was actually taken but we knew that the client's postc code was a leads postcode which is a city in England um so I kind of made the Assumption maybe this is in leads maybe you know this is someone that they know in that area so you know circled leads on Google Maps and then got to work and within 45 minutes I'd find it but um if if I didn't have the leads lead I would have strug I would have struggled um it's not always that easy to find some of these things especially if you've got low res uh you know photography um but there was a really cool thing in that video with the the sign that's tilted out the window that was a a nice little nugget just to confirm it but again it you know we went on the Instagram channel of that business and confirmed that it definitely is inside that room at a very specific table so uh that was useful I mean it's nut cuz you were changing the colors and kinds of things to get and you were looking through the windows Reflections I think you were reflecting off the TV or something I can't remember exactly but it was it was insane what you were doing yeah this you know when you do imagery analysis which I never I never did that there is a a a field within Military Intelligence where you do iment and you you know you get those stereoscopic goggles and you look at all the sort of you know pictures of Russian troops and things uh and you know you learn the real skills I've got very basic imagery analysis skills but I've got Photoshop skills and I know about trying to boost the Shadows to reveal details and things like that so yeah I I play around with you know the sliders to lift the Shadows up and you can do it on an iPhone these days you know um but identifying key things in pictures and trying to figure out what they are and think very logically about what that might be is a it's a real skill you know breaking down an image foreground Middle Ground background and really looking at it you know objectively uh that's I'm not going down the rabbit hole getting lost looking at one thing you know cover the surface and then just peek down each of the rabbit holes and see if you find a thread and if you do maybe then pull on it um those be my tips for anybody trying to do something similar if I look at the next three videos top performing videos on your channel you've got like find social media profiles fost and then you've got multigo so tell us about those I mean I don't for everyone who's watching go and look at the videos if you actually want to see how Gary does it this is just like a teas or like just telling you don't put your photos out there sorry go on yeah so you know the the finding social media profiles one I think that's me showing off the Sherlock tool which you know is freely available you just put in usernames and it goes and finds them I think I found like my old bodybuilding.com I was going to say your bodybuilding photo is the best man um so yeah that was funny finding that one that was genuine like shock that wasn't like me you know take two uh that was genuine in the video um but yeah it's it's super powerful like it you know when you're trying to find people online uh you know my kids they're three and one when they're 20 I dread to think what the world's going to be like you know um especially with the Advent of AI coming into play um and you know tools like multigo have been around for a long time once they get AI in them well then it's just going to go nuts right that's just going to make it so much easier and faster to really like correlate all this data and just very quickly say this is Gary this is where he lives this is his wife this is his car like that'll all just come so much quicker um when people start putting AI into these products so I I always like to joke that I'm a boomer even though I'm not but it's like all the kids call me a boomer on YouTube and other places um so as someone who's not as old as I am I saw you had chat GPT in a mouse and you you said something along the lines let me check my notes you said you find chat GPT better than Google right is that is that true to fair to say and like tell us how you use chat gbt I treat it as like a trusted advisor now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine and I know it isn't always right but it really depends what types of questions you're asking it um you know the questions that I ask it the answer it gives me is usually right um you know things like uh how do you build a cyber threat intelligence program or what is the intelligence cycle you know if it says to me the intelligence cycle is Direction collection Pro processing analysis semination well done it is you know uh some of the things are really quite straightforward for it obviously if you start pushing it and get Advanced and I don't have the paid version by the way I just have the free chat GPT the 3.5 model I think it is but in notion I've got the paid one notion has AI built into it um and it's really good it gives you some really really good content but again you still have to there's no point generating stuff in notion and then just publishing it as it is that's that's that's a waste of everybody's time um I need to put my own flare to it my own words my own take um and my own conclusion you know these Technologies in my opinion are just here to augment us and make it easier and faster and you know so that you don't miss things or make obvious mistakes and when I compare chat GPT to Google you know a Google search when you type the search query in you then have to go and read all these pages and maybe they're right maybe they're wrong it's kind of it's hard to know but if you ask chat GPT it'll just give you an answer what it thinks and I think most of the time for me that's more useful six top video on your channel is 11 tips to pass your ocp first time and I mean for everyone who's watching go watch the video but perhaps you can give us like your top two tips I was quite surprised by the list that you gave because it wasn't what I would expect okay um I think for me the uh the set in the time the start time is really important so I think I think I started mine at like 7: a.m. or something like that because I knew that um UK time right uh well local time I was in Singapore at time but I started at 7:00 a.m. and then I knew that that would give me a good run you know get up at 6 get ready get breakfast sit down and then s all the way through to maybe 2 or three in the morning and that's you know that's push in 20 hours right so and after 3:00 I know from gaming and things like that I start to tired but until 2 or 3:00 I am pretty much on point the whole time and that worked really well because I got to the end of that window and uh knew that I'd passed I got enough points and I was like right we're done and my wife and dog were s sat in the in the living room in our apartment in Singapore waiting for me so that was nice so yes pick the time of day some people are you know night Isles and you might want to you know start at 900 p.m. and then finish at you know dinner time the next evening it's totally up to you but really think about how you feel in your body maybe it's easier for gamers and people who watch a lot like late night TV or they might have a better feeling for what it's like to just sit sort of in the zone for a long period of time yeah really started at the right time and I think the other one is you know get up and move around don't don't just sit there for the the whole time period if you can stand up move your body do some yoga I think in the video I do yoga in the garden outside jump in a hot tub whatever whatever it is to like just take take a break detox get get the blood flowing again um those may be my big ones and I guess the last tip would be the whole gitbook thing so I do have a video on gitbook and I think I shared one recently about hack tricks XYZ fantastic resource you know put all your commands in there and just copy paste so easy you still have to index it and know what you're looking for but if you don't have it you're kind of going in from memory uh trying to remember all these commands and things and that that doesn't help because you'll just spend a lot of time Googling commands uh when you should just be using the commands to get to get going so Gary you work for a big Bank of unknown name which you won't we won't mention here but I was watching a video just recently uh I think it was the Wall Street Journal we're talking about this guy who took people's iPhones and was able to empty their bank accounts out just because they were either intoxicated or whatever and they gave him the phone and and or the pin and then could get access to the iPhone and just take all the money out yeah you thread intelligence it's a worry right our lives on a phone how can I better protect myself what's your advice with all the threats that you seeing you know um I don't want to get my bank accounts emptied out and stuff like that what's your advice um I would say make sure you've turned on that new thing that came out in iOS 17.3 which I think came out last night at the time of recording this and I turned it on I did it right I turned it on this morning it's a very subtle thing you just hit the button and that's it done so if people steal your device your iPhone uh it they really can't there's no benefit anymore because it just won't work for them even if they have the passcode it'll still do some face ID stuff when they try to make those changes and like turn things off and change your Apple ID it it won't work uh which is great and I'm sure Android will maybe they have something similar or maybe they'll bring something out that's similar so I think that's a that's a big one um for me yeah I mean it's woring because the iPhone security was um just from the point of view that a pin most thing is we we people who who are aware of this stuff it's obvious right the problem is most people are not obvious so I mean you must be dealing with an a the banks obviously have people from all walks of life and a lot of them aren't technical I mean it's like what are the what other tips would you give someone I mean if they got an iPhone enable upgrade the iOS Etc but like what other tips have you got um I mean there's the obvious stuff like don't reuse passwords that's super important you know if you're using the same password on every website that's actually hard to do these days because you know on your iPhone keychain is probably enabled which is the password manager that's built into every Apple device basically so if you're typing the passwords in manually that means you're overwriting the suggestions that it's making for you that you could just click accept on um so do not reuse passwords um make sure you're using keychain which is the the iOS you know and Mac password manager but you know Google has one you can get independent ones like one password dashly and all that sort of stuff use a password manager have multiactor authentication where you can it isn't a Panacea anymore it's not perfect anymore you you know you got Kuba tool the evil Jinx tool evil evil genics tool however you say it um which you know acts as a a proxy for those six-digit codes don't think just because you have tofa it's you know perfect you can get PH2 which is you know reverse proxy resistant to fa so the likes of the Ubbi Keys the plugs in so if if you need more security go buy one of those yubi key things for 50 bucks whatever it is and you know stick that into your computer and that is fish proof I think Google reported they have zero fishing now because they use those and it's just Z you know how many things do you get where it's zero you know it's like yeah when you use your mouthwash it's 99.9% of bacteria this is 100% so yeah Ubbi key really works and you know hats off to them for inventing it so yeah don't reuse passwords multiactor authentication update your stuff like when you get that little red dot that says you know iOS is out of date or your windows computer's out of Date Update it quickly um if you run a small business do not be complacent the amount of the amount of small and medium businesses that no one has ever heard of you know Jack's lumber shop in Oregon Y no one's ever heard of it but it's on a ransomware site because it got hit with lock bit because they didn't update for free their active directory you know just update especially the internet facing stuff um don't get complacent with that that really annoys me when I see that happen because it's just so much of it is an easy fix different if it's a zero day you know when klopp The Ransom or gang klopp hit all those people uh with the manage file transfer vulnerabilities that's different right that's zero day territory yeah you know no one can protect against that really um unless you got layered defense that are going to catch it uh but yeah the easy simple stuff just get it done um but it's tough you know security is hard and security culture is a I really struggle with it I genuinely do I I'm torn part of me is like we should educate everyone in the business and tell them to be able to spot fishing emails at a a thousand yards away but at the same time the other part of me he is like no Gary tools exist companies exist out there so that if click on something it doesn't even matter it's sandboxed it's it's irrelevant you can't get infected so we don't need to educate them and I'm really torn between these two you know I don't you and I don't need to know how a seat belt is made or like exactly we just plug it in and we know right we've been told that's the thing that's going to save you and off you go and that's it why do we have to educate people about security awareness in big businesses where it costs a lot of money to do so if you're an apple or Microsoft and you got 100,000 Plus employees and you want everybody to sit down once a year and do the old compliance learning this is what fishing looks like click click click that's time time is money uh and it's a distraction from what they should actually be doing in their role so I really struggle with that but I do think the more you know the better so probably it's worth learning I just saw on Twitter the other day and I when I interviewed um Martin from Cisco he said he's also cybercity expert and two cybercity experts said that they got fished and it's like if the best of the best get fished what is a normal person who's not technical what chance do they have you know what chance do they have if people like us get fish and you know my iCloud mail you know I'm an Apple user so I get iCloud my junk box is filled full of actual junk exactly which is good right that it ends up in there I'd rather not receive it in the first place but um my inbox largely just is my inbox um so I can really pay attention to what's in there the odd time I'll like some sort of Lucky jackpot thing pops into my inbox I'm like how did that get through Apple's filters but it happens um recently I joined hey.com from 37 signals the team behind base camp if you haven't seen it it's a really really cool take on email um it's a complete re-engineer of like how you do email forget what Apple Mail looks like Google Mail Outlook it does not look like that it is beautiful and no one can email you on until you approve them so kind of every sender is whitelisted which that's that's what I'm looking for I dream of a day David where employees join the company and they don't even give get given a laptop unless they need a laptop you know you don't have an email address because you don't need one you don't need to send email you're in the marketing team you communicate via slack that's it and guess what you only get slack until you can prove to me you need calculator. exe you ain't getting it hard hardcore some sort of Windows box the Microsoft sells that is like extremely locked down and everything has to be turned on manually that a attx surface would be tiny no it's probably quite impractical from a I I was going to say the business people are not going to listen to you because the end of the day they want to make money right sorry exactly it and it would be quite costly from an identity and access management perspective you'd have to have a lot of people flicking the switches you know oh David has requested access to the webcam because he needs it to go on Zoom call okay tick David gets the webcam so it would be a very uh intense process from that side of things you'd really need like unbelievably detailed job descriptions mapped to tools but it's a cool idea like I've never seen it done before so I do wonder if there's something there um I think it's the problem with that is that's cyber person's dream but it's a business person's Nightmare and that's why sa people struggle sometimes sorry go on I interrupted you no no you're absolutely right it is a it is a dream uh but it's always that balance of service versus security um and obviously if you work in a high security environment that's more possible it's more possible to be that you know lockdown um but if you're in a generic business environment quite tough I was told by I won't even mention the names because the less people know about me the better I was speaking to a UK bank and they said oh we have voice recognition now you can like talk into your phone and be authenticated with your voice only voice command voice command and then I listened to Rachel Tobak doing something and what's your opinion you know should I enable voice uh authentication it sounds like a really bad idea yeah it's a tough one so I'll give you a a different story but it'll probably give you an idea uh I signed up to a bank I don't think it exists anymore but I won't say the name uh it's got four letters in the name and I downloaded the little app it was just an app there's no sort of website or shop front it's a digital bank and um we were this is 20 20 15 2016 somewhere around that time and we were messing around with it and we got one of those little wooden coffee stirring sticks and we had a photograph of me on my iPhone we sent it to my friend and we used that photograph like in the mission of Possible movies we just held the photograph of me up to the facial recognition in the app and it didn't accept it so then we got the coffee stir and we put it over my eyes and then we did this to make it look like I was blinking like I was alive and it worked we emailed the company and said hey we figured this out and we got the response back which was uh we take security very seriously blah blah blah blah blah the end so you know should you turn on voice recognition maybe but it really depends on your threat model you know um I do wonder if these uh companies that do things like you know uh creating 11 Labs as it is called creating the AI voices if going to have to add some sort of um hidden track a bit like when Shazam detects music you know when you do the music detection and it tells you what the song is it does that from the ID3 tag um it can hear something I think in the track I wonder are they going to put some sort of Watermark onto AI generated video and you know audio so we know it's generated by AI but then you're always going to get a bad actor that makes their own AI that doesn't do it exactly yeah so tough question really depends on your threat model I think if you got lots of money to lose maybe stick it in some old school physical you know bank account where you have to walk in like Jason Bourne and give them the number of the account and be escorted be escorted to the gold that sits in the vault you know that's maybe the safest option I like I mean it's a great answer it depends on the threat model but it's it must be a worry I mean how you guys sleep at night knowing you've got all these people uh putting money into the bank and security isn't always the best it's a worry yeah yeah and like you know a lot of the big issues we've seen recently in the threat landscape have been around things like uh cves so you know exploits uh in uh VPN software and vpn's is how everybody connects into work right if you log in from home you connect via a VPN that means that organization has a box somewhere called a VPN server and you connect into it but it means it's internet facing anybody can see it um and if you just Google like Tesla VPN you'll find like the login panel that employees use for Tesla it's it's just right and you can try and it'll say no but one day if you get the credentials it'll say yes and yeah uh if there's a zero day there's a vulnerability in the software you don't even need the credentials you can just get in now you'll only get into the VPN box can you go any further that's the next problem um and that's where that's where it gets hard but you know you could encrypt all those uh with ransomware and then make a lot of money um yeah it's terrifying that that internet facing technology bit doesn't keep me up at night personally but I know a lot of people that it does keep up at night and rightly so to be honest because it's it's terrifying yeah I mean it's not like the old days where it's you know someone had to walk into a bank I mean someone can be on the other side of the world and break in yeah exactly it's a it's a worry and it's like you said about small businesses right the banks have money and resources but most small medium businesses and even per people in their personal capacity it's like you know how do you afford to to protect yourself yeah a friend of mine his friend was doing a mortgage uh money transfer and I think you know where this is going the the law firm that he was going through to send the money you know through to the end point uh they had their email server compromised by a hacker and the hacker got in the middle and changed the bank details so my friend's friend sent 00,000 to the the hacker uh and it went to the hacker they never got the money back but the bank refunded him fully uh which I think is you know I won't say who the bank I won't say who the bank is but if you're in the UK the bank yeah yeah if you're in the UK you've definitely heard of the bank uh but yeah hats off to them for doing it because that's a cost you know I mean I'm surprised the law firm wasn't held viable for that yeah it's it's a yeah where do you where do you stop the um the investigation you know if you if you did dig into that and it turned out that there was a zero day in the law firm's email server and that's how the bad guys got in do you then hold the people who made the soft Ware of the email server responsible because they supplied it and it gets get gets messy that those demarcation points it's tough I think the problem for a lot of us is I want to go live in a cave right I say this a lot because the more you see what's going on the more you think it's insane yeah so what's your advice you know to stay sane in this crazy world it's so tough so like me personally I took a little bit of a step back from LinkedIn over the last couple of months I just you know seen too much stuff sad things sad videos and things uh and I just you know I saw a lot of bad stuff in in the Middle East as it was during my time in the military and it I don't know it I just wasn't enjoying being on the platform anymore so I just sort of dialed back a bit my usage on it um and I think just learning to dial back when you feel when you feel it you know um I don't find myself getting burnt out doing this stuff at all uh I find being in the social media game quite fun and refreshing it's actually energizing more than anything uh but yeah I think using things like screen time you know if you are getting burnt burnt out Doom scrolling on Instagram or you know reading the news about cyber attacks all the time or being on Twitter chatting with people all the time just learning how to curb at the source you know screen time locks it at 7 pm and you're not allowed to use it I know you can bypass it but that's where discipline comes in you know I like that discipline is it's a great way to end off this this interview because discipline equals freedom and uh that's how you get that's how you got your occp right it wasn't just uh it didn't just happen you had to put the work in Yeah Yeah from what I would call a cold start as well you know there's a lot of kids you know in fact my neighbor of mine you know his son just finished a degree in you know ethical hacking and networking and it's like that's cool you know you're you're set up now to go and you know he knows what the ocp is is and he's done sort of half the work already because you know he's got that degree uh I came from sort of a cold start um and I got there so if I can do it anybody watching you can do it you just need to apply yourself and stick at it uh don't quit uh I've done things in the past and I've give up because I felt like it wasn't getting traction looking back on it I think some of those things wouldn't have gotten traction just because they were a bit ill-conceived so I'm kind of glad that I did quit and that's where you have to sort of calculate in your mind but you take YouTube for example in LinkedIn Like It's a Grind right it took me two years to get to 10,000 Subs on YouTube and then it took another month to get to 20 yeah so don't quit let the other people quit and then you'll be the last one standing in whatever Walk of Life that it is just be the last man standing or the last woman standing or sitting if you can just sit it's fine um yeah don't quit be disciplined apply yourself and try to pace yourself as best you can and look after your body as well like that's something I'm really focusing on in 2024 we've got a big uh exercise gym thing arriving at the end of February uh for my home gym uh you know I spend a lot of time at a standing desk I'm sad now but I do stay mobile throughout the day you know up and down the stairs see the kids make Cups of Tea but do look after your body um because you only get one of them and healthy body healthy mind all that stuff Gary that's brilliant thanks so much for sharing thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to David I really appreciate it",

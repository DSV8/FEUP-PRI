    "transcript": "I told you they'd be back this here is a very large very dirty and dusty gaming pc this thing has been sitting for quite a while in a house where it has not been used at all and it has been allowed to collect dust in fact when it was used it was still collecting dust because there's tons of dust caked in the radiator which means that the fans were turning at one point gathering all that grime and dirt and in this video we're gonna deep clean it this video is sponsored by karma an app and chrome extension that ensures you'll never miss a price drop or coupon code when shopping for your favorite items formerly shop tagger karma can be used to track prices for amazon and other e-retailer listings meaning you'll know when the time is right to pull the trigger on that favorite pc component in my case i've been using it to track the price of ram which has been a bit all over the place lately if i find a kit that i like i can click this slider off to the right and specify parameters for notifications to be sent via push or email so if this listing experiences any price change karma will notify me and i can better decide if it's the right time to buy you can create wish list for these products to better organize them and shop more efficiently and the chrome extension will even apply relevant coupon codes automatically at checkout it's literally that simple karma is a peace of mind tool for smarter shopping on the go and if that doesn't excite you enough there's even a chance to earn cash via paypal for shopping at select retail partners i told you it gets better so be sure to click the link below for a smarter shopping experience with both the chrome extension and smartphone app now for this season they're wearing white gloves i won't be touching this computer anymore without these on just because i have kids i have a wife and i don't want any of that grime rubbing off on them so uh we're going to do something that we haven't done before in this series i'm going to try to do this in every episode this season i have uh blacklight and we're going to turn off all the lights and we're going to see what kind of grime we'll pick up with that black light here we go well on the exterior here we've got some pretty nasty stains i don't want to know what that is but i am certain it's bodily fluid the back of the case of course is caked in dust about half these grills are totally clogged and same goes for the front all this white you're seeing here is dust the entire front intake part of this front panel is caked in dust i don't think there's any air getting through here we've got a few additional stains on the sides here oh god what a way to kick off the season this one is worse than i thought it was all right let's get the lights back on so yeah this thing is pretty awful dust caked up in well most places you would expect there's a lot of dust in these grilles both front and back even these pci slot covers are pretty much caked in dust the graphics card looks disgusting the top mounted 240 ml io is set to intake for some reason but that thing is caked and dust looks awful the front of the case yes that dust that is a true blanket there i don't think there's any airflow getting through especially this uh very front section of the grill here the cables are caked in dust this one is going to be a cleaning perfect for the first episode of season two of pcdc now rather than run through all the cleaning gear that i use for these built like i did in the last season i'm just going to tell you to check out the video description that's where it all is if you see anything i'm using it's probably going to be linked down there and if you see something that's not linked down there let me know in the comments and i'll be sure to add it all right folks yeah yeah this one's this one's going to be a journey here we go so well it is about time it took two full days to clean this system i think doing part because the case is so large this is one of those half cases from cooler master which has these really large fans uh one on the side here which obviously is missing right now with the left side panel off and then one large one at the front as well those fans took a long time to clean i know you didn't see much of it on camera right in the time lapse uh but off camera i mean there was a lot of like prepping trying to get the small little bits of dirt uh removed and even in that front fans case which is kind of transparent i couldn't get all the dust out of the the center hub of the fan i can't i don't want to remove those uh the fan blades themselves i just don't want to damage the fan i don't have any replacements for that so i left that as this but i deep cleaned elsewhere of course all these primary components are all deep clean with the exception again of the power supply i do what i can but i don't like taking these apart for reasons i've discussed in previous videos i think the build looks revitalized yes it is dated to an extent i think this is using a core i5 2500k in case you're interested in a gtx 970 from evga hx 850 watt power supply is more than enough for this system i've got a few storage drives a three terabyte one terabyte hard drives and then a 128 or 120 gig uh ssd which i believe is the boot drive we've got this aio here this is an older corsair 240 mil i o i want to check and see if this actually works though because the owner of the system told me that they were having heating issues now that the cpu would get way too hot way too fast and that sounds to me like a pump failure so i'm going to check the aio right away after booting the system up we want to check and make sure everything is working properly that the fans are all spinning or not you know the fans aren't clipping against wires or anything like that i always do that before giving these systems back to their owner so let's plug it in turn it on and see what happens all right so let's see what we've got turn the power switch on at the back power button up front and we've got nothing that's weird we do have power on the board maybe i just didn't uh plug this in correctly oh okay that was weird definitely need to calibrate these fan curves the pump is working so that's a good sign we don't need to replace the cooler fan up front is turning it's lit up fans up top and aio turning fan at the rear i'm assuming the fan on the side panel will work when we plug that in graphics card fans are turning no clipping there the io is lit up the power supply fan is turning just slightly looks pretty good let's check the screen do we have a post yes we do all right so whenever you get an error like this and it always seems like the end of the world right is this fatal error system halted like that's some big deal uh these asus boards especially is this an asusp it is an ac board they tend to be very finicky when it comes to fan cable connections especially these older ones so right now i don't have a fan connected into the cpu the primary cpu fan header and because of that it gives me this error it says that there's no cpu fan it doesn't want the system to overheat and for some reason that's like the fail safe so if we put the left side panel on connect that cpu fan header you can bypass this in the bios by the way if you wanted then we shouldn't get this fatal error message anymore and all right so we're in the operating system a bit finicky trying to get these things to boot actually to disconnect the two hard disk drives which don't have a boot image on them to get this thing to post properly and without being stuck at the windows loading screen anyway uh i have downloaded a trial version of ida 64 to see what all the fuss was about regarding temperatures whatever the issue was it seems we have fixed it because we've run into tests for about 20 minutes now which is fine enough on air you can see temperatures aren't really fluctuating much more than they already have they're about 70 degrees on the uh graphics card which is a bit hot i mean especially considering we have a very large fan blowing air directly into the shroud but the cpu i mean every core is pretty much at 50 degrees celsius or below it has not been manually overclocked so there is plenty of additional thermal headroom there and yeah so whatever concerns this user had previously they should be no more well i hope this video was at the very least entertaining to watch maybe you learned a thing or two about cleaning components we do have dedicated cleaning videos for specific components including the graphics card and the motherboard already out on the channel you can look those up they'll be under the how-to playlist we also have one coming out i believe for aios and then possibly one for cases as well because if you notice i like to use water to clean these cases and that's not something you would think you know would be like the acceptable thing to do but water works very well much better than even compressed air in a lot of cases when we're talking about just stuck grime that's been there for several years air alone probably won't get all that up i like to use water for that reason alone so if you enjoyed this video be sure to give it a thumbs up i would appreciate that consider subscribing if you have not already be sure to send my wife and email lisa at salazarstudios.org if you have an extremely dirty system something like this will do obviously it's a great way to start with one that's as dirty as this it's as time-consuming as this to clean because it is so large but any case like this that's this dirty will be perfect for this playlist and if you live in the orlando florida area i want to clean it i will be making an exception for a separate i don't know if it's gonna be a separate series or not uh but what i might be doing in the future say you have a very old system and you don't use it anymore it's been collecting dust but it is extremely dirty and you don't live in the orlando florida area um i might be able to buy the system off of you and i'm not going to pay you insane graphics card markup prices right i'm not going to pay you 800 for a card with a gt 710 and an fx8320 and it's just not going to happen but i'll give you a fair offer what i think to be fair and if you think it's fair too then we can exchange the money for the system ship it to me i'll cover shipping and then uh i'll get to clean it and i'll also get to give it away so it's a business write-off in that sense it helps me and it helps you offload your old hardware you get some cash for it again it might not be top dollar i just i can't offer top dollar everywhere but i think this idea could work we would probably have to pace ourselves in the beginning but if we can get sponsors to cover at least the cost of the the builds that we have shipped to uh to the office then i think it can work that'll open the doors up for plenty of dirty systems out there might not be able to do international uh build cleanings that would just be just insane like the cost of ship ability over the atlantic uh is several several hundred dollars and you've got customs and all that crap to deal with but at least to the contiguous 48 u.s states that could work so still in the planning phases there more on that in a future video but again for now thumbs up subscribe let me know in the comments what you thought about this one and stay tuned for episode two in season two my name is greg thanks for cleaning with me",

    "transcript": "So you think you know everything there is to know about hard drives. Well at least I did- I thought I did. Turns out theres been a ton of expansion in the hard drive world. Specifically in the types of applications that individual drives were made for. In front of me I got some candy, Hard drive candy. I got Black, Blue, Red, and Purple. They said \"Hey Lew, we want you to make a video explaining the different attributes of each of these drives, and why they are perfect for specific applications,\" On the far side I the highest performance drive. This is a Six Terabyte Black, WD Black, and the intended application here is inside of your system. Inside your workstation PC, gaming PC, anywhere you need high performance storage. They use the words creative professionals. I consider myself a creative professional. Essentially anyone who is beating the hell out of their drive. Not physical but, in a productivity kind of way, off-loading a bunch of video, let's say, and then editing it. Fast and speedy behaviour. Next up we've got Blue. This is one, that I found kinda interesting. I remember WD Blue sort of being like the de-facto standard, internal hard drive for a very long time theres actually one over here that is exactly that. There's a one terabyte right here which is a standard desktop hard drive. There's a new WD Blue as well, With a built in SSD, it's kinda a hybrid, and thats going to give you enhanced speed on regularly accessed stuff. But it kinda fits a similar use-case scenario to the WD Black. This again is intended for users that are a little bit less intense. But it'll do the same tasks. So Blue, like the others, comes in a variety of different sizes as well as form factors. This is a Four terabyte with that built in SSD functionality. But you can also get it up to Six terabytes, I've got a one terabyte over there. Everyday computing, thats what this on is all about. Now things get a bit more interesting as we move on to Red. Red is designed for Network Attached Storage. This is a WD \"My Cloud\" EX4, It attaches to your network and allows for you to access data locally, that's on the network. Share it with other people, thats what we'll be using it for. Then through the cloud features you can access that data when your not local. Just via the Web. You want a drive that's sort of configured for 24/7 operation. And when you get an enclosure like this the idea is to put multiple drives into these bays, so that you can have a RAID. Lets say for example, you want to have a simple RAID 1, The way that works you'll have two drives, just like these here. So two Reds that match in capacity. You'll have a constant backup of all of the data that you write to that RAID. A hardware backup. So essentially that file lives in both places with each copy. So these install really easily into a system like this. Simply slide it in, click it down and thats about it. Okay so thats Black, Blue, Red, and now its time for Purple. Or as I like to refer to it, the Donatello Drive. It is intended for use in 24/7 surveillance systems, that are constantly writing video files 24 hours a day. That is a fairly hefty request for drive to be operating like that. And right on the front here you'll see it says 24/7 reliability. Intended for everthing up to HD video. Now much like the Reds, which also put an emphasis a reliability, you're going to see an advantage in doubling up the Purples. So I've got another Purple over here as well You still have that oppertunity to create other styles of RAID like \"RAID 0\", or pair up a ton of drives and do something like \"RAID 5\", which is going to enhance speed and redundancy together. The world of RAID. So lets do it one more time real quick, Black: Performance, gaming, creative professionals. In your system. Blue: Everyday tasks. Inside your system. Available SSD inside for a hybrid drive and enhanced peformance. Red: Inside your NAS, multimedia, constant access to your files locally, sharing or via the Web. And then Purple, this is all about surveillance. If you want to stream video, record video to a drive 24/7, it's Purple your looking for. Anyway that wraps it up, and hopefully you guys found this information useful. If your looking for some more, I will drop the relevant links down in the description, so you can check out pricing and availability on all of these various models. We actually dont have any Network Attached Storage right now, we're using like Google Drive to drop files and what not, and obviously that's limited and not the fastest thing in the world. So this is going to allow for us to send pictures back and forth, video files music, et cetera. Anyway I could go on and on as you can probably tell. Thank you very much for watching guys, appreciate your viewer-ship. If you enjoyed this content make sure to leave a thumbs up down below. And I'll catch you on the next episode. Later.",

Send it out!\" So what is this thing? The miniPRO. It has a top speed of 10 MPH, 14 mile range, An anti-theft alarm, Aircraft grade magnesium alloy frame, And safety controls built in It's also able to connect to your Smartphone, and you can like remote control it As I understand it.

Now, this one has This, like, little part here. For some level of Safety, and comfort Silica gel... Here's some lunch for ya', Jack. And here is the unit, Alright, so there's a couple different pieces That smell of, like, what is that? Fresh rubber? Unbelievable. Look at the tires on this! So it looks like we've got our LED Lights in the front here Which will show you the power level, Speed limit, Bluetooth, whether it's locked or not And there's a power switch, there. You see that, Jack? A little door for your charging port This guy here, I'm guessing, And that's that! And it's height adjustable too, by the looks of it. Look at that! That might be me in a few hours from now. No, uh, it won't be but, come on. Power cable, power brick for the power cable, keep it charged. A tube to add air to the tires? Let's get out of the studio and test this baby out! Alright, so, as you can tell, Took this baby for a ride, Super solid. A totally different animal outdoors. As expected though, You steer it around with this, Of course, it controls on the app But it's cool, it balances itself without you even on it You got your battery light constantly displayed, which I like, And he lights, which are configurable And look, you can set these light to any color you want, Now be safe, guys.

    "transcript": "this is nzxt's new Kraken Elite RGB AIO and when NZXT told me that they've upgraded the display in the AIO to a 60hz one it got me thinking can you actually game using the display on your AIO [Music] thank you so on top here there's the manual which I'm sure has plenty of details about how to hook up your NZXT AIO as a gaming display and in terms of packaging this is just how every AIO for the last Millennia has been shipped in terms of RGB fans it seems like nzxt's switched it up a bit with these new fans they've got these slightly flimsy semi-translucent fan blades which I'm guessing is for RGB diffusion and in terms of RGB header it uses nzxt's proprietary connector which is a bit naughty but at least it comes with an RGB Hub in the box which I guess alleviates the naughtiness at least slightly and then here is the included Hub which comes with three little RGB slots and it connects to your motherboard using USB but for today's video I'm significantly more interested in this end of the AIO now the display on the new Kraken is a 2.4 inch 640 by 640 display with a 60hz refresh rate which should be more than enough as Lenin once famously said more than 2.4 inch for a gaming display is nothing but bougie heresy so hopefully we can get games to display on it oh that's a nice solid material I think that's metal but in here is the connector that you use to connect the pump and all of the display mcguffins so let's see what actual headers we have available oh this new connector is way better you can actually see which way around to plug it in you don't have to break the connector to figure out the orientation now unfortunately the new connector does not come with an HDMI port which would have been real convenient so now that we've had a brief look at the new AIO let's plug it into a system that's already running and see what kind of output options we have for this new display [Music] these are lighting up actually I guess I should probably peel this first there we go and now that we have Cam installed some interesting things are happening on the AIO there we go we've got the firmware updated and you can see now that the display is doing its thing although it is upside down so we go to rotate display and then when you click save it turns around good so now we can have a look at the options we have for faces here display an image or GIF but that's like pre-loaded stuff so it's not really useful to us oh there's this new option for web integration this seems interesting I think the web integration may be the way to go because the rest of it's just like temperature monitoring crap which isn't really useful to us now now how Cam's web integration works is you drop a URL into the software and then the AIO displays that web page that's about the extent of it the problem I ran into was how do I use the AIO displaying a web page for real-time gaming the first option I tried was using TeamViewer but I quickly realized considering that I'm not a scam call center I don't know how to use TeamViewer but after a couple of pretty inept attempts I can confidently say it didn't work my next genius idea was to use a browser game like Slither and while inserting the Slither URL into Cam yielded promising results it wasn't a copy of the instance I had running in my browser so I couldn't control anything how do I get my mouse here my next bright idea was to try and use Discord streaming in a browser which again seemed promising but after dropping the Discord Channel URL into Cam the AIO would display an initial frame from the web page and then just stop refreshing so unfortunately after another entire afternoon of struggling another dead end but then it hit me Twitch [Music] but before I enact my genius pan I think I need to mount this on the system so that we're actually gaming on the AIO we're using to cool the system I don't know I feel like it's an important semantic point [Music] oh no I'm gonna use my thigh slash crotch as an anchor point for the radiator while I mount fans can't imagine that going wrong oh turn the PC on [Music] oh look at that it looks all lovely and it's in its Pure White although now that we have the AIO installed comes the the difficult part because I don't want to lean over the system to to view my gaming monitor so I'm gonna have to kind of lean it up here I'm just gonna kind of go for it I'm gonna take the PC oh oh my word this we can move the box out the way and then I think I I think that's gonna do the trick standing here looking at the setup I can't help but think that this is the future of Gaming so I've just finished setting up a fresh Twitch account so I can stream my gameplay to Twitch drop the twitch link into Cam so that the AIO shows the twitch stream which I can hopefully use for gaming which in no way seems like it's going to be a latency nightmare a few moments later hey and there is our twitch stream although you can tell there's a of a funky crop and unfortunately there's nothing I can do about it that's just the way Gaming's gonna happen and as I started the stream more good news look at that it's updating in real time and after just a bit more tinkering I was ready for some game and then I just press play as you can tell at this point we can kind of measure the latency in minutes but it's fine you know latency isn't that important for gaming and once I turned off the secondary display we were in business the game is now launching and that is happening are you using using the AIO display there we go it's loaded in and um the latency is legitimately shocking like I've never felt this much delay and it also seems like the frame rate is very low oh oh my word I'm gonna see if I can get into my car although that is gonna be a very difficult thing to do because the thing with this latency right is that a I guess the frame rate the game is running at is kind of irrelevant which is cool so I could use any hardware theoretically for this but the second problem with it is you kind of have to guess how much movement any particular input is going to generate because you can't correct post input in the way that you normally can I'm going to get into that car if it's the last thing I do I can imagine driving like this is is entirely safe oh we're doing it we're getting into the car look at that we're on the road very good I've aligned everything we're going straight that was such a big latency Spike I jumped like a hundred meters there I just also can't get over the crop it's so wildly unusable wild unusability aside I decided to set a challenge for myself to prove that gaming can happen on an AIO display get a kill in an FPS now at CS go there's a bit of a problem the button to start a match is cropped out yeah that's a problem I'm gonna have to use the main display here I know I know it's kind of cheating but I don't have a choice I don't have a choice because I can't find the button oh oh it's gonna be harder to get a kill than I thought oh oh that hasn't worked that that hasn't even almost worked has it so now I'm gonna use I think an SMG so that I can just spray and pray whichever one I can click on that one [Music] damn it the bot killed me before I could finish buying my SMG uh now I have to wait for another round to finish luckily in the next round the Bots were so busy planting the bomb and winning the game that I had plenty of time to buy my SMG in preparation for the next match which went well oh I'm being shot at ah damn it the problem with having to get so close to your PC to see what's going on is you can really feel the heat emanating off it and you can hear it very clearly this is this is quite intimate and considering that unlike you I'm not looking at it through a macro lens I can't even almost see anything but try as I might I just couldn't get a kill in CS go so I decided to try a much less precise shooter oh I'm being attacked oh no oh no I'm I'm dead oh no I need to do the mouse I I'm dead again come on turn oh God I'm so scared to put any inputs in and after eons of shouting I got real close oh no right oh I I think a kill happened there the gaming experience is so terrible that I can't really tell but luckily I was screen capturing oh I did that is confirmation the gaming happened on the AIO display it worked and there you have it the future of Gaming

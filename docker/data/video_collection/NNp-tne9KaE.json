    "transcript": "Hello! Matt here on DIYPerks. In this video, I'm going to show you, very quickly, how to make a macro filter for your lens. *Arrrrr* (pirate voice) so the first thing you're going to need is a lens filter that's the right fitting for your lens... and a lens you don't mind destryoying! *arrrrr* (pirate voice) And some glue... don't forget the glue. So the first thing we're going to do is destroy the lens! Which is, obviously, the most fun part. So what we want to do is remove the very first bit of glass on the lens. On most lenses, you can unscrew a ring and take it out that way, but on mine, because it's old, it's glued in. So I had to take a hacksaw to it... I've got two of the same lens. Well, HAD two of the same lens. So once you've gotten the first lens bit out you should end up with something that looks like this. Yes it makes your eye look verrrry big. Then we've got to remove this bit of glass from our lens filter, and to do that all we need to do is unscrew the little lens ring that should be in there (hopefully it's not glued, for your sake). Umm.. and then remove the glass, or whatever is inside there. Then we have a bare lens filter, with nothing in it. Then we need to get our glue, and glue our front lens element to the ring we unscrewed from our lens filter. So it should go on like that. It's quite a good fit really. So I'll glue that, and through the power of editing it will be dry and ready to go. So I've successfully glued on the little lens ring to the front lens element using some Stix All. Then I need to do is get the other part of the lens filter and simple screw it on. That makes a very nice tight fit. Now that's on there, all I need to do is get my lens and screw it on like a normal lens filter. Now I'm going to show you a few videos that I've taken with this wonderful, cheap, macro lens filter. To put the scale of this little snale into perspective, this is it on my finger. It's tiny! So there we have it. I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you go out there and make your own macro lens because it's quite good value for money and taking photos in macro has something special about it. It's very fun. So, report back on your findings because I don't think all lens elements will work the same in front of different lenses. Anyway, you've been watching DIYPerks and I hope you've enjoyed this video enough to subscribe or something. Anyway, bye for now!",

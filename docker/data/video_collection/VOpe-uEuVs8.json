    "transcript": "Welcome back to the backyard bunker project. Today we're going to be installing an elevator using an extremely tall, slightly broken scissor lift. This is really high. This video is sponsored by KiwiCo, but more on them later. To catch you up to speed, six months ago I dug an incredibly deep hole in my backyard. I stuck two pieces of 12 foot diameter stormwater runoff pipes into the dirt and then put the lawn back on top. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy. There's a whole 7 episode series if you want to get the dirty details, and I'll leave that playlist in the description. Today though, we're going to drop an elevator into the shaft to make my backyard bunker wheelchair accessible. Regular elevators, however, are ridiculously expensive. For example, the one I installed in my living room costs over $24,000, and this bunker has a budget. So to simplify things, I found a used broken scissor lift in the classifieds for just $3,000, and it goes up and down perfectly great. Just the wheels are a little wonky, but we won't be needing those anyway. And fingers crossed, it should get the job done just fine. We are in the garage. This bad boy is the Snorkel S3219E and is capable of lifting 550 pounds to a max height of 19 feet, which is exactly what we're looking for. It looks like there's a lip on the back of this metal beam. And just like in that one Martian movie, there are a lot of parts on this lift that need to come off. Not for weight saving in our case but more just to use our space down in the bunker more efficiently. The snorkel scissor lift is powered using a hydraulic ram for rising up and down and four hydraulic motors, one on each tire. Getting a little close there to the garage door. We need the ram obviously, but pretty much everything else can go. We don't need those tires anymore. And we can just put plugs into the removed hydraulic outputs in the manifold. We also don't need the entire lower half of the scissor lift. I'll be relocating the four large 6 volt lead acid batteries. We have plenty of room off to the side underneath the deck. I'll be upgrading these to lithium later for better longevity. Lead acid requires too much maintenance for a bunker. We also need to make sure it all works down in the bunker hole first before fine tuning the final product. If we wait until it's perfect, it'll never get done. Oh, it's heavy. The ride's on there. So that all the weight is transferred on this hub-centric piece and all the bolts do is hold it tight. The real reason we're modifying the base is so we can add some adjustable leveling capability to the elevator. An elevator that rises up at an angle doesn't help us out very much and would be dangerous. We have successfully turned a mobile scissor lift into an immobile elevator. Partially. There's still a little bit more we got to do. Building a secure foundation for the elevator also requires a lot of concrete, which we poured ourselves. One interesting thing that I found at my local metal mart was while I was looking for rebar, I found something called fiberglass rebar from Corning. Turns out the same company that makes the glass on our smartphones makes the concrete reinforcement that's 8% cheaper than steel while being 2 times stronger than steel rebar and 7 times lighter, all without rusting. Without internal reinforcement, concrete will just crack and fall apart over time. The ridges on the rebar and its grid light structure will help hold the pad together. We know that our bunker tubes are designed to last about 100 years underground, and I imagine this concrete slab will now also be here for my grandkids' grandkids. One additional thing to keep in mind is that dry concrete dust has some nasty stuff in it, like silica, which can shred your lungs from the inside, which is not on the list of things that sound fun, so masks are rather important. We're mixing the dry concrete with water to get an oatmeal-like consistency, and then dropping it down in the hole with some satisfying splatters. Nice. Dad, just clean it up! Before the concrete has time to harden, I'll throw in four steel in-bed mounting blades. These don't have to be perfectly level yet, and that part can come later. Huge thanks to KiwiCo for sponsoring this video. They've sent me one of their Eureka crates, which has a two-in-one lantern inside, which is perfect for the bunker. If you haven't guessed already, I'm a huge fan of science and engineering, and KiwiCo allows kids and teens of all ages to experience discovery and success with monthly hands-on projects of their own. These projects get delivered right to your door. Designed by experts, KiwiCo has shipped more than 50 million crates to more than 40 countries worldwide. For ages 0 to 100 the fund innovative project expand the mind with constructive educational entertainment, like this two-in-one lantern. Cambry and I like to give these KiwiCo subscriptions away for birthdays or holidays, and they're especially fun during the summer when kids might not be in school. Glad I have this lantern to illuminate the bunker during Cambry's first trip underground because first impressions are important and I hope she likes it. Use code JerryRig to get 50% off your first month. With 9 different lines, there's something fun for everyone. KiwiCo.com/JerryRig. Now that our two-in-one lantern is finished, let's get this deconstructed and reconstructed elevator down in the bunker so Cambry can visit us for the very first time. While we're waiting for the concrete to dry, we designed an adjustable mounting bracket in SolidWorks and had it laser cut and bent for about $200 from Oshkut.com, just like we do with all of our other projects. The more perfect and square we can make our mounting bracket now, the easier it will be when the elevator goes into the shaft. The leveling ability comes from the 5-eighth inch diameter all-thread and these two massive nuts, one on either side. Once the whole metal brace is set down into the elevator shaft, we can use the bracket as a template to weld and position the all-thread exactly where we need it. The 5-eighth inch pipe is sitting inside a one-inch hole with a plastic insert to make sure the bracket is centered on the all-thread. The extra wide spacing gives us a little room for error, not that I anticipate making any mistakes, and that extra wiggle room will help make dropping the scissor lift down onto the bolts easier. And now that it's being done used as a template, we can weld that leveling bracket to the base of the scissor lift and cut away the temporary cross members. And finally, the elevator is ready to come out of the garage on its last voyage. With all the excess metal removed and the hydraulics taken off, I'd be surprised if what's left weighs more than 1,500 pounds, which is a cakewalk for the telehandler which can handle about 15,000 depending on how extended the boom gets. These telehandlers are pretty much the most versatile pieces of equipment on any construction site. They can never crab walk like a hummer. Down, Nate. It's going to work. Okay, how are we looking? Just keep going. Alright, start going slower. Go slow. You looking at those two? Yep. What? Come up a little. Woo! There we go, I'm on. On both? I'm on both. Down. Woo-hoo! Good? Is that it? That's it. Take a look at that. I'm excited, we got an elevator. First try, baby. Drop it. Let's go. Drop. That's the hard part though. We have an elevator in the bunker. Success! And thanks to all that planning and prep work we did earlier, the scissor lift fits extremely neatly right on top of the all-thread. And now we can tighten or loosen these nuts to level each corner of the unit to make sure each platform is level with the ground even after raising up 20 feet. The platform is bolted and leveled, and since safety is one of our top priorities, we've made a little special something for the top. I'm not worried about me or Cambry, our hands, we know where they're going, but for little kids we have to make sure they don't get pinched on the side of the walls as the elevator is going up. Which is why we've made this aluminum platform, lightweight, sits on top and makes sure that little kids can stay safe during transportation. And using that same hydraulic pump, hydraulic ram, and batteries that the scissor lift came with, along with the little ramp and perfectly sized bolt-on platform, there is now a fully wheelchair accessible elevator with access to my backyard bunker. All for about $3,200. And we have a total of 6 bolts holding the platform to the lift. Now all that's left is Cambry's first voyage underground. Alright, Cambry, you ready to go in the elevator for the first time? I'm ready to go in the bunker for the first time. Okay, so grab that controller right there, bring the elevator up. Okay, so grab that controller right there, bring the elevator up. Okay. And then stop it. Perfect. Can it keep going? It can go higher up like two feet higher. Sorry. Oh god. It's a little wiggly huh? I'm a little nervous about this especially because there's like brakes are going on. It's like wobbling right now. Oh don't make it wobble. It's gonna make me smell like drop. We'll make it more secure later. I'm nervous. Does it just go fast? No, super slow actually. Because I feel like it came up kind of fast. It does go up faster than it goes down. That's not bad. Yeah that's not bad. Say goodbye to civilization. Oh my god. Oh okay. Here we are. Oh is this it? Does it go down any lower? No that's it. It smells like a bunker. Come on in. Okay. Oh this does not feel safe. Is this safe? You're fine. 100% safe. Hey. This brings up a little thing of like meaning to you're in the dog house. This is a grape house. What do you think? I'm still just taking it all in. It's bigger than I thought. Like this is kind of cozy. I think I was expecting it to be more like, I don't know, creepy. This is cool. Yeah. This is like bat cave-esque. Is this, did you think we could do this? What were your thoughts when I mentioned the bunker project? I mean like anything else you'll ask me to do something and I'll be like yeah but I don't actually think it comes to fruition. So this is just kind of wild that it's really here. Like it's so weird because I've seen the process. I've been watching out the window and it's buried and then I kind of forget about it except for the one little like entrance. But like it's really cool. It's yeah. I like it. I still feel like I'm just taking it all in. Like it's bigger than I imagined. Like I don't feel claustrophobic down here. Like it feels cool and cozy and legit. And so knowing there's a quarter million pounds of dirt above your head doesn't bother you too much? Hey don't bring up that aspect. You want to tour? Okay. Alright so over here in the far corner is the master bedroom. This is going to be where you know people, you know, master bedrooms sleep. And then there's the exit shaft over there on the far side. And so we're going to have a dividing wall right here. It's so short. It's the same as the other side. No I mean...oh yeah the ceiling. Is there going to be like a little hidden door that opens up or something? It just seems so cool. Yeah I think so. And then up here in the top we'll have either like a library or like an armory that like folds down. And then here's going to be like a bunk room with bunk beds on this side. And then here at the middle point where we welded both the pieces of tube together is going to be the largest TV you've ever seen. And then kitchen on this side. Combustible toilet over there. Whole thing powered by EcoFlow batteries. And then like a couch and stuff over here. So it'll be even more cozy. And now you can come down whenever you want. Probably won't be that free for a while. It's a little sketchy getting down here. Well, want to finish this off? Thanks a ton for watching. We'll see you around.",

    "transcript": "- Welcome to Samsung Galaxy Unpacked. - The Galaxy Z Flip5 comes with the largest cover screen on a Galaxy Z Flip yet. It's a whole new era for selfies. Zoom in or out or select different aspect ratios and settings to capture memorable group selfies, all straight from the cover screen. And Galaxy Watches take the hands-free camera experience to another level. Snap photos, film videos, pause, and zoom all from your wrist. The Galaxy Z Flip5's rear cameras are enhanced with AI which reduces noise and boost quality crisp photos and videos even when you zoom in or film in low light. And with AI Stereo Depth Map, bouquet effects are heightened to make your portraits come alive. We've also made it more familiar and intuitive to use. A quick swipe up gives you quick access to your credit cards, QR codes, IDs and more on Samsung Wallet. You can also check your tickets or boarding pass at a glance. And just like our Galaxy Watch, you can swipe down for quick settings, right for notifications and left for all of your favorite widgets from weather to Samsung Health, GameSnacks and even Google Finance. - [Presenter] We set out to better protect the display by modifying it with a new shock-dispersion layer. This makes the main screen stronger and more resilient. We also redesigned the hinge to feature a dual rail structure that excels in diffusing external impact and enhances stability and toughness. Introducing the Galaxy Z Fold5. We designed an integrated hinge with a pivot shaft that moves the wing plate to create a larger curvature and it reduces the fold's gap to almost nothing. We call it the Flex Hinge. And with a higher level of tension, our new hinge can be adjusted with extreme precision to get just the angle you want. And even with all these advancements, our new hinge still comes with an IPX8 rating for water resistance. This performance is anchored on the same leading technology as our flagship Galaxy S series, providing the most powerful processor on Galaxy Foldables, yet. - [Narrator] 7.6 inch display, max brightness 1,750 knits, up to 120 Hertz adaptive refresh rate, effortless multitasking with next level productivity, drag and drop, split screen, popups and new ways to easily navigate using both hands, drop files, move icons. The intuitive task bar now supports up to four recently used apps for switching between windows and tasks with speed and ease. The new S Pen is lighter and with a slimmer case, it's easy to take everywhere. Whether closed, open, or in between, it optimizes apps in flex mode with a new panel for easy control. - [Presenter] In pursuit of productivity, the Galaxy Z Fold5 offers an immersive large screen that fits in your pocket. And for the free spirited style icons, the Galaxy Z Flip5 is a pocket-sized powerhouse for self-expression. They come with an IPX8 rating for water resistance. Both will be available starting August 11th in select countries. The Galaxy Z Fold5 starts at $1,799 and the Galaxy Z Flip5 at $999. - [Presenter #2] We're delighted to introduce our latest watch which helps you not only track, but personalize and enhance your sleep so you can make the most of your days and nights. - Overnight, the Galaxy Watch 6 series takes various measurements to gauge your quality of rest. In the morning, it sends you a sleep scope based on the analysis of a hypnogram which identifies the different stages of your sleep cycle and you can easily check all of this right on your wrist. The PPG sensor recognizes the different stages by measuring heart rate and heart rate variability which change according to brainwaves. New and updated watch faces make it easier than ever to see your score and reminders with just a glance, prompting those positive habits and healthy bedtime routines. - [Presenter #2] Our proprietary powerful three in one bioactive sensor provides a comprehensive picture of your wellbeing by monitoring ECG, blood pressure, body composition along with heart rate. With a new Galaxy Watch 6 series, tracking your heart rate and getting real-time insights into the total wellness is effortless. You'll get alerts if you experience a low or high heart rate while resting and you can gain a deeper insight into your cardiovascular health with a new irregular heart rhythm notification or IHRN. It comes in two sizes and signature colors, giving you more ways to express yourself. With multiple band options including Slimmer Designs and the new one click band, it's easy to match your style and needs. If you prefer a more timeless look, we're excited to announce that we're bringing back the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic with a new signature rotating bezel. The new rotating bezels are thinner and more refined, bringing a modern touch to a design that stays true to traditional time pieces. The Galaxy Watch 6 series is the first to come with Wear OS-4 and software upgrades will soon be available for Galaxy Watch 4 series and later models. The Galaxy Watch 6 starts at $299 and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic starts at $399. You can get yours starting August 11th. - [Narrator #2] The Galaxy Tab S9 series comes with dynamic AMOLED 2X displays with an adaptive refresh rate up to 120 hertz. Equipped with vision booster, these displays detect your surroundings to maximize color contrast in different lighting conditions. For the first time, both the Galaxy Tab S9 series and S Pen come with an IP-68 rating. The Tab S9 series is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen2 mobile platform for Galaxy. The TAB S9 series now features a thoughtfully redesigned structure for dispersing heat. It sends heat in two directions, above the display and below the body. We minimize the parts used and utilize a minute gap between the external surface glass and display to accommodate a new USBC port. The Galaxy Tab S9 series comes with our stunning display and in box S Pen. You can choose from two colors, our signature graphite or a new sophisticated beige. Tab S9 Ultra will be available for $1,199. Tab S9 Plus from $999. And Tab S9 from $799. Pre-orders start today. - Thank you for being part of this Samsung Galaxy Unpacked. (audience applauds) See you next time.",

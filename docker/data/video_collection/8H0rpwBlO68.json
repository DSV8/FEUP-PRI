    "description": "Apple has officially announced the iPhone XR, a new model that features a 6.1-inch notched LCD display and Apples Face ID system, similar to last years iPhone X. Replacing the iPhone 8 in Apples lineup, the new iPhone XR is a pretty significant upgrade for Apple because it standardizes the iPhone Xs design and features across the companys latest line of phones.

    "transcript": "- Hi everybody, it's Nilay from The Verge. I'm here with the new iPhone XR. This is a super strange phone, I think it's really interesting. Design-wise, it's a hybrid of like the iPhone 8, with this glass back and the iPhone X with this notched screen edge to edge. It's got a bunch of the specs of the iPhone XS, and it's missing a whole bunch of stuff too. So let's go through it real quick. The iPhone XR has a glass back, an aluminum frame, seven thousand series aluminum, on the front is a 6.1 inch LCD display with 326 pixels per inch. It looks a lot like the iPhone X display. Curved corners and a notch at the top, but that is an LCD, if you get close, you can see some of the anti-aliasing they're doing. It has the same A12 bionic chip as the new iPhone XS. It has the same wide-angle camera on the back as the XS. It's only a single camera though on the front, it's got the same TrueDepth face detection system and selfie camera as the XS. So really what you're looking at is a lot of the design of the old iPhone 8 with a glass back, aluminum frame, with the front design of the iPhone X with the notched screen and a bunch of the features of the iPhone 8 spec bump. So it's a really strange hybrid of a phone. I think it's really interesting. It comes in all these colors, you've got yellow, coral, blue, there's a black one, a white one, and a product red one as well. I'm not a big fan of the yellow. It's the product red one though that I think is absolutely the best. There's been a mob scene around it the entire time we've been here. It's just a really striking phone. And then obviously you've got black and white, same as ever. I think these colors are gonna sell the phone over the iPhone XS for a lot of people. Camera on the new iPhone XR is 12 megapixels, single lens on the back. Seven megapixel selfie camera with a TrueDepth system on the front. This is pretty remarkable, they can do portrait mode with a single lens. Last year, only the plus phones and the ten could do portrait mode with dual cameras. Obviously Google can do portrait mode with a single lens with the Pixel 2. Apple's figured out how to do it with a single lens on the XR. This camera's also faster. They're doing something called smart HDR, which takes four frames, a number of inter frames, and a long exposure, to do better HDR photography using this camera system. That stuff is very interesting. Obviously, we gotta test it all out. Most notably about the LCD screen is the lack of 3D touch. So every iPhone since the 6s has had 3D touch, where you squeeze the display, that is simply not here. We don't know why Apple took it out, we're gonna ask them. The iPhone XS has 3D touch, the iPhone 7 has 3D touch, the iPhone 8 has 3D touch. Those are all still on sale, but the XR absolutely does not have it. That is the biggest omission from this phone compared to the XS. I just like holding these phones. I think the color is absolutely beautiful. Obviously the big question everybody always has with phones like this is battery life. Apple says that it's 90 minutes more than the iPhone 8 plus did. Everybody else always wants to know about price. These are gonna start at 749, which is kind of a remarkable price, and they're gonna go up to 256 gigs of storage. The pricing will go up accordingly from there. (electronic rattling) This thing is making sounds at me. Alrighty, we got way more from the iPhone event today. Dieter played with the iPhone XS and the Apple Watch series four, that's on the YouTube page, and there's a ton more coverage on theverge.com.",

    "transcript": "The Moto G4, a solid mid-level device that passed my durability test. Its time to take it apart and see what its made of. I have an unopened G5 on my desk, but life would not be complete without a tear down of its older sibling first. We can test the G5 tomorrow. Lets get started. [Intro] Its a pleasant change from when I finally tear down a device that isnt glued shut. The back panel is removable, but that only gives you access to the SIM and SD card trays, everything else is still hidden under 19 d4 screws surrounding that back plastic panel. At this point we can pretty safely assume that the more screws the phone has, the more durable its going to be. Theres one ribbon we need to disconnect before lifting off that back panel; its under this rubber tab. The little ribbon that unsnaps goes to the camera sensor and flash. The two gold tabs on the opposite side go to the earpiece. Ill show you that in just a second. Now this tape does not come off in one piece, so if you do swap out your screen or battery, its going to be easy to tell that someone has been inside of your phone. The battery connector is a pretty flimsy little two-prong plug. You dont see this type of connector very often anymore. The battery, unfortunately, does not have any magic pull tabs either. Instead it requires a bit of aggressive negotiation. Im using that flat side of my metal pry tool, taking special care not to puncture anything since a punctured battery would be the end of your phone. This guy is a 3000 milliamp hour which is actually the same size as the new Galaxy S8interesting. The eccentric rotating mass vibrator motor is over here at the bottom of the phone. With the same type of connector that we saw the battery using. Its tucked under this black little rubber blanket that also covers the non-modular micro USB charging port. There are two more T4 screws holding down the motherboard. Some phone manufacturers, who I wont name, seem to be ashamed of their headphone jack. But we have Motorola over here rolling out the red carpet on top of theirs. Thumbs up for the red decorations, Motorola. Its actually got a really interesting design - this headphone jack. It easily pulls out, leaving a ribbon with gold contact pads inside the little hole in the frametotally modular. Before the motherboard can lift out of the screen frame, Ill disconnect the screen ribbon; its under the copper tape. And we have the last little ribbon for the headphone jack up here at the top. Ill lift up the latch connector and slip it out with my tweezers. Before we look at the screen, lets talk about the main board, specifically the cameras. The front camera has a little bit of gold tape covering the latch connector. Ill set that off to the side next to the water damage indicator. Once that tape is off, the latch will lift up unlocking the front camera and it can slip out and away from the motherboard. The rear camera is on the other side. It has the same type of latch connector that weve seen all over this phone. And then both cameras are free. The camera on the left is the larger 13 megapixel camera. This camera only shoots in 1080p, but since most TVs and computers are still displaying 1080, thats fine for the moment. Its just not future proof. The iPhone 6 only shoots in 1080p as well and a lot of people are still using those phones. The front facing camera is 5 megapixels. Neither of them have optical image stabilization. Now remember that huge speaker grill on the front of the phone? This is pretty interesting actually. Take a look at this tiny speaker back here. Talk about compensating. Ill rip out the extremely large speaker grill material so we can see exactly whats going on. There are a few screw holes, but the speaker is literally only shooting out of that far left side of the grill. Such a strange placement. Its not even in the center. Its such a small speaker for such a large hole. Maybe the sound is supposed to echo down that chamber or something. Kind of weird. Either way, this is the replacement screen now. And like always Ill be including replacement parts in the video description. Luckily the Moto G4 screens are pretty cheap now. You might need to separate the old LCD from the frame. Just use some heat to soften the glue, remove it, and then reuse the frame for your next screen. Replacement screens should come with adhesive preinstalled. Once you get the new screen into the frame, the rest of the assembly is pretty simple. Ill tuck that earpiece back into the frame. Then the motherboard can literally click down into place. Make sure the external power and volume buttons are lined up with the motherboard or youll have problems later on. New screen gets clicked in with the metallic tape over the top of the connector. Then the headphone jack ribbon can get slipped into the little slot and locked down with the little latch. The vibrator motor needs to be sitting into the frame, along with the two silver T4 head screws that go into the two holes on the motherboard. Lay out the red carpet for this headphone jack couldnt agree more. And finally the battery goes in with its little flimsy motherboard connector. Make sure to tuck the black and red wire underneath the plastic brackets right there alongside the battery. The back plastic slides on, then you can clip the flash ribbon connector into place. And 19 screws later Ill toss the exterior back panel on the phone and hear is satisfyingly snap all around the back. And its over. The phone is back together and fully functional. You can join me tomorrow for the durability test of the Moto G5. Well see if the new metal design holds up as good as its plastic sibling. And check it out I just did a whole repair video without once saying the word Lego ...and... never mind. Thanks for watching. Ill see you around.",

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Has your career in networking stagnated? Has your career come to a grinding halt? Don't let your career crash and burn. Are you feeling dejected? Are you feeling down in the dumps? Are you feeling that life is just not fair? Because for instance, you failed an exam or because something went wrong at work. Have you given up standing up and carrying on? Has your career crashed and burned? Are you stuck in a rut? Are you stuck in a dead-end job? Now, I want to encourage you through this video to pick yourself up and carry on towards your goals. Don't let problems stop you from reaching your goals, and I'm not just saying this. This is not just some nonsense that I've made up. This is based on real life. You cannot let your failures hold you back. You've got to pick yourself up and carry on. It's not important how many times you've stumbled. It's not important how many times you've failed. What's important is how many times you pick yourself up and try and reach your goals. Don't let your failures hold you back. Learn from them. You can often learn more from your failures then from your successes. Sometimes in life, you just need enough pain to drive you to change your life. If you're comfortable, it's very difficult to make the changes to change your life, but if you hate your job, if you hate your financial position, if you hate where you're at in life, go and do something about it, and one of the easiest ways to do that is through education. One of the things I love about networking and IT in general is that just by studying and working hard, you can change your circumstances entirely. Through hard work and determination and simply studying and applying your knowledge, you can change your life. Now, just like this plane that ran out of fuel and then crashed, does it feel like you've run out of energy, motivation and the will to change your life, and now you've crashed? If that's true, what are you gonna do to change your circumstances? I've personally seen how others can change their lives through hard work, study and application of knowledge, but it's not only others that have changed their lives. I've done the same. You know that they say that education is one of the biggest enablers in life today. You can change your life through education, and I'm not just talking about formal education. I'm talking about educating yourself. It's a very sad statistic that a lot of people that go through school, stop reading books once they finish with school, they stop reading. They stop developing themselves. That is a fatal mistake. Don't be like those people. Make sure that you study and read and change your life every day through continuing education. If you don't wanna study, then you shouldn't be in networking. When I get frustrated with all the changes in networking, I often say I should've become a shoe salesman. Or perhaps taken another job where there aren't the constant changes, but that wouldn't have enabled me to do what I've done in my life. Networking, education and study have allowed me to change my life. When you stumble or so-called fail at something like failing an exam, you've got to keep your eyes on the destination. Don't look at the problems of today. Keep your eyes on the destination. Or what are you trying to reach. They say that if you don't have a goal, you're gonna hit it every time. You've got to have a goal or a set of goals or a vision of what you wanna accomplish. You've got to look to the future and see where you wanna go. Where do you wanna be, six months from today, 12 months from today, a year from today, five years from today, 10 years from today, and so forth, and so on? Goal setting is important. What are your goals? What are you trying to accomplish? What's the big vision? Where do you wanna go? It's much easier to handle the problems of today. When you know where you're going and you just see those as stumbles along a journey or along a path, just like a child that stumbles or falls over multiple times when trying to learn to walk, you're gonna have stumbles in your life. You're gonna make mistakes. Don't let those get you down. Look at where you're going. Don't focus on the problems, focus on what you're trying to achieve. In life we can experience nasty knocks, things go wrong, but what are you gonna do when those things happen? What I always found amazing in life is people who have some of the hardest issues to deal with in life, are sometimes the happiest or the most courageous or accomplish the most. People with a lot often complain, people with little often, don't complain. It's amazing about life. Which type of person are you gonna be? Are you gonna focus on the problems, focus on your mistakes or focus on ways to change your life? You know that to become a CCNA, you have to pass once. To become a CCMP, you have to pass your three exams once. To become a CCIE, you have to pass once. People don't generally ask you, how many times did you fail your CCNA? Or how many times did you fail your CCIE? They will ask you, are you a CCNA? Or are you a CCIE? In other words, it's not how many times you've failed that counts. It's how many times you've got up and then succeeded. Now I was very fortunate. I passed my CCIE on the first attempt, but to the average is a lot greater than that. I dunno what the statistic is at the moment, but it's something like most people only pass on their fourth or fifth attempt. I've heard stories of people who've had to take their exams many, many times before passing. Now you could laugh at that, but I think it shows tenacity that shows endurance. That's something that a lot of people seem to lack today. You need to have endurance or stubbornness, if you like, or tenacity to keep on going. (upbeat music) I like to say this, if you wanna have a pity party, in other words, you wanna feel sorry for yourself. Give yourself pity. You are down in the dumps. You feel dejected. You feel upset because something went wrong. Like you failed an exam. Do that for one day. Have your pity party, feel sorry for yourself, but after one day, put that behind you. Stand up, get up and continue. Don't be like others. Keep on learning. You on adapting your knowledge. Life is not a straight line of successes. Sometimes you learn more from your failures than you do from your successes. If you've failed or made a mistake, feel sorry for yourself, but do that for one day, and then forget about that. Pick yourself up and carry on. Work towards your goal. What is your goal? Is your goal to become a CCNA? Is your goal to become a CCMP? Is your goal to get a promotion at work? Or perhaps to become a CCIE? Is to move to a different town or to earn more money? Get a better car? Whatever the goal is, keep that goal in mind and work towards that goal and note that you're most likely gonna have failures along the way, but that's not in itself a failure. That's life. We all fail at some things, but you got to pick yourself up and then carry on towards the goal. Don't lose sight of your vision. Don't lose sight of the goal or the objective that you're trying to accomplish or the goal that you're trying to reach. Keep that in mind, don't look at the failures along the way. (upbeat music)",

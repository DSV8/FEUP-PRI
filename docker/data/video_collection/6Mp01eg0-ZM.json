    "transcript": "Okay hello, I'm back. I was on a trip for a little bit, and now I'm back in the comfy studio. It's really not that comfy. Not this exact spot. It's a white table and a green chair. Some of you might not know, that the chair is green. Anyhow! What's up guys Lewis here with another video and today we're going to check out something called Dimple. Dimple Dimple.IO, Your custom buttons for Android NFC Devices. Sounds cool This is a simple, inexpensive way to add more buttons to your device. And it doesn't need any kind of external power source; It just needs NFC on your phone. It can do various things like launch applications It can turn on the flashlight Trigger your camera This is exactly as it sounds, there's really not too much to explain here. It's more of a demonstration. So I'm gonna go ahead - and as you can see here - there is a little bit of a quick start guide. \"Clean the back of your gadget. Turn on the NFC. Try out the location. Long hold the button. \"Install the app. Remove the adhesive backing. Stick it to the device. Follow the instructions.\" And then, as you can see here. The final step is \"Buttons!\" with an exclamation point It will work on Android devices 4.0 and above with NFC but it excludes metal phones like the HTC One I apologize, HTC people Alright, so let's go ahead and cut across this dotted line As you can see, I sort of missed that line Just like that, we have the Dimple.IO I have a Galaxy S6 here, and I'm sort of thinking it would make sense here Because when you're holding it, right, that's sort of right where your finger lines up comfortably Comfy little spot. It's just a 3M adhesive Let me follow the steps here \"Clean your device.\" Okay Got some cleaner here from a company called Looj \"Turn on the NFC.\" Okay NFC, turn it on baby So rather than permanently installing the buttons right away, You want to make sure the location you hope to put them is gonna work fine with NFC So you just sort of hold it in that location, then long press one of the buttons and if it picks it up, you'll go straight to the Dimple.IO app, which I'm gonna install right now I'm gonna line it up Right there like that Lined up \"Thank you for purchasing DIMPLE. This tutorial will teach you how to use it.\" Do we want the tutorial? Alright, I'll give it a chance. It uses NFC. Okay, fine, we're gonna leave NFC on. \"Press and hold a button\" [Laughs] Now it tells me I've successfully pressed a button Thank you for that \"Press a button to edit\" Alright, the top button Okay, hold it \"This is a popup window. This button is empty!\" Alright let me add something to that I want to turn on my flashlight \"Success\" saved, okay Now, let me do something on the second button \"Add.\" And let's launch an application this time We will launch the camera app. Save And then press the button to save That is easy Alright, third button \"Add.\" Wow you can open a URL That's kinda cool Call a number It can be a media button For play/pause if you are listening to, like, a podcast or something like that Call a specific number that you might call often \"Take a picture.\" Just right away take a picture? Okay, I'm gonna try that And then I'm gonna program the last button \"Use a third party plugin. Open a URL. Change your setting.' Settings might be nice And you can pick a specific setting So change your WiFi setting Bluetooth, Screen rotation, and then an action to either turn on, turn off, toggle What about screen rotatio? Let's try that, and let's say that the button toggles it Toggles the lock, I suppose Okay Yeah! Check it out! That is locking the orientation now Beautiful Alright, now this button It just takes a picture right away! Woah! That is fast! Get over here for a second, Jack. Come here. I'm gonna take a quick picture Yeah, right in there, right in here People think you're imaginary [Laughs] That's fast! Okay, that's very useful for that reason alone Not launching the camera app, but just snapping a photo Snap Now the top button, I programmed for what? I can't remember now Ah, flashlight Ooooooooooooooo Show you guys up there See that? Alright When you need a flashlight you're searching for something real quick. Boom! Buttons! Buttons for everyone And the nice thing here is that this doesn't require any kind of maintenance or charging or anything It just sits there and that's all you really ever need to do with it This thing is probably the quickest way you're gonna get some things done I don't think there's a quicker way to access your flashlight How about \"youtube.com/moretop5\" \"moretop5\" I've reprogrammed the nipple Never thought I'd say that combination of words Press down the button Boom! Right to my favorite YouTube page \"MoreTop5\" Yeah, this thing is cool This thing is definitely cool Anyway, if you're interested in it I'll drop a link down in the description But as you can see, it does some simple functions that you would otherwise have to navigate to in order to get to And it does it in a physical way Something else to mention. You can put more than one Dimple on the back of your NFC-enabled Android device You can put multiple dimples If you get addicted To these nipples Alright, getting carried away Thanks very much for watching guys, hope you enjoyed this content If you did make sure to leave a thumbs up down below And if you want to know more about this product, I'll drop a link in the description so you can check that out Thanks for watching, I'll catch you on the next episode Later guys Yeah this thing is cool, this thing is definitely cool We're gonna go with it The show must go on!",

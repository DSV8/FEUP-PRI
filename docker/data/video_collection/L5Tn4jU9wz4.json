    "transcript": "- Come on, Bruce Willis, Obama, and Paris Hilton all use the same really strong password. - That's interesting. - No attacker can use these techniques that I've shown you. Grab your password and log into your Facebook, and your Twitter, and your YouTube - Scary website. it's amazing to see how much data has been breached. (upbeat music) - Hey, everyone, David Bombal back with Micah. Micah, welcome. - Hey, thanks, David. So Micah, we've done a series of these videos where you show us all kinds of crazy things with OSINT. What are you gonna show us today? - Today's about breached data, about that stolen data that people have released to the internet, and why we need to care about it as OSINT investigators and really just as people on the internet, 'cause it's your and my data that's out there that other people are using. - Every other day you read about some kinda breach, some kinda hack. And I won't even mention names because by the time the video's released or whenever someone's watching this, maybe six months from today, it's gonna be another company. It's scary how much stuff is out there. And it's not just scary from a perspective of me finding that as an OSINT investigator and then using it in my investigations, which is what I do professionally, but I think about my LinkedIn account, my Facebook account, my accounts on GitHub, and other places. And I think if those get compromised, I may have problems. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you how to do some of these things that we do in the OSINT world, but then there'll also be some suggestions for you to do personally to protect yourself as well. - Please take it away. Show us what you've got. - For this, we're gonna just hit three sites, and the first is have Have I Been Pwned. A lot of you may not legally be able to use or view even breached data because, let's face it, breached data is stolen data. Somebody broke into a website, broke into a server, stole the user information with user names, and passwords, and emails, and then released it on the internet or sold it. You wouldn't be able to use that in your investigations, but there are ways of accessing that that are more ethical and legal. And the first one is Have I Been Pwned. Many, many people use this site. - Scary website. It's amazing to see how much state has been breached. - Absolutely. And just by entering in a phone number with your country code or something like an email address, you get to see the breaches that that email address or phone number were in. You don't get to see the actual data. That's the ethical and the legal part of this site. And one of the reasons why I highly recommend it, it's very simple. You just type in an email. I'm gonna use johndoe@example.com. Here, for John doe@example.com, we see 56 breaches and 12 pastes that email was found in. And if we scroll down, we see that it was in the Ge.tt, the Factual, the GeekedIn. And we can read about the other types of data that was found on these websites, and we can understand a little bit more about it. But we don't know any of the other data about this john@gmail.com. We don't know what any of the data that was in their profile, what got released. And this is actually something that scammers use all the time against us, David. I don't know if know if you've ever gotten the email, \"Oh, I'm sorry to tell you, but I've had a virus on your system or a Trojan on your system for months, and I've watched you as you've gone to pornographic websites and I have videos.\" And then they give you a little trust trick. They say, \"Here's your password.\" That password's coming from breached data. And you'd be surprised at the many people that don't realize that, and actually send money. - This website is legit, right? - Oh yeah, absolutely. This website is was made by Troy Hunt, Australian security researcher, very, very trustworthy individual. And what they do is they grab the larger breaches out there. So if it has a certain number of users in that breach, they will grab it. They will then extract the email addresses and the phone numbers from the passwords. They will actually... If you go all the way up to the top here, click on the Notify me link right up here and give him your email, and your mother's email, and your kids' emails, and register them. And then when a new dump comes out, and your email or somebody else's email is in there, they will email that person and say, \"Oh I'm really sorry, your information was in this new dump.\" Giving you a little bit of heads up, hopefully, before attackers get to use that. - I'll just say this. Troy's amazing. So this is a legitimate website. I only ask that question because I know a lot of people would be worried putting their telephone numbers specifically into a site like this. So it is a reputable site. Troy's doing great work. So if anyone who's watching, I don't think you need to worry about putting your data in here. It's not like he's farming your data. He's trying to help you. - And David, I hate to say this. People think that their emails are private. in certain parts of the world, there are privacy rules about storage and all. But the reality is if you just Google your email, your phone number, or something like that, you'll see that there are many sites out there that may be sharing that, and especially if it's found in breached data. - It depends on which generation you come from, I think part of it. In the old days, people tended to try and keep this kinda stuff private. But these days, so much of it's out there. It's worrying. - Absolutely. This site, the thing I like about it is that anybody can come here and look and say, \"Oh yes, my email address or my Target's email address was found in breaches.\" If you are a person that's a red teamer, somebody that's gonna be doing social engineering, an OSINT investigator, what this tells me is that somebody has, at some point, use the johndoe@example.com email on at least 56 different websites. So it's an active-ish email address. Think about if you put in there micahhoffman@hotmail.com. If you were looking up me, then you could say, \"Oh, look, Micah actually uses that.\" Keep in mind also that it might not be me that that michaelhoffman@hotmail.com email address maps to. So we always have to be careful of that. The thing that this site also shows you, if you go all the way to the bottom, and many, many people do not scroll to the bottom, is it gives you some of the Pastebin pastes where this email was found. And I'm just gonna click on one. I hope nothing bad comes up. You can see this is kind of like a data dump. Here we have customer ID field, field. And we see, as we scroll down, we have some other data. And we scroll over here, we see people's names. I wonder if I looked at this in the raw and I search for johndoe@. There's my johndoe@example.com right here. So in this case the pastes can take us to some of that raw data. And then all I have to do is parse out. Hey, look, this was customer number 135. here was their password right here. Oh sorry. Here is their password. It is hashed, which is good, and maybe there's some other information here that might be useful. But you may have access to some of that raw data. - What's a paste? - So on pastebin.com and some other websites out there, it's very easy for you, or me, or anybody to just post information. Think of it like putting a post-it note on the bulletin board in a restaurant or something like that. Some of the restaurants have community boards. You can just put a notice up there. Same thing here. We can go to Pastebin. Say I wanna post David Bombal's YouTube video and the link to it and submit it, and then that gets posted up there on the site until you take it down or it ages out, and that's what we're seeing here. People have used Pastebin and some other sites to paste breached data and just post it out there for anybody to find and to grab. - And they do that so that they can't be found. - They do that anonymously, right, to release that data, and sometimes they do it also because they don't want to collaborate on a more private platform. So we've got our johndoe@example.com email. We found it in some breaches. Now let's say that you are one of those people who can use breached data. I have some paid services and a kind of free service for you. If we head over to intelx.io, I can just paste in johndoe@example.com, and it shows me a bunch of redacted information. If I pay them money, then I get access to all of this data with the black lines. I'm an OSINT person, so I know that I always scroll down the page. 'Cause when there's redacted data, there many times will be unredacted data as well. So what I'm doing is I'm looking for Any Place Here That Does Not Have... Ah, here we go. We have Collection 1, and you see that this is not redacted. Clicking on the link, pasting in my johndoe@example.com. It shows me that in this Collection 1 of old Cloud Gaming Combos, the password associated with John Doe account was the most popular password in the world, 123456. - A lot of people who watch my video say I'm never gonna use such a dumb password. No one's gonna use passwords like that, but we both know, Micah, that people do. - Oh, absolutely. Sometimes people are just doing this as throwaway accounts. It's just like, \"Hey, I just wanna access that Angry Bird thing, and it makes me sign up for an account. So I'm gonna use johndoe@example.com, 123456. I don't care if somebody hijacks that account.\" That's what we might be seeing here. In our case, we would search and continue to go through these records and see what else came back. Here I would note johndoe@example.com associated with this password, and then continue scrolling down this list, and looking at other places. - Is it worth paying for this? - For me, David, I like the data on Intelx. I find that the dehashed.com site, which is our next site, here, you can pay by the day, by the week, or by the year, and it's a lot more affordable to buy the data here. And again, that's what we're doing, is we're buying the data from somebody else. They've collected it, made it searchable. They've indexed it, and all we're doing is using it like a search engine. One of the things that we always try to do is we do forward searches for things. We take a data point and then we do a search for that as well and see what else comes back. Let's go ahead and do this. We're gonna obama@whitehouse.gov. So obama@whitehouse.gov email, valid email, or at least it might have been years ago. And we can see a whole bunch of breaches or breached data that it was in. And if we click on one of these, what we see over here is any data that's associated with it. Here we can see that here the password for this one, the mmorg.net, right here is that password. I'm hoping that it's been changed since then, but you never know. So what I'm doing is I'm looking for a certain breach 'cause I want to show you something really cool. So what I've done is I've searched for obama@whitehouse.gov. And on page four, or five, or so, I found this one for Dropbox data and you could see that here we have the email. It was in this dump and I've got a hashed password. Now as an OSINT person, the easiest way for me to check what this password is... It's hashed. It's a one-way cryptographic function. I can't reverse it. I can't decrypt it, but what I can do is go to my password cracking rig. Well, at least if you're an OSINT person, this is my password cracking rig. And I put in the hash here in Google, and I see that nowhere else on the internet, none of the billions of websites have ever had this hash on their site. What this tells me is that this is probably a pretty strong or complicated password 'cause regular passwords, like password and 123456, you'll see their password hashes up here. So here's what we've got. We've got a breach for Dropbox where somebody used this really strong password. Well, what if we could take this really strong password, paste it into the search field, and find other accounts that also used that really strong password that was hashed. If you look here, Dropbox, Dropbox, Dropbox, so this is all probably from the same site, and we see that polgar_jeno used that same password. We see brucewillis@hollywood use the same password. Would it surprise you to know that parishilton@hilton.com use the same password? Come on Bruce Willis, Obama, and Paris Hilton all use the same really strong password. So what we've probably done, by doing that forward and reverse search, we've found somebody or some people that have used a very strong password on Dropbox and just signed up with random email addresses. They probably signed up for a free account with lastname@mail.com. I mean, come on. Try at least, right? And then they pasted in their really strong password, and then they filled up that space, and then they signed up with parishilton@hilton.com, used that really strong password. Never thinking that one day there's gonna be a breach and that password or hash password would be released. This kind of is my message to your audience. If you wanna be secure, you gotta plan for defeat. You gotta plan for failure, and you gotta plan for the fact that one day that super strong password that you use on every website is going to be released. And when it does, you better hope that it's only good on one website. So get a password manager. Use LastPass, or KeePassXC, or some other password manager. Use really strong passwords, but make them unique to every single website you use. So when Dropbox has a breach and your password is released, no attacker can use these techniques that I've shown you, which they use, Grab your password, and then log into your Facebook, and your Twitter, and your YouTube, and take over your accounts. 'Cause if that password is only used on one site, you've limited them. - That's great advice. Which is your favorite password manager? - I used to use KeePassXC, which is a free open source tool. It stores things locally on my system, and I really like that. I would share those vaults on via Dropbox with my other systems to synchronize my passwords. But then life got complicated. My wife, my family needed passwords, and stuff. So I've moved up to LastPass, and I use like the family plan with them, and I share passwords, 'cause we can share within our vault passwords between us, and we don't have to email them or send 'em via text message, and take 'em out of that secure environment. But there are many other password managers that are out there, that may be equally as good. - I'll just say this for everyone that's watching this is not a paid advert. Neither of us are getting affiliate fees or anything for this. It's just Micah's opinion. You've shown us in previous videos that it's not the single data points that's the problem. It's when someone like you who can aggregate huge amounts of data that it gets really worrying. I'll put a link below to a video where Micah was able to take data sets of someone's drinking, and then create crazy patterns of... I just thought you like beer, come on Micah. - I might like beer, but I don't like telling the world I just drank this beer at this location with these people at this date and time. And that's really what Untappd is. Untappd, you take your mobile device... - But this is a lot more serious because this is people's passwords. This is serious when someone gets hacked. So really wanna thank you for sharing tips and showing us why we have to be really, really careful. - I think that there are certain things in the cyber security, in the personal security world that are really hard to implement. Using a separate password on every single site, if you have one of these password managers, is a simple thing that once you get in the habit of it can really maximize the security aspect of it. So I'm hoping your audience takes that to Heart. - How many random passwords can you make and remember? And that's why someone uses a crazy password and uses it over and over again. It's not easy to have a hundred different unique passwords. - David, I used to do cyber security work and one of the things that I did for one company was every 90 days... Because their password changing policy was, every 90 days, their employees had to change their passwords. And so, every 90 days, I got a dump of all of their internal passwords. And my goal was not to embarrass people or whatever, but to see that password hygiene, so see how people were doing with the complex rules that this company had. There were some people that used just random letters and numbers that were really strong and secure, and I never ever cracked those passwords. But then there were some people that found ways around the rules, like using a a1a1a1 15 or 20 times, and then guess what, 90 days later, a2a2a2 And there were other things. People would start out with roots, like this password is for fall. Well, guess what happened when it turned into winter. It was really predictable. So you're absolutely right. We use these strategies, whether they're mnemonic... My kids are this person, this person, this person, and then next month you shift them around or something. We use mnemonics and we use those things that we can remember to help us, but the reality is we shouldn't be doing any of that. We should be relying on these password managers if we trust them. - Yeah, exactly. I mean the LastPass has just had a breach recently. - Yeah, it was a breach of their development environment. And according to LastPass, the key material, the safe material, none of it was accessed. But it can be scary, and that's why I used to use KeePassXC, which put a file on my system that somebody would have to compromise my system to get access to my vault. Depending on your personal risk tolerance, you can go ahead and do what you want. But use something. Don't come up with Micah is my favorite purple-shirted person. Although that's a secure password, you can only use that so many times. - Micah, so tell us where can we learn more, because you're sharing so much amazing information, but I know you've got a lot more. - I am on Twitter at @webbreacher. And also, I have a class on my OSINT training site on using breached data and open source intelligence and cyber security types of assessments. That'll teach you all of the things that I've shown you right here. - Now I've put links below where you can get more information. Please go and follow Micah. Please go and sign up for his classes if you're interested. Micah, thanks so much. - Thanks for having me on, David. (upbeat music)",

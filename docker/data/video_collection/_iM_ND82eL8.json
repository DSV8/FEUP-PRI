    "transcript": "(upbeat electronic music) - We're inside this LG tunnel, there are 246 55-inch televisions inside of this tunnel, and it has all of the Dolby Atmos surround sound. So it really feels like you are in these places, like we are right now soaring in the sky. (upbeat electronic music) This is the LG CLOi, now these are concept robots that can do multiple things. There's one to bring you room service, there's one that can potentially check you into your hotel, and there's one that may one day replace shopping carts. One of the key things that I've noticed here at CES this year is integrating Google and Alexa into other things. This is all using Google Assistant, you don't even have to say hey Google. And it's integrated into the remote. Change light brightness to 100 percent. Change lights to blue. Search YouTube videos for iJustine. Oh, what do you know? So basically, you can use the remote control for your television, to control your lights, to control your entire home. So basically, change the color of the lights, turn on the air purifier, I can turn on the air conditioner. This is why I don't ever have to leave my house. (calm electronic music) This is actually a pretty cool demo. People have TVs in different locations, it's really hard to be able to see from different angles. With these, they have an accurate color angle. So, no matter what angle you're at, you can see all the colors at much more of a true depth. So the bottom is conventional, and this is the top, where you can see the accurate color angles. (calm electronic music) We're heading in to get a demo of this 4K HDR projector. You can scale this up to 150 inches, wow! (crowd chatting) This is actually shocking in the picture quality, because this looks like a television but it is a projector. The colors are so vibrant. The lifespan of this projector is over 20 thousand hours. Basically, you can watch this projector for eight hours a day, for seven years straight. I could spend my time quite wisely watching plenty of Netflix shows on this thing. (relaxed electronic music) You guys know I'm always struggling with monitor solutions, and I'm trying out so many. I've seen a bunch of people try the ultra wide monitors, and I think they may be the solution that I need for editing. (relaxed electronic music) Basically, just taking a little rest here at CES, a CES siesta! Siesta? Siesta. I'm getting such inspiration goals, from all of these mock living rooms. Why can I not be an adult? And why does my house never look nice? (relaxed electronic music) We made it to the Sony booth, let's go check it out! (crowd cheering) I'm shook. I've run into so many people this trip. Okay you can... Do you wanna... So this here is like a little timeline of the past several years of Sony cameras. It's showing where they started from, and where they are now! You know, kind of like that Drake song, started from the bottom now we're here. Jenna, did you see this? They have an A9 with a new Sony RX0 on top of it. It's their tiny, new little action camera that you guys have seen me talk about. They also have a bunch of different adapters and cages for this thing too. So you basically take this RX0, and do so many different things with it. They have a filter adaptor, a cage, they have housing, the camera control box, there's the camera itself. Here is a tear-down of everything that's inside of it, and this is a really, I hate to say it, I don't like saying aesthetic, but this is a very aesthetically pleasing tear-down photo. (upbeat electronic music) This is Aibo, and it's kind of crazy because he has a lot of artificial intelligence built into him. He can recognize up to five family members. - Imagine there being like seven people in your family, so two of them it's like sorry! (laughing) Wait, remember when you thought dogs only had three toes? This one does! - [Justine] He does actually. - [Jenna] This is your dog! - [Justine] This is. Depending upon how a person treats the dog, it'll respond differently. So if Jenna is nicer to the dog than I am, it's gonna like you more. So, this is Aibo, it isn't concept, it's actually a real product. They said that you can only get it right now in Japan, and it's sold out. So maybe, we just go to Japan, and maybe we can find one? - Should we camp out? - Look, he's even got little toys too! So, this is his little puppy pad. And if it's blocked and he can't find it, he has a little tiny camera on his little butt right here, that'll use the ceiling, and he'll be able to navigate his way back home. Because he can tell, and remember, that there are two lights on the ceiling. (relaxed electronic synth music) Did you say you wanted to go see shirtless man? - Don't me get B-roll of that. - It's okay, I'll go shoot it, 240. So clarification of what's going on, the RX0 that I was just talking about, they're doing bullet time, they have 16 of them up here. So, it's capturing in real-time and doing the Matrix effect, it looks really crazy! - I think that this is what you need to set up in your office. - Okay! (upbeat electronic music) So this is one of the actual Intel drones, if you guys have seen any of the synchronized droning that they've been doing. They have a really cool demo that they're doing here at Vegas. Over 250 drones are synchronized together to create this incredible experience. Every night from eight to 10, they are flying these at the Bellagio, and it is amazing that I'm holding one right in my hand. Surprisingly, this thing is very light. Here's your drone back, thank you! - [Man] You're welcome. (upbeat percussive music) - Hey, this is Saf, from Super Saf TV, as you can see on the T-shirt. - You said that you've been struggling because you haven't filmed anything either. - I literally, I think I've filmed like three clips in this whole time. What's great is, I think CES is more about the people, like seeing everybody. When was the last time we met, was New York? - New York, yeah. Is there anything really cool that you've seen? - [Saf] The huge TV from Samsung, 146 inches. I kind of want that on my wall. - It's pretty crazy too, 'cause it's modular, so you have as many as you want. - Exactly, so you could just like have an entire wall of just displays. And it was so busy there as well. I was trying to get some shots of it, but there was like 100 people in front of it. - This furniture is smart furniture. It's enabled with Bixby, so instead of yelling over to the other room, say hey refrigerator, what's in my fridge? You can basically talk to the coffee table, you can talk to your chair. Did you see the refrigerator that can basically pre-heat your oven? You say, okay fridge, pre-heat the oven. It's actually crazy how Bixby is integrating into everything. - [Saf] I have the Family Hub 2.0. - [Justine] Do you? No you don't, are you serious? - I don't have the new one though. - [Justine] But still, oh man! - It it pretty insane, it's one of those things that you don't need until you have it. But it's awesome, I can see what's in my fridge right now. It's insane. - Do you want to show us what's in your fridge? - Probably not, its a bit of a mess. - Well, if I would look in my fridge, there's probably spoiled eggs, and just a bunch of coffee. So, we're at the DJI booth, and they announced the Osmo Mobile 2, and the Ronin S, did you get a chance to check it out yet? - I have checked out both, there's going to be two version of it. So this one, the one that they've got is for the DSLRs, but they're going to have a smaller version for mirrorlesses apparently, and I think that might be a bit more manageable. - [Justine] Awesome, well thanks for being in my video! - Thank you for having me, it's so awesome to see you. - I'm gonna put my microphone back now, okay bye. (upbeat pop music) Something that I've been super excited to see is the new Razer phone. You guys know that I absolutely love phones, of course, I'm a huge iPhone fan. They just announced a Razer laptop, that basically integrates with the Razer phone. Where a normal track pad would be, that's where the phone goes. So, you guys know I'm a huge Hue light bulb fan, but guess what? Razer now has an integration with Hue, so you can basically customize all of your Razer LED products with Hue lights. - With Chroma Studio, I can now configure all my lights at the same time. And I can also position them based on how they're physically located in my room. - [Justine] That's so cool, I've actually never even seen the speakers before, those are awesome. - Yeah, those are actually our brand new speakers we just launched on Tuesday. - [Justine] Okay, that's probably why I haven't seen them. I was like how did I not know? - So, do you have a favorite song, or a jam? Or even you want to pop up your channel. - [Justine] DMX. (\"X Gon' Give It To Ya\" by DMX) Oh my goodness! This isn't the censored version! - [Jenna] This is the bad one! X gon' give it to ya Knock knock, open up the door it's real With the non-stop pop pop of stainless steel - I usually listen to the censored version. So I'm a little shocked because it's been a while since I've heard the full remix. (laughing) Alright guys, that does it for CES 2018. We are about to now embark on a journey back home to LA, and we're driving, so wish us luck. Unfortunately, I don't have a self-driving car. But, that's alright, maybe in the future. Oh gosh, how long do you think it's gonna take, Jen? - [Jenna] A long time. - Alright. - [Man] Can I get a picture with you? - [Justine] Yes, of course! (upbeat pop music)",

    "description": "iPhone 7 Event discussion video -  SpinChill (USA Link) -  SpinChill (International) -   This contraption is called the Spin Chill. It's a handheld drink chiller that rapidly spins a can or bottle until it's ice cold. I've featured a similar product before that sits on your countertop, this one is cheaper and more portable.  From the manufacturer -  The SpinChill clips onto the top of the warm drink. It's then placed on ice and spins the drink, chilling it 20 times faster. Chilling Times: Beer/Soda cans: 1 minute Glass Bottles: 3-4 minutes Plastic Bottles: 3-4 minutes Wine/liquor: 5-7 minutes  FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

    "transcript": "*clears throat* So a little while ago, I showed you a contraption, a little mini spinner type deal that can take any beverage that happens to be warm and make it cold in like 60 seconds and not just cold like \"oh that's a little bit cool\". No! Like ice cold. So you didn't need to have it in the fridge, so someone could come over to your house, bring a case of - let's say beer if you're into it - and not have to worry about refrigerating it instead cooling it down on demand. Go watch the video you can.. you can tell for yourself. But: It required wall power so wasn't super portable, a little bit large, you know it took up some space- and for some people is a little bit pricey. Today! I'm about to show you another one of those things - a portable drink chiller. It's way less expensive; the link will be in the description. It's completely portable and it can run off batteries, it's called the \"Spin Chill\". This is what it is; it's handheld, chills drinks 20 times faster, Its called the ridiculously cold drinks. It'll do a can of beer in one minute, a bottle of beer in three minutes and it'll even do a bottle of wine; maybe you got a nice little uh a... a nice, little, dry, white wine. If you've ever drank beer before you know that ice waters it down. In-fact ice waters down any drink so if you could chill this way, you could have a more chill time. What's happening with the spin and the reason the spin is important is because it moves the warm liquid from the center to the... to the outskirts of the can. Moves the liquid around to the outside there's a greater surface area of that warm liquid that interacts with this cold liquid. I've got the infrared thermometer I'm gonna be.. I'm blasting. What happens if I shoot them? Can they? Are they blind now? Did I just.. destroy the sensor on the camera. Who knows? Maybe. I'm gonna be measuring the exact temperature of the beverages, prior to going in here for their little bath, the little ice bath and then afterwards. So that's it - that's the Spin Chill right there. Four Double A's That's the action. Simple, spinny, action! Molson Canadian, of course. I mean... I guess that's roughly the temperature... room temperature really.. *(73.22 Fahrenheit)* just clips onto the top, check that out, and then - Bath time. Hahaha. So we're going to dunk it and we're going to start spinning. Hahahaha Look at that little guy go! What do I got? Alright that should do it. Alright, I'm gonna hit the button. Oouuh. 19.7 Celsius *(67.46 Fahrenheit)* Is that good enough for any of us? Not for me imma' put it back in. I like an ice cold beverage and I'm not messing around when I say ice cold. I mean you could drink it like that and it's now cooler beverage than room temperature but if you want ice cold take the extra minute, right? Okay, let's check it out now. 16.5 Celsius, 61.9 Fahrenheit. Ok, let me crack that and see how ice-cold that is. A lot of people said no way how can you just crack it open what about the spinning it does not affect the carbonation the can look nothing no foam. Mmm, hmm! Okay, 15 degrees celsius is plenty cold Actually, do me a favor, Ryan. Go grab me fridge beer. We are going to do a comparison. around 14.145 (57.461 Fahrenheit) is an ice-cold fridge beer. This was a 15.9. I could get it down to 14, probably with another minute in there I would say. It also works for bottles. There's a circle in the center, which is sized up for the top of a bottle. Bottle is 22.8 *(73.04 Fahrenheit)* 13.2 *(55.76 Fahrenheit)* Does it work? Yeah it does It's not gonna be a minute, it's gonna be a couple of minutes it's gonna be way faster than just d-dunking your can in here, which can take a long time. You know, if you just show up at a party, you want to drink your specific beer, your favorite beer and that wasn't in the cooler yet, but you can kick it off straight away. You'll be the coolest guy at the whole place with the Spin Chill.",

    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is. Things are looking a little different in here, so different that we don't even have Austin anymore. What we're gonna talk about today is the Pixel 6a and why, just why? Why? - Why, why? - That's my general thought on the Pixel 6a. So we have this over from Google. I played with this for a little bit now. It's good phone, don't get me wrong. But I feel like there's significantly better options out there that people should consider before they even consider this one. I don't know. Let me give you the rundown of the Pixel 6a. This guy here is 449. So not expensive but definitely not cheap. I mean, there's definitely way cheaper phones. It's got six gigs of RAM. It's got Google Tensor processor, which for those of you who do not know, is like the Exynos, but it's not like the Snapdragon equivalent of the Exynos. It's a slightly lower one. Kind of like in the Samsung A series. The big glaring thing that this has is a five or six year old camera? - I mean, it's the same one that the Pixel has had since like the Pixel 2. Google's always emphasized the processing and the software and you know AI kind of making the picture all better. But the thing is, I think at a point, especially now that we have 48 megapixel cameras, 50 megapixel cameras, especially from the bigger brother, the Pixel 6, you really notice the extra resolution, even if it's you know, binned down to like a 12 megapixel picture, you do get increased sharpness. And that's something that you lose with this even though I think this is still some of the best portrait mode that you can get out of any phone. - Yeah, let's be very clear. It is still a really good camera. So do not let that deter you. Now you are getting the newest software with this which is the benefit of getting that older, like, you know, the newer version of this. It's little things. One I do like that this is smaller than the Pixel 6. So if we got this over here, you see it is noticeably to us smaller but I wish it was even smaller. When talking with Austin, he thought it was too chunky. I actually think it's the perfect level of chunk. I love that it's all squared off. I love the design of it. Everything's great. This sage color, absolutely gorgeous. - I don't notice a difference or at least much of a difference between the glass and the plastic. Of course, we don't get wireless charging with the 6a because it doesn't have the glass back. The main thing that I'm missing and I'm sure that, you know, you felt this more in you know, the more time that you spent with it. I'm gonna take a look at this on the Denki channel video. - Yes. - Which is coming up pretty soon. - [Matt] Go subscribe to Denki channel here. - I wish this thing had a higher refresh rate. - And that's where we kind of get into like these like weird little trade offs. I know I'm personally someone who 60 Hertz is fine for me but it does feel weird that in 2022, it doesn't have at least 90 Hertz. - Okay, so here, here's the thing like, so for the Pixel 6a video, one of the comparisons that I'm going to draw is with the Samsung A53 5G. That phone, actually kind of crazy for the price, it's around 350 bucks. - Yes. - I don't know if that's MSRP, but that's what I see it at constantly in stores. The Pixel 6a we should note, is 450 bucks. It'll probably be on sale at some point, as these phones are. Pixel 6 for example, was something what like 600 bucks? - During Prime Day, it was as low as $500, which is insane. - Which this isn't out yet, but it almost cannibalizes the younger brother. - And now that like, by the time this video goes live, Prime Day's over, blah, blah, blah. It's still only 570. So for a hundred bucks, you are getting way more phone. I think that that trade off is worth it when you compare the 6 to the 6a. Samsung's budget line now have gotten so good that like really the only thing that Pixel has going for it is the long longevity of it. - Yeah. - So you're like, these are, I believe guaranteed three years of major updates. - It's three years of major updates and I think five years of security. Now the interesting thing, and we've talked about this a lot, is just how good mid range and even some entry level phones are to the point where even though the 6a is a mid range option, it's still relatively expensive for what it is. - Yeah, yeah. - And you know, we've talked about the iPhone SE also relatively expensive for what it is, granted on the iPhone side, you only have so many options but I think on the Android side there, the competition's just so good to the point where the 6a, unless this thing gets a price drop or is on promotion or whatever. - But I feel like it will - It will. But in the vacuum for now, it's still too expensive. - We're talking about this when it first comes out. And I guarantee within the first couple months, we're gonna, this is gonna be sub $400. - I want this to be 350. - Yeah. - If you can get this for the same price as the A53, I'll get this instead. - Yeah and like a lot of people like that because they get the pure Google experience. But I wanna talk about just like the Pixel line in general for a second, because I feel like every year, we get the Pixel, we don't know what to talk about it with every, because like some years it's super cheap and it's like the best budget phone you can get. And they like kinda like lose some of the specs but that's okay because it's so cheap and then the next year it's like, this is way too expensive and we still don't have, like. I feel like every year, it's a different narrative. They need to find a way to define their role in the like Android space because it's Android, it's Google, like, how are you losing this battle? - No, but that, that's the thing though, right? That's the thing that underscores Android is, yes, they're always on the up and up. Yes, things always are new and fresh and exciting and they're always changing the formula. But at the cost of changing the formula is the Pixel is kind of taking a backseat to that inconsistency. It kind of just has to deal with what Google's doing. And it's kind of hard to establish that identity. They do it with little things like the camera, with the design schemes. You know, they usually keep those for a couple of years. Their third parties are doing a better job, I think. - So I will say, I think that the Pixel line is the best looking Android phone on the market. - I think this does look better than the A series for sure. - Oh definitely better than the A series. But I think it looks better than the S series. I think it looked. - Austin, Austin, give me your phone. This is still, I think one of my favorite looking phones. - I will specifically say the bespoke version of this with like the baby blue. - Oh, I love the yellow. - Yeah, yeah. - Yellow's nice. - Where I had this revelation was with the Pixel 5. I don't care about specs anymore. You can yell all you want about how this has only six gig RAM versus whatever. None of that matters to me anymore. As I've gotten older, I do not care about the specs. I care about the experience. I care about how it feels in my hand. I care about the size, everything like that. - I mean like the thing about that, right, is, and this is something that we always have to think about when we evaluate phones is I think we're in a very privileged position. - Oh, absolutely. - Where we get to try out all the Pixels. - I have my daily driver iPhone. It definitely skews what we appreciate in phones. And at the end of the day, what I will always, always prefer is the most consistent experience especially for work. But I think there's also something to be said about how we evaluate this stuff. - Yeah. - And, I think that at the end of the day, like we try to find things that stand out but that doesn't necessarily mean it'll make us like the phone more. - You're not gonna notice like the 0.01 gigahertz difference in a clock speed of a cell phone. Like when we talked about the Pixel 5 a couple years ago, me and Austin said like, that was like the perfect experience. It was like the perfect size. It was tiny, it was a little tiny guy. That was like the perfect experience for us because like, yeah, like it wasn't the best specs compared to other flagships, but it was snappy. It did everything we needed to, it was perfect in feel in the hand. This is where it's kind of, I feel like I'm saying the opposite now for the 6a which again, to be fair, is supposed to be a lower spec type of phone. The battery's smaller, but like, okay, it's physically smaller. It's smaller screen. It's only 60 hertz screen. I wouldn't be surprised if you actually got better battery life out of the, out of the 6a - In a vacuum, this should give you the better battery life for sure. - But like, it does have like a in-screen fingerprint sensor which is not great. So again, when you're talking about like, what's the experience? What's the overall, like, what am I feeling with this? This just doesn't hold up to other Android phones which are cheaper. - So we unboxed this on Mystery Tech and one of the things I noticed when I was shooting photos with it, and it's something that I experience on Android a lot, but it's always egregiously bad on the Pixel, is the processing. When you're taking a photo, right? The phone has to do a bunch of stuff in the background before you can actually preview it. What that means is that, you know, if you take a photo and you wanna preview it or something like that, you have to wait like three or four seconds for it to finish. And that can mean missing a shot if you just wanna make sure that you're catching something on the fly. And that has been a problem for me since the Pixel 2. I'll just take a photo of you right now. Look at this, ready, ready, set. Takes a second before you can actually do stuff to it. In rapid motion, it's like slow. And sometimes it's almost too aggressive. Like there are some shots that I took of Austin and again, on the Mystery Tech, where it looks over HDR. Like it has like that the halo effect around him, his skin doesn't look natural. The main thing with the camera is that I still think that the computational is one of the best but I think there are times in the right conditions or I guess, wrong conditions, where it doesn't look the best compared to everything else. Everything else has just gotten so good. One of the issues that I have with the Pixel and this is more of a long term thing, that we obviously cannot test with this phone, is how bad they are long term. You know, you use the phone for six months and you know, you're fully set up in it and then all of a sudden the phone will just slow down, it'll bog down. And that's kind of my big worry with the Pixel. And it's also weird that it's Google's software. - I'm just gonna come back to this of just like I don't know who I could recommend this to. The plastic back feels really nice. I can't tell it's not glass. However, no wireless charging is a no go for me. I don't remember the last time I plugged in a phone. The physical real estate of this is so similar to the six. If you want it like a smaller phone, there's different options. If you want a cheaper phone, there's different options and they're better spec or at least damned close spec wise. - That's the thing is I think that Google in their pitch meetings or whatever probably were like who do we compare this to? And I think probably at the top of their list I think is probably the iPhone SE, iPhone SE 3. Give or take difference of 20 bucks but I still think that there are better mid-range Android phones that are cheaper, like the A53. - And this is my bold claim. This is never really gonna sell for 450. - But do think this will genuinely sell better than the Pixel 6 when the Pixel 6 goes down so low too? - Right, I do think that like immediately this is gonna go on sale or like it'll have like some crazy incentive deal like $400 plus Pixel buds and like a $50 credit. Like some sort of incentive to make this like a really enticing deal. It's one of those things. I don't think this is just ever gonna be a $450 phone when you're shopping around for phones and you see a hundred dollars off this phone. That just looks so nice and it's so enticing. This is the next strategy after, you know, doing 499 instead of instead of 500. But even at 350, I have a hard time recommending this over, like the Samsung. - Yeah, like the Samsung's is just too good. And I like, they're gonna be people like hollering the comments about that but 120 Hertz display. I think the camera is still like, at least on paper, better as well. - I feel like you're gonna get better-- - Screen. - Better software on the Pixel for camera but the actual camera itself is better on the Samsung. - On the A53, yeah. It's good design. They, we know Google can make great material design. - If only they could follow it up with great software and great specs at a great price. I've said it about an Apple. I'm gonna say it about Google. These companies print money. They could sell these at a loss if they wanted to. - They won't. - They won't, but they could. Here's what I'm gonna say. Google make this $300, sell all of them and then collect all of our data and make all your money back on our ad revenue. Let's know in the comments what you think. Is the Pixel 6a worth it? Is it not worth it? Are you gonna get a Pixel 6? Which I think you should. Are you gonna get something completely different? Are you gonna tell me about how your Huawei is way better than this? - I'm gonna get a Nokia 3310. - Nokia 3310. Just don't drop it on the floor because you'll need a new floor.

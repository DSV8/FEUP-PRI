    "transcript": "*Clap* Set Bananas So You Guys Know I Like Music I like listening to stuff podcasts, late at night. If you ever caught me relaxing or attempting to relax There might be some audio involved You probably also noticed that there's a pillow in front of me That's unusual This thing showed up, I looked at it, I looked at Jack and I said \"the people need to know about this\" It's the iMusic pillow It's a pillow It plays music with a built in speaker Listen with comfort More comfortable than headphones Compatible with any music player because it's got a headphone ...connector. Powered by the connected device so you don't even plug this thing in. You never knew you wanted this because you never knew it existed I was onto something Hello? Yeah like right now. It's recording, you're a part of it. But.. but.. but.. wait a minute. You're talking about my truck? Well you can't fit.. you can't fit very much in my truck This is now.. this is.. we're now 5 minutes and 10 seconds into the video and most of it is me talking to you, and Jack watching and tapping his wrist Hmm, he is really impatient these days So what does this all mean? I don't know now maybe .. er.. now I'm lying down on a couch I bring this little guy with me I'm more relaxed than I ever was before I've looked at all kinds of headphones Headphones you sleep with Headphones .. err.. that go inside your ears Maybe you're searching for some level of relaxation that you've never hit before Nonetheless whatever it is you're into, now it's your pillow now it's your pillow that's bringing it to you So let's find out where is the...? Where does the sound even c-? How do I? Alright.. Here we go.. Looks, so far, it looks like a pillow There's nothing in here! Okay... Still put a pillowcase on this I guess? This is zipper.. Oh! Ok. Pull this zipper up over here. It only goes partway. There's a little pocket Oh my... Little fuzzy fibres on there So I guess, I don't know you could still be using your device while you're lying down How loud can this really be? Let's be honest here How many speakers are in here? It's deep in there though. Like.. I mean you would never.. You would never.. You would never feel it.. it's somewhere in the middle So no matter which side you're on There's plenty of padding This sound is obviously going to have to come through the fabric, nonetheless I think it's louder from this side I just realised something though, I think the intent here is that your on top of it obviously, in which case it gets a lot louder Like, you gotta be.. you're not having a party with this I might.. I'm gonna .. just nap .. and the weird thing is with your ear you kind of find the spot For me I think it's probably I'm actually going to listen to podcasts more on something like this. It's your boy, Jack! Do I wish it was a little bit louder? Yeah sure But if you're laying on top of this If you're laying on top of it It's plenty loud enough Who's it for? I don't know I'm not really sure. Alright but most people I know, they use a pillow. Most pillows aren't that cool, they don't do very much So here's one that does a little something else It doesn't have to be plugged in or charged and that audio is being powered strictly by the headphone jack on your device That's kinda cool actually I'm sensing the opportunity for some high level relaxation here You fall asleep listening to the audio book, maybe you wake up with an elevated IQ. I'm not sure. That's how it works? Right? I don't know. Is that how you study? Is that how you get smarter? This pillow is how you get smarter. You pass the test, you forget about the text book it's all in here. I will often listen to white noise to fall asleep Do you hear that Jack? Just a little bit of white noise like *makes white noise sound* Do it right in the pillow, powered by the cable You probably don't want to do this if you're rocking a Note 7 I will not by held responsible *singing* I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place.",

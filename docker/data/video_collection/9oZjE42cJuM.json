Grab your own Soundcore X600 here:   ranked number one by DXO best wireless speaker under $200:  and top 3 in Spatial audio performance out of all the speakers tested by DXOMARK.   Watch the installation video HERE:   Get $250 dollars off of your Solar Wholesale kit HERE:   Tesla has been priced well in the past:  but shop around.   Solar energy has always fascinated me. I can put black rectangles on my roof and get free power from the sun for 30+ years? I'm all about that life. Join us as we track my solar journey on year three with my 8kw system. My only regret is that I didn't install more solar panels when I started.",

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Stellar deals! I'm a space lover. I'm a lover of all space. Do I want... What? What is the, how's the space? All right, let's see what we can find. Ooh, I can, Adventure is Calling. (laughs) \"Being a dad is an honor. Being papa is priceless.\" If you ever see me wear this shirt, you have permission to punch me in the face. Ooh, okay. Here's an item I actually would like to try. This is a, quote, \"Invisible Sleep Wireless Earphone.\" This says it's basically just a Bluetooth pair of headphones, but the idea is that it's completely flush so that you can lay down and it wouldn't really bother you. I'm actually kind of interested. (gagging) Okay. I thought this is a mouse, but the fact that it's a hat makes it a lot worse. \"Hot Topton Gaming Laptop.\" A Core i9-10880H GTX 1650 for $144? I am not getting this laptop. I'm not getting this laptop. I'm gonna add it to the cart. Oh, this is neat. Wait, what is this? Dual SIM standby power bank? Flashlight, 2.2-inch screen, big keyboard, loud speaker. So, wait, it says dual SIM card. So wait, this is a $42 phone. It looks like we're like one of the OG, like, cell phones. Oh, it's also got MP3 and MP4 support. So, on your giant phone you could watch a video on a two-inch screen. All right, I will get, this is cool. All right, my friends, I think we've got all the Wishtery Tech items we need. Now I'm gonna ask you to please subscribe to the channel and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button as we begin this beautiful montage of Austin standing by the door, waiting longingly for the FedEx man to deliver my Wishtery Tech package so we can continue the video. (Austin singing) This video is sponsored by Bitdefender, a global leader in cybersecurity. Bitdefender is obsessed with performance and innovation, which makes their partnership with the Scuderia Ferrari F1 team a perfect match. Speaking of a perfect match, if you know me, you know that I love Formula 1. In fact, I have an entire podcast all about F1. And my friendship with Bitdefender has gone on for many years. Meaning that seeing these two come together has been really exciting for me. Last year, Bitdefender announced a multi-year partnership to become team partner to Ferrari, who are, of course, competing in the FIA Formula One World Championship. In Formula One, every millisecond counts, and cybersecurity is no different. Just like a driver needs a helmet or halo for protection, your devices need protection from serious cyber-threats. Bitdefender is serious about safety, and you can see their logo and commitment on all sorts of safety equipment like the Scuderia Ferrari driver's helmets and racing suits. You can even see their logo on the car's halo, one of the most important safety features introduced to F1, keeping top drivers like Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz safe. One of the reasons why, like Ferrari, Bitdefender is an industry leader, is because they excel at threat intelligence, they're can adapt to quickly-evolving threats. And now Bitdefender and Ferrari have announced that they have expanded their cybersecurity partnership. In Marinello, the two companies announced that Bitdefender Advanced Threat Intelligence will integrate into Ferrari's Security Operations Center to help Ferrari's security analysis more quickly validate and triage alerts, improve threat hunting, and speed up incident response. Find out more about the partnership and this exciting new chapter by heading to the link in the description. And of course, huge thank you to Bitdefender for sponsoring this video. - [Matt] Hya-kipa! - All right, this is very bouncy. So, here's the thing. Unlike Temu, Wish has, like, little labels on the front that will kind of tell you, like, some really vague basic description. I'm not gonna read them, because who wants to watch mystery tech where I know what the items are, even though I did order these like a month ago? But, a month ago? I've completely forgotten everything. Why is it so pink? What did I order? - Jesus. - What is that? Is that allowed? - [Matt] Oh, it's a, okay. - I think this is a back pillow thing, right? - [Ken] Or a tongue. - No! Looks- - No, no. The other way, the other way. The other way, the other way. - This looks not- - It kinda looks like your nose. (Ken laughs) Oh, oh, ugh. - So it is, it's got like some flex to it. So, as I kind of put the weight of my neck down, it actually does kinda work. - From here it actually don't look that bad. - [Matt] It looks comfy. - Here's the thing though. How is it a massager? Like, I know it's got some bumps. What am I supposed to do? Like- - I think it's just a pillow. - You just squirm. Just- - I mean, this makes me feel like, yeah. - Squirm. - Well, how much did you pay for it? - $5 and 76 cents. That's not bad. Well, what a great item to start out this \"Wishtery Tech.\" - Woo-hoo! - That was bad on my part. - All right, we've got, what the hell is this? It's just all written in Chinese. - [Matt] I feel like at this point you should have learned Chinese. - [Ken] When in doubt, Google Translate. - Yeah. Wait, is this not Chinese? Am I stupid? - Wait. (laughs) - No! - No, it is absolutely Chinese. - It is, right? - It is. Know it is. - Yeah- - Just open it. - Yeah. - We are so over the Google Translate part of this. - I just wanna know what my box is gonna be. - Then open it. - Open it. - What's the fun in opening? What? You think that this series is- - This is opening- - An unboxing show. - Inside we have. Oh, yeah! The Big Chungus phone. So- - Wait, what? It's a phone? Oh shoot. - Yeah, it's a phone. - Oh, wait, no, no, no. Hang on a second. One moment please, lemme just. We need the actual experience. - Wow. - This looked like it came out when Matt was born. - [Meme] Bruh. - Well, it has a little sticker here, dual SIM stuff, on it. So we take this off, we've got ourselves a. Holy frick, that's a battery. This is a 22.21-hour battery, like the battery size of a small laptop. And inside, there you go, you got yourself SIM one, SIM two, and what looks to be like a micro SD. Wow. The HOSWN H999. All right, let's dial it up. - Oh, okay. - All right. - Welcome. So we do have a little display. (intense upbeat music) (all laughing) - [Matt] (coughs) What? - Let's get ready to rumble! (lightning roars) (epic Thuganomics music) It does it every time you turn it on? (Austin cackles) Look, if you're walking around taking calls like this, you're committed to a lifestyle that I'm envious of. So, we've got FM. I'll press FM. - New music discovery. You know got to have the greatest hits. - Why is it so loud? - [Matt] This is the loudest thing in the world. - Oh, I got it off. Oh my God. Why is it so- - Wish. - Loud? Okay, let's go Menu. Phonebook, Messaging, Multimedia, Tools. I want Tools. \"Change baby.\" - Wait. - What? - Wait, no. - What? - \"Charge baby.\" It says \"Charge baby.\" Charge baby. Charge, baby, charge. Baby, come on Ebook Reader. Who is gonna read an ebook on this? What? - What? - I got exactly what I asked for. I don't know why I asked for it. All right, we've got ourselves the. Oh, good Lord. I think. So, Ken, you're gonna remember this. This is like OG. I think this is one of those, like, first couple episodes of \"Mystery Tech\" items. Oh no, look at the time. My phone's dead! That's phone dead o'clock. Well, you know what I need to do? I need to charge it. So I'm gonna use my battery bank here. So, I'm gonna plug in the USB-A to my battery bank, and I'm gonna plug this into my Z Flip. We're gonna plug it in. - [All] Oh. - No, this was in the mystery tech. This was the mystery tech, right? - We- - That absolutely here. - You ready? (Matt and Ken yell) (upbeat music) - [Joanna] Why is he doing that? (all laugh) - [Matt] Joanna, we'll tell you when you're older. - [Joanna] Mm. - I got it. All right. Wish's got the goods today. I'm feeling good about this right now. So these are the MD538 headphones. Oh, we just remembered why we bought this. 'Cause I was like, \"Why did I buy this?\" This is, oh my God. So, you see these cool-looking UFO headphones? Yeah, that box is a lie. This is in fact a different kind of headphones. Okay, so that's where the earbuds go. But let me actually pop 'em out here. - Oh. - Eugh. - It's the- - It's out. - So much work. - It's a bit of the ear. The idea with these is that they're meant to actually live in your ears while you sleep. That's why they're so weirdly flat. The noise it makes when it, like, turns on is literally the Windows USB. Like the donk, donk. (strenuous music) - [Matt] Okay, they don't look as bad as I thought. - Yeah. So, for less than $11, I'm not expecting amazing sort of audio quality, but let's give a try. These actually have bass. - Really? - Like legitimate bass. - That's almost surprising as the face that's on the back of the case of the headphones. It's going, \"Ah, oh!\" - What? - Look at the back of the case, it's making a face. - Oh! - Nyah! - No, dude, these are not bad headphones. It just sounds like they're a little muddy. Like it's, you sound like you're listening to, like, a good car stereo, but from outside the car. - That doesn't sound good. (Ken laughs) What do you, what? (Ken laughs) - Oh, that's not comfortable at all, right? (friends laughing) No, that is, what? That doesn't work. I don't think I could give this a W. It's still a little, like, it doesn't quite land, but it's neat. I'm saying these are better than I initially expected for flesh- - They look like an egg from here. - I hate flesh egg. (TV beeps) - Legos? All right, this is 100 classic games. (Ken laughs) - \"Sorry, but your princess/laptop is in another castle.\" - Wait, \"Refunded.\" - Wait- - On the back. - Look at the back! - \"Refunded.\" Was this the laptop? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is character development. So, if you've never watched \"Wishtery Tech\" before, almost every episode I end up ordering one big ticket item, you know, an Xbox or PS5. And sometimes I've gotten the items, but most of the time I've gotten these weird sort of phantom, like, shipment notifications where, \"Oh, it was delivered,\" but no package ever showed up. They take my money, it sucks. Are you trying to tell me that they preemptively canceled my order and gave me my money back without getting scammed? Is this the wish.com that I know? Oh, good Lord. Why is this red leather? Oh no! Wait a minute. This is my Kinsey cosplay. - Oh. - Oh God. Wait, what? - No, no, no, no, no. It's great. Look, see, it's just a simple red bucket hat. You've seen my Temu fit. It's time to get Wishtery Teched-up with my jorts? - Are those- - Oh. (Austin laughs) - [Matt] Aren't those like, 90's-looking- Like- - Wait. - I feel like I'm. I need my. Oh, you know what I need? I need a kilt. (friends cackling) - Extra, extra, read all about it! (Austin laughs) - I'm actually not gonna lie, you don't look horrible in there. - All right, let's see here. I don't. It's fashion jewelry. I don't. Oh, this is it. Oh, okay. All right, that's fine. - Perfect. - Oh. (friends laugh) - Wah! (friends laughing) - 'Ello, mates, Welcome to Austin's Style Emporium. Can I get you some bangers and mash? Can I give you some dental hygiene lessons? - [Ken And Matt] Bro. - Europe, never heard of it. (laughs) Oh, right. I forgot I ordered this. - [Matt] Oh good Lord. - [Ken] Always popping the collar up, my God. - My God. (Austin laughs) - [Ken] There you go. - [Matt] Is what a true alpha looks like. (explosion booms) That's exactly what we guessed it was gonna look like. - Let's go ahead and cut. We're gonna be right back after we find out what's this thing is. (TV beeps) Why, hello there. Welcome back to \"Wishtery Tech.\" Don't mind that minor PlayStation-related emergency. I have now changed my fit and I'm ready to continue with the video. Ow, I should not have tried to catch that. Oh, thank you very much. I was so confused as to what I was looking at. So it's a coke dispenser. I mean, bottle opener. - Plain water, water, 'cause- - You're gonna spill this everywhere. - I'm so nervous by it. By this. - [Ken] This table's gonna be sticky forever. Oh my God. Ah! - No way! - Stupid. (Austin laughs) You stupid idiot. - I'm gonna- - No, I was gonna take it. - Can't let some Coke go to waste. (Ken sighs) All right, so this is an electromagnetic radiation tester. So, as we all know, electromagnetism is radiation, therefore it's bad. And if you're holding a phone right now, you're being electro-radio-magnetized. And as the Geneva Convention states, that's bad. If you step outside, there's electromagnetic radiation everywhere. - The sun. - Yeah. All right. I'm gonna turn it on and there's no electromagnetism around. Let's investigate. So camera. Oh, oh, whoa! We went from zero. Let's see if it comes down. We get closer to the camera. Look at this. 8, 13, 18, 20, 31, 34. - Oh! - Ah! We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die! Oh, it stopped, okay. So what about these? Oh, our microphone? Ah! Look at, look, look. I even get remotely close to our audio station. Look at this. - [Matt] The one with four wireless receivers? - How high can we get in the middle? - 600! - Someone (indistinct) the wall. - Ken, you have radiation in your brain. All right, so we're zero. (soft playful music) - [Ken] Okay, okay. - Well, it's about to- - Didn't work. Didn't work. - Huh? Interesting. You think phones would be electro magnetized, but unfortunately they're not. Oh, oh, here we go. The reasons why you wanna be careful with electromagnetism. Cancer, direct harm to the human genital system. - [Ken] These all, like, sound like symptoms after watching an Austin Evans video. - Oh, it's our floating light boy. All right, I'm actually kinda excited for this. So if you watched this show for a while, thank you. But you're also probably familiar with some of the wild and weird gadgets. Specifically the kind of the, I would describe as toy-style gadgets, that we've looked at over the years. This, I believe, is a magnetic wirelessly-powered lamp which, if this works, I'm gonna be super amped. All right, so I can tell that there's, like, a magnetic ring all the way around, right? So I need to kinda get in the middle for that sweet spot. There you go. Nope. (Ken laughs) That's what I was afraid of with this. If you had the patience, you can get it right, but you have to be very precise. Magnets, boy. Hey, it works! We have mobile phone cables. Mobile phone cables. Did I order a cable? Is this the USB-C cable maybe? - [Matt] Knowing you, you'd be like, \"Oh look, a cable, that's interesting. - It's called doing my job, Matt. Sometimes I wish that I come up with better puns. - Oh! - This is, yes, it is. Okay, so this. I'm actually low-key a little bit excited for it, it is a USB-C to C cable, but it has a little screen built in. So, there are a couple versions of this now. When they first came out, they were quite expensive. I'll say this actually feels very high quality. Like, the actual, like, sleeving on the cable feels pretty nice. It says it's 100W USB-C cable. So, let's plug it into my Z Flip and see what happens. 17. 17 watts. Which my Z Flip will do 25 watts, but that's max, and because I'm at 63%. Yeah, 16, 17 watts. That actually sounds about right. Now, for me this is like one of those, like, nerdy things where you don't need this. I mean, obviously your device is charging without a little screen, but the ability for you at a quick glance to see exactly how much power's being pulled is actually kinda cool. I think we can finally say, after a very long, arduous journey today, this is an item that's actually good.",

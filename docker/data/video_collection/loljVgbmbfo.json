    "transcript": "What's up guys? Lou here back with a BONUS video for you today. Two for one. This is a tip, a hack you may want to call it, For how to play YouTube in the background, on your smartphone. So you can go about your other business, you know, messaging people, browsing the web, and so on. Now why would you want a video in the background? \"It doesn't make much sense Lou.\" The main reason here is for music. Plenty of people use YouTube for their music discovery, for their playlists, and so on. But also long-form, spoken word content, podcasts. You might want to have that on the background! And the YouTube app does not allow you to do that natively, but there is a workaround. Now this has been out for a while, but if you are like me- maybe you missed it, maybe you hadn't seen it before. So I thought I was just bring it to you. Let's get started on iOS and then jump into Android, because there are different workarounds for each platform. Now, if I'm just playing some audio. [Music in the background] Hopefully you guys can hear that. [Music in the background] [Music keeps on playing] Now if I'm gonna click out of that- that audio is just going to stop, right? That's in the app. Okay Lou, yes, I get it, you close the app and the song stops playing. What's the deal here? Alright, real simple- launch into safari, go to YouTube.com in the URL section there, search up the song you want to play. start playing it again, okay [Music in the background] same song in this case [Music in the background] No problem here [Music in the background] but what happens when you back out now? [Music in the background] OH! But it still stops! Okay, here's the trick- Lift up from the bottom, you see, it still shows the media right there, now hit the play button again. [Music] Ooooh [Music] Look at me, I'm in my phone doing whatever I want, [Music in the background] while still listening to my music. [Music in the background] Get it? Okay, recap- [Music in the background] You don't want to use the youtube app. [Music in the background] Load up the mobile youtube site, play the song, back out of it, and then just hit play again, down here, in your quick options. Don't want to leave the Android users out. Same scenario here. If you go to the YouTube app, you play the song. [Music] Beautiful, it's playing, [Music in the background] [Music] but you back out and you're dead. The song stops. So, what do we do here? Download Firefox. Real simple. This is a browser if you're unaware, it's free in the app store. Go to the mobile site, [Music] play the song, [Music in the background] back out. [Music in the background] Money in the bank [Music in the background] The inventory of music available on YouTube, and the playlists, and everything that you can do with it, it's very powerful. So being able to make that happen in the background So you can still do your other activities, is a pretty compelling feature in my opinion. I wish that it was built in by default, but it's not. So, that's how you get it done. iOS, iPhone and Android. Tell your friends.",

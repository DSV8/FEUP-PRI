    "transcript": "(logo chimes) - So Lit Mobile just sent me this wireless solar battery pack. I'm excited, let's see what's inside. Oh yeah. (upbeat music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? Really, that's just great. You know I'm doing pretty great today, too because you guys are amazing, thanks to you my Lit Mobile episode took off like a rocket. So, thank you and as promised I will have follow up episodes for you and today you're getting one of them. So, what's been up the past couple weeks? Well plenty, but one of those things that happened was I got in touch with a supplier that sells solar chargers. I got in touch with them via Alibaba and I'll get back to that soon. But one of the things that didn't happen the past couple weeks is Lit Mobile, actually, supplying the product that I purchased. I placed my order back when I released the first episode to this day I still haven't received a shipping confirmation or a tracking number. I would say I'm surprised but I'm not. I submitted a contact form on their website asking what's up. Like many others, I received the automated response from The Team. I contacted the listed email address and waited, nothing. I sent a followup email and waited, nothing. And yes, their phone number is still disconnected. - [Automated Voice] 7-9-1, the number you dialed is not in service. So, it's been radio silence from Lit Mobile. But I did receive a few comments from you guys that, actually, gave me a glimmer of hope, in a way. Some of you said you, actually, had a good experience with the product, or it at least arrived. It, maybe, wasn't that great but it at least showed up. So, maybe at one time, Lit Mobile actually had good customer service, quality assurance and they actually shipped out orders, good. Another thing I saw pop up a lot was the term, dropshipping. In a nutshell, dropshipping is a fullfillment method in which a store doesn't have to keep inventory. Instead the store provides the customer a buying experience, like a website, for example, then the store owner or respective employees order the product from a supplier and they ship the product directly to the customer. According to Talkbusiness.net, in 2017 23% of online sales were delivered to customers via dropshipping, as noted by Forrester Research. I also found this Wired article about dropshipping and it's almost hilarious how many topics Lit Mobile checks off of this dropshipping cliche list. The article mentions pain points, Ali Express, targeting ads on social media, particularly with video. They mention the long wait times for shipping and they even mention Shopify, specifically. Hmm, seems familiar. I also found this Oberlo article which talks about the negatives behind dropshipping and one of the points they mentioned was, dropshipping makes customer service more challenging. That makes sense, you have very little control over the product. Pretty much, it isn't your product. And it seems like Lit Mobile has given up entirely when it comes to customer service and satisfaction. Frankly, I don't work in this industry and I've never sold physical product online. So, I wasn't familiar with this term, dropshipping. Well, now I know. I don't think all dropshipping businesses are inherently bad, but dropshipping does open up the possibility of you giving your customers a bad experience, especially if you don't provide good customer service. For example, you don't reply to your emails, or you disconnect your phone number. Are you getting the hints, here Lit Mobile. Anyway, there's some other stuff I discovered too. Another comment I received was from the videographer behind these ads. He did confirm the on-screen personalities were actors, makes sense. I don't think there's anything wrong with that but if you're going to fudge a testimonial with an actor, you should disclaim it. Of course, I'm not putting any blame on the video team here because they don't have the final say. I get it, I've worked in the video world for years. I free-lanced a ton. If I can interview this videographer later, I'll include him another follow up episode because this journey is far from over. Another interesting thing that occurred is the new reviews on the website. It seems like there's some (beep) posting along with some memes occurring now. As funny as that is, I don't condone that and I don't want anybody really doing that going forward. Let's not make ourselves look dumb. In one of the Lit Mobile website reviews I found a product called a Lit Solar, guess what? There website follows the same cookie-cutter (beep) as Lit Mobile. They even have the same logo, interesting. Also, if you share a photo of you're product in action you get a 60% discount, is that 60% off of the 60% off? Or can I not combine the offers? Help me out here Lit Mobile. I know, I'll just call your customer support and ask that question, oh wait. It's also weird that they say they're based out of Indiana but then show a photo of Cloud Gate in Chicago. Which is the city Lit Mobile claimed to be based in, sigh. I also love how a product will say it has no reviews and then another part of the page will say it has 1,489 reviews, make up your mind! I'm also discovering other solar charger brands using this exact charger product, or at least something similar. I saw a tweet which mentioned the Halo solar battery bank, which was, actually also, on Indiegogo, what? So, now what? Well, I'm still waiting to hear back from Lit Mobile. I doubt they're ever gonna get back to me. But I still wanted to try this product out. I promised I would do that, at least, I think I did. So, do you know what I did? Oh yeah, I went to Alibaba and got in touch with the supplier, Juding Tech. Granted I don't have 100% confirmation this is the supplier Lit Mobile used but, visually, it looks like the same product. The JD-T19, as suspected they offer custom branding and boxes, which for the hell of it I submitted my computer plan logo and received three renders. Neato, hey maybe, we can sell these one day, wink. So, after getting a few errors on the Alibaba website, I got in touch with the supplier and ordered one non-branded unit for review. To Juding's credit they were super polite and responded very quickly. So, that product is on it's way to my lair as we speak. When it gets here, I will do some testing and I will gladly do another follow up episode for you guys. So, stay tuned for that. And if the Lit Mobile product ever arrives, I will gladly compare the two side-by-side but I doubt it's ever gonna get here. I did receive some generous offers from you guys, for you to actually donate your Lit Mobiles to me and I may have to take you up on that. So, we'll see. I'm curious to know about your Lit Mobile buying experience and as always I love to hear about your other tech buying horror stories. So, let me know about those in the Comments, down below. If you liked the video, you know what to do. Awesome, thanks for sticking with me. Catch the crazy, pass it on. (upbeat music) (logo chimes)",

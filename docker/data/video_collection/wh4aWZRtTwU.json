    "transcript": "Hello. This video will be exploring the color brown. Viewer discretion is advised. Red. Green. Blue. These three colors are almost like magic. Theyre able to fool our eyes into thinking were seeing almost any color you can think of. And yet they cant. Theyre actually very limited. But at the same time, theyre nearly limitless. What do I mean? Well, brown. Brown. Feast your eyes on the delightful world of brown. There are so many good browns out there! The bark of a majestic tree. The amazing woodgrain of your favorite videocassette recorder. Fresh coffee beans, delicious chocolate, really, brown is the color of some awesome stuff! Yeah, there are also some less appealing brown substances out there but on the whole browns a nice color, and underappreciated! But the funny thing about brown is that its a color that doesn't really exist. OK, it does, but it also kinda doesnt. It literally depends on how you see things. So, were gonna be talking a bit about RGB lighting again, so in a sense this video is a continuation of the weird world in RGB. If you havent seen that video you might want to check it out. Heres a card: [excessive straining] [incessant coughing]. Now [cough] that [cough] [cough] that, that, that doesnt always work... so theres a link down below if you need it. Have you ever seen a brown light? This may seem like a rather silly question but its pretty much the entire point of this video. So yeah. Now, youve probably seen like a sign for a UPS store which is lit up and contains brown, but theres a weird thing going on with that sign. Its not actually brown. Its orange. But darker. Brown is an amazing color because it highlights how we perceive and describe the world. Our eyes are just fancy light detectors, barely able to see three colors, but our brains; theyre pretty good at interpreting what the output from those light detectors means. And the fascinating thing about brown is that its a color that exists due to context, not wavelength. Take a look at a rainbow. Rainbows are super helpful because they break out the visible light spectrum and show us the limits of what we can see. Theyre also super interesting because they exist only to humans. Well, they exist only to organisms that see in visible light. And they also kinda dont exist at all. Rainbows arent physical objects, theyre just the result of weird things that happen when electromagnetic radiation gets diffracted and reflected through water droplets and observed from one location in space. Anyway, the important thing about rainbows is that they contain the color spectrum. Thats our friend Mr. Biv, Roy G. These are all the wavelengths of light that we can detect with our eyes and thus see. Now, you may notice that browns not in here. I suppose thats not too surprising, whens the last time you had a brown Skittle? M&Ms though... *taste the brown* The fact that brown does not appear in the rainbow tells us that there is no such thing as brown light. Dont believe me? Well, I dont blame you. The screen youre looking at is showing you brown, with light. So how can there be no such thing as brown light when youre looking right at it? Well, in fact, this isnt brown. Its orange, with context. Lets play around with some RGB lights, shall we? Ive gone with some LED tape light this time because I have more precise control over it. So, quick refresher, the colors red green and blue work together to create virtually all colors of light because they roughly correspond to the long, medium, and short cone cells in your eyes. Mix the ratios up between these three colors and you can trick your brain into thinking its seeing just about any color at all. Red alone well it, its red. As we add green light it shifts to orange, then yellow. Now as we take away the red, it becomes a yellow-green, and finally its solidly... green. Then we add blue and now its shifting towards a blue-green, and now a cyan, before we start taking away the green and it heads into solid blue territory. Start to add red to this and you get a purplish color. Keep going and we get magenta. And finally, as we take the blue away, we start back at red. The only thing weve been messing with here is the hue, not the Dewey or Louie. And hue exists on a circle. Well, sometimes, theres a bunch of ways to represent color, but here; Let me show you my play button. The outer ring contains all of the pure colors of light that we can produce in an RGB space. Youll notice that it follows the color spectrum, though violet is replaced with magenta, and it bleeds back into red. In case you forgot, magenta is a weird color that our brains made up! It comes from an object emitting both high and low frequencies of light, so near-blue and near-red, but few middle frequencies like green. Magenta doesnt exist in the rainbow, yet there it is. Anyway, back to the tape light. These lights can make any sort of RGB combination you like, just as the sub pixels in your monitor can. But they cant make brown. Why not? Because again; Brown light doesnt exist. There is only brown. Uh, well, here. How does one make brown in the RGB space? Surely its possible. I mean. Look at all the brown. Well, notice whats going on inside the triangle. This triangle represents the relationship between hue, saturation, and brightness in a 2D space. If fully saturated, and fully bright, we find ourselves in the right corner. All monochromatic, or spectral, light sources exist here. If brightness stays the same but saturation falls, we head towards the top corner, and white. In an RGB space, this is accomplished by adding both blue and green to red, pushing the composite color towards white. Of note is that brightness is technically increasing since we are adding more light, but youll see why we dont say that shortly. As brightness decreases, we head towards the bottom corner, and black. In RGB, this is done simply by producing less light. As you approach no light at all, you approach black. This can be a little confusing to conceptualize because the axes are weird. You might think saturation exists on the X axis, going left to right, but in fact saturation remains at 100% all along this edge of the triangle - only brightness varies. On the opposite edge, brightness remains at 100% as saturation changes. And on the left edge, saturation stays at zero but brightness changes, and in fact thats why this edge is simply black to white. The axes are really here, with this being the saturation axis and this being the brightness axis. It isnt really important to the point here, but it is interesting. Now this is just one of the ways we can show a color palette. There are plenty of other options, like this one where the box contains hue and saturation, and brightness is controlled via the slider on the right. Or theres also YouTubes favorite, the Hue Cube. But for what were talking about here the color wheel is best. So, how do we get brown out of the color wheel? Well, were gonna put our hue at something like 30 degrees, and drop the brightness. That, my friends, is brown. Brown is just orange. But darker. Now, Im sure many of you already knew this, but I am routinely fascinated by this. Because again. Ya cant make brown light. Here, lets go back to the tape light. We know that to make brown we need to make orange, and darken it. So, well make a nice orange color. Now decrease the brightness. Thats still orange. This is not brown. At all. Oh, but it is! We just dont have any context to suggest that this should be brown. Because you cannot create that context with a light source on its own. Here. Im gonna leave you in the dark for a moment. Were gonna stay here for a brief period so your eyes get used to the darkness. Yes. This sure is dark. Not a lot to see here, thats for sure. Now, this demonstration is only really gonna work if you can be in a completely dark room so maybe try and do that? Ill give you a second. Are you there yet? Are you in your dark place? OK. Cool. So, *fart noise* I have brought to you a square of orange. This is a very pretty orange square, isnt it? Now, its not the brightest orange square out there, in fact Ive yet to see one of those, but it sure is orange. But is it? Lets fade from black and into white. Oh no! It was brown the whole time! How could I have been fooled?! smarmy slow jazz Those words on the screen up there? They're important. Don't bother reading these words. They won't do you any good. Yes. Yes it is. Well, you were fooled because you didnt have any context to tell you that this color was brown. Or, if you werent fooled, you didnt listen to me and instead left the lights on so you could see the color against the blackness of your screen. You cheater. To see brown as brown, we need to be seeing brighter things around it. And thats why you cant ever make a light source like this tape light appear brown. It produces its own light, so it will always be brighter than its surroundings. You cant use light to take brightness away. However, in the case of a monitor or a television, you can control the amount of light each portion of it makes. So, if you need to see a brown thing, so long as there are brighter objects on the screen to give you context, youll see that dimly lit orange as brown. Also of note is that, with lights on in the room, the monitor is of course darker than its surroundings already. This is one of the reasons this demonstration might not have worked. The black space around the orange square gives you the context you need to know that its not very bright at all, so its brown. In fact, this is precisely the reason why your display needs to be a black void when its not displaying anything. In order to see a full range of colors, you need to be able to produce darkness and lightness at the same time. The only way to do that with light by itself is to make sure the starting point is very dark. So, modern displays absorb most of the light that falls on them so they will appear black even in a well-lit space. This is also why projection systems need to be in very dark rooms. Otherwise the screen is illuminated by incidental lighting, so the darkest color it can produce will be a grey, and the image is washed-out. The thing is, to make brown, you need to take light away. If you wanted to make brown using pigments, youd start with orange and add black. And in fact you can even see this going on in the color wheel. While this is of course representing color in the context of light, you can also think of this as the result of mixing paints together. Up here is purely white paint. Down here is purely black paint. And over to the right is a paint of perfect hue. Mix them together and you get whats going on inside the triangle. Objects in the real world that are brown are like an orange mixed with black. The light they reflect into your eyes is similar in wavelength to an orange, but theres not a lot of that light. Its pretty dark. And we just happen to call that resulting color \"brown\". Side-note; brown is also fascinating to me because its arguably a human construct. Perhaps youve heard about how languages evolved to describe color in categories. Some languages have fewer categories of color than others, and anthropologists have discovered that as languages evolved they tended to build upon these categorizations in the same predictable order. For instance, languages with only three categories of color would almost always contain white, black (or their stand-ins light and dark) and red. In these languages, things like blue, green, yellow - they just dont have words for them, and theyre not distinct. Languages with six categories, like Mandarin Chinese, contain white, black, red, yellow, green and blue. Side-side-note; When we were learning colors, as you do, we learned bi s, hi s, hng s, hung s, l s, and ln s. Then our teacher asked us, \"what do you think brown is?\" And I just blurted out because I was a smart ass and thought it would be clever, what, is it k fi s? And my teacher eyes lit up delighted because it is! Now, to be fair, that technically means the color of coffee and there is a separate word for brown, zng s. However, we used k fi s more frequently in class at least so, there you go. I can now officially say that I have used my very, very, rudimentary knowledge of Chinese in my professional life. Huzzah! Anyway, to get us back on target, the point Im making here is that we only recognize colors as distinct after weve decided thats a distinct color! and we give it a name. Even in English orange didnt become a color until we stole that word from the fruit. Prior to then it was either yellow or red. Or yellow-red. Or maybe red-yellow. Rellow? And I think brown is definitely one of these late colors. Why? Well, lets hop on board the color wheel one more time. Right here is a nice sturdy brown. Clearly. Thats brown. Mmm. But look what happens when I change the hue. As we head into yellow that becomes, oh I dont know a puky green? Maybe tan? We move into green and thats just a dark green. As we move into cyan we get what you might call a teal, but everything from there on out is just dark whatever. Dark blue, dark purple, dark red... but when we get back to orange thats not dark orange. Its brown! The color is clearly its own color. But why? Why isnt it a dark orange? Well, because weve named it brown. And the mere act of doing that causes it to become a distinct color in our minds eye. Thats pretty neat and weird stuff, isnt it? Brown serves as a fantastic example of the difference between creating color with pigments and creating color with light. Objects in the real world are lit by the sun, or maybe a light bulb, and what we see is the light reflected off of them. If they reflect a lot of that light, theyll appear white. If they absorb a lot of that light, theyll appear black. And if they absorb only some frequencies of light and reflect others, theyll appear as whatever color they reflect the most. But describing it that way is incomplete. Its not just the prevailing wavelength that creates the color. That defines the hue. Again, thats the circle. Hue is only one third of color. Hue, saturation, and brightness all work together to create the colors we see. In the realm of pigment, or real-world objects, brightness describes how much light is reflected back, hue describes which (if any) wavelengths stand out to give it color. And saturation describes how much that wavelength stands out, or how intense the color appears. And the thing is, in the real world, we always start with light and the objects around us take it away. This is called subtractive color. If we use paints, well a white paint reflects pretty much all of the light that hits it back, and roughly equally. A black paint absorbs most of the light that hits it, again equally. And a colored paint absorbs most light, but not certain wavelengths. In the case of red paint, it reflects red quite well. In this scenario, the red paint is our hue. Red paint alone is fully saturated, and fully bright. Add some white paint to it and you decrease the saturation because now the reflected light is not purely red. Other wavelengths are now visible, though red remains prominent. Mixing in black paint with red decreases the brightness because it lowers the overall amount of light being reflected back. However, because black paint absorbs all wavelengths roughly equally, the light being reflected back is still purely red. Theres just less of it. So this mixture is fully saturated, but less bright. You can create any brightness and saturation combo you like simply by altering the ratio of white, red, and black paint. The hue, however, will always remain red. Or roughly zero degrees on the hue circle. But when we use light to create an image, this is sorta turned on its head. A display creates its own light (usually) and this is why the primary colors are red, green and blue. We sometimes call this additive color. Were starting with no light, and need to add light to create what is seen. And in the weird world of RGB, creating colors anywhere below this line requires lowering brightness, or taking away light. But we cant actually take away light. We can only produce less of it. And thats whats so interesting about brown. Even here on the color wheel, with orange selected, its kinda hard (at least to me) to see the space in the triangle as containing brown. It just looks like a whole bunch of different shades of orange. But indeed, those darker shades are very much what we call brown. Its an orange-ish wavelength of light, but not a lot of it. With something like an LED tape light, or really any RGB light source on its own, you cant produce a color that looks like brown because any attempt to do so will just end up looking like orange. And the reason why is pretty simple; all light sources brighten whats around them. There is no equivalent of a black pigment in the realm of light. Theres just less light. And in order for that to be perceived as a dark color, you need to have some sort of context. You get gobs of that when looking at an image produced on a display but you get none at all from a simple light source existing in the real world. With an RGB light, youre limited to colors that exist on this line. You can either be a pure hue, which incidentally is why your RGB gaming rig tends to just cycle between blue, cyan, green, yellow, red, magenta, and blue again, or you can decrease saturation and approach white. But you cant venture away from this line. I mean, you can, but a dimmer light without context is still just a light. And our brains simply wont see that as in the center of the triangle unless we have other, brighter things to see, too. I hope you enjoyed this look into the color brown. Brown is, and I am not kidding you, my favorite color. Sometimes I wish we could just get a 70s appreciation movement going because boy was that a good time to be a fan of brown! Nowadays nobody seems to like the color brown. Sad face. Now, to be fair, the worlds ugliest color - thats Pantone 448 C - is a brown. But, I mean, thats not fair to brown. Not all browns are that gross looking. They... they can be, just slide the hue over here and youre getting a good bit of yellow in there, which somehow seems to make the brown look almost greenish. But, just look at all these other great browns! Those are some good browns. Are you wondering why Ive made a video on brown? Well, the more good sounding answer is that I wanted to share with you more of the weirdness that is our human color perception, but the more true answer is that I wanted to see if I could make a good video out of something as mundane as a color. I hope to make this a sort of periodic challenge for me, and I hope you think Ive done a good job today! By the way, and this is a totally random suggestion, you should consider checking out the channel Aging Wheels on YouTube. If you like hilarious shenanigans involving weird and interesting bits of automotive history, including bizarre electric cars, well then that is a channel for you. Ive been told I look a lot like Robert, but frankly I dont see the resemblance. Well. Thanks for watching! And seriously. Go check out Aging Wheels. Its great. I even made a playlist for you of my favorite videos. Go watch. Kay bye. contextually smooth jazz Theres a card down below if you need it. Link! Ahh They tended to build upon these categora categorizations. This is ooh boy! Thats the first time I read this line and I know its gonna go poorly. I suppose thats not too surprising, whens the last time you had a brown skittle? That went well, except what was this? So were gonna be talking a bit about RGB colored light lighting again. Its, its going too slow... Im sorry.... But when we use light to create an image I need to back it up once more. I need to restart it because it stopped. Heres a mmmMMMMMMM. (laughing) You know Im not youre not gonna use the footage from that, so what does it matter? [Probably not] Oh, but I did! I did use the footage from that! Also, yes. I totally forgot to add the text elements that I usually do on the endscreen. I'm just gonna pretend that I meant to do that because I am promoting Robert's channel. Ya know, 'cause it's different?

    "transcript": "This episode has been brought to you by Graphic Stock This is the web's largest repository for royalty free images, graphics, and vectors And unlike other sites that charge you per image that you download This one here is gonna have a membership, so instead you've got unlimited access to over 300,000+ images There is a 7 day free trial as well and during that period you can download up to 140 pieces of content This is the kind of stuff that you can use and not get any kind of copyright infringement So click the link in the description, or head over to graphicstock.com/youtube for your free trial. What's up guys! Lou here, back with another video and today we're gonna be doing something new, something fresh Often I guest asked, \"Hey Lou, what are your favorites?\" We know that you unbox enormous amounts of things But I don't often get to sit down with you guys and tell you about my favorites The things that get unboxed here, that end up in my life long-term That I use, in this case, as far as today's video's concerned, on a daily basis [faint bird chirping outside] Those are like, baby chicks Now these things have shown up in videos previously So if you wanna - I don't know - get some more detail, go check out those videos, I'll link them in the description This isn't technically tech, but it holds all my tech Look, you can see, I'm actively using it - We've got the baggage tag on there still This is the PackSafe - I believe it's the Z400 I love this bag. I've been using this bag - Jack can attest to it - on trips since I did the original video for it. It's durable, rugged, spots and pouches for everything - Look at this thing So, a nice zipper pocket on the outside - solid, satisfying This zipper can go underneath this little flap here to make it tougher for pickpockets, and whatnot So you've got a lock over here on this side as well, and when you pull the zippers over string them through there, and keep that completely locked. The strap itself is slash-proof, there's a mesh cage inside the bag there's even an RFID-safe pouch for your travel documents, passport, and so on and then on the backside, this passthrough for luggage, which I use all the time. This strap here, if you're not gonna be using it, if you're using this more as a briefcase, you can unclip it from this end, and there's actually a channel where you can store it. It's something that I can't get away from - I love it, probably more now than when I even got it So, go check out the original video. Next up, you guys have heard me talk about this guy right here This is the MX Master mouse from Logitech. This is another example of something I love more now than when I got it. Super comfy to hold, it can be connected to multiple devices It's got this really satisfying wheel here, which can spin freely, or in a geared manner Probably my favorite feature, the button on the thumb-rest here. See that how I can click down there? And of course you can map that to whatever you want through the app I don't know, you can't beat this mouse, in my opinion it's my favorite mouse on the planet right now. Lastly, this is probably the question I get asked more than any other \"Lou, which phone are you using right now?\" And, honestly, I have gravitated back to the Nexus 6P Real nice dbrand skin, got it blacked out I wanted that stock Android experience I did think, \"Man, it's a little bit big\" - maybe? I don't know Maybe I would prefer something with a slightly smaller form factor, but honestly you could really - I don't know - you could take advantage of the larger screen from a multimedia perspective. Nothing too flashy, just nice, clean, skinless experience. Favorite tech picks, tech that I'm using right now But it's also time for the wildcard round. A new toothbrush concept - a sonic toothbrush, plus cleaning system The \"Aura Clean System\" They sent this baby over, they're like \"Lou, we want you to check it out, maybe give it a go\" 99.9% pathogen removal They have said that there is a deal for all of you beautiful Unbox Therapy viewers right now Ooh, now look at that guy - that looks like you, Jack See that guy there? They're doing a deal on this right now, for this Unbox Therapy debut 50% off with the code UNBOX - I'll have the link in the description so you can check it out - but 50% off , cool So here is the cleaning base So here are tips, they've given me 3 here There we go A little power brick A power cord Let's see if we have - oh we have juice! Ooh [toothbrush buzzing] My assumption is - okay, so basically [loud click] Wow! Alright It's - aah - It's UVC rays They destroy the DNA of pathogens Here we are, I'm done, I'm brushing up Getting spiffy Turn it off, and I'm gonna hit it right here [loud click] Like this And I can hear it action The light is illuminating Drying, UV light, killing those nasty germs What's the point in cleaning your teeth if your toothbrush ain't clean? What are you gonna go for? Not this!",

    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -  iStranger (USA Link) -  iStranger (International Link) -   The iStranger is a dedicated voice changer. It plugs into your iPhone or Android device and acts as your speaker / microphone. The device processes your voice making it unrecognizable to the person on the other end of the call. Use it for a few laughs, prank your friends but keep it cool.  From the manufacturer -   Do you want to realistically alter your voice over the phone? Then the iStranger voice changer by Spy Max is just what you need! You can choose between the 2 pitch modes to decide on the ideal voice for your covert mission. The higher setting increases the pitch while the lower one creates a deeper sounding voice. And our voice changer is nothing like the toys that produce fake, mechanical sounds. Our product has been used by professionals to create real-sounding voices that can be clearly heard over the phone.  Weve designed the voice disguiser to be as easy to use as possible; no C.I.A training needed here! All you have to do is connect it to your cell phone using the headphone jack, hold it to your ear like a receiver, and speak normally. Thats it! This device only turns on when the phone is in use to greatly save on battery life. And with its compact size, you can covertly use it whether youre in the house, office or street.

    "transcript": "Yes, it is about to be another fun one! I've got the iStranger Voice Changer Some of you have been watching Unbox Therapy for a little while And you may have caught a previous video about The world's smallest phone. And that thing had a built in rudimentary voice changer. It had an optimist prime style voice Donald Duck was on there, Donald Duck, Daffy Duck It's a lot of 'Ducks' in the cartoon world This one is another level. Honestly, i don't really know what to expect But chances are... we're about to have some fun with the IStranger Voice Changer Let's jump inside as we usually do here Very nice box so far. Ooohohoho It is a unique voice changing system designed to be compatible with most existing cellphones. Insert the voice changer in the headphone jack And that's about that Micro USB cable to charge it up Ooh, it's kinda... it's slender. Look at it! There's a mode switch on the back There's a couple of different LEDs here Low, high, voice, and then a charge indicator. I don't know what it's made out of, but it feels a lot more solid than i expected. So you plug it in, and then you immediately see this low indicator Now you can change that; you hit the 'mode' button And it switches to 'high' Now, the voice changer is the phone's headset. So you're actually talking like this The ear piece is there, and the microphone is down here So this is like your phone now Due to the variance and octane of the human voice Some people may not be able to use 'low' and 'high'. So, anyway, i don't know; i'm gonna call Ryan on 'low' *Evil Laughter* Yo! How do i sound right now? *Another type of laughter* Would you know that it's me if you didn't see the caller id? Wooah, ok, please, ahm, please tell the people that -one second- If i had not seen the caller ID, i would not have known how this is *3rd type of laughter* *The IStranger Voice Changer recording* On Low and High mode. You heard my bissare voice Now i'm gonna get a call back So that i can react. Hello! Excuse me? *Reaction* 4th type of laughter. It's going well, how about you? Woow, you sound mean Woaah There's absolutely no way That i would know that that was you Woaah You got the voice from like the guy from Randsome *Scream* You're creeping me out! Dude! Woaah Oh my goodness, this one is much more defined *5th incredible laughter* You can't, there is no way That you're going to be able to recognize Who's voice that is on the other line. IStranger, a little phone for your phone Where you can be, all new you.",

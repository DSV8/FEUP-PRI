    "transcript": "- Hey everyone, happy \"Forza\" launch, and I'm so excited because inside of here is a custom \"Forza\" Xbox. I think it is. They said they were sending one, but there's no branding on the outside, so we're gonna have to open it up and check it out. I feel like this year, I've done so much with \"Forza,\" so it's super exciting that the game is actually out. You can play it on Game Pass as well. I went up to Seattle earlier this year to reveal the cover cars, which is the Cadillac V-series.R race car, and the Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray which is the first electric Corvette. I also got to post a video checking out the Corvette E-Ray, and very, very soon I'm gonna be posting a video getting a chance to finally drive the E-Ray, which spoiler alert, it was really fun. You also may have seen this video that I posted the other day. It was supposed to be a short, but it was too long for a short, so I just ended up posting the entire vlog as a vertical video here on YouTube. (laughing) We went to a driving school with \"Forza,\" in Vegas, at the Spring Mountain Resort. We got a chance to drive the Corvette Stingray all around the track, and we did like a little mini driver school, and it was so, so, so awesome. I'm having so much fun making car content, and I've never really made much car stuff in the past so kind of getting into this whole new world, there's so much to learn. But man, I'm obsessed. Anyway, let's unbox the Xbox and see what's inside! (gasping) Here it is, here it is! (paper rustling) (tissue rustling) Oh my... Oh man. Okay, for some reason, I was thinking it was gonna be the E-Ray, but this is so sick! (laughing) It's the Cadillac V-Series.R theme. Oh, you're beautiful. You are so pretty. Holy moly, this is amazing. Oh wow, this is so cool. We've also got a controller. (gasping) The controller's even custom! (plastic rustling) (wires thudding) Dude, I am just so shook. And as you may have noticed, another controller just fell over. (laughing) I got this one in Vegas. You can make custom colored controllers at the Design Lab. So they gave us this one, and since I've got the Cadillac here, they also did an E-Ray Elite controller. Just beautiful. I'll show you guys those in a second. Here's the Xbox. They've got all of the little accents. It looks so, so good. Here's the front, here's the other side. I love it, I love it so much. Here's the controller, check that out. It's got this little, \"Cadillac Racing.\" Mm-hmm. (buttons clicking) And here's a closer look at the yellow Design Lab controller. And the E-Ray Elite. Wow, this one just looks absolutely stunning. (gentle rhythmic music) We've also got the custom joystick toppers as well that you can custom color those, and the case also has a custom Xbox logo. It's pretty cool because you can basically customize these controllers to be almost any color you want, and I love that you can now also custom design the Elite controllers because I love the Elite controller. Thank you guys for watching. This was just a very short, quick video 'cause I wanted to show you guys this Xbox and I wanted to unbox it. And also, remind you that \"Forza\" is available on Game Pass if you do have Game Pass, and it is currently out for Xbox and PC. So I've already been playing it, so I definitely plan on doing some streams. So if you'd be interested in that, let me know. And with that my friends, I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye!",

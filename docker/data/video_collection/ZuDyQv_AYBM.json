    "transcript": "- One day, the tech news came for me. Now I'm trapped in this void, forced to read cringey intros like this one. - [Male Speaker] Oh, it's not, it's okay. - Forever. In recent years, Intel has appeared to fall behind, getting stuck on 14- and 10-nanometer process nodes as its competitors move on to seven and five nanometers. The obvious solution? Rename your products to sound more competitive. - [Male Speaker] Hey, wait a second. - Of course, this actually makes more sense than it seems. Intel's processor technology is in fact very similar to TSMC and Samsung's in terms of transistor density. Since these process node names don't really refer to actual transistor size anymore, not since 22 nanometer. Intel laid out a roadmap outlining the new naming scheme with Intel 7, 4, and 3, replacing 10 nanometer, 7 nanometer, and so on, and eventually being replaced by Intel 20A, with the A standing for the angstrom unit of measurement. Okay, so we're going back here at some point. 10 of which make up one nanometer. - [Male Speaker] You knew that. - That doesn't sound metric. If you're confused, Dr. Ian Cutress has a good explanation because he is a massive nerd. - [Male Speaker] Nerd. - And that accent makes him smarter. The rebranding is the latest move by new CEO, Pat Gelsinger extraordinaire to get team blue back on track. And so far, his campaign seems to be working. Intel's new Foundry Division just announced it will be producing x86 and ARM chips for Qualcomm and Amazon. And I thought that was going to be a list, but it's not. Somebody give this man a Pat Gelsinger on the back. - [Male Speaker] Oh yeah. - Californians looking to order high-end Alienware gaming PCs, there's dozens of us, online are being met with a notice saying that Dell can't ship those products to their state due to power consumption regulations. And it's not just California, Dell isn't shipping the Aurora R10 or R12 to Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Vermont, or Washington, Washington, the state, not DC. - [Male Speaker] The state. - The good one, either. - [Male Speaker] It's not a state, actually, DC? - It's a district. - [Male Speaker] Fun fact. - It's right in the name. So what gives? Do these states just hate PC gamers? I mean, what else is there to do in Vermont? - [Male Speaker] Whoa! - Visit Bernie Sanders' house? - [Male Speaker] That's where Bernie Sanders is from. - (chuckling) The man is a museum. Actually, it looks like Dell is to blame here. These states have enacted minimum power efficiency requirements for electronics that were announced in 2016, supported by an organization called the Information Technology Industry Council, which has HP, Intel, Dell, and Lenovo among its members. Dell knew these regulations were coming for years and apparently, did not prepare by building these systems with rule-abiding power supplies, which many of their competitors did do. There's also much more to the story so stay tuned for a Linus Tech Tips video dedicated on the subject where Linus gets very angry about something or yeah (sniveling) - [Male Speaker] (sniveling) - You know what he does. - [Male Speaker] That's him. - (chuckling) And the LG, once at the top of the smartphone manufacturer heap is going to sell iPhones and other Apple products in it's south Korean stores. - [Male Speaker] What? - They have stores? The announcement months after LG officially exited the smartphone business and I guess Apple approached them as they were crying in the alley behind computer headquarters and they made their dastardly preposition. Hey, chin up, what's up? - [Male Speaker] A deal with the devil? - The news surely won't be celebrated by Samsung who has enjoyed somewhat of a duopoly over the south Korean phone market with LG and will now have to compete more heavily with Apple in the country, now that you can actually buy them more easily. Can you imagine if LTT was reduced to reposting videos from MKBHD? That's what this is like. Can you imagine? - [Male Speaker] It wouldn't be that bad. - What time of day would they even come out? We're on Pacific. Oh, Riley, what time is it? - Now it's time for Quick Bits brought to you by NZXT's BLD system, which makes getting a custom built PC easier than ever even if you're like a Mac person. It's okay, we forgive you. Simply set your budget, see how your PC will perform in your favorite games and let BLD take care of the rest because their recommendation engine provides benchmark data guaranteed to be within 10% accuracy. There's transparent pricing, a flat $99 assembly fee. And everything's covered under one warranty plan with NZXT's excellent customer support. Orders are built and shipped within 48 business hours and it's even available in Australia now too. So go check out NZXT's BLD system today at the link below. - Quick bits, that's where they really get you. - [Male Speaker] Aww, they got you this time. - Hm-mm. Rumormongers, the least creepy kind of monger, are rumoring that AMD will announce the Radeon RX 6600 XT on July 30th at the Chinajoy Tech App Expo number one, which is apparently a big event I've never heard of, but we've never heard of it because we're in the west and the west has CES. But now China is becoming the world's dominant economic and cultural powerhouse, and we've lost. So Chinajoy here we come. Facebook has halted sales of the Oculus Quest 2 after multiple reports of skin reactions, including swelling and rashes resulting from the VR headset's foam face plate. Also known as its Facebook. The social media giant is offering existing users a free silicone cover while they prepare a new version of the Oculus Quest 2 with 128 gigabytes of onboard storage for release next month. We don't care about the storage. We need the eyes to be... - [Male Speaker] No, gigabytes are good for your skin. - Ooh. - [Male Speaker] Soak in there. - Got it. - [Male Speaker] Yeah. - Apple has won patents for an under-display touch ID and face ID system. Meaning we'll probably see those pop up in an upcoming iPhone in 20 years, but it's worth noting that ZTE is now on their second generation of under-display camera tech with the Axon 30. Because once again, China number one, isn't the meme anymore. China is number one, - [Male Speaker] Dang. - But you wouldn't know that because your government won't let buy ZTE phones, will it? - [Male Speaker] Oh! - Huh, fake news. The heavily anticipated Halo Infinite will hold this first technical playtest this weekend with the chosen few who got invites, like us, getting the chance to play against the games' new bots. The rest of us, I mean, you, can watch from the sidelines, giving us all flashbacks of when our older siblings hog the controller. That doesn't sound funny at all. - [Male Speaker] Yeah, that's why I stopped playing video games. - And watch out Neuralink and by extension Elon Musk, the FDA has given approval to Synchron to begin human trials of their, their Stenstrode, Stentrode brain computer interface. The device is installed by implanting a lace of electrodes in the blood vessels of the brain, which lead to a connector on the chest that can be plugged into a computer. So paralyzed patients can send emails, shop, and even do online banking just by thinking. I wonder if you can use it to order a Tesla. - [Male Speaker] Oh, that would be... - Ooh. - [Male Speaker] that would be really insulting for Elon Musk. - Got them. Maybe you can use the Stentrode to not buy doge coin. Take that Elon. - [Male Speaker] He wouldn't like that. - I think it's time to not continue this episode. So come back on Friday for more tech news, otherwise I'll just stay in this void, a liminal space between tech and news. It's not a bad void, but I want to go home. - [Male Speaker] It's got a nice background. (laughing) Pretty good boy.",

Try Privacy and get $5 free -  macOS Mojave Patcher -   Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter -  Follow me on Instagram -   Apple is often criticized for overcharging when it comes to hardware. When it comes to mobile devices, they typically make well by offering many years of free updates to iOS. On the Mac, however, most machines enter un-supported vintage status after just 6 years. In Windows land, there are computers many years older running the latest build of Windows 10. But what if you could use the same method that Hackintosh computers use to run a vintage Mac on the latest-and-greatest macOS Mojave and later? Well, turns out you can.",

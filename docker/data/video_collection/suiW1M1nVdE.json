You get VINCI: the most ambitious wireless headphones I've ever used. Version 1.5 isn't quite ready for primetime so I wasn't able to test all of its promised features, but if even half of these work as designed, this is definitely a \"hearable\" worth keeping your eye on  especially at the Kickstarter price.    [SUBSCRIBE]     [ABOUT THIS VIDEO]  MrMobile's VINCI 1.5 hands-on was produced following three days of usage with VINCI 1.5 review hardware on loan from VINCI.

    "transcript": "- [Mr. Mobile] It's just another pair of wireless earphones, right? Nope. I'm Mr. Mobile, and this is a quick hands-on with the VINCI Smart Hearable. A new take on the headset. (upbeat electronic music) You may have seen the VINCI before, because version one has been out in China for awhile. And while this review hardware is based on that first generation, it's actually a version 1.5 that's hitting Kickstarter, and the U.S. market. What you'll get, if all goes according to plan, a fully self-contained, voice-controlled headset capable of reading your heart rate, syncing with Spotify, Amazon and SoundCloud, and responding to voice commands. Now when I say self-contained, I mean it. While you can plug in a cable or pair it to a phone or computer via Bluetooth, VINCI also includes wi-fi and a cellular radio so you can use it on the go all on it's own. If you don't want to pay for a SIM and a separate data line though, there's onboard storage so you can load music through a USB connection. You control all this through a custom Android interface on the single massive display which does double duty as a touch pad for volume and track skipping while you're wearing it. Rounding out the feature set, better looking hardware with more metal than you see here. Wireless charging, and variable noise cancellation on the pro model, and a proximity sensor for automatically pausing music when you take it off. Those are the promises anyway. At this point, so many of these features are incomplete or missing on my review hardware, that I couldn't properly test them, so I can't give you a proper buy or don't buy recommendation. I can say that I'm excited by the ambition of this product. It's very cool to just speak out loud what song you want to hear, and have VINCI play it. And it certainly gets points for pizzazz. The visualizer on the display is guaranteed to get you some attention, if that's what you're after. Beyond music, I really like the Amazon integration too. The idea that the Alexa voice assistant is always on your head is alluring, if you don't carry your phone everywhere. But um, everyone does carry their phone everywhere, which I think kind of obviates the need for this kind of product for most folks. And in a world of 20 to 30 hour battery life on many wireless headsets, VINCI's power-hungry features will probably make it something you need to charge much more often. But if you're shopping for a wireless headset, even a more basic one, VINCI might still be a good choice because it starts at $199, cheaper than most headsets I've tested this year, and with many more features. Until I use the final product, I won't be able to say whether it achieves the dream of being the world's best smart hearable. If you'd like to help them become reality though, the Kickstarter link is in the description below. I've hit up a lot of headsets this year folks. Check out those videos, and subscribe to Mr. Mobile on YouTube. New videos land at least twice a week. Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile my friends.",

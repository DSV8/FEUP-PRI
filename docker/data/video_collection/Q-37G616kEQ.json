    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is Justine. And welcome to my garage. We're turning this thing into an at home gym. First up and most importantly, this is the NordicTrack Rower 900. A huge thank you to NordicTrack for sponsoring this video. I've been such a huge of theirs for a really long time. My sister also recently just got one of their treadmills. And after running on that, it was like my entire life, just changed in an instant. I'll talk to you guys more about all of the incredible features that not only the tread has, but the rower and also their all digital lab. And next up we have this. We've got some mats. Because what are the things I haven't been able to do in over a year is train Jujutsu. So I decided to bring Jujutsu to my garage. And of course my sister, just started training with me. I'm also forcing her to help me set up. I also forced her to help me clean out the garage. I ordered her dinner. I offered her money, but she turned it down. So it's, so let's unbox these mats and then set up the rower. And get to fitness. (upbeat music) Here they are! These are so nice. I'm so excited. - Yeah, put that away. - I'm going to put this away. - [Sister] Look, they're heavy, but they're not that heavy. - They're heavy. - Step one is complete. - Looks good. - Do you want to take a little nap. - Flip here. What if I broke your arm? Haiyah! - Training will start on Monday, of next week. - Okay. - We got some throwing off. Yes. Thank you. Okay. (calm music) oh! Wow! Oh, the seat. - Oh, nice, very important part. - Oh, our hardware kit. Smell it. Learn about it, Maddy. - Very important. - Directions but there's also an app. Bilt! - Bilt, so they have a partnership with bilts, which I have never heard about until I was putting my tread together. I already have it up. So this is the RW 900 rower. - Yes! - And, it will basically give you a step-by-step. It says two people, 30 minutes, 24 steps. And it'll walk you through each step. - Here we go. Let's do it. (calm music) Team work make the dream work. Did we do it? - Yeah. - Oh my gosh! - It works. And it moves. - No way. Look at this. I'll be able to work out over here. - Yeah, that's nice. That's cool. - Oh my gosh, this is incredible. I'm so excited. So time to get started. We're at the welcome screen. I'm going to connect to wifi. And get this all set up. They also have heart rate monitors, which are definitely something that I recommend, if you are doing any types of workouts. Because when you are doing a workout, like you really want to be able to monitor your heart and know if you're actually making progress and how you're progressing. So, we're about to start this up. I'm going to put this on. And I'm going to do one of my first classes. This will automatically adjust the resistance to go along with what the trainer is doing. So I won't have to make any changes at all. I can just focus on my workout. This is adjustable, depending upon your foot size. Let's go. Time to row. There's so many different options and places that you can row. You can basically row all around the world. I mean there's so many different options. I can also do ones in the studio. But I think I need to get outside. And go to Portugal. This looks like an easy one. And since I'm a beginner rower we do an easy one. So resistance doesn't look too difficult. Let's go for a row. Over here is our resistance. And I haven't set so that it will automatically be adjusted to go with Alex's row. (trainer on screen) This feels nice. (upbeat music) This is hard work. Oh man, the resistance. Just automatically change, from a six to an eight. And I feel it. All right, I'm going to turn this down a little. I still feel like I'm new. I'm going to go back to six. I appreciate him automatically changing. I'm not ready. There it is. We did it. (Justine laughing) Easy recovery. That was an easy class. Wow, I have a lot to work up to. But this was incredible. I loved my first row. And now what I'm going to do is maybe a little yoga, a little stretching. They also have other types of classes like strength classes, yoga classes. So even if you don't have a piece of equipment like this, you can still take advantage of some of their classes. That was a workout. So obviously, this is a rower, and there are rowing classes. But there are so many other class option on here. There's yoga. There's strength training. Now I could just work out like this, but what I can do is I can just lift this up put it where I want it to go. Like I can put it where ever I want. One of the things that I love about this is you can fold it up. So if you don't have a lot of space in your room, you can just fold this up and tuck it away. I mean it's still pretty big. But considering, that you can fold this up quite small. I'm impressed. I mean look at this! Small, there's even a little clip, to keep it nice and sturdy. Look at that. That's perfect. And it's nice because I can just go like this. And I'm ready to train here on the mats. Let's maybe end this day with a little bit of yoga. Let's do, let's do this nice stretch. In St. George, Utah. Whoa, look at this. This is so pretty. Oh my gosh, look, where's she at. I want to be there. These cool drone shots. (trainer on rower screen) Thank you guys so much for watching. And again a huge thank you to NordicTrack, for sponsoring this video. I'm so excited to start integrating rowing into my workouts. Even if you aren't able to fit equipment into your home or your apartment. I love that iFit has so many different classes, that you're able to still do. That is available online for a subscription as well. Happy 2021! I would love to know, what your fitness goals are, for the new year. I know at the beginning of the new year, everybody likes to start doing their new year's resolutions. So I'd love to hear from you guys, what are yours? Leave them in the comments below. And I'll see you guys in my next video. Bye. (calm music)",

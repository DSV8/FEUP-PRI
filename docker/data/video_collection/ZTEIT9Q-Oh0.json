    "transcript": "now I've made a lot of videos where I said some pretty mean things to Alienware devices \"your parents are disappointed in how your lives turned out.\" but I've never actually had a look atone of their gaming laptops which apparently aren't all just plague ridden goblin sharkswhich make them potentially a lot better thantheir desktop counterparts so for today's video I bought the cheapest Alienware gaming laptop I could find to put this Theory to the test butfirst today's video is sponsored by be quiet'sdazzling new light Loop AIOs and it's not justthe pump block that's got all fancy but it hasa state-of-the-art pump with Progressive IC. don't know what that means but it sounds fancy but my favorite part about the new light Loop isthe easy to access fill Port. It even comes with additional liquid so you can top up the AIO ifit ever gets a bit dry and best yet it performsvery well hooked up to a window AC so if you're in the market for a brand new AIO check out the new Light Loop from be quiet! using the link down below [Music] the cheapest Alienware laptop I could find was the x14 R2 which comes in nice packaging adorned with the obligatory patronizing gamer phrases where game but the device is very well protected and once you get deeper into the packaging you get to the very cute little 130 W power brick but I feel like they could have shaped it a bit more aleny like a xenomorph head or an anal [Music] probe the little warranty card has I wouldn't say it's like an an Apple product smell but there's definitely a scent on this that isn't in the rest of the box and then in here Dell tells us all about how much they love whales and recycling ocean Plastics that's nice it's good at how happy they are now considering how much they apparently love whales there is a lot of plastic in this packaging whether it is recycled or otherwise oh there's another one of those now straight off the bat that is quite a nice looking device which you can feel is very solidly built the lid is definitely some form of metal but immediately what's this it's a 14 in laptop it's supposed to be a very like a small little device and then it's got this huge theak booty on the back in fact it's got so much junk in its trunk that this 14-in laptop is taller than this 16-in Asus device and when compare to an actual 14-in laptop the difference is considerable and that booty is significantly lower build quality than the lid so that is an immediate turnoff I'm I'm also not a fan of the color mismatch that material difference makes but let me not harp on that too much let's see if it passes the one hand open test yeah it does if it's not on a box it does um also this is a bit of a weird side note but this is a very high quality like in between keyboard and display bit of fabric compared to other laptops ooh at least they fit a nice hinge mechanism in that booty now when you go to the bottom of the laptop I quite like the design here you've got a lot of ventilation going on this bottom plate is metal aside from the booty then you've got this very tall rubberized foot with a bit of a cut out to give the ventilation a bit of clearance now I really like the idea of IO on the back of a laptop I'm curious to see how it's going to feel using a device with all of the io on the back like this and in terms of Port selection it's pretty good although there's one big thing lacking a dedicated ethernet port which is something I'd argue is pretty much non-optional for a gaming laptop but you do have something Thunderbolt so you can use an adapter but now when it comes to the inside of the laptop again there's so much depth real estate on this laptop so to have such a narrow trackpad feels really weird to me why is that so tiny oh I just noticed the fans can pull air through the top of the device that's an interesting implementation although it does mean that you have kind of ear line of sight with the fans so that's potentially concerning uh other than that that we have what looks like front-facing speakers so that's really nice I love that in laptops and uh we've got our 14-in display that is very high resolution I think this may be a brilliant display but we'll we'll see a bit later and then in terms of the webcam implementation we don't have the kind of nose cam like some Dell laptops have which is good and it seems to have stereo microphones which that's also a nice touch uh other than that we've got the keyboard that's just pretty standard run of the M laptop keyboard there uh but what is nice is that instead of adding a num pad which some of you will be upset about but you do get dedicated volume buttons and like mute and stuff on the side so I like that Although our power button isn't an alien head it's just a normal laptop power button that's very disappointing oh oh that's a lot of flex up there it's kind of okay on the keyboard but it is look at that that's the thing with this laptop is that a lot of it is quite nice but then there are these little bits sprinkled in between that makes it feel like Corners were cut although there was a point that I missed on the back it seems like this is going to be super easy to open up because we've got these six screws and because we have no io on the sides it should just pop off on that note let's see how easy it actually is unscrewing was straightforward enough even though four of them were captive but once unscrewed getting the back off was quite traumatic with a bunch of Clips holding crap in place does not love the idea of opening up one of the reasons that the opening was slightly traumatic is that it's got these Apple like Clips on the inside that hold this plate down so this isn't like some of the other metal laptops where the bottom just kind of Pops off once the the screws are undone I much prefer that this is a really annoying way to hold the bottom of the laptop on but once inside the laptop it's a very neat interior but it's neat in a way that makes it clear there's not much you can do to upgrade although having said that the m.2 storage is upgradeable even if there's just one slot and you can replace your Wi-Fi card the battery looks pretty easily replaceable this is a pretty big flat little 80w hour unit although it seems like Ram is soldered down on this laptop which is a real shame and the laptop comes with 16 gigs of ddr5 which isn't the worst but you would conceivably want more RAM in the lifespan of this laptop other than that specs wise we've got an Intel i7 13 620h which is real mouthful a 512 gig SSD and an RTX 4050 which seems to be a cutdown variant of the 4060 which has had at least one of its kneecaps blown out with its 6 gigs of video memory and Tiny boss The Next Step was to remove the booty Cod piece to see just what exactly is living in there so here we can see what the massive booty is for on the top bit of it it's mostly display hinge uh which you know it looks like quite a robust hinge like if you open it up and then on the other side aside from a little bit of motherboard extension for the I/O to reach the back there's also a bit more heat sink I find this fan implementation really interesting because the fans can pull air from the top and the bottom of the laptop which you know it makes a lot of sense the top is usually much less constricted airflow wise than the bottom so with that let's switch the laptop on and see how it [Music] runs and once I fired up the little laptop there was one massive pleasant surprise that I was not expecting there's no maffy on here did they make a mistake was that like an accident I don't think they did because on alienware's website no antivirus is the default checked box which is a huge win when did that happen that's so exciting I mean we still have this standard like Alienware crap on it but that makes sense it's an Alienware laptop but the fact that there's no maafi or in fact any other antivirus is wild the display is also very nice it's a 2560 x600 so it's a 16x 10 display that has 165 HZ refresh rate and measures pretty well the only issue is some inaccuracy in dark gray and the high resolution which does give very sharp text does mean we're going to have to game in less than native resolution which is a bit of a shame now in terms of webcam this is what it does and from where I'm sitting it looks pretty flat despite the fact that there's quite a lot of light contrast in here it's not a very Punchy image but it looks usable you've got a nice wide field of view so you can like see things around you uh and in terms of the microphone from what I've heard it sounds very webcam but I'll cut it between my lav mic and the kind of stereo microphone up here but from what I've heard it just sounds like I'm Skyping from a laptop so this is CS2 running a 1080p well 1200p but it's basically 1080p at low settings and our little 4050 is doing pretty well we're getting 200 frames per second which looks and feels great on this display this is balanced power mode which this system is not doing a whole lot running CS2 here but that does give us pretty good temperatures for a laptop and the noise isn't too bad either at which point CS2 crashed while I tried to apply some settings and then MSI After Burner just couldn't show us GPU utilization and memory frequency anymore I even reinstalled MSI After Burner but apparently we're not allowed to see that information anymore in fact generally the windows install felt pretty unstable with games occasionally crashing and things taking really long to load which again just highlights the point which when you buy a new laptop install a fresh copy of Windows on it so this is Doom internal running a 1080p High settings and you know this is decent performance Happening Here I then switched to Performance power mode in the windows control panel which had no impact on the power draw of the system so now we're trying out cyberpunk and this is at 1080p medium settings well again 1200p uh but I did discover in the Alienware panel a performance mode which does give us quite a bit higher wattage uh to the GPU but with a pretty huge temperature penalty we're sitting in the mid 80s now as opposed to mid 70s before and we still don't know what the graphics cards doing temperature- wise cuz we're not allowed that information but with this different performance mode we are getting quite a bit more performance so in benchmarking cyber Punk it did benefit quite a bit from the extra power uh and interestingly we're not getting much higher fan speed like it's it's not super noisy although interestingly after gaming for a while in performance mode the power draw and the frame rate slowly crep down over time until I was eventually just getting about 30 frames per second and it was pretty stuttery at this point so despite the massive booty the laptop doesn't have enough Cooling in it to sustain performance mode gaming for more than like 20 minutes at least with the fan speed it was maintaining and while loading Into The Last of Us CPU temperatures peaked at 100 C fun and with the last of us even at 1200p medium settings the game is already real unhappy about our 6 gigs of video memory but despite that and the fact that the CPU was role playing as the Sunny Side of mercury we were getting a usable result but to put that result into perspective depending on how hard the CPU was throttling at any given time I was getting similar performance to a desktop RTX 3050 6 gig variant which is not a compliment but the little alienware's averages were still higher and some quick final notes before we get to the price I like all the io on the back it keeps the sides really clean although the vents on the side does mean that you often get a lot of hot air spilled onto your hand while gaming which isn't really comfortable also the low keyboard means that you don't have quite enough Palm rest to comfortably rest your hand while gaming oh and this speakers are pretty good they're reasonably clear although they have zero base which honestly I don't mind it's better than terrible base and then finally let's get to the price well I bought this laptop from Best Buy for $1,400 Canadian which was on sale which honestly for the build quality in this kind of laptop it seems pretty good but if you buy it from Alienware it's $1,900 Canadian dollar but that's apparently on sale and according to their website it's normally $2,400 Canadian dollar which I don't I don't know that feels like a wild amount at that price it's more expensive than the Asus zephrus G14 which in my opinion is a much nicer laptop so with that let me know what you think about Alienware Laptops and if they're better than their desktop counterparts and yeah thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video watch another one a suggestion will pop up in a second subscribe to the channel and until the next one bye-bye [Music]",

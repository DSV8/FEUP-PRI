    "transcript": "This iscompletely serious video Deal? Jack? *Chuckles* Jack!! What's up, guys? Lew here back with another video and today we are checking out something very exciting. This is the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Iron Man Edition. These are incredibly limited and pretty expensive right now biatch 'cause there's not many of them out there, so they're pretty much only on eBay now, for WAY too much money. But, since I'm always bringin' you guys the latest and greatest here on unboxtherapy, you're gonna get to have the unboxing experience of this very limited phone right here! So, it starts with the packaging, as you can tell. You have this red finish with the gold, Iron-Man mask or helmet. In the corner, here, you can see: \"MARVEL: AVENGERS: Age of Ultron in cinemas now\". You have the LTE-A3 band, 64-bit octa-core processor, Quad HD display, 16-megapixel camera, 64 gigs of memory. This also comes with a clear cover and a wireless charger included. So let's go ahead and open it up. Oh, my goodness. Look at that. Would you look at that, already? Very special. Black on the inside, here. What is this? *knocks* Look at that. Solid. Oh, my goodness. So, the S6 Egde, over here. In this beautiful gold and red. The Iron-Man logo on the back. And over here, is the wireless charger. 'Little USB connector. Now this box is no joke. This is, like velour foam. Never seen velour foam before. And a little badge. \"We are greater than I.\" Woah! How 'bout the deep statement there from Marvel and Samsung. That's like us! \"We are greater than I.\" As a group. Whaddya think Jack? Next up, there's a little, clear case included. Along with the gold trim, if you wanna use it. (Just like that.) We have a SIM tool. And this box here, we have our power brick. And last up, 'have some headphones. The same as the standard S6 or S6 Edge. How 'bout the unboxing experience here though? This is the stuff that unboxers' dreams are made of. What a great way to keep all of your accessories together. Look at that... It's like when you open up a box for a fine scotch, or, uhh *Snaps* cognac. A fine cognac! But even when the bottle is empty, you put it back in there, you hold on to it. (Which way am I going to peel this off) *Peels off plastic* Just like that. Now I do have a regular S6 Edge here for comparison. There's the standard S6 Edge versus the Iron Man edition. The limited edition badge down here, which identifies this as number five-hundred and thirty-four. And also, the specialized wireless charger, where you just drop the device on there like that. And booyah, your charging. Now the case, it has an even glossier looking gold finish on it. *Blows* *Peels off screen protector* *Plastic Shaking* Okay, so now we're booted up, and as you can see, 'completely customized theme. You have a customized clock, these buttons down here, as well as the background. Obviously? \"Avengers: Age of Ultron in theaters now\". Look at this! Your apps, 's all themed up, Iron Man style. Yeah, so, here you can see the Iron Man limited edition theme is installed. 'Course, you can switch to other themes if you like why would you spend all the money on the Iron Man edition and then use a regular theme? (I dunno) But, here you can see: the home screen, the lock screen, the diallier, contacts, and messages, ofcourse. I wanna see that dialler real quick. Look a' that. Look a' that! Feel like Iron Man making a phone ca does Iron Man make phone calls? (doesn't matter) Anyway, so there you have it, the Iron Man edition S6 Edge. Very cool. Limited edition, obviously not a lot of these out there. And, the exciting part about this video is I'm not gonna keep this. Actually, I'm gonna give this away to one luck viewer, 'cause that's just how we do it! But, it's even more special than that. It's a collaborative giveaway a three way, if you will. Myself, Marques, from MKBHD, and John, From TLD, today are all combining forces. Like the Avengers, sort of. (Like how they combine forces.) Well, anyway, the three of us are gonna giving away three separate devices, three separate Iron man phones and they've all got videos on their channels right now, with the phone featured. So, all you need to do is head over there, subscribe to their channels, and leave a comment on their video in order to increase your chances at winning. The full details will also be down in the description, so if you missed anything that I said, go ahead and check that out. Alright, so there you have it, the special edition, limited edition, Galaxy S6 Edge Iron Man version. This is number five-three-four, as I mentioned before. Very exciting unboxing experience, as you can tell. And a very unique look. Plus, it's gonna belong to one of you very soon. So, make sure to leave a thumbs up down below if you enjoyed this content. Also check out those other videos from my friends from my friends that I mentioned earlier. Thanks very much for watching. Subscribe if you haven't yet, and I'll catch you on the next episode. Later, guys. *Sigh* (Man, it's always the case isn't it)",

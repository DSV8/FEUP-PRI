    "transcript": "In front of are arguably the best 13 inch Windows laptops on the market right now This is the Huawei Matebook 13 this is the Matebook X pro both kind of refreshed and brand new for 2019 Now it's easy to kind of dismiss the brand because some people said in the comments to look at these devices and they look like Macbook clones. It's clearly look like they've been inspired by Apple's designs and Huawei is a company that has a bit of a controversial past they've been caught for IP theft, and patent infringement, they don't have the cleanest record at there. However, the fact remains these devices are very good. If you're in the market for some of that thin and light with great performance, this should be on the short list. So, i'm just gonna jump into performance real quick These are running Whiskey Lake CPUs. They're quad core, they're fast and for anyone considering an ultrabook, they'll get the job done. But they're also running nVidia GPUs and that's what makes these things special cuz most ultrabooks that are thin and light like this are usually running integrated graphics These are running dedicated nVidia GPUs. They're very similar in performance despite having very different names they're not gaming GPUs but if you do wanna play some light games they will work, I'm still on the fence as value of these cards, like, on one hand they're not super powerful, of course, you can't do alot of graphically intensive stuff with it, but, if you're looking for something that's thin and light that does have graphical capabilities, these are a perfect fit. Now , I wanna talk about fans and thermals for a sec, these have upgraded fans. the 2018 models for both these devices had kinda weak thermal performance, they had loud fans, they had inappropriately sized fans, these are better but hey're still not perfect. The Matebook 13 are now running two fans, instead of one, but the Matebook X pro's still running one fan, it's an improved fan, it's better but, both of these devices still run pretty loud on load and when they're idling, I feel like the fans come on more often then I'd liked them to maybe that's something can be fixed with software and Huawei does put out software updates prettry frequently for their deivces but I just feel like these things should be quieter than they're in their current state. Now, the main difference between these two devices is their displays. this is running a 13 inch 1440p panel, the X pro's higher res' 3K by 2K and it's larger 14 inch panel but the display on the Matebook X pro is significantly brighter I think for most people they're going to be really drawn to this screen's brightness and colors. The Matebook 13's screen is already great, it's just that the Matebook X pro's that much better. In fact, if you're deciding between the two, I really feel like you should just figure out what type of screen you want or need, and then make your decision based on that because it really is the fundamental difference between the two. the Matebook 13 ha a standard webcam up top, but the X pro has the popup webcam if you haven't seen this in the past, they have a key that you can press and the webcam pops up, it's pretty cool, I don't think it's a particularly great location like when using it you can see your hands as you're typing, but i think for most people who don't use their webcams frequently, this is a great lil' addition like a kinda hidden webcam that doesn't get in your way and, the screen has a very thin bezel because of it. the port selection is relatively light on both these devices, the Matebook 13 has two USB c now there's a side supporting thunderbolt 3 and the left side can be used for charging so they're port-light device for sure, the X pro has an extra USB A and 2 USB c ports support 4 lane thunderbolt 3. the speakers on both of these laptops are very good. the Matebook 13 has located at the bottom but despite their not great location they sound really clean the speakers on the X pro are definitely better. There's two on the bottom and there's two on the top and they sound excellent. they're seriously some of the best speakers in the ultrabook market. I will say they're comparable to Macbook's speakers which are I'd say class-leading These are on par with that. AH, okay. Keyboards. These keyboards have obviously been inspired by Macbook keyboards from the past. and that's honestly a good thing These are easy to get used to, it's got a good layout, easy to type on, I think most people use these keyboards and find them comfortable to use fright away. At the top of the keyboard is a fingerprint sensor Both of these devices lets you login to the device with Windows Hello. and oh, on the Matebook X pro, there is something called Huawei Connect, I don't have the ability to use it because I don't have a Huawei phone that supports it, but if you have one, you can place that phone on the NFC sticker and it will transfer data from the phone. and you're device which is pretty cool Truthfully, I think it's a really cool and quite innovative like if this is was an Apple feature like people will go crazy for it, it's just that Huawei phones that support that feature aren't wide spread enough to make this thing like super cool but i do think it's a cool idea. Um, oh trackpad. their running Windows precision driver you have good tracking, good gesture detection, and the button mechanics on both of them are nice clean clicked There does seem to be a little of a quality control issue I think both of these devices have a lil' bit of play on the trackpad which i wished wasn't there but they exist Also other things that I'm not super fond of the Matebook 13 only supports 8 gigs of ram and it probably won't affect most people I think taht 8 gigs are sufficient for lot of work flows but you can't upgrade it to 16, the Matebook X pro and also the 14 inch version of this supports 16 but this only supports 8. The hardware on these Matebooks is excellent. there's no denying that but the pricing is a lil' bit more than what i thought would be. this comes at $1,300, this comes in at $1,900. and that's both for the dedicated graphics versions that's on par with any of the premium Windows laptops on the mark right now there is nothing wrong with that, like these are clearly premium devices but last year, this one in particular the Matebook X pro was it was like 20% cheaper than now and I think it's gone to the point where Huawei knows that their making good hardware they know they have one the best laptops on the market so they bumped up the price because they can the X pro costs more than the Razor Blade Stealth and that was already a very expensive device The Matebook lineup has great build quality the X pro does have slightly better build quality it's a unibody design so the panels are just a lil' tighter but they're both well built. Regards on people calling these clones of Apple's Macbooks I can kinda understand where they're coming from they obviously inspired this design fomr Apple's Macbook lineup, and even the color of the devices like the grey unit they call it space grey they could have called it anything they could've called it meteor grey, rock grey, storm grey but they went with space grey because that's what Apple did and that's what Huawei rolls, But these devices are excellent like they're just such good hardware that You know, I didn't make this video to be like hey, everyone should buy these devices. I'm certainly not saying that but if you're in the market for a thin and light ultrabook, that has performance like this, you should definitely look at them. Because they're that good.",

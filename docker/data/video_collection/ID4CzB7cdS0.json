    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and the 2021 Apple event just ended. And of course there's a bunch of new and awesome updates. But first I got a chance to chat with Tim cook right after the event ended so I'm so excited for you guys to check that out. I'll put a link in the description if you want to watch that after this video. We talked about the new cinematic mode in the iPhone 13, the new iPad, the new Apple Watch 7, Apple Fitness+, honestly, this was such a dream come true, so I'm still so excited. - Hi. - Hello. - How are you? - I'm doing well. How are you? - Really good, good to see you again. - Oh my gosh, you too. Thanks so much for joining this fun little interview here right after the event. Okay, so first off, let's actually talk about the event itself. If you guys watched it, this kind of felt like a pared down version of some of the last Apple events, because the last ones have been like these crazy over the top elaborate productions, which is amazing, but this one felt a little bit more like the old school live events that we're used to, like the ones that were actually live and onstage. I did really hope that one day we can return to Apple campus again, because it was seriously so much fun getting a chance to actually go there and really experiencing all of that in person. I also loved all of the amazing fly throughs that they did through California, even though I live here, just kind of getting that overview was really awesome. Now, let's get into the actual announcements. They started off by giving us a preview of Apple TV+, their fall lineup of TV shows. Now I'm so excited about The Morning Show, the second season, because the first season was honestly, one of my most favorite shows ever. Jon Stewart is also coming back to TV, I think that's something that a lot of people were not expecting, so that's super exciting. And they also announced updates to the iPad and a huge update to the iPad Mini. We also got to look at the new Apple Watch Series 7, it has an all new design, well, I guess like not all entirely new, it's kind of like an updated refresh. There's also some updates to Fitness+, and of course the brand new iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max, Can we get a little round of applause here? Just let's hear it, let's hear it for the iPhones. (cheering) - Boy, do I really hope Tyler puts in a sound effect here or everything I'm doing right now is just weird. So they updated the iPad, it's got the same design that we're used to, but now with way better performance, thanks to the A13 Bionic Chip. Can we get another round of applause for A13, let's hear it. (cheering) You'll have all day battery life and it has a new 12 megapixel ultra wide front camera with center stage for video calls. And now it also supports other accessories like the smart keyboard and the first gen Apple Pencil and it starts at only 329. And what I'm really excited about though, as I'd mentioned at the beginning of this video is the updates to the iPad Mini, but it's been awhile since this thing actually got a real refresh, but honestly this seems like so much more than a refresh. Like this seems like a whole new iPad. It has Apple's new Liquid Retina Display and now with some really thin bezels, just like the iPad Air and iPad Pro, which is so nice, especially on such a small device like this. It's also getting a massive boost in performance, there's upgrades for the camera on the front and back, USB-C connectivity. Hold up a second! Did you guys hear that correctly? Yes. The iPad mini has USB-C, it also, my friends, has touch ID on the power button. These are the things that I want in my iPhone so badly. This is actually pretty exciting if you kind of think about it because this is slowly integrating us into maybe iPhone 14 either not having a port at all, or it'll finally be USB-C powered. So the iPad Mini does come in for new colors, there's a pink, a Starlight, a purple, and a space gray. There's also some new folio covers to match and this little thing now supports the second gen Apple Pencil, which is amazing. They've packed so much into this little iPad, including 5g support, and the price is going to be starting at 499. I actually cannot wait to test out the iPad mini, just because the form factor is so small, but yet it's like a larger iPhone, but I feel like it is something that has been desperately needing an upgrade, so I'm so excited to try it out. Will I get the pink one? Well yeah, I mean, of course, like, was that even a question? Like what? So next up is the Apple Watch Series 7. You guys know that aside from my love and obsession for my iPhone, the Apple Watch is probably one of my favorite products, not just an Apple product, but product in general. I love this thing so much. It has honestly really kind of changed my life in the way that I approach fitness, because it's really helped me quantify my fitness and actually see changes as I'm progressing through my fitness. So I'm always very excited to see what the next version is going to bring. This one is more focusing on some design upgrades. It has an always on retina display with 20% more screen area than the Series 6. It's got a thinner border, which is going to allow for some really awesome UI changes to give you more space for content on the watch face. There's even going to be a full keyboard in the Apple Watch now. Like, just think about that, you're gonna have a full keyboard right here on your wrist. In addition to the design updates, there's also new support for cycling and bike fall detection. I actually started riding a bike a lot more over the last few years, so I'm very excited to test this out. It's got some enhanced dust and water resistance now and stronger crack resistant front crystal. It comes in some new aluminum case finishes, there's a midnight, starlight, a green, a new blue, and a product red. Pricing is starting at 399 and will ship in the fall. I have a question. When is fall? Like, is this early fall? Like when is the first day of fall is? Is this like, what are we talking here? Are we talking like spooky season? When is fall? Fall begins on September 22nd and ends December 20th. Like, are we talking early fall? (laughing) So along with the new Apple Watch, we also got some really fun updates to Apple Fitness+, and I am such a huge fan of Apple Fitness+, so this is really great. They've got some new workouts for Pilates and mindfulness, so you'll be able to do the meditation classes as audio only on your Apple Watch, which is really nice if you don't want to have your iPad or have some sort of distraction, you can just listen to the audio right on your wrist. There's also something new called Workout Programs. Basically these programs are designed to get you ready for a specific activity. The example they showed was winter sports and skiing, but I can imagine that these programs can be for people trading like a marathon or maybe like some bike races, or maybe even something like sports specific, like some workouts to enhance my jujitsu or maybe to enhance my lightsaber training perhaps, I don't know, it's just a thought. The other thing that they announced is actually really cool. This is a new group fitness workout feature, and it's powered by Share Play. So you and your friends can basically do workouts and hang out together. You can have up to 32 people in a group. And honestly, like I'm really hoping that I can get 32 of my tech YouTuber friends to do a group fitness class together. But I'm curious, like who would you want to see? And what class would you like us to do? Leave it in the comments below. And finally, of course, Apple has announced the brand new iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro, and 13 Pro Max. So the iPhone 13 and the iPhone 13 Mini is going to have a new sleek design with some flat edges and Apple's Super Retina XDR display. And they come in five new colors. We've got the pink, blue, midnight, starlight, and the product red. Now I do kind of wish that the pink was like a super hot pink color, but this is something that I've been waiting for for a really, really long time. Like I wanted a pink iPhone and here it is, pink, pink iPhone. So both the 13 and the 13 Mini share the same dual camera system with a new wide camera and this new feature called cinematic mode. They showed this short film that was shot entirely in this mode and it was so cool because it basically lets you rack focus, track subjects with focus, and it will automatically detect faces using algorithms and machine learning. It's actually really, really cool. You guys know that I love my iPhone accessories. There are some new MagSafe cases in matching colors and there's now even a new MagSafe leather wallet with built-in FindMy. I recently had my wallet stolen. And it's funny though, because you would think that Justine, who was so excited about these Air Tags would have had an Air Tag in her wallet or even in her bag that was taken. Did she? No, she did not. The crazy thing is I was actually using a backpack that I don't normally use because it was one that I really didn't care about as much because I was hiking and I just thought, for whatever reason, let's just throw that in the backseat, don't care, It was stolen. Its also kind of funny cause I actually tweeted something about losing my Air Pods as well and I thought it'd be really cool if the new AirPods would have FindMy integrated into them. But even though we didn't get a new AirPods at this event, the FindMy wallets will suffice, I'm actually pretty excited about that. So the iPhone 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max also got some incredible upgrades, especially in the display and the camera system. They have an all new Super Retina XDR display with pro motion, enabling adaptive refresh rate up to 120 Hertz. Now I love this so much on the iPad, so I'm so happy that Apple is finally bringing 120 Hertz pro motion to their phones. And what's great is they both have identical camera features now. All three rear cameras have gotten huge upgrades. In addition to the cinematic mode we already talked about the ultra wide camera can now do macro photos. The zoom lens is now upgraded to a three X telephoto as opposed to the 2.5 on the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Oh, and this is also super exciting, they said that later on, we're going to be able to capture and edit video in progress, this is awesome, especially if you're a final cut editor. That is something that we love. Speaking of editing and shooting a lot of content, the new 13 Pro phones will have storage options of up to one terabyte. Yeah, when they announced this, I was like, \"Yes, finally.\" I've actually filled up the storage in my 512 gig phone, so this is honestly something that I was looking forward to. I do store a lot of content in the Cloud, but the thing is when I'm shooting some of these 4k videos and then editing them down, a lot of times I'm airdropping them from my computer, like the final edited piece, to my phone and a lot of times these are really big files, so it's really great to be able to have that additional storage just in case you need it. There's seriously so much to talk about in these new phones, so I'm going to be doing a whole separate video, digging into all of the specs, all of the new upgrades, and some of the things that I wish that they had done. So be sure to keep an eye out for that and it might actually already be out. So check the link in the description and see if there's a link there. Well, that's it guys, thank you so much for watching. I will have a ton more Apple content for you, so don't forget to subscribe so you won't miss the videos, be sure to hit the bell so you'll be notified when those videos go live and like this video and leave me some comments below and let me know what you would like me to test out when I actually do get the phones in hand. I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye. (inspirational music)",

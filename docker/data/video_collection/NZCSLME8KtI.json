It seems to have everything we could want to make it the best gaming mouse too; a lightweight design, great form, new optical switches and more.  But with mice like the Glorious Model O and Logitech G Pro out there, can the ambidextrous Razer Viper win even with its higher price?

    "transcript": "well hello good people armed b-tree and welcome to my Razer Viper review surprisingly they're doing many things right with the Viper despite the slightly higher price point versus the competition and I feel like the Viper might be a strong contender and delight and complete mice the newbie quiet dark rock slim cooler offers high physical clearance for any memory module thanks to its slim heatsink and the low-profile 120ml airflow optimized fan so you get great cooling low noise easy installation and no issues for high profile RAM check it out the low alright so at $79 you're looking at the mouse with a lightweight design at 69 grams that's very important that means it's very close to the Model O but with a solid shell instead of the perforations all around and I feel like this might work and Razer's advantage in the long term because dust and other ambient particles are not entering the mouse body because this one is closed unlike with many other lightweight designs with perforations that we'll see in the future I'm not exactly sure how this will stack up you know two years down the line but when I think about lightweight mice I think about the perforated design because a final Mouse because of Model O and other mice that are entering the market and so if you see the Viper you might not necessarily think that this is a 69 gram Mouse and visually it certainly is not giving off the lightweight vibe because it kind of looks like your standard traditional Mouse now shape wise I actually preferred the Viper with its low profile and less curvy body over my model all mouse the front triggers feel very nice with proper grooves to house your fingers and the back section flares out perfectly to accommodate my pinky side and need that fat pocket under my thumb the side texture is a hard rubber it's okay for some control even with a sweaty layer while the main texture is slightly coarse with this cool transparent layer behind the logo so the illumination is very well integrated with all the RGB goodness but that's it no other illumination areas so the Model O visually is a more beautiful Mouse in my opinion the mouse feet are pretty generic which is disappointing given Model O is cheaper and has much better glide feet and you can even hear the glide difference between the two and in the bottom here we also get the DPI shift button for five profiles that are color coded and they're saved on the mouse itself this means you'll need Razer synapse to configure and access your dpi shifts if you want to customize them and then they'll travel with you and fortunately the RGB illumination color profiles are not saved onboard memory which means you'll need Razer synapse if you want to have something other than a rainbow effect cycling on the mouse which is again disappointing why wouldn't they configure some a little bit extra memory so it remembers what color profile you selected not cool so one of the advantages of the new Razer Viper is the fact that this shape is ambidextrous and just for fun we decided to use my left hand I'm usually a right hand player play against Ebor something that we wanted to do for a while in csgo 1v1 let's see who wins I'm gonna use my left hand that's actually a very comfortable shape for my left hand as well but I'm so uncomfortable aiming and let's see me get what Glorious Model O Oh oh my god this left hand gaming thing is is really coming to life this mouse is better than the model all in the right hands I feel good with the vibrator even in my left hand left hand my performance was up pretty good I would say you were how do you feel destroyed Demitri 16 Eber 3 that's okay aber you have a full year of practice you know because you have mentioned in our LTX video you can check it over here that you will challenge me 1v1 and csgo yeah the new speed Fox cable is quite flexible and light it reminds me of the G pro hero cable which is nice I'd still want to bungy toe and flatten the exit of this cable so that it doesn't have curves and is not bothering me when I'm trying to flip the primary switches are optical and that's a first for a gaming mouse as far as I know so instead of having a mechanical contact to actuate the switch we have a laser and thus no physical contact to register the clip the technical advantages here with the optical switches is there's no D bounce delay which normally happens with a mechanical switch where it filters out the certain milliseconds after the registration happens so on the optical switch is just on and off basically which is awesome and there's no way to develop double-clicking overtime that certain mice develop because of mechanical switches and we also have a 70 million click lifespan for the optical switches instead of your traditional 50 million I've never had the mouse die on me but it's sounds like because of no contact inside the switch the lifespan is increased the scroll wheel has full control with nice tactile steps and light enough middle click too and the side buttons are very flat to the body but with satisfying travel and softer actuations and finally the sensor is Razer's 5g optical 16000 dpi developed with pics art with really good accuracy no spinning out of control and surface tuning to automatically adjust lift off distance and by this point all esports targeted mice have fantastic performance and the viper fits in that category very well and actually preferred the viper shape wise over my model oh and I feel very much at home with CSgo with aim correction flicks and lifting the mouse to cover a larger mouse area the only immediate difference I feel versus the g305 or the model o are the slightly softer primary clicks that have less travel distance and have less satisfying like the click that you experience on mechanical switches and also the glide feet I mean they're not as smooth as the model o or the g305 which is disappointing considering the mouse itself is more expensive I honestly feel the Mouser have been priced at $69 to remain competitive and being more of an attractive alternative to something like the G pro that is $69 all the Model O that is $50 or the rival 310 that is also $50 but I also feel like if Razer had valued it or priced at lower than $79 it would theoretically devalue the product versus the competition in the eyes of the Razer fan base which is really strong apparently so my recommendation still stands with the model hoe that is cheaper and the feel like it's a nice compact overall package or the G Pro from Logitech at 69 bucks or the rival 310 from steel series 450 as well but if you can find the Viper for around that price points like the lower than 79 then I would say it's definitely worth it fantastic shape but the optical switches are unique and added longevity is also nice although I will say throughout my entire mice usage history I have never experienced double clicking so I guess it depends on your own history I'm too orange alright you but get out of here the new Hydra x-series from Corsair is a full water cooling ecosystem with transparent blocks for RGB goodness and built-in flow indicators with soft and hard to being available and the array of fittings so you can design the perfect loop for you hide your x-bike or sir everything's linked below all right I'm Dimitri thanks much for watching let me know if this whole lightweight movement is something that you're thinking about if you have a heavy Mouse a heavy Mouse that is something around 100 grams now but for example Michael the Viper was not for him he likes something a bit on the heavy side while eibar they haven't used the Model O for a while now I was good wait for him and I'm really happy they didn't go even lighter on the weight because if you go too light then it feels like you have no control and so 6 9 gram points is a nice light weight mark without going to light alright guys thanks much for watching I'll talk to you I just want to let you guys know that I shot the beautiful this video so I'm pretty happy about that so if you guys really don't like it you know how to blame or if you're really all about the b-roll life he's your main",

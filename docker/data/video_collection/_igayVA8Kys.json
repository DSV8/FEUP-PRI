    "transcript": "- Beep beep, beep be-deep, beep beep beep beep. - Doo doo doo doo! - Doo dooboodoo! (laughs) (honking) - This is so cute, I just opened up this box, it was like a big box, and I was like what the heck is this? And I pulled out a van. - It's really cute! - It's so cute-- - It's got like little fake stickers all over it, like, I'd rather be, oh, the door opens! - The door opens? This is incredible, so this is from Mophie. Now, wait'll you see this, Jenna. - [Jenna] Oh! No way! - Yes way. - [Jenna] No way! - Yes way. I think that they may have saw my Instagram comment because when I saw that they released what is inside of here, I freaked out. I was like (tapping) oh my God, OMG, like a real classic iJustine move. - Oh my God. - Like hyped, super hyped! - Well, what's in it? Who's got the keys to the van? - [Both] Beep beep! - Let's see what's back here? (gasps) This is where the goods are. - It's so cute and thoughtful! - Look at this. - Wanna see what's in it. - Look at this charger. - [Jenna] Oh my! - Yes. - It's beautiful! - I know, it is gold. (gasps) This thing is ridiculous. You can basically charge everything. I love that they put it in like a little camper van because this also has a little outlet so that you can like plug in your computer or other things that you would need to power with like an actual-- - Wait, this is perfect for camping. - I know. (gasps) AC adapter, baby! - [Jenna] Is this wireless? - I was just gonna say-- - Ermahgerd! - I think that's actually a wireless charger. Well, it's not on, but-- - Poosh them out-- - Help, help, help! - Poosh the button! Oh, the flashlight! - It has a flashlight? - Shook. - This is exactly what I need! What's this? (gasps) I don't even know what that is! - [Jenna] It's for the plug! - Is this to jump your car? - I wouldn't know, but we should know. (laughing) - Oh my gosh, it does, it says jump start. - Okay, this is incredible. - Okay, well, let's turn this on and just charge our basic phone. Go ahead. Put that up there. (gasps) - Ding! (clapping) - I love that this has different buttons for each section to charge. What else is in here? Oh! - Ooh, a little baggie! - No way! Plug jumper cables into your Power Station Go and attach jumper cable clamps to car battery. I was, I wasn't like joking, like I thought that's what it was for. But that's insane. - This is actually super useful, oh! It comes with it. - Oh, can you imagine? My car dies, which it has, because I actually one time left it on by accident and I didn't-- - [Jenna] For days. - It was a long time and I went out to my car and it wasn't working. - You're like, I think it's dead. - I think it's dead! That would've been great, if I'd had a Mophie then I wouldn't have had to call AAA! - [Jenna] This is genius-- - [Justine] This is unreal! - I am very much so on board with this Mophie, like, I'm probably going to be asking to borrow this because I do this under canvas a lot and I gotta BYOB. (tapping) - This is even cooler than I thought, I honestly was just into it because I thought it was a massive battery that I could just make TikToks all day long-- - Who goes there? - Oh, me! - This could also be used for lighting if you're like, you know, camping and you're like, oh, I need some lighting. - It can also be used to make TikToks, like to light yourself for TikTok. - What else we got in there? - I think that's everything, but look how cute this little van is. I think it actually is everything. Oh no, look, there's something else! - Oh! - To charge it. - To charge in the car. - We can charge this in the car and then you can use this to charge your car. Oh my goodness. - That's, you know, that's a full circle. Got a full 180. That's a 360. - Baby. - This is incredible, I'm on board. - Renegade, renegade, renegade-- - Stop that, this is-- - This is a very, very quick video because I just really wanted to show you guys how awesome this presentation is. Like, I'm shook. Absolutely. This is so insane. - It's very cute. - I can't believe I can jump my car with this. - I wish we had like a little cutout to put like a view in there. I'd probably be the driver, let's be realistic, and like put you and me over here. Oh, this part doesn't open. That's okay, it's a solo trip. - So, when AAA came out to jump my car, they couldn't find the battery and they were like, where's your battery? I said, I don't know. - Was it like a secret place? - So, I don't remember, I think it's under the passenger side seat. (clicks) It's a really great story. This is the future. You can jump your car with a Mophie battery. They have a blue, a black, a-- (gasps) A gold, a rose gold, they also have a camo one! - The blue and camo. - The camo was the one that I saw and I was like, (shrieks) that's what I was like, me. - The blue has my name all over it. - Ah, the rose gold, this is insane. The fact that this is $160 and you can jumpstart a vehicle-- - Road trip! - I can't even believe it. - Yeah, I'm excited! - Spark proof jumper cables, LED light, USB-A, 65-watt AC port, wireless charging on connect, connect and charge multiple devices. It's easy and safe to use. 44,400 megawatt hour battery, like, that's, oh my God, this is insane. - I've already started to charge it 'cause we're goin' on a road trip. - We're goin' on a road trip!

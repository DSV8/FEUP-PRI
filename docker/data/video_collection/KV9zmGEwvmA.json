    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin'? If you've seen some of my previous reviews, you may know that I like to keep cases on my mobile devices. My tablet is no exception, so this time, we're gonna take a quick look at the Power Support Air Jacket for 9.7 inch iPad Pro. [ Music - Intro ] For those familiar with the Air Jacket series, this one'll feel very familiar. Power Support sent me the clear version to check out. One of the goals of this case is to provide protection that's thin and light, and the Air Jacket really excels in this regard. It doesn't really add any noticeable bulk or weight to the iPad. Yet, at the same time, the case feels solid and sturdy. That's largely due to the excellent fit that it offers. The dimensions are just right. The iPad fits snug and all of the cutouts are in the right places. Previous models of the Air Jacket came in two varieties: one with the cutout for the Smart Cover and one without. There's only one version for the iPad Pro this time around, and it's compatible with both the Smart Cover and Smart Keyboard. The clear version of this case does a surprisingly good job at resisting scratches, though it does tend to pick up fingerprints and can occasionally feel slippery. If you're concerned about grip, it also comes in a black rubberized finish with a soft matte texture. Something I really like is that Power Support includes one of its AFP Crystal screen protectors in the box. The film is high quality and reasonably easy to install. Like the case, it does a decent job at resisting scratches, and as you'd expect, it doesn't interfere with the operation of the touch screen, including use of the Apple Pencil. So overall, the Air Jacket for iPad Pro continues in the tradition of its predecessors. Being a thin case, if you're really clumsy with your devices, you may wanna look for one that's a bit more rugged. But for everyday protection that doesn't get in the way, the Air Jacket is a solid option. Big shoutout and thank you to Power Support for sending an Air Jacket my way to review. I'll include a link down in the description if you're interested. If you like this video, I'd appreciate a thumbs-up and be sure to subscribe if you haven't already.

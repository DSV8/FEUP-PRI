Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter -  Follow me on Instagram -   Apple has undergone a number of transitions in the past. In the early 90s, they moved from Motorola's 68k platform to IBM's PowerPC architecture. For a few years, Apple made the fastest personal computers on the planet. But PowerPC had a number of issues and Apple was forced to move to Intel in the mid 2000s. It was a good transition and helped the Mac a lot, but it's now time for Apple to transition once again leaving Intel, AMD, and the x86 architecture in the dust. Hello, ARM. The new Apple-made custom chips for Mac could be a game-changer and could make Apple exciting again. Battery life would improve, thermal throttling could disappear, and the chips could obliterate the competition thanks to application-specific hardware and a software stack to match.",

    "transcript": "Close your eyes and picture something with me for a second. Come on close em. Its September 1999. The air is brisk with dog days nearing their end as Im driven by my mum to my new elementary school to continue my second month of first grade. I enter the new, staggeringly spotless computer lab at my school and my eyes glisten with excitement upon seeing an entirely fictitious Power Mac G4 because this entire story is made up. I press power, hear the famous Macintosh boot chime, and realize this computer is going to change everything. Theres a lot of hubbub about Apple ditching Intel and the x86 platform in favor ARM (which is the instruction set Apple has been using on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AppleTV since inception (okay, so the first AppleTV wasnt ARM but we dont talk about that (or should we talk about that? I still have mine from 2007lemme know in the comments below if you want to see a video on that)). With this rumored transition to ARM on Mac, Apple would presumably develop custom-designed processors just like the iPhones A-series chips, but specific to the Mac. I think a lot of people believe Apples innovation has flattened out or that theyre not trying anymore. People said this very same thing in the late 90s but Apple proved them crazy wrong by developing the fastest home computer on the planet that absolutely crushed any Windows Intel machine from the era. Back in 1991-1993, Apples chip architecturewhich had been in use since the original 1984 Macintoshwas aging rapidly. Their Macintosh lineup was still wicked fast and running on the 68k family of microprocessors, but they were becoming bulkier, hotter, and more expensive than ever before. Apple was trying to squeeze as much processing power out of the old technology as possible and it showed. Wintel computers (thats a Windows-Intel computer btw) were less expensive, far more efficient, and were catching up in the speed department. Apple CEO John Sculley had commissioned an internal project called jaguar to develop a new four-core RISC-based CPU designed to succeed the Motorola 68K chips. But this would mean no backwards compatibility for old software and without the market share to force people into the new machine, theyd have created a platform that died before it was born. And in the 80s, Steve Jobs had already made this error with Lisa an insanely powerful computer that was made useless due to the lack of software. Luckily, a veteran engineer at Apple, Jack McHenry, saw the new, incompatible computer was doomed to fail and started the cognac team. Long story short (and it really is a very cool story), McHenrys team developed a RISC-based machine that was able to run old Macintosh 68K software with essentially full compatibility thanks to an incredible hypervisor emulator (it was one of the first computers ever to do this well by the way) and the PowerPC was born. For over 10 years, Apple was making hardware with an extensive software library that absolutely obliterated any Wintel machine in its path. In fact, that 1999 G4 I mentioned at the beginning of the video was the first personal computer with a gigaflop of performance and it made such a mockery of Intels Pentium III system in terms of the operationat over 2x the speed in many workloadsthat it was actually less expensive to own and operate over time than even the best Intel PCs. The PowerPC architecture, like the 68K platform before it eventually met its demise and Apple, well [insert Jobs clip] Intel CPUs were more efficient per watt, ran far cooler than PowerPC, and showed far more forward facing potential. And it was a good move for numerous reasons. Sharing an x86 platform between Windows and Mac made apps more easy to port between systems, allowed the Mac to run Windows natively through Boot Camp, permitted the Mac to integrate into the business and enterprise market for the first time ever, allowed for increased system stability, and more. But it also came with some huge drawbacks: Apples hardware advantage that existed with PowerPC was gone. Apple was a systems builder and moving to off-the-shelf parts limited Apples design capabilities; it required that all performance benefits be made in software optimization since the hardware was the same as everything else on the market, the hackintosh market flourished with reverse-engineered and custom EFI kernels, and Apple became beholden to Intels update cycle. So ARMwhy would Apple care to move to it? And why should you care? 1. Apple can continue its quest of vertical integration and supply chain control. Apple wont be waiting on Intel to release new products and we wont be waiting on Apple to integrate those new Intel products. . It allows Apple to have a unique market offering. Nobody else (at least, not for a while) will be making flagship ARM computers. Microsoft has attempted albeit unsuccessfully in part because they require backwards compatibility and enterprise support (both of which Apple has a history of disregarding). . Unit cost decreases. Intel is a ripoff because they own an essential monopoly and while AMD is giving them a run for their money, theyre still the defacto supplier of enterprise hardware and the prices reflect that. The tray price of the dinky little 8-core Xeon in the new Mac Pro is $749. Thats insane. In theory, Apple could reduce the price of their machines and become cost-competitive with low-margin PC manufacturers but with better hardware. Would modern Apple do that? I hope so, but they almost might maintain pricing and just increase their margins. . The hardware may truly be better. If Apples current silicon is anything to go off of, theyve demonstrated extreme proficiency in chip design and they continue hiring some of the best SoC engineers in the world. I dont think thats a coincidence. Now, dont expect a complete transition to happen on day one. Steve Jobs said in the 2005 Macworld keynote that moving from PowerPC to Intel would take a few years and Apple actually got it done faster than expected, but Id expect the same for ARM Macs. This new Catalyst project, which ports iOS apps to x86 Macs is a great way for Apple to test emulation and app compiling and allows developers to get comfortable with the Swift coding language. It also allows customers that own existing x86 processors to run most of the software that will be available on ARM Macs for a smooth transition over to different platforms. . It will pretty much kill-off hackintosh computers even though Apple probably doesnt care about as much as people think they do. . In theory, it will allow for much better battery life as the RISC-based system will be more efficient and generate less heat. Maybe we can finally say goodbye to thermal throttling on Apple comptuers. . There are potentially massive security benefits. . There could be multi-platform app purchasing since the OSes will share similar code bases. So you buy an app on your iPhone and it works on the iPad and Mac as well. And if all the platforms are easy to develop for, the number of quality Mac apps should skyrocket. I could go on. And thats not to say that this thing doesnt have potential downsides. There definitely are. Its a huge gamble for Apple with exponential increases in R&D with no guarantee for return and at the end of the day, Apple is liable to its shareholders. Theyll have to maintain a competitive edge on x86 and Windows ARM machines and continue innovating for years to comethey cant rely on Intel to do the work for them. Apple also may erroneously seek power over compatibility and if the Catalyst transition isnt a smooth one, things might be buggy for a number of years, etc. But I think this future is brighter than it is dull. I hope that Apple can ditch the often-accurate stigma that theyve become anti-consumer, overpriced, and incapable of innovating. There are people out there that dont even know Apple used to make the fastest computers in the world. And as a life-long Mac user, Im hoping Apple will finally live-up to Phil Schillers famously smug and unfulfilled words.",

    "transcript": "- I've slaved away making this tech news for you. And so you will eat it. Full reviews are finally up for AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X3D, which the company hyped as the world's fastest gaming processor when they announced it at CES. Well, a lot can happen in a few months. Intel understandably felt the little threatened by team reds bravado, and launched the Corei9, 12900KS in that time. And according to Anthony's benchmarks, it usually matches or it slightly exceeds the 5800X3D performance, but it's MSRP's also $800, while AMD's contender is just 450, just 450. On the other hand, it's not really overclockable. A fact that has led enthusiast like YouTuber Buildzoid to post 20 minute rants. On the other hand, another YouTuber, Scatterbencher, actually did manage to overclock the chip's base clock using a bunch of tweaks but those aren't really feasible for the average gamer like you. Look how strikingly mediocre you are. - [Anthony] Is that an insult? - So we're left with the other, other, other hand, which says that you should watch LTT's full review if you're still confused, and also listen to Anthony's sweet, sultry voice. - [Anthony] That's mean. - Put them in your headphones, fall asleep. - (bleep) you Riley. The saga of Elon Musk versus Twitter is the story that just won't die, which is the favorite of story for Elon, especially after the world's richest man put it in an offer yesterday to buy all of Twitter shares for $43 billion, an exaggeration of the company's value according to its current share price, which itself is inflated from since Elon got involved at all. But can you really put a price on troll farming? Seems like Twitter's board members aren't keen on Musk scooping up their company though and have executed what's known as a poison pill maneuver. Inserting said pill into a drone and flying it over to your butt. It's a contingency plan that can block hostile takeover attempts by restricting certain shareholders from buying more than 15% of the company shares, and allowing another shareholder to buy more stock if an outsider like Musk tries to get around the rules. Musk seems to be relying on the FCC to see his position as more reasonable here, which would probably be a better strategy if he hadn't flaunted their rules multiple times to pump and dump stock. Burning bridges, Elon. Look, Twitter is a caged bird and Musk just wants to set it free. He wants to edit that cage, so it has no door. It may poop on some cars we're but it's worth it. Free speech! And after Meta confirmed that it would take a nearly 50% cut of transactions in its Horizon Worlds Metaverse platform, Apple of all entities called them out for their hypocritical criticism of the default 30% cut Apple takes on the App Store. But wait, said Meta CTO, Andrew Boz Bosworth, they're going to release a web version of Horizon that just takes 25%. Since those transactions would be happening outside of the Quest VR ecosystem. A figure that Boz noted was significantly smaller than other similar world building platforms, like Roblox, which leaves developers with around 28.1% of their total revenue, which is less than 100%. Now we just need Roblox to throw it to Google and we'll have a real tech giant standoff over who takes slightly more money away from developers, proving nothing, except we probably need anti legislation like now. - [Anthony] Get on it. - Riley. - [Anthony] Okay, I'm trying. - Now it's time for the quick bits brought to you by NZXT and the new function keyboards, which are the perfect entry point into the mechanical key keyboard community. You don't have to jump right in to a hundred dollars key caps, that's for later. The function keyboard comes in 10 key list, mini 10 key list, pretty cool, and full size models. If you love a num pad. And the standard units with Gateron red key switches and white and black colorways are, dare I say, pretty minimalist, nice and sleek. But countries with NZXT Build can choose from five different kinds of switches and a variety of color options for a custom look to match your desk. Plus every keyboard comes with hot swappable switch socket, a detachable USB C cable and RGB lighting, baby. So get your NZXT function keyboard today using the link below. I'm putting an offer to buy 9.2% of the quickbits, which is the controlling sake. I just wanna protect them. The Ethereum Cryptocurrency Network is once again delaying its transition to proof of stake, which has long been promised as a solution to the heavy energy demands imposed by crypto mining proof of work. The latest estimated window for the rollout was June, which is already months away from now, but core develop Tim Beiko, confirmed on Twitter that proof of stake will happen likely in a few months after that. No firm date yet, but we're definitely in the final chapter of proof of work on Ethereum. Definitely this time for real. We can only hope that the transition doesn't lead to situations like the one in which the guy that paid $2.9 million for Jack Dorsey's first tweet ever, can't sell it for more than a few thousand bucks despite wanting to sell it for 48 million. That's largely unrelated to this story, it must be. I just thought it was funny. A popular windows 11 mod, called Windows Toolbox, that allowed users to de blow the OS and install the Google Play Store was also installing something else, malware, most evil kind of ware. - [Anthony] Surprise, surprise. - Yeah, it turns out it was a Trojan the whole time, so GitHub has removed the tool. Let this be a lesson to you, always follow Microsoft's directions and only browse the web with Edge. This would've never happened otherwise. - [Anthony] Chrome basically is a virus. - Apple Oracle Mark Gurman has posted a Bloomberg report detailing nine upcoming Macs, featuring the next gen M2 processor, including a MacBook Air, a Mac Mini with 10 graphic score configurations, a MacBook Pro and a Mac Pro with also some other cores. This is all unconfirmed leaks anyway, the takeaway is that Apple apparently won't just keep releasing versions of the M1 with new suffixes. On one Omnicron. - [Anthony] M1 Big Boy. - A group of researchers recently created a prototype quantum memristor, which could pave the way for highly efficient neural networks utilizing non-volatile... Volatile? Non-volatile storage to specialize in specific quantum computing tasks. I don't really know what that means, but I'm hoping that it involves carbon nano tubes. - [Anthony] I think so. - And more accurate weather predictions. And the Elden Ring community is celebrating a legendary player known as, Let me solo her, so named because they appear as a summon before one of the game's toughest bosses, Malenia, Blade of Miquella. What am I reading? I don't play Elden Ring. Anyways, the player fights her alone wearing nothing but a pot on their head. The mysterious figure, who apparently goes by Kline Sueboy on Reddit and YouTube is now being depicted in fan art. So I guess Elden Ring is an okay game after all. - [Anthony] I'm still not gonna play it, but I just liked it. - And this was an okay episode, but guess what? Monday will be even better. So come back then for more tech news and prove that you love me, dammit. - [Anthony] A different intro, we did a different intro. - Okay. - [Anthony] They should still do it.",

    "transcript": "(lively music) - What you are looking at right now is the hottest, most beautiful laptop that I have held in a very long time but that does not mean that you should buy it. This is the Galaxy Chromebook. So the Galaxy Chromebook comes out some time in the first quarter of this year and it starts at $999 which is a lot of money for a Chromebook but before we get into that value proposition, I just wanna take a little bit of time to appreciate this amazing hardware. It has a 13.3-inch 4K UHD AMOLED display that starts with eight gigs of RAM and 120 gigs of storage which is pretty good for a Chromebook. It should be good for about eight hours of battery life and most importantly, it has an Intel 10th Gen Core i5 processor. This thing has more than enough processing power to run Chrome OS. Plus, I mean, just look at this thing. This color that you're seeing here is called Fiesta Red and it is very intense. It also comes in a really boring gray color if you're a really boring person. Go for it if you want to. There are bezels on the top and the sides but they're super, super thin. You can barely see them and there is a webcam up there too so good job on that. The thing is under 10 millimeters thick which is pretty incredible and it's also a two-in-one so it folds all the way around, it's built out of aluminum, it feels like really good build quality except for a little bit of wobble on the screen. That 999 that you're paying is for this level of quality and hardware. So let's go back to that screen for just a minute because it really is the centerpiece of this laptop. It's AMOLED and Samsung says that it can reach HDR 400 but you should know that you're not gonna get that everywhere because a bunch of HDR content is locked behind weird DRM and Chrome OS has to get updated for it. Whatever. It looks really, really beautiful. It is, of course, a touchscreen and this think has a stylus. It's inside a little garage so you can pop it out and so you can draw with it and that works about as well as it does in any other Chrome oS device which is to say fine. Really, my only complaint about this screen is that it's 16 by nine which I don't personally like but it seems like that's what every laptop is doing these days so whatever. In terms of ports, it's pretty standard for Chromebooks. There's two USB-C ports and it does have a micro-SD card slot for expansion. There's also an eight-megapixel camera on the deck of the keyboard so you can use it as a camera in tablet mode if you really want to. Speaking of the deck, we should talk about the keyboard that's on the deck. This thing is only 10 millimeters thin and so the keyboard doesn't have much room to move so there's only, I don't know, I think it's 1.2 millimeters of key travel which sounds bad up it feels okay. The important thing is that Samsung is using traditional scissor switches so it shouldn't run into the same problem as the Macs and the butterfly keyboard and when I was typing on it, it didn't sound all that loud. Again, the really only problem I noticed was that it made the screen wobble a little bit. The think about Chrome OS is that 90% of people can do 90% of what they need 90% of the time but it's that other 10% that's the problem and until Google can start filling in that gap, this Galaxy Chromebook is gonna remain a niche product, a very pretty niche but still a niche. Hey, thank you so much for watching. We're obviously at CES 2020 and we're running around like crazy pointing cameras at everything we can possibly think of and so please keep it locked to the Verge to see more of the stuff that we point cameras at.",

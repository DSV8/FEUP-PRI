    "description": "More info on the Dyson 360 Eye -  Sponsored by Dyson  I had the chance to check out the brand new Dyson 360 Eye robotic vacuum. This thing sees and maps your space in 360 allowing it to travel efficiently throughout the room. The 360 Eye also features \"tank tracks\" rather than wheels allowing it to travel seamlessly over various surfaces. Why vacuum when a robot can do it for you?  From the manufacturer -  Twice the suction of any Robot vacuum*. The Dyson 360 Eye robot is a powerful vacuum cleaner first and foremost with the Dyson digital motor V2 inside to deliver powerful suction and Radial Root cyclone technology to capture microscopic dust and dirt. The Dyson 360 Eye robot sees its environment using a 360 vision system allowing the robot to clean intelligently, moving in an efficient, systematic pattern. With the Dyson Link app, available on IOS or Android, you can control, schedule and analyze your robot wherever you are. With a full-width brush bar with carbon fiber filaments, it can thoroughly and efficiently clean in a single pass. And, with continuous tank tracks, it is engineered for accurate maneuvering over all floors. * suction testing based on ASTM F558, dust-loaded against Robot market.

    "transcript": "So I received this really fancy looking box from the folks at Dyson they claim to have the next innovative thing in vacuuming But this one is obviously different, You can tell from the box and the scale of it. *knocking* Ooooh! The 26th Dyson 360 Eye to enter the US 26th?! We could've done better. Where's number 1? 26th is pretty good, I'm just k- We are looking at a robotic vacuum. The is the start of a new and hopefully fantastic journey. into the world of robotic servants. *Laughing Out Loud* You're making a statement with this guy rolling around your house. The 360 Eye Right on the top here It has a 360 degree camera Looking, Peeking around your space.. Drawing Out a map A path for how to efficiently clean up your mess And I know you got one And there is this incredible intelligence, internally using complex mathematics to map that all out. Is the thing, gonna suck up dirt! Crumbs, chips, popcorn 78,000 RPM! The motor is spinning at 78,000 RPM! Holy smokes Carbon fiber filaments I mean, these guys, they kind of make a vacuum look like a sports car! Like when you look at that Jack, on the front there. Look at that! Serious piece of machinery! Whoa ho ho! It's like a mini tank! Look at that! It says tank tracks! I mean, who really wants to vacuum, if a robot can do it for you? Am i right? Whoa. We have a very sleek looking power supply What is this? How does this work? Oh! It's a little charge station So that fits up against the wall there, and your little guy... Oooh So this plugs into the wall The Dyson see it, he just scoots over here. Sits down Grabs himself some juice And then gets back to work Unbelievable! From the app, I'm assuming you can schedule cleaning days Contact points, on the bottom of it Right on there A little touch that I really like The power cable Can go on either side Why don't more more companies do that? Hit this button here and I have the app over here on my device WWWHHHHOOOAAAAAAA!!!! Dude! WOO! WOO! Easy boy It sees the edge! It sees the edge of the table, and would not go off Here ya go, tough guy Let's see what you got, tough guy! WHOA!! This is insane! 'Cause this table... If he dips off the edge of this table... He's gone! He's a goner! Whoa ha ho ho ho ho I feel so satisfied for it, when it grabs a chunk of dirt Like, well done! Well done buddy! (Clapping) What can i say about this little guy? I put him in a tough position here Impending doom on the other side of each edge and without a doubt... it was able to stop and see that it was going to fall off A robotic vacuum? Are you kidding me? If I was like, 13 years old and my mom is like Hey Vacuum downstairs again! I'm like, ya know what? I'm saving my lunch money I'm putting the Dyson down there So what do ya think about that, ma?",

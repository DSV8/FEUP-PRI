    "transcript": "now I want to try this new PC gaming thing but I'm not sure where to buy my computer from H I could but no these guys advertised on Sports so I got to do this [Music] one temu has finally gotten into the very lucrative Market of flogging pre-builts fish out of the Pacific Garbage Patch to people who don't know any better now what's interesting about these PCS aside from the market apparently being dominated by one brand stier Brun which I guess sounds vaguely German maybe in an attempt to invoke an idea of quality I don't know anyway the very vaguely speced system that I bought for a hair under $700 Canadian dollars was actually shipped by Amazon and you can also buy them from the Jeff ster which did mean that it shipped very quickly but it kind of seems like these two companies are just fishing all of the crap they pedal out of the same massive pit but anyway with that let's have a look at the system now other than that tear which may or may not have been caused by one of us the box is in pretty good condition now in terms of peripherals I got a decent bit more than I bargained for so aside from the standard e-waist mouse and keyboard you even get an RGB like Soundbar thing with it that's pretty cool it's like a whole gaming setup aside from a monitor and if that wasn't enough you even also get an RGB mouse pad and all of this stuff is from the wildly famous stug bro the actual system comes packaged in some lovely soft packing foam so it should be able to survive even the most violent Amazon delivery person now the initial presentation will have any 14-year-old frothing at the mouth not only do you get more stuff than you were expecting you get a white case with a whole bunch of fans in it that look like they've been repurposed from tain's personal grill collection and from First Impressions it doesn't quite look like an old Optiplex with a gt710 stuffed in it so that's already put it above my expectations although when you start looking closer the cracks begin to show not only is the PC so light that it feels like they forgot to put half of the system in it the USB configuration makes it look like we traveled back to 1972 the graphics card has one of these bad boys a DVI port something we haven't seen on a new graphics card in a while so I'm curious to see what GPU were working with and not to be too hasty with my judgment but the power supply looks a bit like Isis had a hand in developing [Music] it wait why is that so dirty and with that mystery unsolved I gracefully struggled to remove the foam bit revealing the system underneath now first off aside from the tiny little growth of of a PC inside what's already not a very big case but this is a reasonably wellp put together system we've got some cables going to places that make sense there was even some zip tie action used over here and we've got a proper Ram configuration yay but generally putting a system together with these parts I couldn't do a much better job so you know kudos to temu in terms of specs graphics card wise we get some form of the G TX 1660ti which at 1080p should be a decent Graphics Cod however again like with the outside there are a couple of slightly concerning signs we've got an LGA 1150 CPU in here so it's probably going to be some form of quad core which is not ideal and the CPU Cooler looks like some OEM crap that's just developed an MDMA clubbing habit but that's not much of a problem because there is a lot of airf flow going on here we've got what looks like good ventilation and a whole bunch of teain fans rear cable management was also acceptable but I had to remove the power supply to see what kind of detonation risk we had okay so it's a 500 W power supply by vaguely German sounding brand and um I don't know let me go Google what this is a quick Google didn't reveal any additional information about it so for safety I'm just going to assume it's an IED at which point I reassembled the system and turned my attention to the peripherals wow I've seen this mouse so many times this is just slap your own brand on it RGB Mouse the keyboard's the same thing I think I own about seven versions of this exact keyboard it's like E-Waste the keyboard although the Soundbar is definitely a unique touch I'm sure we're going to get some pristine audio out of this thing uh on the top we've got some physical buttons on the back we've got ways to plug this into our system and then we also get two ways to plug it in although I'm guessing this is power and this is audio but we'll we'll we'll check it out oo wow we even get a splash screen now in terms of venial disease other than what looks like Spanish Microsoft Office there isn't really anything on this system which for this kind of offbrand pre-built is pretty standard okay now CPU wise we've got a 4770 in here which is a very old C CPU it's a quad core 8 thread chip and it it should do okay especially when paired with a 1660 TI but I think in more demanding games this may be an issue and it also means there's no upgrade path other than the K variant of this CPU we've pretty much maxed out what the socket has to offer so if you buy this system you're stuck with an 800-year old quad core and then our 16 gigs of DDR 3 is in dual Channel but it's just running at the base speed like we're some kind of fil casual and then we get a 500 gig boot SSD so with that let's try gaming on it now loading into CS2 a 1080p lad the first thing that I've noticed is that there's no sound uh so I'm guessing you can't just use USB to connect it you do actually have to use the uh the Orcs Port so I'll connect that in a bit in terms of frame rate this is low settings but native 1080p I mean 120 frames per second is not what I was expecting and it it kind of dips to about 100 every now and then because there's clearly something weird going on if you look at what's what's happening there we're just getting about 40% utilization on both the CPU and the GPU now putting that aside if you don't see the number it does feel decent like this is very much a usable gaming experience although there is the occasional stutter and dippy going on oh that's a grenade dropping the end resolution hasn't done anything the frame rate is just the same I then brought up CPU utilization for all of our threads just to see that CS2 is putting most of the load on just one core which despite the not abysmal single-threaded performance of the 4770 that's clearly not great for gaming performance and I think that combined with the limited memory bandwidth of our loser DDR3 memory configuration is why everything seems bottlenecked but let's see what happens with more moding games but first I had to plug in the Soundbar oh wow that is a wildly terrible speaker okay maybe wildly Terribles only fair at higher volumes where Distortion Creeps in Fast and hard if you keep the volume at about 70 DB measured from half a meter it sounds possible it's reasonably clear and there isn't any glaring accentuations in any of the frequency response none of that wild overblown Basse that you get in cheap headsets for example although I do find the strobing RGB distracting and it's a weird choice to include with a gaming PC cuz how are you going to use it to shout at strangers on the internet also it's a soundbar so you have like no directional audio which is kind of useful in video games the mouse and keyboard are about as bad as you'd expect the mouse really struggles to track smoothly and the keyboard has this fun party trick in case you didn't catch that every time you press a key the entire keyboard rattles like an 85-year-old falling down a flight of stairs and then finally when it comes to the mouse pad it didn't come included with the micro USB cable it needs for power so I didn't see what the RGB looked like on it but it's so tiny that I immediately had to get rid of it when playing DOTA anyway with that back to the gaming performance ooh cyber Punk at 1080p high is actually using more of the system although we are skirting up against against a CPU bottleneck it kind of depends oo it kind of depends on the scene what's happening around us but yeah they kind of hand off between the two of them so yeah I mean I guess that means it's a it's a good pairing they they they hold up together well temperatures are also very good especially considering that it's like 800 C in the room I'm in at the moment so yeah that's good not surprising at all though we don't have very high power draw components and we basically have a fully mesh case with a bunch of tain's Grill in it ooh well the last of us at 1080p medium is giving us similar performance to cyberpunk at 1080p high so yeah this system is perfectly usable for even more demanding games these days and medium still looks good although if you look at the frame time graph it is a bit choppy and you can definitely feel it it's not the smoothest experience ever so at the end of the day the temu Amazon system was quite a bit better than I was expecting although I was kind of expecting a system that was just going to jump out at me and lay eggs in my face when I opened the box so it's not a super high bar to clear to be honest but instead you're getting a system that for the price could have been a lot worse uh so let me know what you think about it in the comment section down below uh I do want to do a follow-up video where I upgrade the temu system using wish parts I think that should turn out out pretty well and yeah with that thank you for watching subscribe to the channel for a complimentary sense of self-satisfaction and until the next video bye-bye [Music]",

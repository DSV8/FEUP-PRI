    "transcript": "- Gentlemen, y'all looking real, oh no, is that another toaster, is it? Is it not another toaster? - [Kinsey] No, it's just bread. - Hello and welcome to \"Mystery Tech.\" Today I eat bread. On \"Mystery Tech,\" we have had a prodigious history of some truly spectacular toasting apparati, but today we're taking it up a notch with whatever's in this box. - If you ignore like the normal categories of like laptop, cell phones, consoles, the number one category of \"Mystery Tech\" product by a long shot is toaster. - I don't think that that's wrong. Yeah. This really the way you ship it, is just in like a plastic bag. I feel like- (Matt laughs) Is there a reason why? - [Matt] Keep, keep, keep going. - [Ken] Oh. (laughs) - [Matt] Keep going. - What? (Matt and Ken laugh) This will burn my face into toast? - [Matt] Yeah, baby! Finally, something as white as you. - It's already been toasted! (all laugh) I'm already in here. - [Matt] That has been there for the hottest of minutes. - So this is a medium rendition and this is the... (laughs) If you'd like the lighter version or the darker version, well, boy, oh, boy, we got you covered. - [Kinsey] Do you want a new sleep paralysis demon? - In case you're curious. - On the front. - This is the Austin toaster. Just in case you forget what it's supposed to look like. Wait a minute, the bread don't fit. - [Kinsey] Is it too thick? - It's slightly too thick. So we got one to seven. I'm gonna say two and a half. (all laugh) Oh, it doesn't work. No, it doesn't, it doesn't go down. This is the only good reason to ever take the toast off your bread. Also, wow, that smells bad. It smells like, have you ever been like a really old ship? You know, you got a little bit of that like, sort of limey sea air and the general smell of rust and... - [Matt] What are you a pirate now? - Arr! Ah, (quacks) what's that? - [Kinsey] Do you want a plate? - What? What? - [Joanna] That's pretty accurate. - Joanna asked me if I was having a stroke and I said it was hard to tell with how much toast they make around here. (Ken and Austin laugh) - I think that this is gonna be significantly darker 'cause it's been in there for at least 20 minutes now. - [Ken] Yep. (Ken and Kinsey laugh) - I was just poking my head to take a look. - [Matt] Okay, that was, it's not quite... Don't drop the Austin. - There we go. Oh, it actually kind of stands on its own. Look at that. - [Matt] As he props it up against it. - Kind of stands on its own actually. (Ken laughs) - Wow! - So this one's a little, lack of definition. - [Matt] Looks like you're bleeding from the eyes. - But this one though, this is pretty good, right? How much was this delicious toaster? - [Kinsey] So you would say that like, if you got just the base toaster at Walmart, you'd say it's about 15 bucks, right? Well, add a zero. It's 150. (all laugh) - [Matt] I just like how absolutely scorched back of it gets. - Yeah. - Oh my god. - [Austin] That's not good toast. - It is not good toast. - So I think the problem is, is that for them to get any kind of actual like sort of toasting on the front part of the bread, it has to actually burn the back because the way I understand this is, is just a normal toaster with an extra little plate added, which blocks like half the heat. Well, this might be a hilarious gag to give someone as a gift. I will say that it is not worth $150 for creepy Austin. What is Dry Studio? - [Matt] You should know this already. - Okay, Dry Studio. Let's open up Dry Studio. Black Diamond 75. The world's first leaf spring gaming keyboard. I am familiar with the leaf spring type suspension often used in trucks. I'm not familiar with that in a keyboard. Their website is dry---studio.com. Y'all, did you really, you couldn't get drystudio.com so you had to add three hyphens? - [Ken] That's pretty. - Oh my god, that is a chunker of a keyboard. Holy. Oh wow, look at the carbon. - [Ken] Wow. - Holy guacamole, batman. Okay, you gotta gimme a second here. So we've got a, what looks to be maybe real carbon. I'm not sure, but if it's not, it looks quite convincing. Clear acrylic around the actual keyboard. I see a number of these, I'm assuming leaf springs on the inside. It's also got more carbon fiber on the sides. And then on the back we have a USB-C. I think there's nothing else to do besides unleash the beast. Creamy, like cream corn. Creamy, like cream cheese. Creamy, like creamy peanut butter. The second best version of peanut butter. - [Ken] Wait, what? - I'm not like amazed with these buckling springs. Like it doesn't, it's not like it's like the most amazing... - [Ken] You keep saying buckling springs, but I don't think it's buckling springs. - No, it's not. It's definitely not, right? - [Alex] I mean the leaf spring part is more about typing comfort than it is about like gaming, you know, aptitude or anything like that. And so they specifically made this because they were inspired by Lamborghini, the Aventador, Mansory Carbonado, which is known as the black diamond. So that is, they basically made that for that. - This spacebar, maybe it's just the way I type. I'm getting some double taps on the spacebar. It's very light. Like you could almost like, sort of like little, just little, little fingertip action here. Please elaborate me, illuminate me if you will, how much is the Black Diamond 75? - [Alex] It retails for 300. We got for it 280. - Okay. - [Alex] And if you don't need all the carbon fiber, all whatever, you can still get the keyboard part for like as low as 240. - It's actually not crazy. Now I will tell you, I maybe am not the hugest fan of the aesthetic of this. I think the carbon fiber and the acrylic is very- - I agree, it looks like a $20 keyboard. - Hey, bring it closer to the jury. - He doesn't know what he's actually doing. - Actually, well, actually, hold on, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Oh, now he took out the AirPods. - No, no, no, no. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. - Doesn't take up the AirPods while we're shooting a video. Oh, that is nice. - No, there's actual pinging in there. - It's not like egregiously priced. I mean look, 280 bucks, 300 bucks for a keyboard is obviously like luxury territory. But like, I'll be real. If you get into the real, real high end of custom keyboards, $300 is actually not that expensive. You can spend significantly more, especially when you get like custom key caps and all this kinda stuff. I think it's a pretty unique experience. The leaf spring, I'm not gonna tell you exactly how much that makes a difference. It's hard for me to say. You really gotta be sold on this aesthetic and I'm not. - [Matt] What's the thing you use the most? - Z Flip. - [Ken] Which is? - A phone. - There you go. What is our body made out of on the inside? - Stardust. - [Ken] What is a structure of our- - Bone. - Okay, so combine those two words together. - Boney phone. - So close. - So close. - Why? What am I? Alright, I'm just gonna open the thing. I'm just gonna open the thing. It's usually not a good sign when there's newspaper wrapping. This usually means something from like Etsy. Leelanau County drivers wear seat belts. The Bone Fone. - [Alex] You are the proud owner of the bone phone. - [Ken] That sounds like the distant relative/cousin to the booty call. (all laugh) - [Alex] That is a product that came out in 1979. - [Austin] It looks like it. It looks like it. So, okay, so now I need to hold, I see. - [Ken] Oh, I though that was wrapping. Wait, that's the thing? - This is the Bone Fone. (Ken laughs) So on this side we have power and then low to high tone. On this side we have FM/AM and then stereo mode. And it's also has these like two little like, metal prongs on the bottom. Yeah, I will say, if this is really from like the seventies, it don't smell like more than 20 years old. This fabric is in good shape, so I'm guessing I just listen the radio. - [Matt] You're boning right now. - Boy, didn't think I'd be doing that on one o'clock on a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday morning. - [Alex] What is your least favorite type of headphone or earbud? - Bone conduction. Wait, this is actually bone conduction. - [Alex] Yes, that is one of the first instances of bone conduction here. - From the seventies? - Get out of here. - Really? - So do I just do this? - No, you had it right, around your neck. - Oh, okay. We'll see if it has any battery or however I do that. I heard it. - [Matt] Yeah, I always expect these things to be like covered in just smoke. (radio hissing) - Okay. - [Alex] Do you feel it? - It sounds like it's coming from behind me. - [Alex] The marketing tagline for this is, \"Built to take it.\" (Ken laughs) - I'm trying. I'm really trying, okay? Something about that, like, really scratchy, like old school FM just gives me some real, oh. - [Matt] Bone me up, boy - [Austin] You're boned. - [Alex] They basically just want to send the sound so (quacks) loud into your body that it reaches your ear. - [Austin] All right, you're having too much fun with the Bone Fone. - [Austin] You have AirPods in. (laughs) - Oh no, he can't hear it. He's got AirPods. - That's a good demo. - Hey, you guys. Aw man, Rascal Flatts do sound good like this. - [Radio] Schedule your free consultation right now. Throw away your glasses and contacts forever. Get perfect vision and save money. Dial pound and save- - [Matt] Look at him boning, man. - This is shockingly (laughs) decent for something that is as old as it is. It's soft, it works pretty well. It sounds like, for old school radio, it sounds okay. It's very scratchy but like, you know, like, before HD radio, most radios were kind of scratchy. It really works, like you listen to it on the table, right? You can hear it of course, but when you put it on, you actually can probably hear what I'm hearing 'cause of my mic's right here, it's a big difference. How much is the Bone Fone? - [Alex] $45. - A steal! You could pretty much just put this in your pocket, right? Just, you know, get this crap outta here. We're just gonna just... That. That Bone Fone in your pocket or you just have to see me. - You bought a item? - You bought something for \"Mystery Tech?\" - I you know what? Every once in a while because look, here's the thing, I can't trust these guys to not deliver, I don't know... - Funny enough, that's in some industries, that's called insider trading. - Well, I'm probably gonna go to jail anyways, so might as well go out and be rich along the way. Yeah, boy. Yeah boy. It's the Palm Pixi Plus. Did you not know what the item is? I bought this. My good buddies, we were all talking the other day about webOS. Do you remember webOS? Not the LGTV operating system. Oh, no, no, no, before that this was made by Palm. This is a revolutionary operating system that was so ahead of its time that both Google and Apple are still, still stealing features from it. Back in the day, I, maybe if you look real close, have discussed the Palm Pixi Plus in the past. - [Ken] Yeah, the last time you bought one, you bought two by accident and for some reason- - What was that? That was like at least 10 years ago. Can I just say that I bought this from eBay brand new in box. Can you believe? - Yeah, you bought the Verizon ones brand new in box too 'cause nobody wanted it. - You guys think we're lying that he keeps buying these? - So before I do an unboxing of this pristine new in-box Palm Pixi, let me show you the other devices that I looked at in the past so you get a little bit of a sense for it. If I put in a Palm Pixi together- - [Ken] You didn't even buy the good one, the slidey one's the one that like- - The Pre was not the good one. - It was! - What are you talking about? - Actually, you know with the best one, the HP Veer. That one was really cool. It looks like a derpy little phone. But I'm telling you, this thing was ahead of its game. This thing had Wi-Fi. We're gonna do a very rare unboxing. How many of these do you think are available in the world still unboxed? I'll tell you. - [Ken] Well, if you keep unboxing new ones, you're gonna- - Exactly. - [Ken] This is literally the Blue Eyes White, you're freaking Seito Kaiba. He's like eliminating all of the new in-box ones. So we're gonna do a little walkthrough of the box so we can kind of capture this moment until I buy another one of these in five years. So this is the front, it's nicely sort of frosted. So you can see that if I try to pull the sleeve, woo. So fancy. So this is the brand new, (crickets chirping) what the hell is this? (Alex laughs) Wait, hold on a second. Can you see the difference between these two? It's like a case, but it's an actually replacement shell that's not remotely new. - You bought something that we already had three of because it was quote-unquote brand new in box. - [Austin] Yes sir. Keep going. - It was not brand new in box, it was just had box. - Look, I'm gonna read it, I'm gonna read it, okay? Palm Pixi Plus or factory sealed original box. It's got the Touchstone base. This is wireless charging, my dudes. Look at this, look at this. Watch this, watch this, watch this, watch this. Ready, ready, ready, ready? Whoo! I need to plug in first. It's got a second back in here too. Both of which are where they've been sneezed on. You know, the whole like this is like 15 years old thing. They don't have the activation servers on it anymore. Hold on, I'm gonna put it on my Touchstone dock here. Come on, Pixi. Come on, Pixi. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. It's telling me to do stuff. Okay, oh, put a SIM card in. No service. - [Matt] Oh, but it's got Wi-Fi. - Feels like it's been 30 to 45 seconds since an item of \"Mystery Tech\" has hit the table. Which is a great time to ask you to subscribe to the channel and ringling the dingling button. Why did you place that so carefully? - [Matt] Whoa, strong boy over here. - [Ken] You just went to the gym. - I'm sorry. Ah, ah, oh. No, you want heavy? I'll show you heavy. This is our tungsten cube and it is heavier. Look at my hands shaking, it's so heavy. It's a kilo magnesium cube. Is this literally like the exact same thing as the actual cube? Okay, so it comes with magnesium cleaning pad. (laughs) - [Matt] More than the tungsten came with. - Oh my god, it's actually this, is this the same size cube? This is a solid cube of magnesium. And as you can see, by me holding it with two fingers, it's light. It's a little guy. But it is the exact same size. - Oh, Jesus Christ. - Oh my God. - Look, you can see. Actually no, I lied, it's ever so slightly bigger. Catch. - [Alex] I mean, it's still pointy on the corner. - [Austin] Ken, you got your damn iPad. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. - [Austin] You're like, catch? So here's like, are we sure that that actually is a real full cube? Like it's not hollow. It's actually like... - Supposedly. - [Alex] That is the real full on like, solid cube. - They sound the same. - Yo, wait, actually yeah, that's a good idea. - [Alex] I mean, does that work? - Well, okay, so we have to learn how to, we have to figure out how to zero this, which I think is just the, oh, there we go. - [Austin] Okay, ready? Pretty accurate. This is about two pounds. - [Ken] Okay. - Okay, now let's try the tungsten. Yeah. So you can see the difference here. Now let me see if I can use this to clean up my cubes. Oh, I actually, dude, wait, this is really good. And it works around the tungsten too. - [Matt] Quit polishing your cube over there. - Honestly, the only downside with this is that it's kind of sharp. So even though you can toss it around like crazy, it still is a little on the sharp side. I know that the tungsten cube was well over a thousand dollars, right? How much is a lightweight little magnesium cube that weighs a mere kilogram? - [Alex] $200. - A bargain. A bargain. It's so much cheaper than the tungsten cube. - [Ken] I mean 10th the weight. 10th the price. So we're gonna put tungsten cube in the back and then I'm gonna give it its new friend, the magnesium cube, which can live right here. No one can tell the difference. Can I condone $200 for a completely useless cube? Hell yeah, I can. - Useless. - It's so useful. It's so cool. Subscribe to the channel for Austin science tips. I'm like Vsause, except (quacks).",

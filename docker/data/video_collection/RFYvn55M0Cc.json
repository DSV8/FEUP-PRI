Learn how to make your own 360 videos:   The Half Dome Day hike in Yosemite National Park is about 16 miles long, with an elevation gain of 4,737 feet.  (1444 m)  In order to be allowed to climb the metal cables you have to enter into a lottery to get permits.  They don't allow everyone to climb to the top.   The day we hiked, the rangers were turning people around due to unsafe lightning storms.  My group continued to the top, and found a brief window of opportunity to climb the metal cables without any lightning near by.  We were successful in our ascent, but I would suggest to others to not attempt the same thing. People have died climbing to the top. Lightning has struck the peak of Half Dome during every month of the year.   *Follow me for updates!* Instagram:  Facebook:  Twitter:  GooglePlus:   JerryRigEverything assumes no liability for property damage or injury incurred as a result of any of the information contained in this video.

    "transcript": "So here we are in Yosemite National Park. Were going to hike the Half Dome today and Im going to take you along with us. Go ahead and take a look around. If youre on a computer you can use your mouse to scroll back and forth. You can also, if youre on your phone, tilt it up and down to see the whole 360. Be sure you adjust your video settings so that its full quality and then you can see farther into the distance. Were going to have breakfast here. Ive got some Oreos and some eggs and bacon. Hey Steve, how long is the hike today? (Steve)About a 14 mile round trip and 5,000 foot elevation.(Zack) Nice. (Steve) No big deal. (Zack) No big deal. Hope you enjoy! Thanks for coming along! We just hiked up the trail down there and its totally misty all the way up to the falls right here on the other side of me. Its crazy. Steve, tell us how far weve hiked. (Steve) Weve hiked about 3.8 miles and gained about 3000 feet of elevation. Are you just making up those numbers or is that exactly what were doing? (Steve) Thats exactly it. Im actually tracking it on my GPS. (Other guy) Right, we just have to get to the top of that right over there. (Steve)So thats us thats us in about 3 hours. (Zack) But if you look up youre going to see some dark clouds. Hopefully those dont meet up with us later. (Ranger Guy) Yeah you guys make your own decision. If you want to continue up, obviously lightningYoure up above the trees on a granite dome that conducts electricity. There are the cables that conduct electricity. And its also very slick coming down if it does rain. So if you get up there at the top and it starts raining and you come down and its wet, Ive seen people almost lose it coming down. So its something to evaluate. You have a little ways to go before you get above the tree line. You might kind of wait it out and see what you think. Use your best judgment. You guys have a permit? (Steve) The only permit now we need is the heaven sent one, right? (Ranger Guy) Well, right. Yeah, just use your best judgment. (Zack) So we have Half Dome right here and the Ranger said that we should turn back because there have been too many lightning storms and thunder and stuff like that. And you can see kind of the clouds in the distance and a little bit of clouds over there around the Half Dome Peak. So were going to wait it out for a second and see if the clouds will pass and see if we can get up the ropes. Well see what happens. Hows the hike going so far Steve? (Steve) Doing good dude. Climbing up to the top, trying to avoid these lightning strikes. (Zack) How far have we hiked so far? (Steve) Probably about 6 miles. (Zack) 6 miles? (Steve) Probably gained about 4000 elevation right now. Ive got some sunblock sweat in my eyes. (Zack) I feel your pain, I feel your pain. Dude I saw lightning right there. (Steve) I did too. Were straight up climbing the stairs of Mordor. (Zack) Back there over the hills. The camera was on too, maybe it got it. (Steve) Where that rains falling? (Zack) Yeah. We got to get up there. Weve got Half Dome here, storms on the other side, storms over there, storms over there. Were going to do this and we got to do it quick. You can see the cables running up the side of the mountain over there. We got to use those to get to the top. Got my rubber gloves on. How you guys doing? These cables are gnarly. Theres rain right there dude, this is a stupid decision. Its probably one of my more stupider decisions. We come up here in a rain storm. This is as far as Im going. This is what over the edge looks like at the Half Dome. Im getting nervous. Thanks a ton for watching and for coming with me on this slightly insane and stupid journey. I want to get off this mountain before I get struck by lightning cuz the cables are metal. This is just an overall very poor decision wouldnt you say? (Steve) Yes. (Zack) We made it to the top. Im hoping to get some of that squirrel. Look at that. Toss one by the camera. (Girls) Youre going to make it fat. (Guy) I know, I think they are already pretty fat. (Girls) You should have seen the ones in the Grand Canyon. Theres actually signs with fat squirrels and its like do not feed the wildlife, they are already obese. (Guy) Where at? (Girls) Grand Canyon. Theyre like so fat they dont move. Its hilarious.",

    "transcript": "Today we have the world's first cordless stick vac with a built in sterilizing steamer. This is called the MACH V1 Ultra. Very brave of Mach to sponsor a video and let us take it apart to see how a single machine can both mop up eggs, suck up crunched fishy crackers, and sterilizingly steam a smathering of peanut butter out of existence. All fairly common messes at my house. The steam coming out of the MACH V1 Ultra helps loosen built in grime while killing germs, with an impressive 82 minutes of run time. Personally, I've always found it far more fun to see how technology works from the inside, so today we're going to take it apart and find the steamer, sucker, blower, and Tesla valve that makes all of it possible. My wife says I can take it apart as long as I put it back together because she likes it and wants to keep it. So fingers crossed. Let's get started. [Intro] The coolest parts of this thing are probably going to be the Tesla valve, the steamer, and of course, the ecoclean ozone generator. Popping off the magnetic roller cover and removing the replaceable roller, we see this is definitely more of a mop style hard floor vacuum, for tile, wood, or stone. Not so much for carpet. We have the upper clean water tank that does the ozone stuff. We'll get to that more in a minute. And we have the dirty water/fishy cracker collection tank at the bottom. To get to the steamer at the bottom of the MACH V1 Ultra has 16 screws, 4 of which are hidden behind the squeegee. And one of which, that took me a while to find, is hidden under the small left roller wheel. Tricky. After the screws are gone, the top plate of the MACH V1 comes off revealing to my surprise, both the Tesla valve and the steamer unit, along with the motor for the brush. I thought the Tesla valve was going to be harder to find. And the MACH V1 team has even made it all aesthetically transparent. The Tesla valve was invented by Mr. Nikola Tesla back in 1920. It's a fixed geometry passive check valve that only allows liquid to flow in one direction due to the creative looping. The MACH V1 is using this valve to dose cleaner into the tap water without any stirring or mixing required. The concentrated cleaning fluid is stored in the tank mounted on the handle, but we'll get to that later. It's a pretty cool way of doing things. With no moving parts it'll last for a very long time. The silver steam block also has a hose of its own directly up to the clean water tank. And then using electricity from the battery can heat itself up to 230 degrees to vaporize water as it passes through. The vapor then shoots out the front vents below the light bar. 99.9% of germs get wrecked when they come in contact with steam. You could say they're totally heated. Even after removing the 12 screws holding everything together, it still requires some rather extremely excessive force to pry open. But that force is worth it. We see the red tube where the clean water comes in on the underside of the steamer. The water gets exposed to heat coming off the internal electrodes. The water vaporizes into steam and has to pass through the upper metal maze on its way out again past the hot electrodes, ensuring that the temperature reaches 230 degrees, which is far past boiling. The steam leaves through the orange insulated tube and shoots out the front of the vacuum. With two of our interesting components out of the way we can make our way up to the ozone generator. Not going to lie, the bottom portion of this vacuum was fairly simple to enter, but the rest of the MACH V1 is very difficult to take apart. With the side panel unclipped I can remove the jet blade vent. This jet blade blows air over the freshly mopped surface to help dry the floor and eliminate streaks. With the back cover off we can see a speaker, as well as 3 individual pumps running from the water tank and cleaner tank down to the Tesla valve and another one to the Steamer unit. There's not really a good way to see the ozone generator from the underside, but basically the gold contact pads line up with the tank and use electricity to turn the oxygen atoms in the water (O1), into ozon which is O3. Aqueous ozone helps sterilize the floor and remove odors. And then just breaks back down into regular oxygen after it's done it's cleaning. It looks super cool when all the sciency stuff is happening inside of the tank. Another aesthetically pleasing tidbit is the internal plumbing of the clean water tank disappears as it gets filled up. The same ozone infused water is used during the self cleaning feature where the mop basically mops itself - spitting the ozone water onto the brush and then sucking it back up into the dirty tank drying it off with the air jet so it doesn't start smelling funny. It does this all by itself in position while docked on the charger. Super impressive. The internal battery pack is located under the clean water tank and looks like it's made up of twelve 21,700 lithium cells. The exact same batteries we would find inside of a Tesla vehicle. The MACH V1 Ultra has the battery staggered with air gaps running between them for ventilation and cooling. The BMS board, which is also attached to the battery, appears to be slathered with a waterproof coating on both sides. Very smart considering there is a lot of liquid running through the machine. Protection is always a good thing. Now we just need to get smartphone manufacturers to use the same coatings. 21 volts gets us 160 watt hours of energy enough for 82 minutes of run time. Using the steam function a lot does use up the battery quicker. I like that the MACH V1 is using existing technologies and combining them all into one unit. A vacuum, a steamer, and a mop the MACH V1 is like a Swiss army knife of cleaning tools. The V1 has a 2 year warranty and a 30 day money back guarantee, which is pretty solid. As we finish up and work our way back to the power button, we get a look at the smaller tank built into the handle that holds the MACH V1 cleaning solution, which gets mixed into the water with the Tesla valve. And now we can try turning it on...and it's not looking too good. While I spend the next couple hours retaking it apart and figuring out where I went wrong, you can grab one with the link in the description with its warranty still intact. -[Vacuum] Power on. Please return the device to the charging base for charging. -[Zack] It's a pretty sweet little unit and I really hope I get it working again. If you have any questions leave them down in the comments. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

    "transcript": "- [Ken] Greeting internet! I am Ken from the Computer Clan and today Apple has something new to share with us for Final Cut Pro X. Yes, there is a new version that now supports closed captions and ProRes RAW. That's pretty new and special, but today we're just gonna focus on a tutorial about how to use closed captions inside of this new version of Final Cut Pro 10. This is a documentary I have worked on about an abandoned theater. It is pretty fricking fun, but let's say I want to add some closed captions to the video. So, let's just take a look at this scene here. - [DJ] This set is pretty dope, like for real, dude. - [Ricky] Look at the toilets! - [Case] Yeah, the toilets are tiny, so enormous, enormous urinals, tiny-- - [Ken] Yeah, toilets were really different in 1927. So we're gonna start by just adding in our own captions, but I'll also show you later how to import a file, so the captions automatically pop up for you. And stick around until the end, because I'll show you some other cool resources for closed captioning and another great resource to help you learn Final Cut Pro X should you continue your education in it. So for the sake of this demo, I'll start at \"Look at the toilets!\" So we go up to the edit menu, go down to captions, and add caption. As you see we now have a new little block here in this isolated separated timeline for our English closed captions. And right inside of here I can add my text. Look at the toilets. Depending on how your roles are set up, you may not see the text actually appear on the screen. So open up the index over here if you don't see the text, and go to roles. You may have your captions turned off. If you have your captions turned off, they'll still show up in the timeline but they won't show up as an overlay in your viewer. Check this on to see the overlay and if you want to hide the captions from your timeline, you can collapse them and then click to bring them back. So right now we're editing in English, the language, and we're using the ITT format, so let's keep doing some edits here. So I'll trim that there and I'm gonna hold on the option key and drag just to add another caption. - [Case] Yeah, the toilets are tiny. - [Ken] Yeah, the toilets are tiny, so I'll just trim that there. Double click on that, yeah, the toilets are tiny. And I can jump back and forth between my captions in time just by clicking these arrows here. - [DJ] Like for real, dude. - [Ricky] Look at the toilets! - [Case] Yeah, the toilets are tiny. - [Ken] That's a quick way we can add our captions into Final Cut Pro. Now if we look over here in the inspector, we can edit our text up here and we can also change our formatting. Our text color for example, position, we can control the timing here as well, and we can also control bold, italics, and underline. There is another standard of captions that Final Cut Pro X supports. So under the roles inside of the timeline index. Let's go to edit roles, and I'm going to add a caption role. So again, like I said, the format we're working with is ITT, but it also supports CEA 608. So I'm gonna add that and hit apply, so now I can edit in that format if I choose to. So up in the inspector up here, as you can see, I have this little drop down menu. It says I'm editing in the format ITT in the language, English. If I want to edit in a different format, or even a different language I can choose that from this menu. And I'm just gonna hit CEA, now it's gonna warn me, that, hey, you're converting, you might lose some text and formatting, so just be careful with proceeding. For the sake of this demonstration I'll hit continue and now we're editing with the CEA standard and as you'll notice since we have an ITT standard and a CEA 608 standard Final Cut Pro separated them for me in different lanes. So if I switch to English here, I'm isolating the English ITT captions and the second English option is my CEA 608 captions. You can change the text color, the background color, and the display style. So typically you would see something like paint on, like this, where it just paints onto the screen like that. So those are some of the options that you have for adding and editing captions. Now let's say you've already hired a service to make the captions for you and they give you a file. Well Final Cut Pro supports importing of files too. So I'm gonna go over to another recent video that I made about the 2019 Mac Pro, yet to be seen, but hey, you know, there's news about it and we can dream, right? So I hired a company to actually make the captions for me and the company I hired is Rev.com. They will caption your videos for like a dollar a minute. It's pretty fricking awesome, it's low cost, and it's fast. I use them all the time. So I sent them this video and they typed everything for me and they put it into a file. So what I can do is, I can go back to the beginning of my video. I'm just gonna hit shift Z to zoom out to see my whole timeline. I'm gonna go up to file, import, and we have a new option, captions. And as you can see, I can import my SCC file right into Final Cut Pro and I'll click import. The SCC standard may not match 24 FPS perfectly so it's giving me this warning because that typically works in 29.97 drop frame and non-drop frame. This video was produced at 24 frames a second so it gives me this warning. That won't always be the case though, and what I can do is I can turn them on, and now we'll see them show up over the video. So let's say we're done with our closed captions, so we can go up to our export menu, I'll choose my H.264 preset and under roles you'll see we have some new options. There's two main ways we can do this, we can export the quick time movie by itself and then export the captions as a separate file, as you can see we're now exporting two files, a quick time movie and an SCC file. But I'm gonna uncheck that and actually just embed the English closed captions into the quick time movie. So what this does is, I can have my movie file here, and play it like normal, but I can have my closed captions show up. And I even have my menu where I can turn them on and off. So it's just all embedded. So that's super convenient and super easy to use. Again you can export as a separate file or embed the captions into your movie. So that's a quick look at how to add captions, edit captions, and import captions, and then when you're done export videos with captions in the new Final Cut Pro 10.4.1 And again, if you want to have your videos transcribed for you, I recommend checking out Rev.com. It's only a dollar a minute. Oh, and I didn't forget there's that other resource I wanted to share with you. You know watching this video is pretty cool right? You can learn stuff from it, but you can't pause it and ask the video a question, like, you can't ask the video, how can I do this? The video's not gonna be intelligent enough to answer you, but here's the cool thing, I'll be able to. I can be that voice in your ear when have questions and I can help you learn Final Cut Pro and other products. I run as service called TidBytes Training and it's personalized tech training that is geared toward you, where you can train in Final Cut Pro and in other software in the comfort of your very own home. You can work on your own personal projects and I can be that voice in your ear that helps you out when you get stuck and when you want to learn something new. So I'm here to help you. I recommend checking out TidBytesTraining.com so you can continue your Final Cut Pro X education and training. If you have any other questions or comments, feel free to let me know down below. Thanks for watching guys and I hope learned something, and I'll see you in the not so distant future.",

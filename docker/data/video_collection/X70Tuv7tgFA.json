    "transcript": "Keys. We all need them. We carry them. They're an important part of civilized life. If you wanna protect the things you have. You gotta lock up your doors. HERE'S THE PROBLEM THOUGH They're like this. This is a keychain. This is the technology that's been the same for, I don't know, at least as long as I've been alive. What happens when this goes in your pocket, it's stabbing you, in the leg. These things that go all over the place. And then when you need one, what do you do... you're going through here... Who knows? You could be chased by the predator over here. How do I...?! You've SEEN IT IN THE MOVIES! Blaaaah! And you're dead. I think I may have the solution to my own problems and to all of yours as well. This guy right here is called the \"KeySmart\", hand-made in the USA. That thing there here becomes your keychain and your keys kind of \"flip out\" You have like a Swiss army knife with keys. They're all flat, they stay smooth. And, the cool thing is this is the expansion pack which comes with a USB key as well. So now your data can also live on top of here, safe and sound This is an expansion pack so that you can hold more keys so it's gonna get fatter, if you want it to. I think you take a coin, spin that off of there. Same thing down here. Perfect. These two little posts, that's what the expansion is for, if you wanna take it up a notch. Now I don't know. Based on the number of keys I have, I'm probably gonna have at least one? Maybe? We'll find out. Okay, we'll find out... Let's take a key here... Okay so I watched a video just to figure it out. It seems simple but there's some technique involved. First of all, if you're going to do the USB drive, you wanna get started with that. You wanna get that in there and spaced out first. Now the adapter that's included looks like the other ones but it's a little bit fatter. So you wanna stick that in the center here. Put that on first. See? Nice movement there. The next thing you wanna do is space out each individual key so let's say I go with this one Space that out And then maybe I could go one more on this side. Let's just find out Okay cool. We'll go ahead and get the first one... Screwed in. Just to make sure we go the right fit, at least on this side. Okay, cool. So you got half done. Now you want to achieve the same thing on the other side, so... go ahead and grab some key's here. Now there's also an adapter included. This thing here. And this is if you want to hook your key fob (key chain/key ring) to this. So if you have a car key fob (the key chain/key ring with your car key) or something like that So you can put this on the post here And then connect that to a traditional key ring. Slide this back over. Tighten it down. Now... I don't know about you... That's pretty portable! Compared to what I had. You gotta set it up the way you like but... When it comes to actually using a key, you just pull it out like this? And look at that. If you need your other key, flip that out. Bingo. Is it revolutionary? I don't know! I think it's... I gotta be... It's gonna depend on how many keys you hope to carrying I've seen some intense key chains out there. Like a hundred keys on them This isn't going to be a subsitute for that but if you carry a few, you end up with a pretty cool package. \"KeySmart\"! Is it smarter?! I think a little bit.",

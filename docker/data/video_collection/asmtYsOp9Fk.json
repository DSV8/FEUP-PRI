    "transcript": "Alright! Yeah! Today's a good one. At least I'm excited! You know it's not like I don't like the latest electronic gadget that shows up every single time... I do! But this is something different. There's a different level of insanity. Just a- Just a tiny pinch more. At first glance you're like \"What? What's going on?\" \"Is this a cooking show?\" No! Yes, these are marshmallows which by the way are harder than they were at one time in their life. They're a little stiff. This, my friends, is a marshmallow shooting crossbow. Why does this exist? I don't know! Because it's fun? Because Jack is about to find out if his skull can take the impact of a hardened marshmallow? Better than silica gel! This came from a company called mmxvancouver.com \"Hand-crafted with pride in Vancouver.\" \"Adjust the mallow holder to lightly hold your marshmallow \"by pulling it up or pushing it down\" Alright, I get that. Tons of caution here, don't do this at home. I gotta construct it a little bit. So this is how it showed up... I'm gonna have to put it together. It seems like it's high quality materials here. This is all carved out of wood. Look at this! (trigger clicks) It seems like some sort of torture device. Imagine it... Death by marshmallow. BA-DA! So, there's a little release latch up here. I'm sure that's how it's gonna fire, right, like that. There's a little screw on the front that comes off and then this guy over here- now there's a little cutout. So you want to have that along the top so there's room for the marshmallow to skim right through there on its way to destruction. And that's what gives you the- Whoohoho! That's what gives you the pull. You pull back on here... It just goes around this latch, by the looks of it. Yeah, you see that? Right there. And when you pull this release assuming the marshmallow fits into this location here then let's see what happens. You got a good look at that, Jack? Ready, set... Ahhhh! Awooga! What's the origin of that noise? Awooga! Awooga! (wolf whistle) Let's get this baby loaded! And let's give Jack a black eye! (cackling laughter) Oh, man, those are kind of hard! (the marshmallows sound like rocks) Those are dangerous projectiles. To kick it off, we pull this back. Oh! Now let's get a marshmallow. You slide it underneath the holder here. You ready for this, Jack? Ready for this impact? This is exactly what Jack deserves right now. Oo- ooh... Just missed! (laughing) Gah! Ohh! Direct hit! Direct hit! It's pretty powerful, watch this. Okay, you ready guys? I'm gonna ricochet it off the table. Oh hohohoho! Hohohoho! BA-DA! It hit the leg of that tripod. (Russian accent) Safety number one priority. Is that Russian? I don't- Here we go! Ohhhh! That's like a bullet! Okay folks, little bit of target practice now. To show you what kind of force we're working with here. Ready... Set... I'm not loaded with a marshmallow. 3... 2... 1... Ohhh! That's power. You're dead, water bottle. Ohhh! You saw me knock over some water bottles, you saw me almost kill Jack. So, how powerful is this thing? Should I send this stale marshmallow into my hand and see? (battle cry) Okay, I don't think I have a choice. In 3... 2... (screams) (scream continues) I hit the pinky! The poor little pinky! Okay, it's not going to kill anybody, but it's fun man, I don't know... Little bit of target practice, maybe you and your friends have a war, you step the Nerf game up a notch. Plus, you can eat the ammunition! Kaboom!",

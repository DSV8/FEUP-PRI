    "transcript": "- If you're on the road more than your home, you have to be tempted by a PC this portable. It's like catnip for road warriors. And built in 4G to keep you connected anywhere only sweetens the deal. But performance and pricing that are less competitive make Surface Go LTE less compelling. This is The Mr. Mobile review. (upbeat music) Folks, I try to treat everything that crosses my desk equally, but I will admit, I'm a bit of a Surface fan. I think the Surface Book 2 is one of the most incredible PCs ever produced. I'm chomping at the bit to cover those Surface headphone that Daniel Rubino is hogging, and I've been using a Surface laptop since it came out. Stay tuned through today's epilogue for my thoughts on its sequel, by the way. So when Microsoft announced this much smaller Surface aimed at the more mobile among us, I knew I was gonna be hooked. And the hardware is a major win. About the only thing I don't like is the big bezel around the display. Everything else about this one pound magnesium package is fantastic. The rock-solid kickstand that lets you angle from nearly flat to nearly vertical and anywhere in between, with a micro-SD slot tucked cleverly beneath. Windows Hello that lets go log in with your face. Windows 10S is you're content with back to school software, upgradable to 10 Pro if you're not. The Surface Go is easy to hold one-handed if you're reading a book or browsing, and it's small enough to fit on all but the tiniest of airline seat-back trays. About the only place it's not comfortable is in your lap, and that hasn't changed since the first Surface six years ago. Now, there's a reason I didn't review the Surface Go when it launched last summer. I wanted to wait for this LTE version which just landed recently. While not everyone needs a built-in 4G modem, it's one of those things that once you have it, you wonder how you lived with out it. At the Qualcomm Tech Summit I was in a room with 350 people, all being served by the same overworked wifi. In that kind of environment, even hot-spotting from my phone was a dicey proposition, so I turned on the Surface's cellular connection, and my problems evaporated. And you don't need to be in a conference setting. Say you're at the airport, or at coffee shop working on sensitive documents, and you're just not sure how secure the wifi is. Well with this, you don't need to think about it. With built-in 4G you just connect and go, assuming you're willing to pay for it. If all this sounds familiar, you may have caught my review of the first always connected PC, those are the Snapdragon-powered laptops with always on data connections. While those first ACPCs were dogged by sluggish performance, what you got in exchange was incredible endurance. Windows Central just reviewed a Lenovo ACPC that set a new record for the longest battery life this site has seen, around 15 hours of continuous use. Why do I bring that up? Because the Surface Go, with its Intel Pentium Gold processor and tacked on LTE modem, does not have great battery life. In fact, if you leave 4G turned on and favor the sportier side of the performance slider, you'll be looking at about four hours of continuous use between charges. Now of course that'll fluctuate depending on who you are, but I was pretty power-conscious when I put it through its paces. A handful of tabs in Edge, writing in Google Docs, and flitting between Slack, YouTube and email, mainly. Four hours on that kind of workload is pretty weak. It's possible to make the battery last longer by easing off on that performance slider, but most people aren't gonna wanna do that. You see, even pegged at the fastest setting, I found the Surface Go quite easy to slow down. It's especially pokey at opening programs, once taking a leisurely 12 seconds to launch Amazon Kindle. The point is, if we were going to have to settle for slower performance, I'd have preferred a Snapdragon. At least then we could've had that legendary battery life. And finally, there's the price tag. As usual, this type cover you have been watching me clack away on is comfortable, compact, clever, and absolutely not included in the box. Add another 129 for that, plus another 130 extra for LTE, and you're looking at about $800 out the door for the whole package. At press time, there's plenty of laptops on the Microsoft store around the same price point running on more powerful core I5 and I7 processors. And that Lenovo C630 I mentioned is 100 bucks cheaper. I continue to love the Surface Go for that portable package, and it does nail many other factors. I mean, the display is beautiful, pen support is here if you wanna shell out another hundo. The speakers are front-firing. And yeah, it sure does seem like Dave 2D was right about this webcam, it's, well, it's better looking than most. But until Surface Go gets refreshed with either a more powerful or a more power-efficient processor, it's tough to recommend for the price, unless you place portability above literally everything else. Epilogue. The fanboy in me has to go out on a kudos for the Surface Go's USB-C port. While it comes with the high speed Surface charger in the box, I've barely used it at all because of my belief that in 2019, we should be able to charge everything using one cable. The Surface Go lets me do that, unlike its cousin, the Surface laptop 2. I had fully intended to give this machine its own review, but despite the significant platform bump under the hood, it's otherwise such a close clone of its predecessor that I just found I didn't have much to say. And, yeah, it lacks a USB-C port, which just makes very little sense to me at this stage of the game. While I wait for the next refresh Surface laptop, I'll direct you to Daniel Rubino's review to learn more, and I'll encourage you to please subscribe to The Mr. Mobile, so you don't miss another two laptop reviews coming down the pipe to close out 2018. One of which I'm much more excited about than I expected to be. Drop your guesses down in the comments, or your feedback, if you own a Surface Go. Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends. (upbeat music)",

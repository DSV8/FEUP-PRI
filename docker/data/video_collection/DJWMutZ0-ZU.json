    "transcript": "- Microsoft flight SIM 2020 is finally out. And while we're a bit late, with the help of Samsung next level racing, and some goodies from Thrust Master, we're going to try to fly a plane, not just me. We're going to bring some other LMG team members over, and given that we've all probably never flown a plane, I think it's going to be a complete and utter (beep) show. I can't get this out of the box. (rustling noises) Oh my god! Let's do this thing. LTD store.com. We actually built that motion set up a few weeks back on an LTT video, but that was really meant for SIM racing. This time around, we're trying to do Flight Sim. So we've definitely got to make some adjustments. I've already stripped the wheel and everything off, and we've got the new brackets for our flight setup. So all we need is the flight setup. Our friends over at Thrust Master were able to send over their T 16,000 M flight pack. So it's going to include the flight stick, throttle control, as well as rudder pedals. Again, I've never flown a plane, so how useful these are going to be for us is TBD, but hopefully it should make it a little easier than just using a keyboard and mouse. Oh boy, was that important? (upbeat music fades in) (more rustling noises) - To coincide with the flight SIM 2020 launch, Thrust Master actually made some cool Airbus additions of these peripherals, but they only had the flight stick in stock when we asked for it so we got their Airbus flight stick and then we're going to use the rest of their regular flight path for our setup. (foam squeaking) Okay. So there we've got our rudder pedals, our throttled control, and the flight stick. Whew. Do look like a pilot now? Is that a no? This control configuration is what's known as a HOTAS or Hands On Throttle And Stick. Um, in a lot of airplanes what you probably see is a yoke, and that might be more accurate for most of the planes, but I really wanted to try out Airbus's A320 in the new flight SIM, which they use a flight stick in the throttle. And I guess we've got the Airbus specific addition here, maybe lets unbox that too. Ooh. Okay. These look pretty similar. We've got some dials that I don't know what to do, we've got some buttons that you presumably can program, these switches look a little different and it's got a different paint job I guess? We're not dropping any bombs that have an A320, I hope. The construction of all of this is pretty plastic-y, for the price though I think this full set with these three pieces is about 260 bucks US. That's pretty cheap for what you're getting, so I wouldn't expect it to be full metal construction for that kind of money, but all of the motion feels pretty good. These aren't exactly on the bottom tier of what you might find for a flight stick. We do at least have a hall effect sensor in this, which is going to give you a little bit more accuracy than like an analog stick that you might get for 50 bucks on Amazon, but I think we just need to plug it in and try it out, right? - Big, thanks to HelloFresh for sponsoring today's video.

Oh, Oh, Oh my gosh. Um, I think there's probably some things I would want to adjust usually. Oh man. We're going down boys. We're back on the ground. Why wasn't I gaining any speed? Brake, brake! Noo...! Oh boy... oh no! I just rolled the plane. Whoa, what in the hell? What just happened? (screaming) Yeah baby! Saved it! David, I saved it! What just happened? Did you see that? My goal once I took off was to go visit the LMG office. Look at the detail in the buildings. Let's try to, I'm gonna try and go down and get a little closer here. This is probably a terrible idea. Oh. You overstressed the aircraft and caused critical damage. - The chair's frigging sick. Actually, I wonder what happens if we do a barrel roll? Ooh. Oh geez. Oh, balls. We did it. I think it's going to take too long to get to the actual city, so what about we try and just land on one of these buildings here. We might not have the skill, but we do have the can-do attitude. I keep on missing because when the chair moves my stick moves and then yeah, we're back. We're done. - Pause! Ready? Set. Go. Okay. We're good. We're going pretty straight here. (screaming) My feet don't touch, Alex what have you done? (laughter) - [Guest] You can slide the chair forward a bit if you want. - Yeah I need to. Yeah, we've got this. Taxing, we're moving. We're moving. Okay. Okay. Okay. (screaming) I don't know. I'm trying to move. Isn't this how you can, how you steer the plane? I just need to take off and then I could probably experience it. If I crash again, I'm done. Oh, I'm already in the air. Perfect! Perfect! This is our real pilots do, right? They just start in the air. Totally normal. Okay. Can you do barrel rolls in this? I just dipped down and I got really scared. What? What? You overstressed the aircraft and cause critical damage. All right, whatever. I would love to have this set up in the lounge. I'd probably never leave. I would just explore the world. I would never travel again. I would just go all over and be like, I've been there. You know what I mean? - I think I have enough speed, so I'm going to lift the tail...? Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome aboard to number 69. That's where we did the uh, photo challenge. Okay. Slow down a tiny bit. Oh (beep). I didn't make it this time. - So this is uh, my first time playing Flight Sim. I tried it once earlier, before the camera is rolling. I got off, I tried to do a trick in the middle of Beijing and it didn't go so well. What's going on? Whoa. I don't like that sound. It sounds like my plane's dying, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Oh God. Oh no. I'm not going to make that, that's way too short. Oh, I crashed. Okay. Well I can't fly a plane. Surprise. Surprise. Clearly, this is one of the coolest gaming experiences that has come out in a long time. We've definitely gotten some feedback, maybe we should have this in the lounge. I don't really know if there's space, and I might take it home myself. But yeah, this is awesome. So get subscribed if you want to see more content like this, let us know in the comments what you thought of our flying experience. And I'm kind of sad I didn't get to see the office, but maybe somebody else did.",

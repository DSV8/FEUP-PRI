    "transcript": "[Intro] Alright, so Im here right now with the King of Random in probably one of the coolest shops Ive ever seen. [Grant] Whats up guys? Welcome to my laboratory! [Zack] For real, thats exactly what it is. This desk is phenomenal; its got so many power tools. But theres one special thing that I want to show you, and it blew my mind when I saw it for the first time. [Grant] Nobody knows about this yet, this is kind of like, behind the scenes. [Zack] Top secret. [Grant] Pre-video video. [Zack] Okay, so liquid nitrogen. Why do you need it? [Grant] Why do you need liquid nitrogen? Well, why do I need liquid nitrogen? Or why does the world need liquid nitrogen? [Zack] You, particularly. [Grant] Me in particular? I just like liquid nitrogen just for playing around. Its fun to play with because it can make things explode, it can make things freeze. Its one of those substances where it has properties that you dont typically find in normal everyday living because its so cold and thethe amount of energy it takes to make it that cold its not readily accessible. Not very many people know where to find liquid nitrogen and so its just one of those cool things. Its also very dangerous. It can freeze your hands off. It could kill you. So Im very much intrigued by things that can kill you. [Zack] Which is weird. It can kill you, it can freeze your hands off, but here we are in the basement of the King of Randoms house. [Grant] Nobody needs to know that! [Zack] So show us how you make liquid nitrogen. [Grant] Okay. Im going to run you very very briefly through the process of how Im making liquid nitrogen right now. And if you listen very very carefully, you can hear a ticking noise in the backgroundclunk clunk clunk clunk. Let me show you what that noise is. And over herethis is what we were working on today, me and Zack. Youre going to see this popping up on my channel, but we have been playing with brains. Gummy brains coming soon! This is a spare room that I set up; it used to be a guest bedroom, now I use it for my radiator, which is right down here. Now this is basically just a giant glorified radiator that I built with a friend of mine named Chris. We have the radiator here. We have water pumping through it, and its being cooled by a giant furnace fan thats pumping air out the back. So air gets sucked in here, cools the water down, blows out here, and I put a little mesh screen on it just so my kids cant reach in and chop their fingers off. We have a window open because this thing gets really hot and it circulates all the air. So what were doing is were bringing in hot water, cooling it down, pumping that hot air off, and then sending back cold water to what Im about to show you next. And here is what we have making that ticking noise. This is a cryocooler powered by helium and Ill tell you about how that works in just a second. See this little thing bumping up and down? Thats very important. So this is the really crude setup Ive got going on right now. Its just what we have to work with. This is my nitrogen generator, this is my nitrogen tank, this thing right here is called a helium compressor, and thats whats pumping helium to the cryohead and back. This is the stuff that gets really really hot. This is the stuff that turns nitrogen into liquid nitrogen. So our atmosphere where were living is about 79% nitrogen, so nitrogen is all around us. What this little machine here does is it takes the nitrogen out of the air; it pulls the oxygen out of it and then cleans it so its a nice dry gas. Dry nitrogen. At that point we pump it into this tank where we can pressurize it and hold the tank full of nitrogen. Now I have a little regulator on here and this regulator just allows me to pump that gas out at about 1 psi. It travels through this pulley tube which runs over to the dewar and just gently vents the gas on a very very cold heat sink. Thats the tube that you see right here. Now the second system, this is where the water and the radiator come inI have a helium compressor here. It compresses helium and as the gasses compress, it heats up. Well that cools down, and we run that helium over to this cryohead. The whole purpose of the cryohead is to pump the gas in there and rapidly expand it. And as it expands it gets very very cold and sucks heat out of the dewar. The hot helium gas runs back to the helium compressor where its liquid cooled with water and then pumping that water back up to the radiator to cool it back down so it can come back down and repeat the process. So this thing right here is just a glorified air conditioner that gets so cold that when you push nitrogen gas onto it, it condenses and starts dripping down into the dewar. [Zack] And so with all this system in place, how long would it take for this system to fill up with liquid nitrogen? [Grant] So you got to think, were just putting it in one drop at a time. So this is a 35 liter dewar. Its going to take 2 to 3 weeks for it to fill up completely. But weve already got about 15. [Zack] How much do we have in there? [Grant] I think its about half full right now, so were probably somewhere around 20 liters. And to fill this up completely it would cost me about 170 dollars. So making it at home, I dont know if it really saves a lot of moneybut who else is making liquid nitrogen at home? I just think its cool. Its a cool novelty affect. [Zack] So you pretty much have an endless supply of liquid nitrogen right? [Grant] Yeah, because we live in nitrogen. Were just cooling it down and turning it into a liquid, thats all. [Zack] Yeah because theres nitrogen in the air that we breath. [Grant] Thats right. In fact, if I just let it runningif I let this thing keep running without the nitrogen generator I would basically just be making liquid atmosphere, which would be nitrogen and oxygen. And I could use this liquid nitrogen to make liquid oxygen. Basically make any kind of variety of gasses or liquids that we want. Its really effective and its great for cooling things down quickly. [Zack] Thats interesting. You also mentioned that theres helium inside of that machine. So is the helium ever used up, like you have to replenish that? Or is the system completely like self-sustained? [Grant] Good question. No, the helium compressor is a closed system. So all its doing is its taking that helium, its compressing it, and its going through a heat exchanger to cool that gas down. Then its running out to the cryo where it expands and heats up again, and then runs back and just repeats that process. Its just exchanging heat just like your air-conditioning unit does in your house. This is just on a much higher level and a lot more expensive. [Zack] So as long as it has electricity it can keep making liquid nitrogen forever? [Grant] Yep. As long as there are no leaks in the helium compressor, that helium will stay in there in a closed loop system indefinitely. [Zack] Thats impressive. Its also impressive that he jerryrigged that whole system right here in his basement. [Grant] That all came from 3 years of trying to find parts and piece them together from University Surplus, EBay, Amazon, all over the place. But we finally got it working. This is my second batch of liquid nitrogen. The first batch I used to freeze a heart on my channel and we smashed it. [Zack] Oh that was cool. [Grant] We kind of dissected a heart with liquid nitrogen. So another abnormal use for it, but thats how I roll. And I will actually have a full tutorial on this liquid nitrogen generator going into a little bit more depth with how it works on my channel in the near future. So if you want to come check me out: King of Random on YouTube. Got some cool content for you. [Zack] Nice. Thanks for giving us a behind the scenes look. I was very very impressed. Go check out his channel. Ill leave a link in the video description below. And right up here in this section Ill show you what weve been working on here on his counter. Thanks a ton for watching, Ill see you around.",

    "transcript": "it finally came in this box we have the cheapest gaming system that you can buy on aliexpress probably and the reason that i'm really excited to have a look at it is because the previous aliexpress system that i bought was way better than i was expecting aside from the thermal paste [__] and the dead ram kit that it came with there was also the fact that the aio was only mounted with one screw and kind of dangling there the cable management actually wasn't great either and then there was just the general used feeling of all of the components in that um but other than that it was way better than i was expecting so this little pc has some big shoes to fill but before we get into that it's time for a word from today's video sponsor manscaped today's video is sponsored by manscaped a company that cares more about your goals than you do manscaped sent over their perfect package 3.0 for me to check out for this video which includes a lawnmower 3.0 which has a badass 7000 rpm motor in it that's still safe near your julies because it's got a ceramic blade that won't cut you the perfect package also has the crop preserver and crop reviver both of which make your balls smell nice without any added chemicals and for a limited time you get two free gifts which include the shed travel bag which is really awesome and some manscaped boxer briefs that make you feel like a nacho libre wrestler and i have to say after trying the lawnmower 3.0 on my untamed man jungle it works really well so if this sounds good to you go to manscape.com today to get 20 off plus free international shipping and the two free gifts when you use the promo code david at manscape.com your balls and body will thank you [Music] the system in this box cost me about 366 us dollars which in the world of prebuilts usually just gets you a bit of sand rubbed in your eyes so i'm not that confident about the state of the system also the fact that the box seems to have suffered a hernia at some point doesn't help much it really is covered in battle scars oh that is packing material that i've actually never seen used for a pc before and then in here we've got a hunt key box hopefully there's a pc in this box there is um what happened to the graphics card is that uh oh i think this makes more sense oh there we go okay in the moment of truth who hey it's actually got a tempered glass side panel tempered plastic side panel [Music] and here we have a case that on first impression actually doesn't look that bad we've got some faux metal on the front of the case and then what looks like an rgb strip along the side but then you look a bit closer and notice what is some of the most restricted front airflow i've ever seen on a case but you know what they say about front ventilation it's the thought that counts and then around the back we've got some rear i o which would have been considered limited in the 1950s and um no no graphics card and then finally the power supply looks like the stuff of night terrors so let's open it up and see if we can track down the graphics card the acrylic side panel actually cracked in shipping although that could have been my fault [Laughter] the first thing that you notice when you open up the system aside from the power supply that looks suspiciously like the ignition source for an ied is this awesome looking cooler it's all whited out and stuff some more plastic and oh here we go this i'm hoping is the graphics card but before we open that up let's have a look at the rest of the system now under that enormous cooler is an x79 xeon cpu that's running in one of those chinese x79 motherboards that craft computing does videos on semi-regularly which actually makes it a very interesting hardware configuration for a budget gaming system now in terms of the ram it's our old favorite a single 8 gig stick but for a 366 dollar pc i guess it's forgivable what isn't forgivable though is that they barely screwed the motherboard down look at all those empty screw holes and the result of that lack of screws is although to be fair i don't know if that's because it's not screwed down well enough or the fact that the motherboard back plate is made out of like paper mache oh no the vrm heatsink has actually been ripped off let me let me just just there we go that's okay right on a positive note it does come with an ssd which is by a company called juan on z around the back the cable management's not a complete disaster although there was definitely a lot of stuffing going on here and then up here you can see the single screw fighting valiantly to keep the vrm heatsink stuck down now with that let's have a look at the graphics card uh now in all honesty this is actually a really smart way to ship it because it means that it's not gonna like rip out of the pci express slot while shipping or whatever oh in here we have uh a screwdriver that's awesome not many pre-built come with their own screwdriver [Applause] wait wait a minute no way now i'm not immediately gonna say that this is a fake graphics card but i'm pretty sure that i've seen this shroud design on wish.com however hua nanzi is potentially a fairly not sketchy company so maybe this is a legitimate hd 6770 and they just happen to use the same cooler as fake graphics cards because so now i'm going to put the definitely not a fake graphics card back into the aliexpress system and we're going to see how it runs and i have no choice but to use the included screwdriver oh wow this is definitely the worst screwdriver i've ever used in my life let's see what happens oh we've got a lot of rgb going i like the way that the rgb glistens off the crack in the plastic it is already um quite noisy it sounds like it may be the graphics card let's have a look at how it identifies that graphics card um because you should be able to tell pretty early on if it's oh no no no no i think we're okay i think we're okay oh gpu-z to check out that graphics card because gpu-z is one of the best ways to check the authenticity of a graphics card 6700 series okay so according to according to gpu-z we actually have an hd 6750 in here now according to the listing we're supposed to have a 6770 but despite that little whoopsie i think we do actually have a legitimate graphics card in here what is this browser i feel like even if i could understand chinese i wouldn't be able to follow what's going on here it looks terrible what is this location z oh this is one of those weird pieces of software that boomers use to like monitor the health of their system i wonder if it's got like a disk defragment tool in it that's honestly that's what this looks like now let's see how the 360 dollar system actually runs games starting off with gta 5. in terms of the graphic settings that the game recommends it's actually just throwing us straight to 800 by 600 which is the real gamer resolution as we all know uh even with even with 800x600 we're still almost hitting our vram limit here no way that's a really good start look at that it's about 70 frames per second this is actually not too bad it looks like garbage because of the resolution but yo this actually works okay let's try a higher resolution here let's take it to 720p we're still sitting at about 70 frames per second okay let's let's try the unthinkable let's see if we can push it to 1080p 900p i guess if that's what you can call that okay so this is the highest resolution the gta 5 will let us run it at uh 1440x900 and it's still running well we're sitting just under 50 frames per second very playable even when you get closer and like the details and stuff load in like this is this is a better gaming experience than playing gta 5 on like a ps3 for example this is surprisingly good next up is cs go which is a lot braver with the auto settings than gta 5 was look at that it's mostly on high we're not going to try and game on high because nobody plays cs go on hype okay there we go that makes more sense apply no way it's actually running at about 80 frames per second the temperatures are amazing we're sitting at about 60 c with the gpu and about 46 c on the cpu very impressive stuff aliexpress person and finally we gotta do fortnite for the kiddos i'm just gonna try and run the game in competitive settings so let's see if we can do like 100 3d resolution everything on low and then view distances on epic hopefully this works so we're currently sitting at about 75 resolution scale for 1080p and yeah this is not going to cut it if you actually want to win any pvp engagements like this is this is not going to go well let's try and drop the settings more 50 resolution scale at 1080p oh it looks so terrible oh that is oh is that a player i can't see if that's a player or not i think it i think it may be let's try one more step down and see how that goes so we're gonna do oh yeah there we go even with this mosaic mode enabled we're still we're still not getting 60 frames per second i mean this is how all the pros play right is with 25 resolution scale i don't have ammo left come on [Laughter] in conclusion once firing up the system it all went better than i was expecting i was half expecting it to release flesh-eating bacteria into my house but still the graphics card seems to be real despite the fact that it has a fake graphics card cooler on it for some reason the power supply didn't immediately end human civilization once powered on so that's a good thing i guess and if your expectations are low enough you could actually game on this system in fact about a year ago i did a video on a 380 gaming pc from amazon and it performed worse than this one did so good job random aliexpress hello with that it brings me to the end of the video if you enjoyed it please do like and subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one and until the next video bye [Music] you",

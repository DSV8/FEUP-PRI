    "transcript": "what's up guys Lew here back with another video and today we're taking a look at a fairly sophisticated security camera this is from a company called am crest it's the pro HD the real model name is IP to em - 841 B you probably don't want to say that so let's say and press pro HD what's different about this one compared to some of the other stuff i've looked at is that it has pan and tilt and it's not just zooming into the single frame this actually moves around so you can keep tabs on every inch of the room from your smartphone you can actually interact with it that way it will record to the cloud if you feel safer doing that or you can record to a micro SD card slot it's also got night vision on it 1080p recording at 30fps they claim you can set it up in 60 seconds that seems ambitious to me advanced video recording as i mentioned micro SD amcrest MBR that's like a an actual recording box type situation or amcrest cloud there are alerts as well motion let's say or sound that's detected can get that notification and go hey I didn't expect anyone to be in that space at that particular time and then go ahead and look at the live feat see what's going on let's go ahead jump inside the box and take a closer look ok you gotta download an app on either the App Store Google Play so it will work with iOS or Android that the app is called am crestview light or pro I'm going to launch the lite version cool you'll notice there are multiple boxes that's because you can have more than one camera you guys are probably wondering Lew why you always talking about security cameras as some of you know I'm in this pretty cool office right now studio as we like to call it we have a lot of I don't know expensive gear in here the camera i'm talking into all these fancy monitors my eye in the sky and see what Jack's doing when I'm not here DC power audio in and out so you can actually send the audio from here out to a speaker and then you can send a separate microphone in if you don't want to use the built-in microphone that's kind of cool micro SD as i mentioned over here that's for recording locally to the actual device and then it has Wi-Fi but it also has an ethernet jack if you prefer for it to be wired in this on the back here is a speaker and then on the bottom is a tripod mount there's actually two way communication here so you could speak back to somebody on the other side and then through the microphone hear what they're saying so on but also inside the box a little tiny disk oh my goodness a ethernet cable for that wired connection that i mentioned earlier so this is another option for mounting here is where that thread lives you can screw this baby in and get whatever angle you want on the camera that's kind of cool fairly slim AC power brick for powering the device up so i'm gonna go ahead get this baby plugged in launch up the application and see what it can do name for the camera the jack cam monitoring Jack 24 7 apparently if I tap the QR i can just scan it hey try this out got it Wi-Fi password close your eyes and make a password for it okay look away once again whoa Jack 247 lens you have such a four cameras nine, sixteen snap a photo all ok with my hand hello where's me hello there that's really cool check he was we're getting some feedback because but now you can get it since for the tube two-way communication so I could be like over here Jack get back to get back to work the fact that you would take this audio output to like a seriously loudspeaker and and essentially have like a walkie talkie type environment you simply say listen I see you buddy you're in my spot I know you are leave now or it's over for you you see how intimidating i am right now we had filmed an entire unboxtherapy video right here this is not bad actually quality-wise now that's some real inception stuff right there it's me recording me recording me recording me recording me from the me Whoa!

    "description": "The Dell Ori is a foldable dual screen notebook that has some amazing features we haven't seen yet.  While its a concept at CES 2020, the Dell Duet is something a bit more final and boy is it cool, especially the way it handles a movable keyboard.

    "transcript": "so guys we're here once again at not CES as this is a Dells preview event and IRA's behind the camera because you know he said Mike if you go if you're really confident about these devices and if you are passionate about them you get in front of the camera and you start presenting so I might screw it up maybe maybe not but this is not a Dells book of war and peace this is actually what they call Ori and it's a foldable screen laptop this was more of a device that you're going to use as part of your digital lifestyle not 100% like a Productivity notebook but what they want here is your feedback again because it's a conceptual item our CES trip is sponsored by be quiet Phanteks Razer and Thermaltake without them none of this would have been possible one of the things that they work really really hard on is the hinge and I have to tell you even though this is a prototype it feels really really good the display that Dell is using is POLED or what is also called plastic OLED it's completely foldable and it can go closed like a book that helps it to stand on a table you can you know what the display looks absolutely stunning no matter which angle you look at it from but if you want to use it on your lap it can be used in a simple tablet mode and fold it into sort of like a semi notebook so it's a lot easier to interact with more comfortably one example of this is when using it for typing since the interaction is right there right on your lap reading a document or other things are pretty easy too with it in this mode but if you want to fold it back you can do so really really easily and it becomes your standard tablet again but what about my observations well I've been using it for a couple minutes here and one of the things that I was most impressed with is that even in this early version you can't actually see the crease in the screen but another thing you need to be aware of is that because it's a pole ed screen it can only be folded in a single direction so with this device right now you can't actually use it in a tent mode so two people can be viewing it from either side but like all other things here they want your feedback is this something that you could see yourself using is the keyboard in this position as well as the the slope screen something that you can see yourself manipulating and interacting with that's what they really really want to know so let us know in the it's below what you think of Ori and if it's something that you would use on a daily basis because personally I would rock this 100% because we can use it as a secondary screen for filming we can use it for taking notes it's not gonna be a full productivity laptop but it's going to do the job for many things that we need on a daily basis so the last thing I got really really excited about is this and this is called the duet now you're gonna hear some booms and bangs and everything around us there's like 20 people around me it looks like your typical dual screen notebook but what got me is this so this keyboard you can slap it on to the device and you can use it like this without a problem and then by pushing it up a trackpad shows itself and you can use the trackpad without any problems while still using the notebook to me this is what a dual screen notebook should be it's adaptable its quick to respond if you need to take off the keyboard and just store it somewhere else supposedly there's gonna be a place underneath to store it this is exactly what we would be looking for and again it's a concept but I want to know what you guys think about this the fact that you can remove the keyboard without a problem that you can manipulate the screen to me this is some really awesome stuff that could be coming in a near-future front though so until the next video I'm Mike Bernardo Canucks Ebers behind the camera and we will see you in the next one",

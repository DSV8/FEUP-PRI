    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today we are unboxing the Apple Polishing Cloth. The weird thing is everyone's making fun of it, but, it's weirdly out of stock everywhere and if you order it now, you're not gonna get it until January 15th of next year. Must mean that somebody bought them. Me, I did. And a lot of people did on Twitter. Some of them may have bought them as jokes, but, you guys, when I went through and bought my MacBook and I saw this polishing cloth as like an add-on, I didn't even think twice about it because I have one of these polishing cloths. I'm not sure if it's the same exact one, but I got two of them that came with my Pro Display XDRs. And it is by far, the nicest microfiber cloth that I have ever used. Obviously, because it came with two very, very expensive monitors and I was so impressed with the quality of it, initially when I first got it, I was like, this is the best cloth in the world, I wanna buy another one. So I went on Apple's website to buy another polishing cloth. And this was like maybe a year ago and I couldn't find it anywhere. So when I saw this pop up as an add-on to my MacBook Pro, I didn't even think twice about it. I was like, oh cool. I'm glad they're finally selling it. And then I hop on Twitter and saw, it was like a meme and people were making fun of it and I was like, make fun of it all you want, I am incredibly hyped up about this polishing cloth and I know what you're gonna say. Oh, Justine you're a sheep, you're wasting your money. You know what? This is something that I wanna spend it on. Do with that what you will. Let's unbox this polishing cloth. Let's see if there's anything on the back. Well, it has polishing cloth written in several different languages here. Safe for use on all Apple displays including nano-texture glass, which is good to know, because I do have the nano-texture on those Pro Display XDRs, so you do have to be very careful when you are cleaning these types of things, because you don't wanna be using anything that can actually damage it. So, approved for use on the Pro Display XDRs with nano glass. So much like most Apple products, it's got the little pull tab here, so we're gonna pull the tab. It's the same one. I'm so happy. Yeah. This is exciting. Safe for use on all Apple displays and surfaces. For infrequent cleaning and hard to remove smudges on nano-texture glass, a 70% alcohol solution may be used. That's actually good to know, because I, didn't know I could actually use that on the display. So, all right. So here it is. It's a piece of cloth, but it's a very nice premium piece of cloth. This cloth, is very, very nice. And of course it has an Apple logo on it. I know what you're gonna say. Oh, of course it had an Apple logo on it. You'll buy anything with an Apple logo on it. You're not wrong. Should I clean something with it? That's probably a good idea. Look at this. Do you wanna see? Can we get some smudge action? Can you even tell if that's smudgy? Look at that. You see that smudge? Look at that. No more smudge. I know what you're gonna say. Any random microfiber cloth, would be able to do the same thing. I mean, you're not wrong, but this is such a nice soft feel, and it has an Apple logo on it, and it was $20 and it's worth every penny of it. All, 2018 pennies of it. I was joking that I was gonna do an unboxing of this and honestly, I didn't even think that it was something that would be worthwhile, but I just wanted to show you that I bought this and I'm freaking proud of it. I will wear this as a badge of honor. I would buy some more of them and make a full outfit of it, but unfortunately, they're all sold out. And do you know why? Because this is premium quality, if I've ever seen it. And I'm sure now, you're probably gonna want one as well. Well, you can get one, next year. Let's see the exact date, of when this is available. I know you guys think I'm crazy, but this is the only thing that I really have ever used on my Pro Display XDRs, and when you're trying to clean something that is $7,000, you want it to be premium quality. You don't wanna be scrubbing that thing with some random cloth that's gonna leave dust all over the place. And that's what I liked about this one. Completely honest, this is incredibly sincere and genuine. I'm not making this up, because I've been using one of these for the past couple of years now and I thought it was so incredible and I wanted to buy another one and now that the opportunity is here, I have done so. $20, delivers January 11th through January 25th. That leads me to believe, that a lot of you, also bought yourself this polishing cloth as well. Whether it was for serious or for joke, you're gonna get this thing and you're gonna be like, wow, they're right, it's very nice. Since we're here and I'm already making a video, I got my AirPods in. These are the new AirPods three. And for my AirPods, I got them actually customized. So I wanna check these out. The ones that I had before obviously were a review unit and these ones are my very own. Customized them with my name and some emojis. I forget what emojis I got. I think there was a skull or maybe a pig. Oh my gosh, the font size is so big. It used to be a very tiny, thin font. Think I prefer the small, tiny, thin font better. This is very aggressive. The emojis are very big as well. So I did. Skull and a little pig. Yeah. So here they are. So I have been using the AirPods three for the past couple of days, weeks, I don't even know, I've lost track. I think it's been like a week and a half at this point. The fit is very different. I know a lot of you guys have probably received yours already, or you're thinking about it, and I would say, if you have tried the AirPods Pro, and you've kind of had some struggles with those, these are kind of a very similar size to those. And if the small original version of the AirPods, work perfect for your ears, there's a good chance these will work, and sometimes they don't. And it's really difficult because a lot of these headphones, which are kind of like the one size fits all, that's just impossible. The way that my ear shape is, they're very picky about the types of headphones that I can put in. But for whatever reason, those original pair of AirPods, are by far the best fit for my ears ever. The sound quality though, on this gen three, is so impressive. It is almost on par with the AirPods Pro. Now, if you do get these, you're gonna be missing out on, like the transparency mode and the noise cancellation, but the thing that I do like a lot about the newer ones, is the fact that the case and the earbuds are water resistant to an IPX4 rating. And I think that's actually awesome because I'm not gonna lie to you, I think all this time, I thought my case was more water resistant than it was. I have put those things through a lot. So I just kind of assumed, oh yeah, yeah, it's gonna be perfectly fine. I've never had any issues with it. Now just kind of thinking back, to all of the running and all of the traveling, I used to run in the rain all the time, and have my AirPods in my pocket and they've definitely got some exposure to water, and now these ones, I know for a fact, are way more weather resistant, that kind of gives me much better peace of mind when I'm traveling or running or working out or doing anything. But either way, it has been such a crazy tech season this October. There's been so many videos that I've wanted to make and I've honestly have just run out of time. I've been in the process of moving my studio, I've been visiting my family and also just so much has been going on in my personal life that it is absolutely overwhelming, trying to get all of this content out for you guys. So I'm just super grateful for you guys, who are always checking in, seeing how I'm doing, and also coming back here to my YouTube channel and always being so supportive in the comments. So you guys are awesome and I do have a bunch more videos planned. I'm also currently planning to do kind of like some follow-up videos on the Apple Watch, the MacBook, and then even the iPhone, cause it's been almost like a month and a half at this point, that the new iPhone has come out. I feel like the time has flown by so quickly and before you know it, it is gonna be next year and you'll be able to get yourself, your very own, polishing cloth. Anyway, if you guys are new here, hi, I'm Justine, I'm sure you have heard of the Apple obsessed fan girl. You can call me whatever you want, but I do cover a lot of other tech here, not just specific to Apple. So if you guys enjoy that type of content, give this video a thumbs up, be sure to subscribe so you can see any other videos that I post. Hit the bell, so you'll be notified when I post new videos and with that my friends, I'll see you in the next one. Bye. It'd be so funny if I wasn't recording. It'd be like hilarious. I would laugh so hard. It'd be so funny. (upbeat music)",

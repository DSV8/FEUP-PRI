Get your discounted VPN service using MrMobile's exclusive link:    [LG G7 Review]  The LG G7 is tough to wrap my brain around, even given the space of two videos in which to do it. On the one hand, the G7 packs some truly compelling differentiators: the old reliable wide-angle camera on the back; the new Boombox speaker system rumbling away beneath the Raspberry Rose paint; the return of both IP68 ingress protection and MIL-STD 810G ruggedization. On the other hand, its shaved off some battery in the transition from the previous generation; traded OLED for LCD; and sacrificed the G6s distinctive look and feel for a just-another-notched-phone aesthetic thats fine  but really no more than that.   So is it worth your money? That all depends on what the price tag says when it comes to US carriers in June. I do some speculating in that department at the end of Part 2 but until then weve got a lot of impressions to cover, from the offset earpiece to the still-there headphone jack. Join me for MrMobiles two-part LG G7 review, stretching from the shores of Jeju Island to the back alleys of Google I/O!     [G7 REVIEW PART 1]  LG G7 Review Part 1:    [SUBSCRIBE TO MRMOBILE]     [ABOUT MRMOBILE'S LG G7 REVIEW PART 2]  MrMobile's LG G7 Review Part 2 was produced following an additional two weeks with a second LG G7 review device provided by LG (after several days with a separate G7 review unit for Part 1). The device was a preproduction unit running prerelease software.   This video was filmed in part at LG Science Park, Seoul and on Jeju Island in South Korea, for which LG covered transportation and lodging as part of its Spring 2018 media tour.    MrMobile's LG G7 Review Part 1 is available at /theMrMobile on YouTube.

    "transcript": "- [Michael] Since part one of this review a couple weeks back the LG G7 has surprised me twice. One thing I thought would be a problem really wasn't, and another thing I never expected to give me trouble, did. Is that enough to make people sit up and take notice of the G7? Probably not. So its a good thing these cameras are here. I'm Mr. Mobile, welcome aboard to part two of the LG G7 review, brought to you by TunnelBear. (upbeat music) Going into this review, the battery was my biggest concern about the G7. I mean, 3000 milliamp hours just didn't seem big enough to carry me through a day. Whether I've got Qualcomm's tuning or LG's power management to thank, this was the more pleasant surprise. It held up better than I expected. Not that I'm saying it rivals a true road warrior. Look, if you need exceptional battery life what you need is a Huawei Mate 10 Pro or a Moto Z2 Play. By the end of the day on G7 I was usually down to the teens on my power meter. But it got me to the end of the day, which I really didn't expect. Especially given my typically heavy usage, which includes things like mobile hotspot and using super bright mode on the screen. A bit of my unpleasant surprise in a few minutes. First I want to list some of the smaller details that jumped out when I was using the G7, the little stuff. For one, that Google Assistant button on the side is actually pretty smart. You know how sometimes Assistant takes a beat to start listening once you invoke it? Well the G7 gives you a little haptic buzz when Assistant launches and a separate sharper vibration once it opens up the mike. That's very helpful for knowing exactly when to speak. Another nice thing about the button, you can double-click it to jump right into Google Lens, which came in handy on a Lens scavenger hunt Google put together at the zoo, during Google I/O. Point is, I'm glad the button is here. The Samsung Bixby, this is not. Few more details. The G7's haptics are great for an Android phone, right up there with the V30 and Note Eight. I also like that LG kept the chassis narrow for the G7 which makes one handed typing easier compared to wider phones like the one plus six. For a device that uses a rear-facing fingerprint sensor and features wireless charging, double-tap to wake and double-tap to sleep are crucial and I'm glad LG kept them around. For those who like a little LED with their notifications, this one is fun because in addition to blinking for alerts, it also flashes on system events, like airplane mode turning on, or when you pair the phone to a bluetooth headset. I love little touches like that. What I don't like is the sort of slow fingerprint sensor compared to other devices on the market, and occasional lag when tapping into the multi-tasking ribbon. Obligatory warning about this being a pre-production device running pre-release software, yeah, keep that in mind. Real quick, let's take one more trip up to notchville for the unwelcome surprise I teased before. Take a look at the earpiece, you notice how LG bumped it over a couple millimeters to make up for the selfie camera? Well it turns out that decades of phone talking have trained we humans to center a phone on the ear pretty perfectly and changing that by even a hair takes some getting use to on a call. Once you get it phone calls are fine. And I love the addition of an extra volume option in speaker phone mode. In the same vein, extra time with the boombox feature has totally sold me on it's utility. I mean you're never gonna mistake it for a bluetooth speaker or proper stereo, but find a good hard surface or better yet something hollow like a filing cabinet and boombox does live up to its name. (\"Bouquet\" by Pinback) When it comes to the camera I'm in about the same place as before. On the upside you know I'm always gonna be a superfan for that wide-angle lens which really does open up so many possibilities. Also, the main camera is pretty reliable even those spray and pray burst shots. And while super bright mode might you look like you're an early 90's glamour model, at least it makes a photo possible in the dark. Also I want to say once more that I'm glad this phone finally has a proper selfie shooter. But look, most of that is LG playing catch up, rather than bringing something new to the table. That even applies to the so-called AI mode, which is just automatic scene detection and usually adds so much saturation that even my tacky taste is put off. Annoyingly, LG has even removed one feature that made it's camera stand out, pop-out picture mode. In it's place we get portrait mode. Which okay, it popular, I get it. But I tend to like LG the most when it bucks trends, rather than belatedly trying to follow them. With other companies delivering some truly jaw-dropping cameras these days, I'm sad to say it, but the wide-angle is no longer enough. You'll notice folks that nowhere in the video have I yet mentioned the G7's ridiculous surname. Well if you'd like to thank you me for that, stick with me through the sponsor spot here, our last stop before the conclusion. This video is brought to you by TunnelBear. True story, its the first VPN I ever used, And I'm genuinely glad to sponsor it. TunnelBear lets you browse the web safely on a public hotspot which I'm on frequently and it lets you do it with a flick of a switch. TunnelBear even opened itself up to independent audit to prove its keeping its security promises. Mainly though, I gotta be real, I'm here for the mascot.

And since I dropped that sponsor URL it means, we're coming to a conclusion folks, and its a fairly simple one. If LG tries to price the G7 in line with other flagships at the seven to eight hundred dollar price tier, it doesn't have much to stand on. I mean the industrial design is nothing special, the camera doesn't stand out the way it used to, and the AI spin LG is trying to sell is, frankly, weak. Also, if the past is any indication, we're not likely to see the company put a lot of muscle into marketing this thing to Americans, which means only enthusiasts are gonna be aware of it. But, if the G7 hits the U.S. market at 650 dollars, like the G6 did, well its absolutely worth the attention of those enthusiasts, with a wide-angle camera and the boombox feature, that no one else is doing. I still yearn for the LG of days past, unafraid to go boldly in strange new directions. But maybe fitting in is the just cost of doing business in the smart phone space these days. What do you think of the G7? Let me know if its got a chance of pulling LG Mobile out of the red, in the poll attached to this YouTube video.

    "description": "I will review the new Apple MacBook Air and iPad Pro soon but here are some early thoughts on them! Looks like you can upgrade the Mac Mini with RAM but not storage this year.  Running the core i5-8200Y processor and 8 gigs of ram the New Apple MacBook Air is a fairly powerful laptop but priced at $1199, it's more expensive this year than it has been in the past.

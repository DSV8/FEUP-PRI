    "transcript": "in this box is what some seller on AliExpress called the I15 Pro Max which doesn't sound anything like iPhone 15 Pro Max but it cost only about 90 Canadian dollar so I am really excited to see what this thing looks like but first if you want to learn how to program apps for your own scam iPhone to sell on AliExpress today's video sponsor brilliant.org is the best place to gain the skills to do that just to clarify uh no one's endorsing that don't be naughty use your brilliant skills for good aside from the awesome new creative coding course you can try any of the thousands of lessons brilliant has to offer free for 30 days just visit the link brilliant.org or click the link below and the first 200 of you will get 20% off of brilliant's annual premium subscription oh it says Android on the back that's concerning it's a nice plain box and on the base it confirms we've got a 512 gig version of the I-15 Pro Max for less than 10% its retail price that is quite the bargain wow Apple has really started cheaping out on the packaging on their phones this is just a a plastic bag with some bar cones in it oh well at least they make up for the cheaper packaging with an included screen protector and cover ooh Apple you spoil us oh and you're getting a charger with it now I didn't think they did that with the new phones anymore not only that but you also get some dumpster airpods with it which I'm sure will sound great oh and it's nice to see the new USBC cable included with the I-15 good on you EU for intervening otherwise this would still be a lightning cable oh oh it feels so premium oh look at that purple it's Majestic oh why did they super glue foam around the power button I mean I I guess it's to protect the titanium but that really isn't coming off I I guess I'm going to have to use some cleaning liquor to get that off a bit later but let's all let that Minor Detail get in the way of our I15 Tour on the base of the phone we have no way Apple brought back the 3.5 mm Jack on this new I15 I'm assuming the EU had something to do with that as well it's a bit weird that the USBC Port isn't in the middle of the device but I guess Apple still getting used to the dimensions of the port oh that was a pretty good peel I've been so excited to see the new Dynamic Island and it has not disappointed you can tell that there is at least one camera in it it isn't even in the middle of it that wait a minute isn't this supposed to be like 6.7 in so I just checked the seller did indeed say it's a 6.7 in device cuz you know it's a pro Max but here is my I think it's an iPhone 13 not pro and they're basically the same size so that is that is definitely not a 6.7 in device and once the I15 was powered up it actually has a skin on it to make it look like an iPhone all jokes aside that is a pretty decent display considering what this phone is um and it's it's still got a the Safari browser in the bottom I wonder if you get the correct color bubbles with this phone that would be very interesting I will test that later because potentially you can use this to just catfish people on Tinder which will be really cool wow that is some high quality quality camera action but while playing around with the camera aside from some suspiciously wild specs 108 megapixels but I couldn't figure out how to switch between the three cameras on the back and then I had a closer look at them yeah you can tell there's just one sensor if you look closely at the one you can see the sensor but there's just nothing under the other two lenses and the one camera it does have apple clearly salvaged from a '90s CCTV camera cuz the quality real Blair Witch projecty are you having fun I then tried out the couple of features on the phone's homepage like face on loock wow that actually worked that's impressive and its unders screen fingerprint sensor which was initially promising cool that also worked but then I tried to figure that I hadn't added yet okay never mind never mind it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor in it not only did my nose work even my cat's pole worked to unlock the screen so it's definitely just lying about that functionality I've spent ages trying to just do stuff on this phone and it's basically not a usable smartphone the main reason for this is because it just refuses to log into your Google account there is a Google Play app on it but if you click on it the signin button just ignores you until you get bored and go away I also onto the browser and try to download apps through their website but that still needs you to log into your Google account and it just flat out refuses to do that I guess Google just immediately recognizes it is a massive security threat and refuses to engage with it like it's someone flinging feces on a bus but what's the point of having an I-15 Pro max if you can't spend 15 hours a day playing Candy Crush on it but it does have a web browser so you can watch YouTube videos but this is the closest you can get to having them go full screen oh the audio and the video are already wildly out of sync for some reason aside from that it comes with Google Maps pre-installed on it which also doesn't work it tells you to update it you update it and then it still tells you to update it and it just never works uh so you can't use it to navigate although on the bright side it's not all bad I did drop a SIM card in here and was able to have a terrible quality phone call using the phone I mean that would make sense right if the microphone is really bad it would mean that so you can do that with it but but the text bubbles are green so you can't use this to pretend to have an iPhone to up your chances on Tinder which I feel like is the whole point of the phone so that's a bit disappointing however it does technically meet the minimum requirement for it to be considered a cell phone maybe not a smartphone but a cell phone so that's good Okay so we've established that basically nothing works on it but I was still curious to see what kind of specs we're actually working with in this phone because well the spe specs it lists are shockingly high-end and this is not a high-end device now finding out what the real specs were weren't that easy cuz I couldn't download a third-party app onto the phone to check because of you know the whole Google account issue but I was able to do a whole workaround so that I could plug this into a PC and check its specs through that and according to that software the S so or processor in here is a mediatech mt6582 with Android version 5 on it which I guess explains the whole Play Store issue and then we have 12 gigs of storage in it so it's pretty much a 10-year-old budget phone that's had a frontal labotomy done on it and then was put in a case that makes it look a bit like an iPhone 15 if it's 200 M away from you and you're squinting at it so yes the $90 I-15 Pro Max from AliExpress is basically manufactured garbage who would have seen that coming which brings me to the end of another very useful video thank you for watching sub to the channel if you like and until the next one

    "description": "I wanted to do this video precisely because no one was asking for it  and I think that's kind of sad. Because the Palm Centro was part of a legacy that laid so much of the foundation for what became the modern smartphone  and at the same time, it was also the last of its kind.  Weve talked about the Palm brand on this series before: PalmOS powered that Samsung SPH-i500 flip smartphone from 2003. And yes, someday we will talk about the companys most tragically celebrated trailblazer, 2009s ill-fated Palm Pre  a device so epic in ambition that its influence is still felt today.But in order to turn that corner, Palm needed to maintain market share (and, you know, money). So in 2007, it crammed its popular Treo smartphone into a much smaller casing, called it the Centro, and sold it for $99 on contract.   The result was a phone that sold a million units in less than half a year  and served as my final college smartphone just when I was trying to turn a corner of my own.   [SUBSCRIBE TO MRMOBILE]     [ABOUT WHEN PHONES WERE FUN  PALM CENTRO]  This is the fifteenth in a series of MrMobile videos exploring the mobile tech world's most vibrant period in design and experimentation.

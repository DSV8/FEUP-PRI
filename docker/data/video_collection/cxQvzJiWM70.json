    "transcript": "- So breaking news, good news to share with you, Cisco have come to the table, Cisco going to sponsor some giveaways. So a big shout out to and thanks to Cisco for their sponsorship. (upbeat music) Now Cisco have recently created a new CCNA study group. I suggest that you use this link or the link below to join the official Cisco CCNA study group. Cisco study groups are a fantastic place to share information with others and also learn from people such as David, here, who is a fantastic contributor to the Cisco community. So learn from one another but also learn from people who have been in the industry for a long time. They can help you with your problems. They can help you when you get stuck when studying for the CCNA exam. So I strongly suggest that you join the Cisco study group newly created by Cisco for the 2020 CCNA exam. (upbeat music) Welcome to day four of the David Bombal Christmas giveaway. Today one person will win access to the CompTIA Security+ Boson ExSim exam simulation software. So if you're studying for your CompTIA Security+ exam, this software will help you pass the exam. The value of this software is 99 US dollars. Now I'm hoping that you're enjoying these giveaways. If you are, please consider subscribing to my YouTube channel. Please like the video and please click on the bell to get notifications when I post a new video. For some of these giveaways you have to be really quick. I'm only giving away a few copies of software or courses, so if you're not one of the first people to watch the video then you'll lose out. So make sure that you click on the bell to get notifications so that you know when I post a new video so that you have a better chance of winning. I've got another giveaway. Cisco is sponsoring one copy of Wendell Odom's Official Cert Guide. If you wanna win, Wendell Odom's Official Cert Guide for the CCNA exam, then use the link below. I'm also giving away one copy of the CCNA ExSim software from Boson, also $99 as well as two copies of the Boson NetSim Network Simulation software valued at $179. There isn't that much time before the CCNA certification changes in February. So hopefully this will help some of you pass your CCNA exam before the exam changes occur. But even if you don't manage to pass your exam in time, Boson have a free upgrade policy. So if you've purchased either the NetSim or ExSim software, after June this year you get a free upgrade to the next release of the CCNA software from Boson. So one person will win access to the Security+ ExSim software, one person will win access to the CCNA ExSim software, and two people will win access to the NetSim Network Simulation software. But hold on a minute, the first 40 people that use this link will win access to my Python for Network Engineers course. First 40 people that click on this link will get free access to my Python Network Automation and Network Programmability course. If you're trying to learn how to automate networks then this is the course for you. I teach you practically how to use protocols such as Telnet and SSH to programmatically change network devices. You'll configure VLANs. You'll configure routing protocols and other things on Cisco routers and switches using Python. Network automation is the future. It's something that you need to learn. It's even part of the CCNA now. But this course shows you practically how to configure network devices using Python. I'm David Bombal once again coming to you from a very sunny but very windy beach in South Africa. I wanna wish you all the very best. (upbeat music)",

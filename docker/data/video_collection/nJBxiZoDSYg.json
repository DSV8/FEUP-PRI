Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring tried to make the future before it was ready.

    "transcript": "(crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) - This is the story about a device that changed technology. Nope, not that device. - Every little pocket device in the future is going to have a fast, inexpensive internet connection and you're going to use it for voice and data and transactions and so on. - Just that audacity of a group of eight people making a phone, you know. It's like eight people is like a dinner party. - Yeah. - So imagine your next dinner party and the host says, \"Hey, let's make a phone.\" - One of the venture capitalists literally wrote a check to Jeff saying, \"I'm invested,\" before we had a set of slides. - There weren't chips that you could go buy. You couldn't go to the market and say, \"build me one of these things.\" - We took off like a rocket. Everybody wanted this product. Now, guess what? You can take a photo right on this thing and send it to somebody. And they said, \"nah, we don't want to do that. Our other devices can't do that.\" - And we look back at it and we felt it was like a Camelot period. When you're that exhilarated and you come to work jazzed every day. (crowd laughing) - That was it? - Jeff, Donna, Ed, I mean, they were mentors. They were cheerleaders. It was really more like a family. - This is the story of the people whose ideas are inside the phones that we use every day. Over 20 years ago, nobody believed them. Not the company that they worked at, not the carriers that sold millions of phones a year, not even Steve jobs. - Steve got up to the white board and he said, here's what the future's going to look like. - So I get on the board, I said, \"Steve, I think you're wrong.\" And I got up and I wrote on the board next to his and I said, \"okay, we have a different view of the future.\" Here's a handout computer in the center. - We made the decision. We're going to go for the future. So we had this roaring growth and it just cratered.",

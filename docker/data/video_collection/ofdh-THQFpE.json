    "transcript": "hello good people I'm Dmitry and for the last few days I have not been editing and I have not been building anything cool I've just been sucked into Adobe premiere's latest update with their whole hardware acceleration so I've been testing multiple hardware so I want to show you guys how you can save a lot of time using this hardware acceleration if you are on an Intel machine and are an adobe premiere user sometimes i wonder how people imagine what editing for me is like damn amazing edit where in reality it's more like this huh what music should I use two L's later oh I think I found a good track or maybe not all right so this whole experimentation began with me not necessarily experiencing the smoothest editing experience on my rising machine inside Adobe Premiere so I swapped out to Intel popped in the coffee lake i5 8600K that is fantastic for games but in fact Ryzen was slightly faster in exporting 4k video and significantly faster exporting to 1080p video but then Adobe rolled out a lovely update that allows for additional hardware acceleration for Intel's 6th generation plus so your skylake cabling and calculate processors that allows the full utilization of the Intel graphics that's built into the processor for encoding and decoding for significantly faster export times and so we wanted to dig deeper and really explore the full power potential of this latest update of utilizing the IGP and your Intel CPU to really speed up render times so let me guide you through the entire process right after this are you ready ok watch this so that is what the components must feel like inside the H 500 P managed by Coolermaster check it out in the description below alright so this whole hardware acceleration begins with Adobe's 12.1 update that enables hardware acceleration to be actually built into Adobe Premiere Pro and you can see it in encoder settings and allows you to actually select hardware acceleration or just simply software acceleration it basically would utilize an otherwise idle integrated graphics on your Intel chip 6 generation and higher and actually use that graphics horsepower to accelerate encoding now I want to clarify that in my most recent barrage of tweets praising Adobe for this update because the rendering improvements are so significant I refer to this acceleration as quick sing support where in fact we don't actually know what's happening in the background for this hardware acceleration so Adobe could be using quick sync function block to accelerate encoding and decoding because quick sync is so efficient because it's designed to do that one thing so well but they could also be using some form of OpenCL acceleration for the Intel uHD or HD graphics so if they respond to us regarding this clarification about hardware acceleration we'll make sure to let you know in the comments below and so first we must enable the info graphics on your Intel processor make sure that your Intel processor actually has Intel graphics otherwise you will not be able to take advantage of this additional hardware acceleration so you'll need to access the BIOS and enable this integrates in side for some reason on Asus model boards it's listed as multi-monitor support so just make sure that is enabled and boot back into the system the next thing in task manager you still will not be able to see your Intel graphics enabled there because you need to install the latest Intel drivers so just navigate to your processors name and make sure you download the Intel graphics for Windows 10 and restart the system and BAM now we can actually see both GPUs and we can now go back into Adobe and enable hardware acceleration and by default Adobe sets appropriate encoding settings based on the available hardware so if you have an eye GPU available for Adobe to use based on those steps of actually enabling it in the BIOS and downloading the right drivers then you have hardware acceleration is enabled by default otherwise it'll revert to software only and it's actually quite impressive while rendering a video seeing CPU utilization your GPU utilization and the integrated graphics from Intel also working together to output that video file much faster all right so here's the first performance graph we are rendering in one minute forty sequence out into 4k again so we have hardware acceleration and blue and software acceleration in gray now keep in mind that software acceleration uses both open CL or CUDA acceleration depending on the graphics card so that gives you a bit of reference point however the performance improvement with hardware acceleration while it's using the integrated graphics is actually pretty substantial and so in percentages were spending about 16% less time on the MacBook Pro about 20% on the coffee Lake system with both our RX 480 and the GTX 1080 about 28% on the skylake machine and we're literally cutting down our render times in half when that gigabyte air of 15 X and so all those integrals are utilized and really brings that notebook to like desktop performance level as a video production monster and if you guys want to check out that review I'll be right over here moving on to a larger 13 minute 4k project so the time difference here again between hardware and software acceleration is pretty significant about 30% time saved on my coffee like machine 36% on my skylake machine and again we're cutting down the render times in half with that arrow 15 X notebook and what's interesting about these numbers is just how close the Intel graphics brings all this Hardware together so you know our notebook for example it's takes the longest on the software side one is just using the CPU and the CUDA acceleration on the gtx 1070 but it really shrinks down that render time when you enable net Intel graphics it's pretty fantastic but what about a notebook that does not have a discrete GPU and it only the CPU and it's integrated graphics well I've tested both skylake coffee lake and the XPS 13 and the results are a little bit surprising so check this out software acceleration on all machines was faster in outputting our one minute file not by much but in my observations in software encoding we are utilizing more of the CPU and it's still using the IGP because the OpenCL is still enabled in the Adobe Media encoder but I noticed that the CPU usage was higher and potentially maybe that's why things are exporting faster when we're using software only method whereas the hardware method did not use as much of the CPU itself and obviously utilized the full IGP you that was available for the encoder and you may be wondering why the coffee like machine is slightly slower than our skylake machine so the skaldak processor is a fork or a thread part versus only six core six thread part on the coffee like machine so the additional threads I think help with encoding when you're using you know CPU and the IGP only without a discrete GPU now many of you may see these graphs and say sure you're rendering something so much faster but what about the quality degradation obviously there must be some sort of compromise right and so I used the YouTube 4k export preset at 40 megabits per second the output files both the sizes and the bitrate was identical on both so there's no difference there however when I did screenshots from the hardware accelerated output video versus software accelerated output video and overlaid them in the exact same frame in Photoshop and shows the opacity to difference there was no difference even if you zoom in to like 500% that's where you start to potentially notice slightly more blotchiness on the hardware acceleration versus like the smoother stuff on the software accelerate file but the difference once it's uploaded to YouTube will be negligible and you rather save the time on the export then pixel peep something that you will not even be able to notice when it goes out to the world to see and so this whole thing has been very exciting because I was actually thinking of ditching Adobe Premiere altogether because the rendering difference has not been improving for ages now but I feel like with this added acceleration support using you know Intel graphics it really does bring Adobe Premiere to a competitive level with rendering times for you know Davinci resolve and also Final Cut Pro X not exactly on their terms and they're like compatibility for hardware and optimization but it is definitely getting better and I'm going to put this charge for the conclusion you know Rison has been fantastic and it's a really good value platform but with this whole rollout of hardware acceleration using Intel graphics it really makes sense to switch to Intel for Adobe Premiere for our needs because the rendering performance is so much faster without losing quality and I really want an 8700K because we double the threads and so I feel like performance will be even better of like one to one rendering versus my sequence to the output render times that is what I want to see moving forward all right so I'm gonna leave it here let me know what you think of the results and if you are on an Intel platform with a compatible CPU with infographics let me know what type of accelerated results you get with hardware acceleration and you know I still love Rison but if you are potentially thinking like a 2700X or an 8700k the question that's been asked so many times for me in the last week or so you know potentially this could not you in the direction if you are considering going for Premiere Pro for video production so thanks so much for watching I'm Dimitri make sure to check out this other relevant content and we'll see you in the next video this video ran there so fast I'm excited whoo",

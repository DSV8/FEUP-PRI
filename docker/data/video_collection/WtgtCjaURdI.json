    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Today we're checking out not one, but two brand new gimbals from DJI. This is the RS 2, and we've also got the RSC 2. So we're gonna first start with the RS 2 because I've actually unboxed this and I've been using it on a few shoots already. Then we will check out the RSC 2 and then we'll go outside and test both of them out. The RS 2 is the most powerful, small size handheld stabilizer that DJI has developed yet. It is significantly lighter than the Ronin-S, but it's still powerful enough for larger setups and even medium sized cinema cameras. I have actually been using this for a little bit before I sat down to make this video, and we have been incredibly impressed with it. I love that it has a built-in touchscreen, so you can use this to adjust settings and it displays a live camera view when using ActiveTrack. This does require using the RavenEye Image Transmission System. This lets you wirelessly transmit to your phone. It'll give you a 1080p view and a transmission up to a 100 meters. Set up and balance on this thing has actually been really seamless. It has this new dual layer quick-release plates that you can set up quickly without having to rebalance every single time. These little fine tuning adjustment knobs are so amazing for getting precise balance. Before you would always be nudging things here and there, and then you'd go a little bit too far, you'd mess everything up, and then all of your hard work of trying to balance just goes right out the window. There's also some really cool accessories that you can get for this to attach to car mounts, jibs, and even sliders. I've always loved the built-in creative functions, and this also includes some like Time Tunnel, Motionlapse, Timelapse, panorama, and more of which you can find right on the touchscreen. You can get up to 12 hours of battery life and it supports 24 watt fast charging. So in just an hour and a half, you can get a full charge. This is pretty impressive, considering the size and weight of the battery has been reduced by about 50%. But the other thing that I love about this is its a little carrying case. This is so small, so compact, that you can break this down and fit everything that you need right in here. Now let's unbox the RSC 2. Here we go. So this is a pre-release packaging, obviously it's not gonna have this taped on it. (knife scraping the box) (gasps) It has a carrying case. It's, yes! Oh, look at this. It's like the same style. I think it's basically the same case. Look at that. (zipper grinds) This looks like a transformer. (gimbal scraping) I need to figure some things out before we continue. So the RS 2 is a more entry level stabilizer that has a new foldable design. So you can transform it into six different configurations for various shootings scenarios and for convenient storage. There's upright, flashlight, portrait, under sling, briefcase, and storage. There's a built-in front dial right above the trigger. So this lets you adjust the camera's focus when paired with a focus motor. This also has the same dual layer quick-release plates, like the RS 2 that works with Manfrotto and Arca-Swiss. There's a new mechanical three axis lock as well. It has a built-in one inch OLED screen to check gimbal status or adjust settings. You can get up to 14 hours of battery life with the two built-in 18,650 cell batteries that are 3,500 milligrams each. This has 18 watt fast charging and will fully charge in about an hour and a half, and 80% in one hour. Both of these have DJI's new Titan Stabilization Algorithm, which is their next gen stabilizing tech to get even smoother shots. There's also a super smooth function that can be activated for increased motor capacity and torque for even more stable shots, even when using a hundred millimeter equivalent focal length blends. So now that we have all of that out of the way, let's get both of them side by side and just take a little look. First of all, this is obviously made for higher end cameras. You can get a much higher payload on this. The red and the carbon fiber finish on this looks so good. You could obviously tell if this is well equipped for a larger camera because you have so much more space compared to this one. So when you're kinda deciding on which one you're gonna get, it really does depend on, first of all, what's your budget and what kind of camera are you gonna be putting on this thing? Honestly, for us, I feel like most of the time, this is kind of our setup. But what I like so much about this is being able to fine tune your adjustments. So there's these little knobs right here, as you can see when you turn this knob, the plate moves, and this will let you get very, very fine tuned adjustments to make sure you're getting the most stable and perfectly even. So here they are. Let's take them out for a test. (upbeat music) Do you think I look cool? I mean, I'm wearing two patterns of camo and some really cool cheetah shoes. Honestly, I would be friends with myself. So this is the first time that we're bringing them outside. And this one is definitely heavier. I really love how light this is and I can just easily manipulate it. And this one, we actually have hooked up to the RavenEye. We have ActiveTrack already set up. This will also send a signal to my phone when I do have it connected to the RavenEye. But it's cool because this is actually a touch screen. The other difference between the two is the RS 2 does have a touch screen, and the other one does not. It has a very small display screen, which will still let you view settings, but you can't touch to control. And then here is the RSC 2. I am gonna be gonna a trip for the first time in seven months. So I'm gonna take this one with me because this one does fold down to a really nice little storage contraption. I can't figure out the words that I wanna say. It folds down to be small. This one actually folds down to be pretty small too, but I can't take both. Tyler, what if I take RSC 2, you take RC 2, and you can get some cool shots of your kiddy, some Ronan cat and whatever other adventures you might get into over the weekend. Cool, weekend, Ronan, fun, commence. (upbeat music starts) (upbeat music continues) (light melodic music) (soft upbeat music) Made it to Maryland. Tyler just sent me some of the stuff that he shot while he was out with RS 2, and I have the RSC 2. And we're gonna go out and get some shots, and hopefully we can make Tyler proud because he shot some really cool content. Are you ready, Jen? - [Jen] Yeah. - Let's go. (soft upbeat music) Thank you guys so much for watching this video. I hope that you enjoyed it. Lemme know if you guys have any other questions. We will be in the comments answering those. And if you wanna get any more information about them, other than what I've showed you in this video, because there's so much more that I didn't get a chance to cover, there will be links in the description. So you guys can go check it out. I do plan on doing a followup video and a lot of the stuff that I do shoot in a lot of our daily videos, we do use the DGI Ronin. So I'm very excited to test these out and you will see these in action in many future videos. So with that being said, I have nothing else to say. End! (soft upbeat music)",

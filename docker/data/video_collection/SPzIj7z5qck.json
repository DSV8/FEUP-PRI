    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin'? As retro consoles get older, it becomes more likely for their internal components to fail, but troubleshooting can often be time-consuming. So this time, let's take a look at a tool that promises to be a big help. [ Music - Intro ] This is the Genesis Diagnostic Cartridge from Retro Gaming Arts, who sent it my way to review. As its name suggests, it's for running low-level tests on SEGA Genesis consoles. It uses a custom-designed circuit board with programming that can check a few different parts of the console for faults. When you drop the cartridge in and turn the console on, you're presented with several screens of options. One of them gives you some basic information about the system, and another can show you the status of the controller ports and the expansion port on the side. Another screen is just for sound test, where it'll play samples so you can check if the FM, Programmable Sound Generator, and Digital to Analog converter sections... [\"SAY-GAA!\"] are all working right. Perhaps the most useful troubleshooting screen is the one for the RAM. It'll test each type separately: the 64 kilobytes for the main Motorola processor, the 64K for the video chip, and the 8K for the Z80 co-processor. There are also some additional screens for advanced debugging or testing, like intentionally triggering illegal operations in the CPU, or reading and writing data directly against the RAM. A nice addition are the test patterns that the cartridge can display. This can, of course, help you figure out if there's a hardware problem, but they can also useful for adjusting the TV the console is plugged into. There's a few for color, sharpness, and patterns, along with one for overscan. A lot of TVs will crop in on the image a bit to make sure it fills the screen, but that means you can lose part of the picture. So this test screen can help you adjust your TV if you want. So, who is this cartridge for? It's a pretty specialized tool, and the average retro gamer isn't likely gonna need it. But it could be interesting to anyone who mods, repairs, or resells Genesis consoles. I don't have a Model 3 unit to test it with, but it worked just fine on my Model 1 and 2 systems. There is one pretty obvious caveat with this tool, and it's that the console needs to be at least kinda working. If it doesn't power on or display video, you're own on your own to sort that out. But if you work with these consoles frequently, this cartridge might save you a decent chunk of time and frustration. At a price of $50 US though, it's up to you to figure out if the convenience is worth it. I owe a thank you to Retro Gaming Arts for sending a test cart my way to check out. I'll include a link in the description if you're interested. If you like the video, I'd appreciate a thumbs-up and be sure to subscribe.

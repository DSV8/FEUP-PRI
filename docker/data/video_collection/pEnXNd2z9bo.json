    "transcript": "So you are looking at the new MacBook Pro! The one with the The touch bar. This is the 15 inch model. You know what, for some reason this thing has been controversial. A lot of people have made videos. I just received mine, it was a custom order. This one has all the specs, It's like five grand. Is it worth five grand? No. Definitely not, alright? But, for the purpose of this video, for the purpose of this channel, It's an interesting thing to cover as a topic. So, whatever. But for the average person. They're looking at this thing and going: \"Why would I get that instead of a used car?\" And that makes sense! You don't need to be paying this much money for computing power these days. Especially when you're... you're looking at a product that, In many people's eyes has given up some of the versatility of the previous version. BUT! I'm going to give you some of my thoughts on this thing as I open it up here. Why I think Apple is doing what they're doing here. And why this still might be a good machine for you. As you know, with Apple you get a very expensive unboxing experience as well. It's very special. You can see on the back here, this one, 2.9 GHz. So It has the upgraded processor. 16 Gigs of RAM. Now this is uh... This is something I was reading about that actually does kind of bother me a little bit. Only the ability to get 16 Gigs rather than 32. It's soldered onto the motherboard now so it's not like you're gonna be able to upgrade that in the future. So if you need more RAM, it ain't happening here! :( The Radeon Pro 460, So the graphics are one of the areas where there is a substantial improvement. And not much of an argument between this version and the previous one. And I have the 2 Terabyte SSD in here, which is gonna be nice! It's an incredibly exorbitant amount of money! I think that upgrade alone is about 1400 dollars. Let's crack inside the box here. *Cutting the plastic wrap* *plastic wrap peeling* *Sniffs* Ooooooh! It definitely feels slimmer than the old version. The Apple logo no longer lights up. It's got this mirrored finish, like the 12 inch MacBook. And the other thing you're gonna notice is the ports. No more versatility there. You have thunderbolt 3 in the form of this USB type C connector. And you've got a headphone jack. AND THAT'S IT! USB type-C connector, cable, the laptop. No more MagSafe. That's kind of uh, that's kind of a let down, right? Magsafe, you kick it, it pops out. In technology you're always making compromises right? Size, battery life. Uh, thinness, portability, power. It's always a give and take relationship. In this case, you've got better throughput, in exchange, you no longer have the convenience of the MagSafe connector. 87 Watt USB-C power adapter. That's all that's in there! Another thing to mention about this one is no more power switch - so you lift it up, And it turns on. Before I boot it up, I just wanna do a quick comparison here with the older version. So what you'll notice, beyond the fact that it's a tiny bit thicker, is that the footprint is actually larger as well! How significant is it? Not major. So the previous Mac book. SD card slot, Full size HDMI, and a USB port, Old-Fashion style. Compared to two Thunderbolt-3s and a headphone jack And then the other side of the laptop: two USB type C connectors for your Thunderbolt-3 and then here we got MagSafe, two Thunderbolt-2s, a USB and a headphone jack. From a throughput perspective, with four Thunderbolt-3 ports you can do some things that you wouldn't be able to do here with the two ports or with the slower speed USB connector. Yes, you may have to adapt these for your current peripherals I think it's only a short matter of time before we see maximum throughput, hard drives and such that can take advantage of these ports. This laptop can output to two seperate 5K monitors. Right, or three 4K monitors. from a laptop! That's one of the benefits of having all of this Thunderbolt access. Almost a terabyte of data in five minutes over this port. That affects my daily life! Oooh *opens laptop lid* And it just boots up straight away. It does have Touch ID so you can log in with your fingerprint, if you'd like. The trackpad is gigantic, I'm just noticing now. It is clicky! It's clicky and it's loud. But it's just very low travel. Right? Not very much key travel there. Now the trackpad is of course the Taptic version there's no physical click there. You can now use your fingerprint, not just to unlock the Mac, but also to make purchases. Close it... Goes to sleep. Pop it back open... Touch ID... BOOM!!!!! Now, I noticed I can hit this button here and expand the multimedia controls here. Now this Touch Bar will adapt to whatever application you're using. If it's Final Cut Pro, for example, you'll see a timeline in there. You can get emoji in there. But I mean... that's kinda the thing I think is gonna take some getting used to and experimentation to truly figure out.. New MacBook Pro. Old MacBook Pro. Trackpad. It's almost doubled the size, to be honest, measured diagonally. *clicking the space bars* New one has more of a thump to it. Also, the screens, they're both at full brightness now and you should be able to tell that the new screen is more vibrant. There's much more detail that you can make out in the trees. It's a brighter screen, so... Now the speaker grills look similar but I have heard some very nice things about the sound... Maximum volume, Old MacBook Pro. *Music playing from old MacBook Pro* Okay, new MacBook Pro *Music playing from new MacBook Pro* [Lew is satisfied] [Lew making strange noises] There's a little thump to it! a little bit of low end in there! *Music from new MacBook Pro* Speakers are way better. Should you be upgrading if you got the old one? Probably not... You can make the argument, it's more versatile with all of the ports that are available. SD card slot and stuff like that. Are there some improvements to the new one? Sure, right? You've got the nicer screen, you've got all of this Thunderbolt 3 throughput IF you can use it. But this thing is more than five grand. For most people, they'd be better suited with a used car and their old MacBook. Just remember, it's a want. It's not gonna all of a sudden do something for you that the old one couldn't. But that said, there's a bunch of people out there that just want to have the latest and greatest, myself included. They are happy to sell at a high margin to a customer who has a lot of money to spend. That's their game! Who can evaluate value, right? It's so subjective, it's so personal. I mean this entire package is very nice, and it has been in the past but it still is. It's a very nice package. How much is that worth to you?",

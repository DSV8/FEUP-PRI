    "transcript": "One of the most common questions I receive about the Flipper Zero is to do with distance. How far away can I capture signals and transmit signals? There's been comments about David your demonstrations are bad because you always have a device right next to you but that's because I'm recording something but the point I want to make in this video is people such as Rabbit Labs have been creating amazing boards that allow you to extend the distances of for instance sub-gigahertz signals. This is the flux capacitor from Rabbit Labs basically a CC 1101 board that allows you to extend the range dramatically using for instance a small antenna like that or a very large antenna. I've actually purchased one from Etsy but Rabbit Labs comes highly recommended by Talking Sasquach lots of boards available for the Flipper Zero. Here's the official developer board NRF boards are available as well. In other words don't limit yourself to thinking that the distance of a Flipper Zero is limited by what the Flipper Zero can do there are many boards out there that you can purchase including fantastic boards from Rabbit Labs.",

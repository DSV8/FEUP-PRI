    "transcript": "When you log into a Linux computer by default you are in your home directory so as an example if I type pwd you can see I'm in /home/kali the tilde is also showing us that so we can see where we are on an Ubuntu I can see somethingsimilar I'm in home David and the tilde shows me that. If I move away so let's say I go to the root directory I am currently in root I can get back to the home directory by either doing it the hard way by typing /home/kali and now I'm back in my home directory and I'll go back to root I could type cd tilde and that takes me back to my home directory but there's an even easier way so I'll go back to root and I'll clear the screen so I'm in the root directory now and all I need to do is type cd enter and now I'm in my home directory so on Ubuntu as an example I'll type cd root I'm now in my root directory I'll simply type cd enter and notice I'm back in my home directory. Great shortcut to remember if you want to go back to your home directory simply type cd",

    "transcript": "- $37,750. Just take the zero off. Buying used computers has been around since the day after the very first person ever upgraded their PC. It's a chance to save some money compared to buying the whole system brand new or you can effectively subsidize the cost of your new system by selling the old one all without creating any e-waste. - But whatever your reason for buying or selling on the used market and regardless of wherever you choose to browse, it's safe to bet that you are gonna come across some ridiculous ads, crazy prices, bad part combos, poorly written ads. - [Anthony] Oh yeah. - [Jake] It's all fair game for us to roast. - Oh yeah, let's go. - But not before I make this awful segue for you guys to roast to our sponsor. - Waveform. Weak cell signal, check out the Cel-Fi GO X signal booster. Sold and supported by waveform. The GO X is the only booster with a hundred decibel gain, giving you more coverage and blazing fast data rates, learn more at the link below. (upbeat music) - [Jake] Okay, so this one's being sold for $3,000. - [Anthony] Or best offer. - [Jake] Yeah. okay, that's important. - [Anthony] Being sold on eBay too. RGB gaming PC custom build ultimate desktop bundle. - [Jake] I finished this build in February of 2022 and I am very proud of it. Good for you, dude. This was my dream build where I spared no expense on parts. - No expensive. - [Jake] Shipping is included in the price. Man. - [Anthony] Oh. - [Jake] I would not recommend buying things off Craigslist that end up having to be shipped. - [Anthony] If you're interested in seeing the RGB functions DM me for my Tiktok link. (both laughing) - [Jake] 3060 Ti, 400 bucks. So, you got a $400 GPU. You got like 200 bucks in RAM. - (Indistinct) - It only comes with a 250 gig SSD, spared no expensive. Your (beep) is just not worth this much money. It's got more in RGB than it does graphics card. - [Anthony] Gaming and Desktop PC computer, Intel i7 GT 710. - [Jake] Oh no! - 1 terabyte HHD with Dell monitor, 16 gigabytes of RAM. Oh, it's a four by three display, I love it, it's adorable. - [Jake] PS2. - [Anthony] PS2. Well, you know what? PS2 is not bad. - Okay, what's the specs? - i7-3770. - [Jake] It's not bad. - If you look at the location of the 12 volt connector for the CPU, this is definitely an OEM board. - [Jake] Yeah, so I mean look at... - So this was an office PC that was thrown into a gaming PC chassis and called a gaming PC. - Really I think the best value proposition here is this monitor. - [Anthony] Yeah. - Really kinda rounds it out. We're gonna move over to Kijiji, for you American folks, Kijiji is a Canadian equivalent sort of to Craigslist just with a little bit newer UI and just as crazy stupid (beep) on it. - [Anthony] This is an Alienware X17 R1 with a 165 watts. - [Jake] So, this guy must go to LAN parties. - [Anthony] Yeah, 11th gen i9. So, it's got a four terabyte SSD. - [Jake] So this, brand new, newer version of this set, it's got a 3080 Ti, a little bit better, it's got a newer CPU that's gonna have a bunch more cores. I think it's 14 versus 8. Everything else is the same, is substantially less money. I think this guy just missed the memo that used gaming laptops are worth practically (beep) all. - Well, this is what I paid for like two years ago. (Jake laughs) Actually would've been one year ago. - You should sell the case separately, dude, you'll get more money for it. - [Anthony] Complete VR desktop for $450. excuse me? - [Jake] 450 Canadian, 350 US. Oh, it's an OptiPlex. - [Anthony] Is, is this actually a good deal? - [Jake] It's a 1050, 8 gigs RAM. - [Anthony] I don't see a graphics card. - Monitor has large scratch on the screen. - [Anthony] But it still works great. - [Jake] No, it doesn't have a graphics card. - So, Intel HD VR. - Is this a joke? - What VR headset is that? That's Samsung odyssey VR, wait, does it have the controllers? - Okay, so this guy clearly just bought this to watch (beep). - Yeah, like the... where are the controllers? I don't see controllers. - [Jake] Well, you don't need the controllers where we're going, honey. (Anthony laughs) - Especially after you got that scratch on the screen, you aren't really. (Jake laughs) - [Jake] Next? - [Anthony] Oh man. - [Jake] Why are you giving me all these Alienwares? - What are we looking at here? So there's a, either a white with RGB. - Here let me just make this better. There we go, now I can see. - [Anthony] Oh. Nice, very good. - [Anthony] Yeah, yeah, hang on. - [Jake] Oh yeah, wow, you're set up for it. Too much of a computer for my needs. Well, why did you buy it then? - [Anthony] Dual 2080 supers. - MSI 34 inch curved gaming monitor, it's not... - [Anthony] Attaching receipt so you can see the upgrades. You bought every warranty? - [Jake] 24x7 Technical support for $300, accidental damage service for three years for $130. - What accidental damage are you going to do to your Alienware desktop dude? - And guess what? They're not even gonna come to your house like they told you. You paid as much in warranties as you did for your two terabyte SSD upgrade. At least it comes with a monitor. This is silly, dude. This is... - No issues though, going to sell and get myself something a little less intense, potentially a laptop with 128 gigs of RAM. - Did your mom just give you her credit card and said, \"Go ham honey\". - [Anthony] Offer up? Now, I've never heard of offer up before. What am I looking at? - [Jake] Oh my God. Okay, so this is just... - [Anthony] Another 128 gigs of RAM, why? - Well, okay, hold on, this is a thread ripper system, actually. - [Anthony] 2970WX. - Which is like kinda (beep) now. - With the 3090, so that's very lopsided. This is more of an art piece here. - [Jake] It's not even filled properly. Like look at this huge air bubble right here. - [Anthony] Oh, that's painful. - Put the flow meter in just to make sure you get really crappy flow. We got a Corsair CPU block, we got a Fantech's GPU block. We got a Bits power distribution plate, we got a whatever radiator, Corsair fitting down there. Like this is just all over... Okay, man 15 grand? You sir are out to fricking lunch. - [Anthony] What is this photo? - [Jake] Yes, would you like to see the wall? - [Anthony] What room is this? - [Jake] This is not very well painted. - Linus would (beep) himself. - Finance available! Yes, baby. - $37,750. You can make an offer. - [Jake] Maybe he meant to do that... - [Anthony] Just take the zero off. Warranty included, so let's see what we got. 32 gig of RAM DDR5, wait, DDR5 on 11th gen what the (beep)? - This is gotta be a price error. Comes with a Red Dragon keyboard and mouse, yeah. - I mean Red Dragon's not bad, okay? But it's... - It's not 3080 Ti tier. - Yeah, no. Ryzen 7 32 gig of RAM, one terabyte of SSD. Okay, so what else? - [Jake] Oh that's a GT 1030... - [Anthony] GT 10... All parts costed me $2,300. Can run light to mid games. - [Jake] It's got 5800X. - [Anthony] So, here's what I think happened. This was a GPU shortage build. By the time GPUs came down in price, the guy was like, \"No, I want 12th gen\". - This liquid cooler costs more than this GPU. - CPU, definitely did. Maybe the RAM did too. So like 70, 80 dollars. That being said it is relatively new parts. - Yeah, man but that's 1,300 US dollars. - Just because you got (beep) in the GPU shortage doesn't mean that you need to pass that along to people outside of the GPU shortage now. - These photos, man, come on. - [Anthony] Couldn't have turned the lights on? I guess maybe that would've drowned out the RGB. - Facebook. - [Jake] Oh, good old Facebook. PC game ready for use, spect on the picture. Everything icluded. - [Anthony] 9,700F. - That's it, that's all the information we get. - [Anthony] That's the specs. - The spect. - [Anthony] Windows 11 home. - [Jake] Wait, dev version. - [Anthony] On the dev branch. - Dude, you gotta at least tell us what GPU we're getting for 3000 US dollars? He's got two mice too. Do we get everything in the photo? Oh, everything icluded. - Everything icluded. Okay, so you also get the figurines. - Yeah, do I get the figurines and the po... I want the drapes. - I want the wall. - [Jake] Oh, from Saskatoon, baby. - [Anthony] Ultimate gaming PC. - [Jake] Okay, this actually looks kinda cool. - [Anthony] Yeah, actually with custom loop and everything. - [Jake] Multiple flow meters, is that more than one? Is that a flow meter down there? A flow meter there, what's this thing? Is that another flow meter? - [Anthony] I don't know. - Did people not understand that they like actually hurt the flow. - [Anthony] Also that bend. - [Jake] How about all of the bends? It's so wonky. - [Anthony] It's got a core i9 9900 K, a Radeon RX 5700 XT and four, wait, four 32 gig sticks of Trident Z royal. We are again, looking at 128 gig of RAM system. Why do people do this? - You probably would've been better off paying somebody that knows how to water cool, to build the loop for you. It would've looked better and just spent a little bit less on random bull(beep). Oh yeah, here's mid build, each loop gets a flow meter. - [Anthony] Yeah. - Yeah. And you get a flow meter and you get a flow meter. - [Jake] Oh my God, it's a mining... - [Anthony] Oh mining rig, of course. - [Jake] 26,000 Canadian which is about 20,000 US dollars. - He's three months old, it's right at the beginning of the crash. - [Jake] Oh, no. He probably bought these for well above MSRP from like a mining rig company. - [Anthony] Oh yeah, I'm so happy. So many cards that could have gone to gamers went to this guy instead and then he got (beep). - I like this side of Anthony. (all laughing) - [Anthony] Full gaming setup, chair with LED lights. - Look at how many times it says RGB. It's like when you go to CES, the amount of times you see disruptive. - Nvidea 3060 Ti GPU worth two to three grand brand new. - Was there ever a point that a 3060 Ti was two grand. - This is Canadian, so even Canadian, I don't think it was worth two to three grand. - Oh my God everything was bought brand new, PC was custom built, paid around $10,000 for it. Oh my God, he's asking seven grand, I didn't even see. Oh my God. - Bull and (beep). - Or maybe not. Maybe the guy selling the $15,000 one sold it to him. (Anthony laughs) - [Jake] All right, eBay, land of the good deals. - [Anthony] Gaming PC, desktop, barely used monitors, mouse and keyboard. - So, it's a 5900X and a 3080. - [Anthony] Yeah, that's respectable and... - Oh God, the glass that's got tow marks on it. Wait, you didn't even take this off. - [Anthony] Connect all cables before turning on. - [Jake] Oh my God, it's a prebuilt. There's no universe where this thing is worth $4,500. I mean, okay, if you were a Twitch streamer and people wanted to buy your feet picks, they might also be down to buy your feet schmear on the glass. - So, Jake, I had to ask you, how many of these people do you think are just hoping for a whale to come along and just buy it for the astronomical price? - You mean like the whales from whale land. - Whale land? - Yeah, whale land. We did a behind the scenes on Floatplane. You can see all the cool activities we did. You can see some sick PCs. You can even see me walking around. I think there's probably at least one clip of that. - [Anthony] I always wanted to watch Jake walk around. - Yeah. Oh my God. (Jake laughing) - [Anthony] A thousand euros for an i3. - Goodbye. (both laughing) Back to Craigslist. Gaming and editing Think pad. It comes with a warranty. - [Anthony] Workstation, It's got the nipple. - [Jake] It's got the nipple? Is that all you look for in a computer? - Yes. Slightly used or lightly used, ultra high spec. - Gaming laptops, editing laptops any used laptop depreciates way harder than a desktop. There's so many other variables, there's... - [Anthony] Oh yeah... - The battery's gonna fail. - The battery, ya. - It's way harder to clean, it's way harder to service. So many things make it way less of a value. - So many Cheetos fall in between the cracks. - [Jake] Let's see this, so he bought it 48 months. - [Anthony] Start December 2020. - [Jake] But It's only got a 10750H. - [Anthony] And a 2080 super. 30 series was out then though. - So he just got kinda screwed. I would not pay $3,500 for this. I mean, you'd be better off buying a cheaper laptop and an LTT store backpack. And then you can put the laptop in the backpack then you don't need the warranty. The backpack's gonna keep it protected, you know? Price is firm. Due to the high value of the item, - [Anthony] High value? - We can meet at a police station lobby. - A laptop is I guess some one of those things that somebody would be like lol sucker and just grab.. - Saying due to the high value of this item that just sounds like you're blowing smoke up somebody's ass. - [Jake] God, that's a lot. This is the lian li fans, right? Three packs? A hundred bucks. Okay so we have $330 in fans. At least it was easy to cable manage though. - Yeah, and it's got a 5950X in it too, which is not... - [Jake] And 3090, wait, what is that? - [Anthony] That's literal rainbow barf. (Jake laughs) - Why do people buy Trident Z Royal? - I don't know. - [Jake] Has anyone looked at that and been like that looks nice. CPU never goes above 45 degrees max load. - [Anthony] Oh, yeah. - Bull(beep). It's a 5950X, it probably never goes below 45 degrees. - Yeah, it would idle at that. - Make an offer, if it's less than 6,000, I won't respond. Your ask is 6,000, what? We'll trade for cameras as I'm a photographer. Yeah, it really looks like it, buddy. (Anthony laughs) - [Anthony] Okay, so stock cooler. - [Jake] In the garage. - [Anthony] Covered in dust with an AOC monitor that looks like it's been through a war. - [Jake] Looks like it's got some scratches. It's got the sneeze goop on there. Oh the back of the computer's got some sneeze goop on there too. - [Anthony] Ooh. - Oh God, - [Anthony] The Keyboard. - Clean the keyboard man. - [Anthony] And the way he's holding those headphones looks like... - I don't even wanna touch them. It's blue... - [Anthony] Razor, oh, of course, he doesn't wanna touch them. - Yeah. Here's the thing with this one, you didn't put any specs. Given that it's a single power plug I'm gonna go with this is not a great GPU. - [Anthony] Yeah, probably like a 60 series. - And it's the smaller AMD cooler I think. - So, probably like an Ryzen 5. - 3600 or something which is not a bad CPU but for $1,500. - [Anthony] Yeah, but then again, you're getting those bonuses. You get the AOC monitor. - [Jake] The no name, you get the finger goop. - [Anthony] The finger goop. - What is that a poop stain right there? - [Anthony] Oh yeah. - That's brown. - [Anthony] Yeah. - This has been in that garage for too long, dude. 12900K RTX 3090 build, okay. - [Jake] This not actually that bad of a price. - [Anthony] So it's brand new. - [Jake] It looks pretty new, it's clean. - [Anthony] It would have to be. - [Jake] No toe fudge. - And the cable management looks pretty good. Is that his personal info? - Dude, he just put his whole address here. - He docked himself right there. - And the last four of his credit card number. - [Anthony] Oh. - [Jake] God damn dude. So he paid five grand for all this. - [Anthony] Five grand? - [Jake] I mean 2800 doesn't actually seem that bad. - Honestly, yeah. I don't think there's anything wrong with the actual listing other than the fact that he like straight up put his home address and the last four of his credit card. Okay, so we got dual channel. - [Jake] Nice, this guy got this too. - Whoa. - Oh, oh the other way. - [Anthony] Oh, I can't go the other way. - We've got another instance of runs any game on 240 hertz. Is it 990 a thing? - [Jake] No, it's an i990, 32 gigabytes of RAM, eight fans. Wait 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Oh my God, he's counting the GPU fans. You're not wrong, It's just... 12900K, 500 bucks. 2080 Ti, we probably already looked this up already. I just don't remember. - [Anthony] It looks like also about 500 bucks. So, you're talking thousand dollars and he wants 2,500. - But It's got eight fans, Jake. - [Jake] It comes with two monitors, maybe the desk, blue mic stand, a keyboard and three mice, three mouses. - [Anthony] Three mouses. I know that I use three mouses all the time for my third hand. - Wait, dude, okay, if you're gonna clean, like you clearly you use this canned air to clean the PC. Like we get that, what were you using clean shower for? - [Anthony] Daily shower clean. - Daily shower cleaner. - Clean soap and mildew. - Please people, don't use this on your PC. Okay, you just put no effort into this at all. - [Anthony] So we can see all of his drives. - [Jake] Come on, you didn't even. - Holy crap. - Yo, the cable management is bad. - [Anthony] That's an understatement. - Look at this, it's got like a Molex SATA adapter in the front. - It's like the cables are all dragging on each other too. - People put no effort in at all, like if that's the one thing I've seen. Oh man, the 5820K that's like the absolute cheapest X99 CPU you could have bought. - [Anthony] Yep. GTX 1080 hybrid, Corsair vengeance 32 gigs, ASRock X99 extreme4. - It comes with all this other stuff, it maybe it's not that bad. I'm just, I don't know. - With all connectors to start gaming immediately. - Goodbye. Gaming computer with two Acer curve monitors and they work, just I do not know how or why they won't connect properly. - That sounds like they don't work. - Or the computer's broken. What the hell did he just steal this. - Bunch of extra stuff and a Google pixel 3A, it is factory reset. - [Jake] Wait it comes with that phone? - [Anthony] This must be like... - [Jake] A storage locker maybe or stolen goods, yeah. Don't ask me a bunch of questions, I don't know a lot about computers. - So, how do you know that it's $2,000. - [Jake] This is sketchy, dude. You see this? - [Anthony] Yeah, so that's like one of those... - [Jake] There's one fan. - [Anthony] No, there's more fans below it. - No, but one RGB, the rest are just normal. - I think that's just G. (Jake laughs) - 400 bucks for a 2060 super. It's an i5 that's all you get, it's just the first two letters. - It's an i5 so, okay, what... - The first two characters. - What's that motherboard? I think I... - [Jake] There's no way we're reading that dude. This thing is a turd. 60 bucks for this desk. Oh, look at that sick monitor stand. Wait, are those the razor speakers? - [Anthony] That was the game. - Razor speaker, he only has one side. - Only one side. How do you lose one side of your razor speakers? - What! Maybe what happened was he got so fed up with razor and a fit of rage in this realization that he destroyed the other speaker. - Oh, I think he was asking $150 for the steam controller. - [Anthony] Yeah that's like the most expensive thing there. Say for the computer itself. - It's almost as expensive as this segue to our sponsor. - Pulseway.

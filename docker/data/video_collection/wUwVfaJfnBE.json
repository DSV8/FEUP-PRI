    "transcript": "Hey! How's it going Dave 2D here. This is a video about my thought on the iPhone Xr So this is the Phone that is received quite a bit criticism online I feel like when they announced the product a lot of people There was a shared sentiment and it kind like the derby version of the iPhone this year and it kind amazing if you look the specs that is not particularly impressive Has low resolution screen has IPS screen 3 gigabytes of ram it doesn't have 3D touch and only has single camera lens and it's still goes for 750 bucks 750 Dollars goes really far in the smart Phone world especially android world and you compare the spec of the iPhone Xr to a lot of other device that cost 750 Dollars it's a hell's of comparison but as I look into the phone a little bit more I felt like some of the spec that seems really poor on paper were actually not all that important and actually Apple had created a phone that was",

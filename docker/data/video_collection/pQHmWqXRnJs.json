    "transcript": "(slamming sound) - Do you need to send high quality video with extremely low latency over great distances? Well with this, you can. This is the DJI Transmission Combo. And with it you can wirelessly send a video signal up to six flipping kilometers. Oh, and monitor it. That's right. You could operate a camera from over three miles away. - We can work from home now. Yay! Yeah! - At least that's what DJI says. And I sure hope it works because they sponsored this video. So if it doesn't work, this is going to be really, really awkward. (clicking sound) (computerized music) I haven't had a chance to play with this yet, so I am really excited to see it in action. Fundamentally, it's pretty straightforward. Your video input goes here either via HDMI or SDI. And then boop boop boop boop boop with these antennas, it goes wirelessly flipping six kilometers away. Now my first question is how does DJI address little details like walls and roofs? What's that six kilometers based on? - It's six kilometers straight line. - Okay. Got it. Pretty much line of sight. Cause the thing is unlike a lot of DJI's cameras, this thing isn't gonna be 300 meters up in the air. (laughs) So there could be obstacles. - Hot air balloon. That's a benefit. - Now that's a niche use case if I ever heard one. On that subject, the fact that the TX3 Video Transmitter doesn't need to be strapped to a drone is a big part of how DJI is getting so much performance out of it. They had already gotten to the point where they needed to develop their own silicon in order to achieve both their quality and their latency goals. They actually wouldn't tell us much about their silicon. Other than that, if they strap a whole bunch of cooling and power to it, you can get some really amazing performance out of it. Oh, also we're gonna strap on a couple of other things. These antennas, pretty okay. These antennas, pretty extra okay. Okay. What kind of range do we get out of the regular antennas? - I was in build corner and the camera was set up over there and I run into the rear door and the signal didn't cut off. So concrete wall, metal door. Good. - But we're still gonna go high gain just for the sake of pushing it to the limits. - Yeah. - These are hilarious. (laughing) I would've thought they were the antenna already at this point in the process. Now just a second here. Do I actually need the extensions or can I just put the high gain antennas straight onto the device? - I think I do. - Both. I guess they're both options. Okay. What I suspect is that the video transmitter, you wouldn't want this hanging off of it if it's on a camera? - No. - Okay let's... - Definitely prefer to have like the smaller antenna. - Yeah. Let's do the smaller paddle shaped ones. This is my monitor. Then this plugs into my station, wherever it is that I'm set up with my remote controls of zoom or you know, my gimbal or whatever the case may be. And then this straps to my camera. - So you wanna control your camera? You need this. - Oh, okay. There's more pieces. - Yeah, more pieces. - In 40 hand grips combo. I'll share one impression so far, none of this feels cheap. It's got that reassuring, we didn't have to worry about flight time on a drone, wait to it. You know? - And it's filming gear, so nothing is really that cheap. - Clearly this is not everything. Where does this clip to? - So it clip on the side of this. - Oh. - It's solid. - And locked. Not bad. - Yeah. - Okay. Feel solid. I could play switch from so far away. - I can play racing game, you know? - Okay, now what? - We have this, the RS three pro and the R three so... - I guess we'll go with. - Gonna go with the pro. Yeah. - This is a new gimbal so that we can actually strap this thing to it. Cause you just said it doesn't fit with the RS two then right? - It fits with the ring. cause the ring is not from DJI. It's from TETA. - Oh, okay. - So that's their equal system. - But it's the gimbal. - It's the gimbal that we're replacing it. - Got it, okay. - This is our current solution. We basically just hang this on the back of the car and tissue cars and you have full, full of focus control and you have the wireless transmission thing here. - Right. - And you just monitor with your phone, but the problem is wifi base, you know, sometimes single cut and... - Particularly around here where we have a lot of 2.4 and five gigahertz into theaters. - Yeah. - Are you gonna Mount this thing? I wanna play with it. - Yeah. I will, I will. I, I desire a Nintendo. Now you're probably wondering why the first thing that we're doing is playing a retro video game as opposed to hooking it up to a camera or something like that. And the answer to that is that this is a game that I have personally played a lot and I have a good feel for when it's running with really low latency. So I'm gonna try and play it on here. Frame rate's definitely a touch lower. Looks very favorable, even in next to a very good display. There is a bit of noise in it. You can see a little bit of blocking, but that is pretty clean. Seriously though. I am playing on a wireless display right now. Now obviously this isn't, you know, an end game level or anything like that, but I am able to time my jumps pretty much perfectly, whoops. Oh, this is cool. You might have noticed there's menu buttons and like arrow keys and stuff like that here. That's not actually to control this device. That's all through the hamburger menu down here. This is to control the device that you are connected to like a Sony camera, for example. - What's beneficial with the SD car slot is you can load custom lot in there. So if let's say if you're shooting log and you know, those kind of like great type of video format, then you can build the thing in R 7 0 9 or BT 2020. If you prefer to. - It's actually surprisingly usable. I know, right? I do have one frame of run ahead. So it's like pretty ideal, but okay. If I can nail the 50 then... - Woo. - Well, okay. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. This is really the best way to tell though, looking at them right next to each other. Alex, you said, you know what the claim latency on this is, right? - Yep. - Can I guess? - Sure. - I am gonna say 20 milliseconds. - 60 to 100 actually. - No way, that's a hundred milliseconds. No way, that's 60. - Well, but they're also talking about... - Is that total though? - That's total. And that's like from your camera. - Okay, now to be clear when I said 20, I meant 20 more. So given that like a typical even gaming display is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25 to 40. At any rate, that's really impressive. Something to note, if you're trying to compare DJI solution to one of the others on the market, is that you'll see companies advertise zero latency for these kinds of wireless video transmission solutions. That is literally not real. That is impossible. So yeah, 8,200 milliseconds. It's a noticeable amount of latency, but it's really good. I can see now that we're a little bit farther away, the data rate is going down. So instead of being around 32 we're at around 22 megs, oh shoot. - To be able to mount this underneath the rolling gimbal, you just install this thing now you can just slot it in. - And then... - Makes sense? - You took the battery off Andy. - Yeah, because you have power from the gimbals who needs battery right? - Oh. - And what's cool about the RS three gimbal is you turn it on automatically unlock every axis. Like this is so good. Like right? You turn it off automatically lock everything. So it's not gonna be like during transportation. It's not gonna break your gimbal and it's not gonna fry your mortar as well. Ugh. - Okay. - Best feature ever. Hey see this? - 69% Battery. Nice. - Nice. Oh nice, that's sick. - Now you have full control. Hey, check it out. Look it's Dan. - Why you do this, Andy? - Okay. No wait. What's the maximum speed? Wow, you can really haul. Hi Alex. - Hello. - Before we do a long range test, we're gonna walk around our office a little bit, but there's a really important tool for us to look at first. This is their channel selector. So you can do this manually, but I'd recommend leaving it on auto. What it does is it will scan all the nearby channels and then jump around to whichever one is best. And particularly an environment like this, where we have 11 access points, over 140 wifi connected devices and a total of 300 computers on our network at this time, there is a ridiculous amount of interference and it causes us legitimate problems in our production. Like say for example, with our wireless lavalier microphone, that's why we have to wear these backups that record locally. So Andy, you're gonna take the camera and shoot Alex. - Yes. - But you have to control the camera. - Okay Linus, try and track me while you're over wherever you are. - Oh, what's it trying to do? - The gimbal wanted to go that way. - Oh, we lost our connection. We're through a lot of walls right now, boys. The large penis concrete wall to 1 0 5. Killed it. - What about now? We're back on short circuit. Oh there we go. - Yeah, I gotcha okay bye. As a first time gimbal operator, this is actually surprisingly not that hard to deal with. Okay, he's going into the bedroom set. It would be nice if Alex had any light on Oh, oh, oh, there we go. Something Alex said I should mention, is that DJ I tuned their... - Oh. - Is nodding. Yeah. - Nice. - Something Alex said I should point out is that DJI, tunes their compression to not drop frames, to not increase latency. So they'll drop bit rate. They'll drop the actual image quality, but you will always have an image. That's the idea behind it. I can't tell how Andy's holding it a lot of the time. So it's like, yeah, He's like going through a door. So it's, I'm pointing it up at the ceiling. - What is going on? Linus is behind the camera. - No, he's not. - He is. - Are we on a video right now? - Yeah, live stream. - Oh, he's firing you through the camera right now. Yeah, I bet he is. - You're fired, get outta here. - Hey boys. - Hello. - Hello Linus. - I see you. - I lost gimbal control a little while ago though, so that's why I'm just looking up into the left all the time. - I see. - Do we have any idea what happened there? - Gimbal lock is or unbalanced. - Motors in sleep mode. Well, there's your problem. Quality is flipping amazing though. Like what? - So we shouldn't have any like single cutoff issue for car shoots. - Yeah, it's crazy. But it even looked so good even though I know the bit rate's not that high, cause it says right on it that it's, you know, a fifth of what it was before. Look at this though. Like fricking what? And yeah, we're right next to it, But it was still usable even when we were like a solid, 100 meters away through at least five walls. - And you know, what is the crazy part? - The price. - I'm guessing. I don't wanna see it yet. Just for the transmitter piece. - Yeah. Transmitter piece and plus the monitor. - The monitor, the seven inch monitor we have for our... - Yeah. - That was like 1800 bucks. - I don't know. Why don't you just tell me. - $2499 - 2500 bucks. - For the entire combo that you can just monitor stuff from six kilometer away. That's amazing. - They have a USD price. Then they have a Canada USD price, but also a Canada Canadian dollars price. The RS three combo is like a way better price in Canada. Hey, thanks DJI. Canada never gets better pricing on anything. I see all the Americans complaining about gas prices. I'm like, oh, have you seen ours? - We're like almost $9 per gallon for like the cheapest gas. - We get way better prices on Korean cars. - But we don't have to go anywhere anymore. - Yeah. I mean, I guess it's time for us to do a range test hey. - Yeah. Now before we go crazy and just send the truck off into the sunset and see how far this thing can transmit. We wanna do something a little bit more reasonable. This is our setup for shooting car videos. We have the hydro alien. It's a awesome thing. We can set the holding up in about 30 minutes and down below we have the RS three with our camera. The only problem is one, we've been shooting car videos, we've had trouble transmitting video from here to the passenger seat. I don't think it's gonna be a problem now, but we're gonna test it out. - Now we have the driver Nicolas and I'm in the car controlling the gimbal. You can also get this module, which has SDI and HDMI and also a DC in, so you don't have to use the DGI battery. if you don't want to. You can use v mount, gold mount, however battery you like. I gotta say the zoom control on this new system is a lot smoother than the previous one. Oh my God. This is so smooth. - How does it feel, Andy? - The driven eye system, we can't really do like smooth zoom unless we really try to, but like this one, like a smooth zoom, just easy, like here. - Woo. - And I haven't really got any single cutoff issue right now because of the single cutoff issue I used to have to sit in the rear seat. Now I don't have to, I can just be on the side of like Nicholas, then we can communicate better. We can do crazy or fancier movement, you know? Alright. 3, 2, 1 accelerate into us. Perfect. Yeah, every control of this thing is more refined compared to our old system. Like I, I, I don't feel any latency to be honest. - Are you making Linus buy one? - I mean, if we can really keep them, then let's buy one. 3, 2, 1 coming back. 3, 2, 1, come back. It's very responsive. Like I, I, I, I won't say the last shot was the best shot, but like I was trying to save the shot. I can totally do that. You gotta branch like underneath your car. So when you don't have a parking camera, then you can just monitor like that, so problem solved. Yes. Okay, now it's a real test. We're gonna have our interior camera plugged in into this, and then we're gonna replace the antenna with the longer boy and probably just tape it on the back side of the truck. The reason why we're taping the antenna outside of the truck, because this thing is a big metal box and we don't really want to have any sort of interference from metal things. I think that's the best solution. And since we have the extension core, why not just use them? And cable in there. Success. - If this works, I'm going to be absolutely shocked. Honestly. - Let's hope. I really hope so. Six kilometers let's go. - While discussing the best way to get a really long range shot, one of the main things that DJI said is to go somewhere that has very little like wifi or cell interference. We're right beside a wireless wifi dish. That's what like 10 gigabit. It's the best we've got, I'm sorry guys. These antennas probably ulcers supposed to go super high in the air. I don't know. We can just get Arty to hold them up or something. Sorry. - Do you still see us? - No. - How far did we drove? - Yeah, I'm on the edge of the roof and it's essentially line of sight and it's just not working at all. - Oh no DJI. - Nope, there it is. Well, it just came back. That's not good though. - I think now the plan is we just go to the field. If it doesn't work, we're screwed. - It's gone like immediately the bed. You only got like 100 meters. - Okay, what about now? Now you guys should have like a, the right side, low side. I can see you going along, but I can't see you on the screen. Yeah. I think this is a, we need to call DJI and figure out what on the go. - Okay. - Yeah, let's go to the office. I'll call DJI this evening. The last time it was an not a success. Things are looking up. This is the first beautiful day in Vancouver of 2022 and we get to spend it on the beach. What could be better? We have new firmware on our transmitter and our receiver antenna's up nice and high. The transmitter antenna's also up nice and high. Andy has just the most sus set up ever. He is gonna rip around on a E scooter, but we should have line of sight for over six kilometers. We did some testing with the new firmware in our old location. We were able to get about two, two and a half kilometers of transmitting. We weren't quite happy with that. There's just too many like farms and trees in the way for us to get super far. Today though, I think we can do it. - All right, let me show you my setup. So I'm the antenna man right now. And I have the antenna I mounted over there and I have a backpack and I have power here. And the GoPro in front of my chest is connected to the receiver. So Alex, over there can, you know, monitor it from six kilometer in our way hopefully. I believe. See you guys later. Ah, snake. - Oh, did he actually leave the camera? It isn't quite set up. This might be bad. One thing we mentioned before but didn't really show, is just how fricking bright this screen is. It is as bright as it can be outside in the direct sun. And I can see it perfectly. Like I could even do like, you know, exposure and color balancing and stuff. It's so vivid right here. Oh, it was our first little bit of blockiness there. He is in some trees over there. This will probably be one of the more challenging areas cause there is just a lot of crap. Once he gets a bit further, I think it's gonna come back a bit. Oh yep, there we go. He came out past those trees and our signal quality just improved so much. - Hello Alex. Do you still see me? - Yeah. It's actually even stronger than it was before. - Oh wow. I was like slightly worried cause like on that side there's like bunch of trees. - Yeah. The trees call cause us some problems, but it's like really working right now. All right. Two kilometers confirmed and she's working great. Oh, should have brought binoculars or something. Pretty soon I should be able to see him just way off in the distance over there. Okay, I'm gonna turn on airplane mode. Right there I had a text come in and it got all blocky for a second. And now that that stopped, t's beautiful again. He has to be over three kilometers now and it's coming down almost as well as it was when he was like right over there. That's incredible. When you have line of sight with this thing across an open space. Holy freak. She does work. - Alex is probably like over in that area, but I see nothing. - Do you still see me? - Oh yeah. It it's working great. Like incredibly clear at the moment. - You see in front of me, there are like much of trees. I'm gonna go into the forest and then we'll see. Hope the best. - Oh wait, how, how good is the range for the radio? - I don't know. We might run out of radio range before we run out of DGI transmitter range. Andy is way over there. You see, can I point? No I can't. It's pretty fricking far away. - Trees. - Should have brought some snacks. - My antenna is too high. I'm hitting trees. - Okay, signal quality is dropping, Now that he's in that big bit of trees. It is holding though. He's at least three kilometers away right now. Probably more. Oh, I might have lost it. He's back. He came out through the trees. Oh my God. He's so far away. Just past three and a half kilometers. Our radios don't work anymore. He's gonna run out a battery life on that GoPro though. My guess is that every time that it blocks out Andy's phone is probably doing something. Your GoPro's at 1%. She's about to die. - It's back, I see it. Oh man. Andy just completely chopped a cyclist on his little scooter. That must be embarrassing. Video quality at this point, not the best, but at the same time it's very usable. Like if we had a Ronin in at the moment and I needed to control it, I could. Probably over four and a half kilometers away at this point. Oh he just went up on some buildings. Is that the Delta Heritage Park? Hello? Andy. - Delta Heritage Air Park. - All right, 5.2 kilometers confirmed. Holy crap. - I'm gonna keep going. Let's see how far this thing can go. - Yeah. Just keep on trucking. Getting real blocky. She's struggling. Yeah, so the next spot that you're going to come across is a little pony spot and that is 6.9 kilometers away from where I am right now. - Nice. - 6.9, Let's go. - The fact, this is working though. I have dozens of pixels at the moment, but I'm pretty sure that he's arriving at Pony Powell's therapeutic riding spot. - If I, if I'm calling you, is the signal dropping off? - Yeah. It's not quite working, but at the same time, it's like barely working anyway when we weren't having a call. Actually I wonder, if I go to the channels and I switch it to something just completely different while we're on the phone. Here's what I'm trying out, DFS. Basically the DGI transmission is able to use radio frequencies that are reserved for things like small planes, emergency services, helicopters and so on. Because these frequencies are reserved, there can be way less interference on them. Now the general public is allowed to use these frequencies, but if you want to, you need to listen to them for one minute. And if no traffic is detected, you are good to go. Can this help us out? Channel 17 looks pretty good. Oh wow. it came back. - Oh wow. - We hit 6.9. I think we can call it there. That is frigging impressive. - That's nice. - Yeah, very. Holy frick. - All right. I can't believe it honestly. I didn't think this would work. - Nice. Let's head back to the studio then. - Yep. While Andy's on his way back, I just want show our water bottles for a second. This thing's been in direct sunlight for over an hour and I'm guessing this is still just nice and cold. Oh yeah. That's under 10 degrees right now, beautiful. (laughing) - High five. That's a nice one. - One final thing we want to show off is broadcast mode. So we have Anthony here, our talent. He's getting filmed and we have one screen that's able to control stuff in the camera. And then we have two more that are just for broadcasting. This is purely just a video feed. Or instead of broadcast mode, I think most of the time it's gonna be overbearing client mode. So let, let's go to the other room one second. Hello Anthony. - What's up? - Can you thank DJI for sponsoring this video? - Well, thanks DJI for sponsoring this video. - Brandon, can you change the focus a bit? I don't think it's quite right. The exposure too please. Okay, it starting look pretty good. Anthony, can you give us another sponsor read? - Thanks to DJI for sponsoring this video. - Brandon, you screwed up the focus again. Okay, one second. Can we do this? - Wait, you want me to do it again? - Yes, but I want to feel it in the loins. Right now you're just kind of saying it. - I get it, I get it okay. Thanks to DJI for sponsoring this video. - Oh, beautiful. That's a cut. All right. Thanks, thanks. Well, beautiful. - Are you rolling? I wanna play a third person video game. Ooh, Ooh. Oh man. This game has really good camera controls. This is really trippy. Look, I'm playing a third person video game. Oh Andy you all right?",

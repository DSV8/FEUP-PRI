    "transcript": "- Have you ever seen a miracle? Well, you're about to. (chimes tinkle) - [Riley] What is that? - Tech news! - What? Those aren't jazz- - It's the jazz... I don't know. - Those are not jazz hands. - I don't know how to do jazz hands, Riley. - [Riley] Oh my god. - AMD's upcoming Ryzen 5 5600X, a six-core, 12-thread processor, has just appeared on PassMark's CPU benchmark list, taking a single-threaded performance lead not only over AMD's previous generation but also over Intel's current top-end Core i9-10900K. Will the real best gaming processor please stand up? - [Riley] Please stand up! - Although Ryzen has been closing the market share gap on Intel for some time now, AMD has still lagged behind Intel in terms of single-threaded performance, though if this new benchmark is anything to go off of, that trend is about to come to an end. The 5600X is expected to retail for $250 less than the 10900K, albeit with four fewer cores, and it remains to be seen how Intel's upcoming Rocket Lake desktop chips, due to be out next year, will stack up. Currently the number one spot is held by the 16-core Ryzen 9 5950X, but I have a feeling it won't be staying there forever, as time is a cruel master that steers us evermore towards the precipice of uncertainty. - Preach. - Yes. Testify. We're gonna die one day. - Facebook is getting into cloud gaming, but unlike rivals Google, Amazon and Microsoft, they won't be focusing on triple-A games. Instead, Facebook is introducing game streaming functionality to Instant Games, a feature that quickly downloads small mobile games to the main Facebook app. Facebook has actually come out and said the focus isn't on fancy algorithms or getting as many frames per second as possible because you don't need 90 frames per second to have a good time in \"Farmville.\" - [Riley] Yeah, speak for yourself. - Yeah. - I need it. - I need at least 360. (Riley chuckles) The platform will instead offer more mobile-friendly games that are, quote-unquote: \"Latency tolerant.\" (Riley sputters) So a little bit of lag shouldn't ruin your experience. The games are free to play, generating revenue through in-app purchases and, of course, advertising. You'll only be able to get it in some parts of the U.S. at first. Canada misses out again. Come on! I wanna play \"Asphalt 9\" with... No I don't. - What? Why not? - That's a lie. I don't wanna do that at all. - It's a great game. You can get power-ups. - I can play \"Project CARS\" with Andy. - [Riley] That's true. That's a much better game. - It's way better. And one of the features Apple touted during its iPhone 12 launch event was something called Ceramic Shield, which is a stronger cover glass that Apple claims provides four times better drop protection than what we saw in the iPhone 11. But the fanciest glass is still, well, glass, as a recent test from an insurance company, Allstate, has shown. Although the screen itself held up well against dropping the phone six feet into a sidewalk, the device still suffered scuffs and cracks and so on. The Pro model's rear glass shattered, including the camera. Ooh, that's bad. - Oof! - To Apple's credit though, functionality of the phone wasn't actually affected in any case and it does indeed look like an improvement on the previous generation. But don't expect Ceramic Shield to keep your phone looking new if the worst happens. And no, Allstate did not pay us to help them sell phone insurance. But you know who did pay us to sell stuff today? It's our Quick Bits sponsor, MANSCAPED! - Yah! - The brand dedicated to below-the-waist grooming and hygiene that's safe, simple and effective. You can expect only the best products, the best materials and the best grooming experience possible. And guess what? Despite their name, their products aren't just for men. The Lawn Mower 3.0 body trimmer is the perfect gift for the girlfriend or wife in your life. Go to manscaped.com/TECH for 20% off your kit plus free international shipping. Can't get enough of those Quick Bits - Hey! - Is that what you wanted? - [Riley] Can't never get enough. - Yeah. (Alex and Riley laugh) It appears the RTX 30-series mobile chips have been leaked, with the product stack consisting of laptop versions of the 3080, 3070, 3060... Wait, no 3090? That's too bad. An official announcement should come in January during the all-virtual CES, but until then, I guess we have Facebook... No we don't. - Yes we do! - I'm not playing that. - [Riley] Well, we do have it. It's true. - It does exist. - Yep. - Not for me though. Microsoft has been trying to get users to switch to Edge for some time now, so next month, if you try to visit YouTube, Instagram or over 1,000 other popular sites on Internet Explorer, you'll get a prompt say to use Edge instead. If you need to use IE, you'll still have the option to use Edge's Internet Explorer Mode to load up a site that otherwise wouldn't render correctly, even though we should probably leave those sites to die in the wilds of the old net. Change or be destroyed. - [Riley] Tell 'em! - It turns out that contrary to some earlier reports, Facebook won't ban you for using two Oculus headsets on the same account. A customer support rep initially said this practice would violate the terms of service, but the company has since corrected the mistake on Twitter and even said they were working towards allowing multiple users to log into the same device. That's comforting. Now I can go home to my mansion and use my multiple expensive VR toys in peace. - [Riley] Aw, get outta here, rich boy. Aw! - But a cooler VR development is in the works as Samsung, along with researchers at Stanford, have developed a new kind of OLED array that features 10,000 pixels per inch. - Whoo! - Way past the current density of current VR displays. - Wow. - Samsung is reportedly already developing a display with new OLEDs, so it shouldn't be some pipe dream. Hopefully we'll see it in our VR headsets soon, which could eliminate that pesky screen door effect, because I've honestly just had enough of actual reality. - [Riley] Yeah, just go back to your 12 VR headsets, rich boy! - I will, and I'll play \"Project CARS\" with Andy. (Riley and Alex laugh) And it might be the end of an era for Apple's AirPods, as it looks like the company may be working on redesigning the Pro model without the signature stem at the bottom that dangles off your ear. Of course, this isn't exactly a novel idea, as Google, Samsung and many others have stemless wireless earbuds, but hey, it's Apple so it's a big deal, right? - Yeah! - Right! - [Riley] They're gonna revolutionize it. - Yeah! (laughs) So that's our show, come back Wednesday for a redesigned episode of \"TechLinked,\" and by redesigned I mean it'll be exactly the same, but probably with Riley. - Yeah, don't you worry. - Maybe James. Maybe Linus. - [Riley] Maybe somebody! - Maybe me, but probably not. Bye.",

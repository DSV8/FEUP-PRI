    "transcript": "Can these 2 phones ping each other? Ping basically sends what's called an echo message or Hello message into the network saying hello are you there and then the other device if it's available will reply saying yes I'm here. IP addresses have been manually configured. Yellow phone has this IP address 192.168.2.1 the silver phone has an IP address of 192.168.1.2 they are both connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Let's see if we can ping the silver phone has an IP address of 192.168.1.2 and as you can see there pings are succeeding I can ping from the one phone to the other even though they have an IP address of 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.2.1 and no router or default gateway has been configured the reason it works is because the subnet mask 255.245.0.0 tells us both of these devices are on the same subnet the network portion of the address is 192.168 the host portion is 2.1 and 1.2 if you want to learn more see the links below.",

    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to \"This Is\". Apple is a bunch of big old dumb dumbs for releasing- - Absolutely not. The best laptop- - No, the dumbest- - Of 2022. - Laptop of 2022. - Look at that, look at, look at. - Let's talk about the new MacBook Air and the M2 chip. My stance on this thing- - You go ahead, go ahead, I'm- - Is I know it's very different than yours. - Sure. - I do not think the M2 should have been released this year. - We'll split it up, right? Because the M2 is the chip inside this new MacBook Air, as well as the 13 inch MacBook Pro, which, just, don't buy that, it's dumb, unless it's on sale, which it is right now. But there's also a brand new chassis for the MacBook Air. The first time it's been redesigned since, I think 2018 or so. So let me talk about the M2 first. When you look at the M1 versus the M2, now ignore all the M1 Pro, Max, Ultra, all that stuff is for the- - We're talking about just the base M1. - Exactly. Which is what most devices use. So the M1 has proliferated throughout a lot of Apple's lineup, but it is available in the iMac, it is available in the, it used to be in the MacBook Pro, as well as the MacBook Air, the Mac mini, the M1 was a chip that really showed a lot of promise because it was incredibly powerful in tons of applications, but it was also efficient enough that you could put it in an iPad and it was fine, or you could put it all the way in something like an iMac or a Mac mini with active cooling and whatnot. - You could put it pretty much any device that Apple was selling across the board. Which is why it was great. - Terrific, absolutely terrific. So the main difference between M1 and M2 is that it is a little bit more power hungry and a little bit more powerful. So it's still on a five nanometer process, right? So it's not some crazy jump, it is more up to date on the CPU architecture, and it's significantly better on the GPU. There are other things, so if you are a content creator, it has a lot of the media encode stuff from the Pro chips, so you can do things like ProRes and whatnot a lot smoother, you can handle AK and a lot of nonsense like that, which all of these things are solid improvements. The main downside is, because it is a more powerful chip, it can and would like to run at higher TDPs, which basically just means, if you give it more power, you give it more cooling, you can get more performance, but by that same token, if you put it in a super thin and light chassis like this, you aren't necessarily going to let the chip really flex its full potential. - Therein lies my problem. Two years ago when they released the M1 MacBook Air, I fell in love with that laptop. And I could not speak its praises any higher. It was $1,000 for the base model, had eight gigs of RAM, which actually, look, I know a lot of people will scoff at eight gigs, but it was efficient with that eight gigs. At 1,000 bucks, that thing was the most powerful laptop you could get, hands down. Again, remember how most people use a MacBook Air, which is, college students, early, young professionals, who's doing mostly email, web browsing, stuff like that. And you do some light stuff like Photoshop, light video editing. You do not need to be trying to edit 8K footage on a MacBook Air. It's not what it's meant for. - It also will do it, for the record. (laughs) - And that's like, it will do it, which is great, that's a good thing, but if you're redlining any car, I don't care how expensive it is, how cheap it is, yeah, it's gonna lose some performance. So a lot of YouTubers are like, yeah, I've tried pushing this thing to the limit and I thermal throttled it and stuff like that, of course that's gonna happen. - And also it's coming off the back, like you said, of the M1, which was a chip that did not really throttle. - So the problem I had with the M2 is, yeah, it's a good upgrade, but Apple has completely dropped the ball. As amazing as the M1 launch was, everything is the exact opposite with the M2. The reason they put out a new processor in their entry level line, is because they know they have their call to fans who's gonna go out and buy literally whatever they put in front of them. They're gonna have this come out, and then in six months we're gonna start seeing the actual MacBook Pros- - Yeah, of course. - With an M2 version, whether it's- - M2 Pro, M2 Ultra, blah, blah, blah. - And they know that they have a group of people who are just gonna go around and buy another laptop in six months. - I will say one thing. The landscape has evolved in the last two years. When M1 first came out, it was head and shoulders, blowing everything in its category away. And in fact, it's so competitive that, while there is the new MacBook Air, they have kept the M1, last year, or the previous model, still around in the lineup for the exact same price, so this is now the $1,200 model, whereas the old one started at $1,000. But, both AMD and Intel have become a lot more competitive. In the case where they're still not quite there when it comes to the efficiency and the power, but significantly closer than they were two years ago. - When I say, I don't like that M2 has come out yet, it's not because I don't think that they could have ridden the wave of M1. I think it's the release order. This should not have been in a MacBook Air. They showed it in its worst form. The M2 is objectively better than M1. - Hundred percent. No doubt. - No one's arguing that. But, they put it in a chassis that cannot cool the system. People already just look for reasons to hate Apple. They look for any little thing. And so now when they put it in a chassis that's not prepared to handle the thermals of the M2, now suddenly all the good will that they had of the M1 is tainted. You and Ken over on Denki channel just did a video where you strapped a cooler on it to get better thermals on it. We have to sensationalize this a little bit to make content, for views and stuff like that, but now everyone thinks that the laptop sucks. - Here's the thing though, to contextualize it better, M2, in this chassis, fully throttling, is still, generally speaking, faster than M1. - Right. - Right? The main comparison with the M1 was the MacBook Air versus the Pro, right? Which, just like this generation, is whether or not you have a fan. And the fan, in the previous generation, wasn't that necessary. The M1- - It hardly ever kicked on. - It didn't, yeah, because again, this was a chip that was so efficient that it didn't really need a whole lot of extra help on the cooling side. M2 is a little bit more ambitious, still very, very efficient. Let me be very clear that this is not some power hungry chip, but it's a little bit more hungry in a crazy thin and light form factor like this, enough to start to throttle. But when it throttles, it doesn't throttle that much. That's the thing- - And again I wanna be- - It's a small difference. - Very clear that throttling, if you're doing the things that are causing this to throttle, you should be in the market for a MacBook Pro anyway. - If you're gaming or if you're spending hours at a time rendering video, that's when this stuff really shows up. - That's the reason product lines exist. But none of that matters because the press surrounding the M2 chip is that it runs too hot. You need to, oh, you need to buy thermal pads in order to make it run properly and stuff like that. And this is where Apple's completely dropped the ball on it, and they've tainted M2. Again, you have people who just hate on Apple for, Apple just makes overpriced, expensive (cartoon grunts), which is just objectively wrong after the M1 MacBook Air. Because, again, at $1,000, you could not touch the performance of that. It takes years, decades to change perception of consumer's minds. And they just started to move that needle in the right direction. The M2 should have been introduced in a MacBook Pro. - Sure, sure. A better chassis to show the full potential. Because they really, this is the flagship of the M2, and it is not showing the M2 to full capacity. If it was in an iMac, for example, with a fan, you'd be able to see the full capability. You know that the MacBook Air is gonna lose a little bit of performance. Just like if you could benchmark the iPad, you know that, yeah, the iPad's not gonna give you the full, full potential of an M1, but who cares? It's an iPad. Now there's one big elephant in the room here that I think makes this situation worse. Before we go super deep into this, let me be clear, I like the M2 chip. I think the MacBook Air is a terrific laptop. - I agree. - And I honestly think, most people who are considering buying a MacBook today should buy the Air. - Also agree. - But, the price, I think, is a big sticking point. Because if I wanna buy a MacBook Air today, this starts at $1,200, which is more expensive, but not outrageous. But the problem is, that $1,200 spec is bad. It has the same eight gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage of the previous MacBook Air. However, the storage is now half the speed, which, when you're running with only eight gigs of RAM, means that you're gonna have to hit that swap memory, you're gonna rely on the speed of the SSD to supplement the additional RAM because you don't have enough for much more than, you know, a handful of tabs and whatnot. - We often get that a lot, like, oh, you say eight gigs was enough for the last one and eight gigs isn't enough for this one. It's because of that slower SSD. - But my problem is, so I really think, if you were considering buying a MacBook, now we're gonna ignore the 16 and stuff, if you were gonna buy a regular MacBook, in my opinion, there are three models that you should choose from. Number one, the M1 MacBook Air. The previous 2020 model, still available, it's $1,000 on Apple's site. That, I think, is the base model that most people should consider if you want a laptop. However, if you want a MacBook to last you a longer period of time, and when I say that, I mean, you want to use this thing for four or five, six years. You're spending over $1,000, I think you need to invest a little bit more. The $1,200 spec of this new model, don't buy it. I would actually go up to the $1,600 version. Don't get the 10 core GPU. You're not gonna see the performance difference between the 8 and the 10 on the MacBook Air that much, right? That saves you $100. So I would get 16 gigs of RAM, which is 200 extra dollars. And without a doubt, the number one upgrade I would do on the MacBook Air is 512 gigs of storage. Not only because 256 isn't a lot, but that is double the speed of that 256, which will make a difference, not necessarily in, you know, transferring massive files, 'cause you're really not gonna have to do that a lot on MacBook Air, generally. It's a lot of money, but it's a good spec at 1600 bucks. - It is a good spec, but that's still way too much money for a lot of people of the entry level laptop for them. At some point you need a flagship, and part of the reason they get all this hate is because they market every product that they make as the flagship, which, one, confuses customers. But like, how many people are gonna say, oh, I'm not, you know, this thing can't even cool, which was like, this is the i9 all over again. - If you wanna really boil it down, it's twofold. The new MacBook Air is fine as far as performance goes, it throttles a little bit more than the previous model, which is not a huge deal. And it's honestly something you can easily fix yourself. But my bigger issue with this is that, while it is an absolutely terrific laptop, I think Apple got a little bit greedy. The fact that it is $200 more than the previous MacBook Air with the same general spec, 8 and 256, they should have given you something more for that $1,200, or they shouldn't have raised the price by that much. I think it's too aggressive. - I think what should have happened, they should have just done the redesign of the chassis, have it be the exact same spec M1 as last year. - Well, just don't charge so much for it. - I think the Air- - They just charged too much. - Should always follow the MacBook Pro. - I don't, okay, there's two ways, like, yeah, you could talk about the performance and the sort of the look of it. I don't care about that as much as just the fact that it's $1,200 and it is actually, in some ways, the $1,200 version of this MacBook Air is worse than the M1. I actually think if you were gonna use both of those systems side by side for extended daily use, the slower SSD on this, I think may actually make a bigger difference to your sort of overall experience than the niceties of the little bit of the larger screen and the extra MagSafe port. I really think that they are charging you more for a probably worse laptop. And while, if you spend a little bit more money, I think you can get a configuration of this, which is fantastic and terrific. I really want to hit that because it is such a nice laptop. For anyone who is not a content creator or someone who's using HDMI and SD cards all the time, this is the laptop to get. You just gotta really pay for it. And we kinda all got spoiled by how good that last MacBook Air is, especially considering that it is still around. - Let us know in the comments what you think about this. Is it too much, too little? Of course you think it's too much. Like, subscribe, follow, check us out in the next one, and, until next time, we're gonna go just get Dell XPS 13s. - Which throttle even with a fan. (laughs) - Yeah. (upbeat music)",

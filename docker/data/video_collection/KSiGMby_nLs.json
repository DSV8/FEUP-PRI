    "transcript": "I just spent two weeks and nearly 2,000 miles living and working from this all-electric Volkswagen ID Buzz to test the future of #vanlife. I used a BioLite BaseCharge 1500 with solar panel to provide continuous power to my StarLink space internet. That's because the ID Buzz can only power the van's AC outlet and USB ports, lighting and heater for up to 45 minutes at a time. To eat and sleep I installed this BusBox from QUQUQ. It's quick to set up, sleeps two adults and one dog named Hank comfortably, and the kitchen is a marvel of ingenuity. Even at $3,000 it's cheap compared to the premium VW will for the ID California camper that's still a few years away. The experience required fewer compromises than you might think, and without much range anxiety, thanks to Europe's mature network of ultra fast chargers. Like VW's charming electric van, we are still smiling. And that's before VW starts selling a bigger ID Buzz in the US next year. But there's no need to wait if you live in Europe, where #evanlife is now a reality.",

    "description": "The Fractal Era is something we've been waiting for: an ITX case that literally thinks outside the box by adding cool features.  But is different better or does this small form factor case still suffer airflow problems like a lot of its competitors?

    "transcript": "this good people is finally something fresh and different from fractal design the era ITX enclosure it's unlike anything we've seen from them yet and a new ITX case on the market is always exciting especially from a company that tries to cater to the mainstream and at the same time enthusiasts builds to and that's what era is all about I've spent the last two days working with this case and it's not exactly what I expected given the mission statement for this project as you'll see later on it still faces all the traditional challenges of NES fffff a lot of NES ffs and closure power up your PC with be quite straight power Levin platinum series featuring 80 plus platinum efficiency a fully modular design high quality Japanese capacitors and a silent wingspan that's optimized for air flow and silence choose be quiet and your components will thank you alright so first of all we have a five different color options they're all pretty unique and this is with a full aluminum exterior plus TG and wood panels for the top i've been patiently waiting for wood integrations on more pc cases and it's finally here with a metal base plate and careful construction so the wood doesn't warp over time because of temperature fluctuations this also means what top plates will be unique to each case but they're only available on the silver and gray models while the more colorful versions get at eg panel up top and this blue one in particular looks quite elegant and very bright one note about the TG panels they will be thinner because the wood ones are actually quite thick and therefore the TG side of things should allow for more airflow so you're looking to spend a hundred and fifty nine dollars on the era ITX regardless of color which is in line with other ITX cases but still pricey outside of the SFF bubble I love the curvature of the chassis and the ventilation pattern it is quite a departure from their defined series but it's not a small enclosure by any means that's 16 litres it is larger than the latest h1 and also because it's not a vertical tower it does take up more desk space all the aluminum edges on my sample are refined and I haven't noticed any quality concerns on the frame and that have no issues displaying this case in my living room or at my main space we've got a good eye oh with the type C Gen 2 USB 3 ports and the con but audio jack and you'll also notice there are no thumb screws anywhere around the body and that is because the side panels are completely - lists that's it on four pegs with these rubber grommets on the bottom while the top plates are magnetic so you can simply swap out the solid piece with the mesh one and literally two seconds but the wood panels looks just so much nicer anyway I would say keep the wood on top but maybe not as you'll see later the ventilation on both side panels is covered with a dust filter so are the small strips at the bottom and that is the only part of the frame that is not aluminum or steel it is actually plastic and in that cavity that is where your graphics card will breathe breathe now here's the interior it's kind of interesting to see fractal focus heavily on storage power supply compatibility and water cooling support so for example for storage options this vertical bracket can mount doulas as these or a single three and a half inch drive but since it's above the socket CPU tower clearance is limited to 120 millimeters with nothing on a bracket or 70 million is recommended with a hard drive installed then we also have an internal drive cage attached to an SFX bracket that lets you either mount a single hard drive or dual SSDs now the case supports full-size ATX power supplies along with SFX and SF XL and you can see the two psu brackets on the right there with the vertical mount system so you can move your power supply up and down depending on your hardware but because the second drive bracket is attached to the SFX power supply bracket if you are installing an ATX unit you are essentially limiting your storage capacity to only that vertical bracket and then for water cooling you can now take 240 rad at the top or dual 120 on the radiators - and because the bracket is installed from above wider radiators will not fit also the top fan bracket can only be installed one way as it appears to be symmetrical but doesn't actually align with the mounting holes so keep that in mind but with an ATX power supply only 120 rad is supported so era ITX is most optimal with an SF x power supply because you're not sacrificing on the radiator storage above you're not eliminating that additional drive bracket if you're gonna use it and it's also much easier for cable management when you don't have the massive ATX procore power supply that's also entering into your GPU space when it comes to cable management furthermore you can install dual 140mm fans at the bottom as long as you use a single slot GPU or don't use one at all and there are no 120mm mounts at the bottom because that will close off the already limited space to breathe for your graphics card and finally our rear exhaust fan is an 80 millimeter fan running at 1600 rpm so for my configuration I went with a 240 AAA or at the top and SFX L power supply with slim cables and our TX 2060 super that is nicely compact so first of all there is no room behind the motherboard tray to route cables or anything that isn't super slim anyway so everything is pretty much internal I am very happy to see a Type C cable that is flexible and not bulky but managing all the cables exiting the power supply area is quite difficult as in my case they start to mingle with my GPU space so in a perfect scenario you have 295 millimeters of clearance for the GPU and you can even remove the front IO cover if that gets in your way and even though the side panels are mostly solid cable management is still not a strong suit for the era ITX which brings us the most surprising and disappointing part of this review cooling and let me remind you of their optimal airflow mission statement for this project which is definitely not the case here so get this the gorgeous solid top panel which is probably why I would want to buy this case the first place is not adequately spaced out to exhaust air and this heats up the system very fast as you can see luckily the mesh top helps with cooling the CPU but our graphics card is still struggling for air removing all panels you can see another drastic drop in CPU temperature but the graphics chamber is so poorly ventilated it absolutely kills any desire for me to actually use this in the future and just for reference I removed the bottom plastic cover raise the case a little bit and my temperatures finally got acceptable so the culprit here is a poorly designed bottom frame that just cannot breathe and completely chokes your graphics card here's how air compares to the NZXT h1 with the same hardware but a smaller AIO very surprised that even still we get better cooling inside the h1 on all fronts and so the takeaway here is that we have this beautiful aluminum wood or tempered glass enclosure that actually gives users options in terms of hardware configurations but completely sabotages on cooling I would buy the case with the white oak or walnut top but then you're penalized for air flow and I would not want to use a low-profile CPU cooler and therefore I would have to go with a mesh design in case I want to mount radiator up top they did not want to raise the top panel above the actual frame to keep it within design characteristics but in doing so you completely sabotage calling for the GPU and the CPU when you want the case to look pretty furthermore GPU temps are bad and cleaning cables inside this thing is a bit of a mess but the thing is I understand the flexibility behind trying to please all types of users but I think when it comes to ITX focus is priority and is more important having said that I hope to see more wood integrations on cases in the future and I think fractal is definitely going to push that whole momentum forward but this isn't the wood for me all right guys I'm Dimitri thank so much for watching check out this other relevant content subscribe for more and I'll talk to you next week",

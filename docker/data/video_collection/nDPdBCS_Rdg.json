    "transcript": "Today I'm toying with a tiny, fanless PC that blasts tiny jets of hot air right out the back. How? This is a Frore Airjet Mini. It's a micro electromechanical device that moves air with a vibrating membrane. And no, they won't let us see inside. This 2.8mm thick chip can remove 4.25 watts of heat. Not a lot by itself, but two of them make for a fanless, 7 watt PC. Frore showed me two of these Zotac PCs, with and without the Airjet, and the difference was night and day. Without it, it simply didn't have cooling to run its core i3 processor, throttling itself to just 2.2 watts. This isn't just a proof of concept. It's the first Airjet cooled product. Zotac will sell it for $500 later this year. Where else could Airjet replace a fan? Well...",

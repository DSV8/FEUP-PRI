    "transcript": "i woke up on wednesday morning and i thought to myself i wonder how many terrible gaming pre-built i can buy before my wife divorces me so to put this to the test i got into my car and drove to the local best buy to see what stock they had and when i got there one of the first systems i saw was a 2 000 canadian dollar asus strix gaming system i looked at its specs and i thought oh that's pretty decent ah what did they do to the inside of it and feeling a nerd rant bubbling up inside i just had to buy it and push my luck with my wife but luckily we have a video sponsor today so that does help out a little bit today's video is sponsored by govi more specifically by their rgbic knightships this is an awesome way to turn your loser tv into a dope ass rgb tv in the package you get two 5 meter rgb strips look at all this rgb and this is only one of the rolls these govi rgbic strip lights display multiple colors simultaneously on one strip and govi has a really nice app that actually works which is surprising for this kind of accessory and it also works with alexa alexa turn tv off okay so if you think these govi rgb ic light strips look awesome check them out in the link in the description below [Music] hmm wow this box is massive and it reminds me a little bit of like a tacky version of the monolith in 2001 a space odyssey inside we have the eye of sauron uh this just seems to be the accessories we've got very high quality packing foam it actually reminds me quite a bit of the alienware pre-built packing firm it seems to be very well packaged so i don't think that even the world's most disgruntled dhl employee will be able to destroy it oh oh wow that almost ended really badly what do you think of it you're comfy there we go at least we oh i hit the light fixture as i was about to brag about not dropping this system apparently this is what a thousand five hundred dollar asus republic of gamers pre-built looks like from best buy and on the surface it's pretty promising we've got some ventilation in the front that actually goes into the case on the top we've got more ventilation it's also got a top handle which not only means that nerd on a budget will love it but you can also pump some fat iron in between gaming sessions [Music] here is a headphone hanger i think uh which is a pretty good idea although that's very flimsy i wouldn't trust my headphones on there as far as front i o goes it's got some ports it's also got the appropriate nvidia rtx and ryzen 7 badging on the front which is worth many ep points on the back behind the motherboard tray there's actually also some ventilation it does look very gamery and it's not really going to help much for airflow i can't imagine but you know it's the thought that counts it's got a pretty basic rear i o and what's most worrying about it is the fact that it's got a dinosaur video output so yeah that's that's never an amazing sign it's only once you get to the side panel that my nerd hemorrhoid starts throbbing you've got this glass i think it's glass side panel and then behind all of that there's well none of that looks particularly promising [Music] now when just looking straight into the side of the system like that you can already see a couple of pretty pretty big oofs with this system and again it has a glass side panel on it so if you're buying one of these you can see these problems now the first one is the fact that it's only got one 16 gig stick of ram and this is kind of like throwing acid in an athlete's face before they have to do the hundred meters sprint it's just such a stupid way to [__] your system uh but let's see what speed this ram is in here we have a ddr4 3200 megahertz now if it actually runs at that speed out of the box we're gonna be losing about 20 percent of our gaming performance compared to two eight gig sticks running in dual channel just because ryzen is a real memory bandwidth hog although if it runs slower than that out of the box we're gonna lose a lot of gaming performance so asus i hope you overclock this bad boy the second very big oof here which is this terrible looking little cooler what is that this cooler is so tiny and it's sitting on a ryzen 7 3700x which is an 8 core 16 thread hot boy cpu using this cooler for this processor is kind of like trying to put out a volcano with a super soaker at least i assume i mean maybe the airflow in the case will compensate for it a bit i'm really interested to see what kind of temperatures we're gonna get with this little small pp cooler as far as the graphics card goes this system is an nvidia rtx 2070 super in it which is a great graphics card at this price point i just wish they didn't have a blower cooler on it but looking around inside here this case has great airflow even though it only has one exhaust fan so yeah i'm really curious to see what kind of temperatures we'll get and then another issue that you can just kind of see through the side of the case is this motherboard has a pretty terrible looking power delivery now for those of you losers that don't know what that means basically one of the motherboards main jobs is to provide enough power to the processor so that it can do all of its calculations and math and stuff but if the motherboard can't provide enough power to the processor it's not going to be able to math as hard as it needs to and looking at this motherboard pairing it with a power hungry cpu like the ryzen 7 3700x may be a little bit like getting a tour de france athlete to compete on a tricycle made of their own tiers or it's gonna be perfectly fine we'll have to wait till the thermals and the testing later in the video i actually can't see what power supply that is i think all of the information is on the other side of the unit i've unscrewed it but the way that they've set this up means that i'm gonna have to pretty much entirely disassemble the system and unplug everything to get this unit out so i'm gonna look on the internet and see what information i can find about it the guy at best buy very excitedly told me that this gaming pre-built comes with a mouse and keyboard so i'm hoping they're going to be gaming great because i'm going to use them for this video oh oh oh no oh this is just premium quality right there maybe the mouse will be better because it comes in this sweet republic of gamers box oh geez oh no just this is like the worst mouse i've ever seen it's the moment of truth i'm so excited to switch this on and see what happens oh here oh oh okay so we've got some some lighting effect happening this keyboard and mouse are are really interesting i i think the technical term for what these are is is e-waste don't use no no basic no no no now the most important step to evaluating the desktop user experience of a pre-built is by having a look at all of the venereal disease installed on it i mean bloatware that it has installed on it and straight off the bat it's got armory crate on it which is like asus's software i am not a huge fan of armory crane it behaves quite suspiciously like a virus from the 90s so i i don't love that that's on there but it's got a bunch of asus stuff in this asus prebuilt so i guess you don't have much of a choice there it's good to see mcafee make a return uh i did a video on an alienware pre-built a while ago and it actually didn't come with mcafee installed on it out of the box so i felt a little bit scammed so it's nice to see that terrible bit of antivirus on here other than that you've got the microsoft office stuff which is fairly run-of-the-mill and then other than that it's not that bad it doesn't have much crap on it the ram is actually running at 3 200 megahertz which is good that straight out of the box it's clocked to the speed that it should be running it's still single channel though 2 terabyte games drive which is pretty good and there's a 500 gig nvme ssd installed so this is a promising system but it just has these little issues with it that ruins it uh potentially we'll see what kind of gaming performance we get and what kind of temperatures and clock speeds we get with the cpu [Music] the gaming performance is perfectly reasonable in a vacuum all of the games at 1080p ran very well except for crisis but that's because it was programmed by a room full of bonobos oh yeah and escape from tarkov was running weirdly badly at these settings i actually have very similar specifications to the system in my editing rig and i was getting better frame rates at 1440p than i was at 1080p on this system so that's pretty weird now to diagnose this all i'm going to do is i'm going to switch out that abomination of a single 16 gig stick for two 8 gig sticks to see how much of a difference that makes now i'm only going to compare like a couple of games here because i've already done all of these tests with pretty much this exact system so if you want more detail on that check out the video linked in the description below but as you can see here with battlefield 5 you're getting about 20 more gaming performance exactly as i said so yeah i'm clearly a professional that knows what he's talking about and then when it comes to escape from tarkov the game ran way better like way better it felt significantly better and that memory bandwidth really kills that game's gaming performance now i want to briefly mention the temperatures again because they are under control on this system although it does get very noisy and the fact that the case actually has pretty good airflow is a bit of an issue here because there's nothing to obstruct all of the noise of that shouting little cooler so it is very obnoxious on a desk next to you surprisingly the power delivery seems to be handling that cpu very well the temperatures weren't getting too hot although when it comes to the core clock it does run about 200 megahertz slower than the core frequency on my editing system with a motherboard that has a really good power delivery yeah it's pretty surprising it's it's handling it better than i thought so it seems like everything's reasonably dandy here i mean you lose about 20 of your gaming performance and it's very shouty but at least it's not hot and the power delivery can handle the chip but that's what gaming what happens if you use a slightly more serious workload something like ida 64 and fermark and with this admittedly fairly unreasonable workload you can see that the system is really starting to sweat here that cooler is shouting louder than ever and the cpu just bounces off of 100 degrees celsius every now and then it's not thermally throttling yet but it's very nearly there the same goes for the motherboard's power delivery which is sitting at 90 degrees celsius it's right on the edge of catching on fire here and that just being on the border of catching on fire but never quite hitting that point is one of the things that irritates me so much about this system and it brings me to the rant conclusion of this video david's rant time and with that it brings me to my conclusion and it's rant time because for the last year i've been buying a bunch of these off-the-shelf pre-built to see if any of them are decent and this asus one is very close to being one of the best options on the market all they needed to do was put a better motherboard in it with four ram slots so that they could have two eight gig sticks in there with decent performance and still offer future upgradeability if the vrm had proper cooling on it it would have been able to more than just barely handle the cpu and if they put a proper cpu cooler on there it would be able to run games without shouting like a banshee with its testicles caught in a door and that is just the pre-built sob story all of the pre-built i look at have some major unnecessary compromise and at a thousand five hundred dollars you shouldn't be making that compromise and the reason that these companies cut these corners is because they know that the average consumer who buys a pre-built at best buy doesn't know that this stuff's important they know that more ram is better and that they may need a bigger hard drive and that an i7 is better than an i5 for some reason but they don't know that they need decent cooling on their vrms or dual channel memory i was actually standing waiting at the best buy while i bought this system watching a bunch of people buying computers there and it's actually really sad because they're a bunch of noobs that don't know anything about computers they just know what they want to do with it and nothing more and then a company like asus and hp and alienware and all of those companies take advantage of these people you're not supposed to be taking advantage of your customers you're supposed to be helping them out asus you're better than that you know what you're doing like don't don't do stuff like this to your consumer because you're taking advantage of them and that's naughty very very naughty so yeah with that if you enjoyed this video like and subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one and check out all of my social media

    "transcript": "- Hey guys! It's Justine, I'm here with Ro-- - Hello! - Yet again. I'm so excited about this because I have been actually eyeing this up for months. - This is a Mario Kart track-- - This is-- - By Hot Wheels. - Okay, this is-- - Like look at this! - Like, bigger than any Christmas present I've ever gotten in my entire life. - Well today, it's not even Christmas, but if it was-- - It's huge! - It would be here early. - Look how big this is! - It says now you can race Mario Kart in real life. There's a lap power? This is so cool. There's a motorized power booster, Hot Wheels track connections so you can probably actually connect other Hot Wheels tracks. - Wait wait, you can race? - Yeah, yeah! It's Mario Kart! - You can race 'em. - Yes, we're gonna race! - And who does it come with? - There's little extras too. It comes with I think Mario and Luigi but I got a little expansion pack. Bowser, also Mario and Luigi so, duplicates. And then we have an exclusive Yoshi as well. Oh no, we need D batteries. - Mike, do we have D's? - Do you have D batteries? - Let me go check, let me check. Let me check! - Oh no! I do this every time. - D batteries. Okay, this is awesome, oh my gosh. - Okay, I've got the batteries. Is this a castle? Is that a Bowser's castle? (gasping) - Instructions. Have you had Hot Wheels before? - No, I've never had a Hot Wheel. - Me either, this is my first time. - I've never, this is the first time I've ever played with Hot Wheels. - Me too, which I'm kinda surprised, 'cause I feel like I would be so into them as a kid. - This is pretty cool. (laughing) This is legit. - Look at this! - Ro, because we did not have this in our childhood, we know have it now, and that's all that matters. - Wow, this is a lot. - Okay, I thought it was gonna be all together and I wouldn't have to do anything but have fun. - Do you, yeah. We have to build this? Oh wow. - Not that I don't like building but-- - That's okay. That's okay. Look at this little goomba. He's so cute, I always was sad that goombas was the bad guys because look how cute they are. - They are very cute. - I just think they're so cute, I would keep them as a pet. - I have faith that we can do this. - Okay. - Step one. Oh no, do you have a Phillips screwdriver. - I do, I do! I have every screwdriver, I have ranches. - I'm gonna start setting up. One, two. - Okay, Justine, I have-- - Look, I've made some progress. - Oh, very nice! Oh, my lip gloss! I was wondering where this was. We've got the standard, the small, and the large. - I can't believe this is our first time with Hot Wheels. - But you played with Legos, right? - I was a huge Lego fan. So I feel like that's kind of, also, crash test dummies-- - That's really iconic. - Do you remember those? - [Mike] Oh, those were awesome! - I remember that-- - Oh, I used to throw-- - But I didn't have one. - That thing down the steps and it would just be so satisfying. - [Mike] Did you have a full car? - I did have one of the cars, yeah. - You broke 'em? - [Mike] Yes, yeah, they exploded. - Yeah it just like shattered. I am struggling to comprehend how this goes together. - And then I got a guinea pig. Okay, Hot Wheels. Now I gotta tighten this. - So if the-- - Oh the battery's in there. - If this is facing this way, we're gonna put this, oh. Oh my god, that got really heavy with all those batteries in there. (laughing) - Blueberry tried to jump up here and then fell. Come on Blueberry. - We are probably gonna need to like zoom out on this frame because-- - You wanna see? - This is gonna be huge. - Wanna help Justine? - Okay so this is the long one. This should not be this complex, I'm not sure why-- - Oh wait. - I'm struggling. - Boom! I did something, I did something, I did something! - That side goes up and around. Yeah, we got that situation-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Taken care of! Okay so this goes up and around, that looks right. This has to go somewhere as well. - That's like where they launch from, I think. - Oh boy. - Look at these buttons, these are launch buttons. - Oh this is so cool. - Pew pew pew pew. This has to be launching. - I can't believe how incredible this is. - Sliding it on. Slide and snap. - This is a genuine smile. - You did it! - Look how cool this is! Okay, so, all right. - This is really neat. - So this, it kinda curves to the side, you see? - Okay. - Yeah. - Here, I'll put this in. Boom. - What have I messed up? - Okay, um. - Oh, wait. Oh, there's other pieces! Over here, little extenders. - Here, here, here. The files are in the computer. - Like I can build a robot, I can build a computer, and here I am freaking trying to figure out Hot Wheels. - She can code a website, she's a great coder. - What is happening to my small mind? But this is something that I've never used before, we've never experienced Hot Wheels. We don't have that-- - I've never been fancy - Knowledge, the know-how. - With toys. I've never had these kind of things. I don't know how this works. How are you using those connectors, that looks correct. - Yeah, this is good. Okay, this is so exciting. Yeah, this goes in here. - Justine, how'd I miss that entire step. - No, it's okay. Yeah, it's weird because-- - Kids toys are just-- - No, no, we don't need this one actually because this connects to here. - [Ro] Justine, I'm gonna say I'm very impressed with you. - I'm, you know-- - [Ro] I mean, your attention to detail. - Don't get too impressed. - [Ro] You understand how to connect things. - I don't know if it's gonna work yet. - Whoa, this is massive! - Let's flip this around. - Oh my gosh, oh my gosh! - This is so freaking cool. - This is huge, does this fit? Yeah, in the frame. They can see us, okay. - Let's turn this guy on, ready? - Yeah, yeah. - What does this do? [Rattling] - This is me, what is it, (gasping) no, I try to knock you off-- - See? - The track. - I try to knock you off the track. - Yeah, this makes sense. So this goes down for every lap (gasping) so we can determine who will win. Are you ready? - Yeah, I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready. - Three, two, one, go! - Whew! I'm gonna try and knock you. I got you, I got you! - You did! Here, put your other guy here! Go! Oh my guy is, where's your guy? - Look at yours! I won, I won! - Oh you did win. - Red team, red team-- - Okay. - Red team, red team! Literally, our flags match us. Red and blue. - Oh my gosh, okay. (laughing) Should we do it again? - Yes. - Should we get a couple of them in there? - Yes, yes. - Okay, ready? - Okay. - Three, two, one. - Oh shoot! - This is crazy. - Oh my gosh! (screaming) - Oh my gosh! (laughing) - Justine you're winning! Your guys, oh my, oh no! (screaming) (laughing) - Oh no, gimme gimme gimme gimme! (screaming) - Everything's happening so fast! - Okay, I've got an idea, I've got an idea, I've got an idea, okay. - Whoa! Get him! (laughing) - Oh my god! You scared the crap out of me. (laughing) The dogs are scared! - No cookie! - Oh my gosh! - It's just a game, it's just a game. - No! (laughing) We are so talented. They're all-- - Did you do it, did you do it? - No they're not! - Mini bowser! - Okay, all right, okay, okay, all right. So, (breathing heavily) I'm extremely stressed out. Oh my gosh-- - [Ro] She's got one of 'em. I'll stop her. - Oh no! - [Ro] Cookie, no, it's a friend! - [Justine] No friend! - [Ro] It's a friend. - This is the coolest thing ever! I feel like-- - Come here, see it's okay. - Part of my childhood, we just, we just relived a childhood experience we never had. - This was so fun. - I feel like one day, when it's like a slow video day, we get as many Hot Wheels tracks as we can, and just go nuts. I'm sure someone has already done this before, so it's probably not an original idea, but because this is completely new to me-- - A whole room. We could do that. - Oh my gosh. I'm probably gonna end up, all of my YouTube recommendations are now gonna be Hot Wheels videos. Guys, thank you for watching. Thumbs up for Hot Wheels. - Woo! - Hit that-- - Yes! - Bell for Hot Wheels! - Like and subscribe and ring the bell. - Make sure you go check out Ro's channel. We have been making so many videos lately-- - Yeah. - So go check it out! And, I will see you guys in our next video. So yeah, bye! (upbeat music)",

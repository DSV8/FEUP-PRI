    "transcript": "- What did you just do? - Armando took me for a ride in his Tesla and I just bought one like literally four seconds ago. We're going to get it now. - She got the Plaid Model S, that's it. She got the Plaid Model S. (muffled scream) - Congrats! - Let's go! - Did I do it already? Is it doing it now? - I just gave her my referral code. - This might happen. It may not actually happen right this second but we may be going to San Diego. Okay, existing inventory is what we're doing. I think it went away. Wait, what's the zip code? Yes, here it is. Here it is. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh my gosh. I'm shaking. I'm so nervous right now. I can't believe you did this to me. I can't actually but this is what I want, right? This is it. - Yeah, that is what you want. - Dude. - That is what I want. - I'm shaking. Oh no, I don't have an Apple card attached. No hold on a second! Like, oh my God my heart rate, what's going to happen. - Are you actually doing this or? - Error processing! - What? - Okay it went through. Oh my God! (screaming) - So we're in the car on the way to the dealership. You took me for one ride and here we are. Here we go! - And now the car is driving us to the dealership so that you can go pick up your Plaid Model S. - Look at this! The little cars look like little marshmallows on the street. The fact that you can buy a car on a phone. - And use Apple Pay. - And use Apple Pay, is absurd. Okay I have to go to the bathroom before we do anything. We need masks. Hello, do you have a restroom? (mellow music) Oh man. No, the cream looks actually so good. Okay, here's the thing, I was actually a little bit worried because I'm not a huge fan of like wood interior. So I thought this might've had it. And guess what? It's not, it's the carbon fiber. I'm so excited! (laughing) - What do you think of the steering wheel? - Okay, I'm really excited. I'm going to start crying I think. I'm so happy. And I'm really excited. Like I was excited, like on the way here, but this is so cool. I was so freaking excited. The cream looks so good. This is so much better. I'm not going to lie, I didn't really know what I was getting. I'm like extra happy. Oh my gosh. And look at the little key. And it's like pink, that's pink. Oh my God they knew I was coming, what do I do now? (chatter) - I just go fast? - Just floor it whenever you're ready. - Right now? - Yeah, right now! (screaming) - Oh my ears, everything! And I wasn't even going fast! (laughing) - Bro, comparing it to your Tesla, how well did that feel? - Oh dude, like a rocket dude. - I don't even think I pushed it down that far. - I don't think you went full. - No I didn't because I was scared. - The only way to go is up. - I'm having a wild day right now. I still can't believe this is all working out. - I know it, and the car's already yours. You already did your paperwork. - Oh my gosh, ready? I'm gonna put it all the way down, is that okay? I can do that? - Yeah, that's great. - You sure? (screaming) - What the heck! - Was that all of it? - For a second it was all the way down. Ready? Ready? Ready? Ready? That's all the way. That's all the way I think I'm gonna black out. God, my body does not feel- it feels like it's in space right now. I taste blood. (laughing) I definitely- - My heart exploded, straight up. Can I ask you a question? - Yeah. - So you guys saw how fast this purchase was made in the office, have you ever seen a purchase made that fast? - No, I personally have not seen a purchase that fast. It was pretty ridiculous. When I heard about it, I was like, what? And you guys showed up and I was like, no way. And then we got it all done, the paperwork done in what, two minutes? - I mean I think this whole process was maybe four hours and it was that only because it took us two hours to drive here. - Can you think of any other automaker that does that? It's insane. - I can't think of another person that does this. She's insane. - No, I definitely, it's quite- I'm shaking so bad. Like this is wild. I'm already used to the sandwich driving stick wheel. Look this is my first time backing up. - Oh yeah, there you go. - This is monumental. Look at that nice view. - How was your first super charging experience? - It was great. I had a lovely time. I had Panera two times today and I bought a car and everything's awesome. Dude, it's so freaking fast. Like my brain still feels scrambled. (upbeat music) Check out cinematic Tesla mode. - And then there's a button here. So what you want to do is bring it as close as possible to your charge port and then push the button right here. Just push the button, push it. - Oh my God! - Yeah. And then just plug it in. - That's it? Does it give me more slack? - You might have to back up a little bit. As you got out, the car actually lifted up. You don't have to go that close. - Oh I guess I don't. And I plug it in, that's it. - You're all done. - So I just walk away? It's going to lock. That's scary. Are you sure? - Yes, see? (car honks) - Thank you for joining this adventure. This was completely unexpected. Not something that we planned on doing today, but it happened and I'm so happy. - We love the impulsive nature. Well, congratulations again. So happy for you. - Do you have your seatbelt on? - Yeah. - Firmly press the brake with my left foot and then I'm gonna accelerate. Preparing to launch! - Wait, wait, what does it say? - It says ready to launch. - So just let off the brake. (screaming) - I have to, I can't, I had to pull off because I almost freaking blacked out.",

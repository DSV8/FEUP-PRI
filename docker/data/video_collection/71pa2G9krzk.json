    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] Oh but wait, where did this mysterious box come from? Actually we might be (bleep). Holy ball sack! Let's get back to that mystery package I was talking about earlier. (upbeat music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? Really, that's just great. You know, I'm doing pretty great today too because there's something about vintage Macs that's I just really like. And I got my old IIci here. This computer, when it came out, I think was over $5,000 back in 1989. There's some experiments I wanna do with this. On the show. So stick around for those, but the problem is we really can't do much with this right now. Here's why. Let's play a game, how many missing components are there? And time's up. Right now it's a pretty hollow box that doesn't do much. I think, yeah there used to be some kind of hard drive in here. Looks like we got all of our RAM maxed out. I'm not sure what kind of board this is, but I think we're missing a video card. And we're missing a floppy drive. I have salvaged components from this computer from past experiments way before I started this show. And I still have some spare parts lying around. However, the floppy drive, I don't think I ever had. I think when I picked up this computer the drive was gone. So we're gonna have to get a little creative and piece some things back together to get this thing back online. And here's how. I happen to have a Macintosh 2 video card, which I believe had a color palate of 16 plus million colors and it could simultaneously display 256 colors at once. And for what, I think this computer came out in '89, for that time, that was really impressive. We also have a bunch of conversion technology to hook this thing up to various peripherals. Also, I have an external floppy disk drive, which works over this connection. Because I don't have the plastic caddy to hold the internal hard drive in place, I have this external SCSI drive, I'm not sure how big it is. I think 4 gigs or so. So if we all come together, hopefully we can make a barely operable Macintosh IIci. Oh but wait, where did this mysterious box come from? Yes, that is another peripheral that I will unbox later. I just got it from schme-bay and it's now here. So we'll hook that up later. Let's start with the video card installation. This should be a breeze. So you have this, and should just line up and go in, right? And there we are. I don't know if there's any screws or anything needed, but seems pretty steady. Normally I would now put the hard drive and the floppy drive back in. But again, I don't have the caddy. So we're just gonna have to skip that and go external for those. So I believe internally, that is it. Close 'er back up. Bon app-a-tit. Our next phase is getting all the external components hooked up. So, I have, oh shit, I just realized. This isn't gonna work (laughs). Yup, yeah, this interface is not on this computer. I'm just gonna say screw it to the floppy disks for now, but not all hope is lost, I think. Actually, we might be (beep). I'll get back to that in a moment. We may not even need that. However, what we will need is something to boot off of. Now, Macs can boot off external drives, but it depends on what kind of system software is on here. If it's a version that's not compatible with this computer, we may have to install something. But we really can't if we can't hook up the floppy disk drive. However, I do have another potential solution. I'll get to that in a bit. This looks kind of pretty actually, it's like Russian dolls. Also, we have conversion technology. So we may, hang on. None of this stuff is gonna be very useful. Hang on though. See what kind of hamdingers. This will be nice though because I would still like to hook a monitor up to this thing to see if I can get any video output. So this will convert, I forgot what video interface that is, but I think it's DV15. And then we go to VGA. And it looks like we do have full size SCSI on the back as well, in addition to serial and Apple desktop BUS and all that good stuff. So let's just see what we can do with what we've got. If I have to order more stuff, we have schme-bay. And Craigslist. Yes. Nothing's on fire yet, which is good because sometimes this IIci likes to spark when I plug things in. Yeah, let's see. Got the monitor on and we're about to power up a IIci. Hopefully something works. I'm not expecting it to boot on anything. Obviously, there's no hard drive hooked up yet. I just wanna see if it works. Oop. The button won't go in all the way. I can hear the fan turning on. This stupid button, okay, hang on, lemme try this. These Apple desktop keyboards have a power button built in, I'm just gonna try using that. There we go. Hey, we got video and we should see like a blinking question mark floppy disk or something. This is actually kind of cool, oh there it is. Yeah, this is actually kind of cool because I don't think I have interfaced with this thing in like eight years or so. It's been a long time since I've used this computer. This is nice, I'm bringing it back from its slumber. All right, so the next phase is power for this ClubMac disk over here. Ooh, I might need more extension cords. Did someone order some more outlets? It was me, it was me all along! Okay, I'm gonna shut this guy down. Nothing personal. Hook up the SCSI, there's just something really satisfying about clipping in the old SCSI cables. I don't know, I just like it. It's better than screwing them in. Just a nice little click sound. Install it on the back and, if everything worked, it should make a sound when I turn it on. There it goes. I like the sound of old Macintosh, like Apple hard drives. I don't know what it is, I just, I like 'em. All right, let's go back to the keyboard. Okay, there's a shortcut I have to press. There's like a key combination to force the system to boot external. Oh, option shift delete or something. Crap, I gotta look it up again. Let's just boot it up and see what happens first. Holy ball sack! It connect, what? It found the disk, this is great! Oh, and we do have a Connectix RAM Doubler apparently. Okay. Holy shit! This is amazing. I thought I'd have to jump through some more hoops to get this thing to boot. Because I couldn't get this external system to boot with one of my Power Books, so I was like oh, maybe it won't work with anything, but actually it's work with this IIci. Well son of a buck. It looks pretty good on an LCD. Oh man, we're running in one bit color. Oh, too exciting. Oh, and forgive my little mistake earlier. I think the keyboard is called an extended keyboard. And that is the button I can use to power up the computer. I also have an Apple desktop BUS mouse too, so we can actually interact with the system. I just now gotta plug it in. But yeah, we got a mouse. And no traction. Well, I couldn't really find a mousepad, but I found an old screenplay I wrote for a film I never released. I'm just gonna use that. Okay, that still works like shit, okay. You know, I'm not 100% sure, but with how many times I've done hard drive swaps with these older computers, the hard drive originally from this computer might be the one inside here. Fun fact. Any whoozle, got an OS X Panther pad. So that kind of works. Oh, this thing is still like really freakin' janky. Wow, I don't know if adjusting. Oh shit, there goes a ball, there goes the ball. Gotta hold it in place. Man, this thing just does not wanna work. The reverse side of the mouse pad, (laughs) that works better. Wow, we really needed a lot of traction. Okay, oh man, I like the old clicking sound of these mice. Oh, WindowShade, that's right. Oh, I'm getting a lot of like nostalgia right now, forgive me. System 7 was the first operating system I ever used. Let's get some color back in here. Let's go to monitors, and go to 256 colors. And there we go. All right, wow, cool. Looks like we have Trash, System 7, and Car. Car sounds exciting. It looks like there were, oh my gosh, I remember making some of these things. Oh a Sound Edit document? Is Sound Edit even on here? Oh my gosh, dude we got File Maker, HyperCard, dude we got all sorts of goodies on this thing. Microsoft Word, Mac Write, Photoshop, I guess a System 7.5 installer, that might be what's on here, I don't know. Dude yeah, Car, this is the old Photoshop icon. Holy bazonkers, this is gotta be like .63 or something. Yeah, .63, Thomas Knoll, 1988. Don't call that number, that probably doesn't work anymore. Wow, this is great, holy shit. So much good stuff on here. It's really responsive too. Man, I mean this was one of the faster 68K machines at the time. It was a IIci. It was pretty beefy. Let's see how much RAM is in this thing. I know we have a RAM doubler. Eight megs of RAM, seriously? I thought we had way more than that in here. I think this is expandable up to 128. And I think the RAM doubler might be giving us some more RAM, I have no idea how the frick that thing works. Oh yeah, that's right, the menu isn't sticky. I usually always hold down my mouse button when I go through menus anyway. Let's go to our extensions manager. Yeah, the RAM doubler is enabled. Okay, and that's good news. All right, so far so good. I just love how responsive this is. And it works with this display perfectly. I am one happy son of a bitch. So, let's get back to that mystery package I was talking about earlier. In fact, that is one thing I wanna use with a whole bunch of vintage Macs. Because it could be useful. But I first wanna test it out on this IIci. So let's have a look. Okay, so I might have made a teeny, tiny miscalculation with how big this thing is, but I will tell you it is very beautifully packaged. Very nice job. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, the AppleCD 300. Caddy loading external CD drive. Okay, so maybe it's not the most symmetrical layout right now, but ooh, I don't really, I don't know. I'm just gonna keep it stacked for now. But yeah, AppleCD 300, caddy loading. My only concern is the cable it came with doesn't have that smaller type of SCSI port. Well, this is kind of a buzzkill, but not all hope is lost. So I don't have the type of SCSI cable that let's me daisy chain, otherwise I would just daisy chain the CD 300 from this Club Mac hard drive. So I'm gonna need to order one of those cables and revisit that, but that wasn't the main goal getting this thing up and running for today anyway. So I guess we can just take a look at this later. The main goal was to get the IIci booting again. However, I would still like to test this CD 300 with the cable provided, and I have Power Books that accept this interface. So stick around for a future tech video log because I will test this out on that Power Book and also stick around for some more IIci action where we explore all of the other files and programs that are on this hard drive. Because I haven't really booted this thing up in years. It'll be fun, I don't even know what's on there. And I'm also thinking, this IIci should be the computer I revisit the Adobe Premier 1.0 topic on. I cannot wait to try editing video in Adobe Premiere 1.0 on a 68K Mac running System 7. The IIci is gonna be our Petri dish for that. So please subscribe if you haven't, stick around and check back soon because I wanna show you all that stuff and take you on the misadventures with me. But I'm still calling today a win. Thanks for sticking with me, catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat music) Oh hey, something different just happened right as you were about to leave. Now all of the sudden I can't get it to turn on. Yeah, curse, you struck right at the end there. Won't turn on. Well, shit.",

    "transcript": "- Our testing lab is in complete disarray. I don't even know what any of this is. The wiring is half done basically everywhere. The floor refinishing stalled. What is this creepy place? And Gary, this is what qualifies to you as an organized workspace? - [Gary] Based on your current standards, yes. (explosion booms) - At least everyone's got their priorities straight. There's somewhere to kick back and eat snacks. It's pretty clear I'm gonna have to roll up my sleeves get this train back on the tracks. (train horn blares) - Jake, Dan. - Oh. - Fear not, for the cavalry has arrived. - Great. (adventurous music) - Let's get started. - All right, we have a rack we can install. - [Dan] Cable management? - Heck yeah, that's right. By the end of this video, we are gonna have all of our networking equipment on the rack, we are gonna have our network up and running, including our wireless access points, which hopefully will enable the people who are already over here, to work? - Yeah, that's the plan anyways. - Just like our plan to tell you about our sponsor. SmartDeploy, powered by pdq.com. SmartDeploy maintains drivers for you so you don't have to think about it, and with over 1,500 driver packs to choose from, you can deploy any business-class device with a single Windows image. Get your free license, it's worth over $500 at smartdeploy.com/ltt. (upbeat music) (computer beeps) (energetic electronic music) - You are already working? - Yeah, of course I'm working. JerryRigEverything Knife at ltt store.com. - Oh- - Whoa! - My God. - Oh- - Oh- - Okay. - You haven't seen this yet? - That looks amazing. I love it. - It's almost, wow, it's very red. - You know the color codes? - Yeah, you're right, you're right. - For the LTT Orange is actually more red than it kind of looks in most contexts because of what's around it. While they're getting that together, I'll give you a bit more of a realistic update on how things are going over here. The racking is in and anchored for the logistics department, the vast majority of the cables are actually run throughout the building, including to the test stations, which, as you can see, are already being deployed over on the already-painted part of the floor. The logistics department got a quote for the floor that was, like, outlandish, and figured that they could paint the whole place themselves in about a week, which turned out to be right. They've only spent a couple of days and they've made actually really excellent progress on it. And while the job site admittedly could be a bit tidier, when you're doing this much work, there's bound to be a little bit of mess. For example, this is the six EV chargers that we're gonna be putting up outside the building with free employee EV charging. I was just giving these guys a hard time, considering everything that they've got going on, the place is actually surprisingly organized. We specifically went out of our way to not show how, like, how carefully arranged all of the thermal compound and hammers are. Wait, what the hell do you guys need hammers for? - If it doesn't fit, we hit it. (Linus sighs) - What are you- - [Jake] Can you get some foam? We're gonna tip it off. - [Dan] 'Cause that that's the only way to get it off. - You want foam? - [Jake] Yeah, to, like, put underneath here. - To put underneath it, why do you need foam? - So it doesn't - It has legs. - Scratch. Ah, there we go. It's okay, just stand there and ask questions, we'll do the work, all right? (Jake breathes heavily) - [Dan] That's all he's been doing the last six months. - I mean, if you insist. - You grab that end. - Oh my god, it's really heavy. - Oh my God, here, switch spots with me. Dan, you got that? - No, no, I got it, I got it, I got it. Where do you want it? - Just off! - Ah, keep it vertical though, or horizontal? - We're gonna tip it back vertical, yes. - Okay, in that case, you should lift it up a bit more. Yeah. (calm music) You guys ready to go rack racing? - Oh, you're wearing sandals. What the (beeps) - Dan? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh my God. (Jake sighs) - Oh no, close me in. - Did I tell you there's a reason I'm on medication? - Close me in, close me in. - Oh, it was nice for five minutes. - Oh my God, Linus. If you scratch the thing, you owe me 100 bucks. - Oh, it's really hard to steer. - [Jake] You're going the wrong way! - Ah! Oh, no! Ah! (laughs) - [Jake] Oh, God, I hate you. - [Linus] You love it. - Come back. Yes, please, please, for the love of God, just stand. - Okay. - Now, we're gonna leave him. Stand in the place Where you work - Want me to tip it over. Right, Linus? - What, what? - Oh God. - Geez, Dan. - I stopped you. - It would be really funny if you were the one to (beeps) up. I am a fraction of the weight that this thing can support, it should be fine. Until we're going through the doorway. Wait- - No- - This is gonna fit- - It fits. - Through the door? - It fits through- - It fits- - The doorway? - [Jake] At your house. - Okay, slow down. - Oh God, it might not fit. - [Linus] Oh God. - No, it'll fit. - Oh God. - It fits. - Okay, rotate. - Totally does. - Rotate. - Okay. - [Dan] Watch it. - If it fits, I sits. - Oh my God. - Just rotate. - You're gonna make us, like, do this the whole time? - I hope so. - I'm not gonna make you, I mean. - We have a bit of a lip here. - [Jake] Yeah. - [Dan] So to your right. There you go, straight forward. - How much clearance we got? - Yeah, very good? - Oh, we're mint. - Push it, push her, ready? - Okay, ready. 3, 2, 1. - Ah! - Jesus, three- - One more. - Two, one. - Oh God. I'm getting, hold on, hold on. - I'm gonna go low. - Okay, hold on. - Put your feet on, dammit. - [Linus] When they go high, we go low. - [Dan] Stop it. Ready? - I can't. No, it's gonna hit me in the ankles, wait! (Jake laughs) - All right, I'm just gonna lift it. - Yes, just tilt it like the tiniest bit. - Can I help you? What you're doing is terrible. - [Jake] Yeah, it's great. - No, it's not. (laughs) - Yeah, we're gonna have to disconnect the internet. - Oh, should I let them know? - Meh. - Neh. - These things are super cool, they're called rack studs and they basically mean you never have to fumble around with a metal rack nut ever again, which is great. - Cage nuts suck. Even good cage nuts suck. What I think the best bet is gonna be is to put an extra switch in there and then go, \"Quick, plug things in,\" to switch them over. - Okay. - And then we can move this stuff. - Okay. - You want my plan? - And I helped. You might say I'm pretty handy. - [Dan] We're gonna need both. - We started putting them in on this side, which is the correct side, and then we went, \"No, no, no, we want the casters, these casters in the front.\" Too bad we didn't realize these PDU mounts are right here. So we have to use this as the front. - Technically nothing would prevent us from moving the PDU mounts this way, it's actually symmetrical- - Yeah. - But that's a long work. - That's what would prevent us. - Yeah. - The amount of work. - We're pretty work shy. (Jake laughs) Ah, these are very plastic. - They are. - And this is- - Surprisingly excellent. - Really? - Isn't it? It doesn't move at all. - Wow. - Ain't it incredible? - Dude, these can, the sheer strength is like 300 pounds per, or something- - Shut up. - It's crazy, like that. - It's amazing. - They're nylon, bro, nylon's indestructible, or so the marketing says. - [Dan] They're made of the same thing as your screwdriver. - Not bad, not bad. For those of you who aren't familiar with what we're comparing these two, this is a cage nut, or as I call it, the fingernail destroyer, because the only way to get these in is to, like, you gotta kinda stick it in there and you gotta kinda like, oh my God. - [Jake] To be fair, the Ubiquiti ones are garbage. - Yes. That's kinda Ubiquiti's thing though. - What? - Suck for a while and then iterate. - Yeah. - And then, like, suddenly, all of a sudden you're like, \"Holy crap, this stuff got really good.\" (laughs) Like these switches are amazing value and they have super cool features. Like, you can pull out your phone and AR point your camera at the front of the switch and it'll show you, like, what devices are connected- - Yeah, yeah- - To that port and stuff. - Your camera's plugged into this one. Your AP is plugged into that one. - It's wild. - I've never used it. - I have. - Well, I'm glad. - It's super cool and, like, really handy. There's two different kinds of switches that we've got over here, we've got the ones that we just put in, which are 24-port, 10-gig switches, which means this entire place is gonna be capable of 10-gig to absolutely every workstation. And then our second type of switch is this guy right here, this is the Enterprise 48 POE, and it's exactly what it sounds like. All 48 of these ports have power over ethernet, meaning that we can plug in fricking up to 48 security cameras. Actually, you can do more if you use some really cool little additional switches that are POE-powered POE switches. I actually used one of those to run two, three security cameras off of a single POE port at my old house. Is this two and a half gig? (machine beeping) Shut up. No, this has gotta be gigabit. - It's, no, it's 2.5 gig. - Shut up. - It's 48, 2.5 gig ports. - How much is it? - 1,600 US dollars. - That's- - 720 watts of power. - Do you know what I would've given for a $1,600 48-port, two-and-a-half-gig switch? - Yeah. - Like, when we started this enterprise? - It's kinda the bees knees. - Don't hit me in the head with that. - Well, I might. - You don't wanna see head injury, Linus. This is me when I'm functioning well. - Oh, could have fooled me. - Here, catch. Whoop, whoop. - Come on, go for me, go for me. Oh-ho-ho! Oh, that was awesome! - [Dan] First take. - [Jake] See if you can do it again. - Nope, nope, one is good. (Jake laughs) - [Dan] Oh, I dropped one. - [Jake] Yeah, it's like, this is like the bottle flip. I'll see if I can get it to land on the switch. - Oh my god, Jake, Jake, what? What are you doing? - [Jake] Sorry. You know, me and Linus is a weird, is a good combo. (laughs) The three of us. - Yeesh. - That should- - Little too much energy. - It should be illegal. - I mean, really, Jake? - What? I mean, that's what we've been doing all day. Look, you just got here. - They're not even metal, they're not even convenient to pick up. - With a, your ltt store.com screwdriver? - No, with, like, a metal screw picker upper do that, you guys have one, right? - Eh. (Jake chuckles) - You guys have one? - It might be I'm not in Logistics, yeah. - Oh wait- - Dan's not- - You're not part- - Part of Logistics - Of Logistics anymore. - He's in the No-Man department that I'm technically- - Yeah. - Nobody has told me- - Supposed to be- - What my job is. - In charge of but not part of, you know? - Colton's my manager, I'm just your (beeps). - Wait, do we have a new UPS over here? - [Jake] Not yet. - Oh. - Don't talk about that, I'll cry. - Yeah. - Okay. Eaton is working on getting us one of their lithium UPSs. - [Jake] No, no, no, not lithium. - Oh, is it like the other one? - It's the same one. It's a 9PXM, 12 kilowatt. - Oh. In that case, Eaton is working on getting us one of their banging UPSs with the, like, giant battery backup base full of lead acid batteries and all that stuff. - Careful. - What on earth- - Take these. - Are you guys doing? - Just take that. - Oh my god. - Oh, you unplugged it. I was gonna keep the power plugged in. - Okay, sure, whatever. - Okay, and what the idea behind this- - Give me some black things. - Is that we interrupt their internet as little as possible? - [Jake] Well, Dan didn't really listen to the plan, so. - I never listen to you. - I mean, can we plug the, can we at least plug the cables in through the cable management holes? - Yeah, it's gonna take a second. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's just holding the thing. This is so overkill. We have like 100-gig fiber coming from a closet 20 feet away. (Linus laughs) That's connected to a one-gig cable box, it's lit. - (laughs) I mean, it's enough internet for here, like. - I only did 10 gig to that closet. - [Jake] No, look, 100 gig. - [Dan] Oh yeah. - [Linus] Can I pull out the Ento 1? - Ah, mm, well, mm. You know, at this point, (beeps) 'em, let's just do it. - [Linus] Okay. I told them no internet. - Whoa. - Ooh. - (beeps) Linus. - I broke one. - Oh Jesus. Well, it's because all of this. - There's so much weight on it. - Yeah, why are you doing this? - Well, I was trying to support it. Sorry, Jake, did you say these are Cat6A? - Yeah. - What? - [Jake] Ultra thin, baby. - [Linus] Oh, that's super cool. - Feel the connectors too, they're so nice, they just come right out. - Oh wow. - And they snap in so nice. Where's the 48-port Patch for this one going? - I don't- - Look at the map. - No, I know, but then we're breaking the trend, it's gonna be patch, like the patch for each switch is above it, right? - Yeah, but the (indistinct) patch is above and below. - Above and below. Unless you wanna loop over the cables, they're not quite long enough. - Realistically, a few years down the line, there could easily be 40, 50 people working here though, so- - [Jake] We could put another rack. - Between all the equipment and everything? Yeah, that, and we have a decent-sized server room, unlike the other place. - Yeah, we could totally put a second rack. - We could absolutely put a second rack in here. Jake, what are we actually doing for HVAC in here? - I don't know. - We are going to knock out that window and put a unit outside. - Oh, brilliant. - Yep. I wanted to get rid of the window anyway, so that's great. - Oh, okay. Dan- - All right, let's just pull the goddamn Patch panel out. - Yeah, I mean, what's cable management- - That's- - Anyway, right? - Dan's problem for later. - Ha-ha, got 'em, Future Dan. - I actually like doing it, you're the joke. - \"You're the joke,\" whoa. - Wait, these are 48-port Patch panels. - Yes, so we have to remove them all and put them in singles 'cause he doesn't like the 48-port ones. - Oh- - Or just put it- - My God. - In the rack, and I'll deal with it later. - Yeah, he's gonna deal with it later. (bell rings) But- - How on earth- - Can I have- - Is he gonna get that? - The rest of this? No, you just bring the bundle up here and I'll be fine. - I don't believe you. You're just dropping them on the floor, Jake. - Yeah, we're gonna pick them up later. - Why gonna pick them up now? - 'Cause the, later, it's Later Dan's problem. - Yeah, there you go. - Oh my God. - Gimme the cable! - You guys know that I pay for it either way, right? - Give me the cable! - You know they cut fiber cables in data centers, right? - This is- - Oh, it hurts me. - Data center and I don't like that. - Data center. - Dan, what happened here? - Yeah, what is this? How could you guys possibly think- - I didn't do this. - We're gonna get these Patch panels into the new rack like this? - This was not me. Dan, what in the (beeps)? (metal clanks) - [Dan] I actually don't know. - You've enabled him. (Jake laughs) Here I am, trying to talk sense- - Actually- - While we run the things through the thing and you're sitting here going, \"No, it's fine, we'll be fine.\" - Hold on, hold on, hold on. What happened? Oh God. All right, all right. Okay, actually, that's making, we're making progress here, sort of. - Fine, you know what? If that's how it's gonna be, watch this, I don't even care. - Yeah! - Yeah! - That's the spirit. - [Jake And Dan] High five! - Terrible. Hey, remember, Jake. Jake, hey. - Hey, hey. - Remember when you were gonna 3D print me a faceplate when you were like, \"Yo, don't worry, we can have this face- - Yeah, you know- - In the records. - I love working two jobs, it's great. Okay. (mumbles) - Yeah. (Jake mumbling) - Yep, I got it. Okay, so this one should be good to go. Yes, I see it, I got it, I got it, I got it. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, you won't need that. Where does this go? - [Dan] 35. - 35 is there. - Okay. - Well, hold on, wait, you're not sticking 'em through the rack? - [Linus] I mean, aren't I? - No, no, no. Like, through the top. - No, I can't 'cause they're attached to these. - [Jake] Oh, you can't, like, crush it enough that- - No. - Oh. - [Linus] Dan will do that later, but at least this way it's- - I crush it in- - Like, somewhere. - Can I- - Good luck, Dan. That sounds awful. - No. - No, no, he's got this. Okay, where did our internet one go? Where do you want that? - I don't know, I threw it on the floor. - I, yeah, I know, but where do you want it now? - I wish you wouldn't throw things on the floor. - Jake moved my patch bay that I used for that once, so- - Oh, okay. - I moved it, what? - Okay. I keep asking a question and everyone keeps giving me everything but the answer to it, where do you want it? - We'll just, I'll put it in the rack. - May I has a 24-port Patch panel? - [Dan] I think there's some on the floor. - [Jake] That's where we keep everything. - Oh my God. You guys are infuriating. - Really? - But we get it done. - No, no, don't do that. I'm doing that. No, stop doing that. - You're using the rack as a holding thing? - Yeah. - Oh, well you're smart. Okay, I would've just used the floor. - Okay. - Don't give him that. - [Dan] I don't know, that's smarter. - [Jake] Dan, what is that? - I don't know, I think they're important, they're in this one itself, I can't read my writing. - You can't read your writing, what? - I don't know, I was probably drunk. (Jake laughs) - [Jake] Things your boss wants to hear. - Okay. - [Jake] 100. - [Dan] While working in a warehouse alone. - You're not even alone, there's like six other people working here every day. - Not when you get that drunk. (Linus laughs) - No, that's not the goal, the goal is to get this room networked. - [Jake] Oh, we're not supposed to get drunk, what? - [Dan] I'm way ahead of you. (Dan laughs) - I was being facetious at the beginning of this video, but spending the day with them doing this, maybe they do actually need me. What was our goal today, again? - [Jake] To get all this stuff in the rack and plug things in. - Oh, okay, we could have that done in 15 minutes, right? - All we need to do is change this rack, it's like one of the more difficult things and I couldn't do this alone, so- - Well, you could. - Guys. - [Jake] This one's not labeled. - I don't- (metal clanks) - Ah! Darn it. - I don't know what it's actually for aside from when you do the AR thing, you have to point it at these, so it's probably like some sort of QR code. But when you click it, you see how they're all synced? You click I, they're all synced, except these ones, don't look at these ones, they're not plugged in. - Hey, you wanna pass me that black one? - Sure. - [Dan] I'm glad they're on the floor, they're so easy to find. - Oh my god, no. - It's nature's bucket. (Jake laughs) - I'll have you know that I have also qualified all of the runs in this building so we know their exact lengths. - Oh. - And all their locations are also mapped with unique kind of human readable text names instead of W4. - Nice. That's actually super awesome because in the event that we are trying to diagnose something that, for whatever reason, has the label fall of or we catastrophically lose our map or whatever else, knowing the lengths of the runs will actually give us a solid clue as to where the heck it's going. We joke a lot, but we've actually come a long way in terms of networking, and server configurations, and all that kinda stuff. - You're welcome. - Things have been running pretty smoothly for- - Pretty smoothly? - I mean, pretty smoothly. There was, you know, catastrophic data loss from the vault. - [Jake] Yeah, well, that wasn't my fault. - It looks messy now, but once I have a cleanup of all of this, it'll be pretty beautiful, I hope. - Man, the number of times in my life I have tidied up a server room of some sort, be it at worker at home, and had a bundle of cables this big at the end that were not plugged into anything on either side that I then just huck into a bin to organize? Every time. So this is the part where everything devolves into chaos, right? And we start blaming each other, because while it's all fun and games for the labs team to not have internet right now for like, you know, a little bit of time at the end of the day, they must have internet tomorrow. I have this Patch cable mostly disentangled from everything else. - Oh, awesome. - I think. This is a traditional nerd mating dance. (upbeat music) You throw your cables around and you hope it attracts a lady, never does. (Dan chuckles) - What the (beeps) is going on? - Look, we're- - This is awful. - Nearly done. - Maybe if you had helped. - [Jake] (laughs) Yeah? - I didn't say it's perfect, but look, look at the room, at least it's in the corner. - Yeah, we don't know where that one goes. - [Linus] What? - [Dan] Oh yeah, that was one premium 24 pack. - No, my 24 is full. - [Dan] Oh, I don't know, put it on the floor. Thank you. - Nice. - [Jake] Wait, why are there no studs in this? - I told you to get the purplely boys. This is what we call in the biz a classic vlog. It doesn't really have a purpose, this is stuff we were gonna do anyway. - Yeah. - I was gonna do it. - But now it's on camera. - [Dan] I was gonna do it. - Now you came along for the ride. It is going to look awesome, at least I think people can get an idea now of what it's gonna be like. - It's just half network. - Yeah. - [Dan] Taketh the thing. - I take-a the thing. - Ah, there's many purples again. - Oh my God, I thought you had done that. - [Jake] No, we did the other one. - [Dan] Aah. - These are cool cables, basically we take our 100 gig in from our closet over there and then we can connect to all of our switches here with their 25 gig uplinks by splitting our 100 gig here into four 25 gigs. - Guess what? A 100 gig is just four 25s put together. - [Camera Operator] This is chaos, I don't know how this is gonna edit together, like... - [Dan] It's something. - [Camera Operator] Somehow they always seem to make it work. - Yeah, that's why we have a lot of editors. (machine beeps) - [Camera Operator] Takes a while to make this into not a turd. - That's why we release like six LTTs a week and we have over a dozen editors on staff. This is what we give them. Can I just, you know, give her, give her the old? - [Dan] Full sense only? - I mean, once the rack is closed, that's good, right? Yeah. - I didn't close it yet, I've still got those fiber cables in the door frame. - Neat. It's closed. - Okay. - And cable managed. (upbeat music) - [Camera Operator] Wow, you guys are so good at that. - Not bad, right? There. Not bad, right? We may end up with some storage here, but it's also possible we just won't have any, as long as we've got a fast enough linkback to the other office, which we're doing with air fiber dishes on the roofs, then really all this has to handle is the infrastructure within this building. As for why it needs to be 10 gig basically everywhere with link speeds up to 100 gig. Well, we're gonna have a lot of really high-end testing equipment, including testing server equipment, so unless we have this infrastructure, we're just not going to be able to do that. The only storage that we've got for now is this NVR, which is a network video recorder, which is gonna handle all of the security cameras, will handle some of the security cameras. We might need another one of these, - I think it'll handle- - There is another one. - There's another one. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. - Pretty much this whole thing is just gonna be cameras. And I should also mention- - Wow. - That there's still 90 more runs to come in here. The warehouse is full of, like, 200 foot long, 10-gig ethernet plus cameras, plus APs, it's everywhere. - Uh-huh, and you're gonna use contractors, right? - That one, probably. Just like I use contractors for this segway to our sponsor. - Secret Lab. Thanks to Secretlab for sponsoring today's video.

Why don't you go watch the one where I noise-isolated the server room at the old place? We are not doing that here. - [Jake] I thought we were. I thought we were. - If this is just networking equipment, then probably not. - Okay. - That's how loud it is. - But if we put servers in here. - I have to fill the ceiling. - [Jake] We'll do it less bad, don't worry. - Okay, we'll do that, but, like, better. - Asbestos. - No.",

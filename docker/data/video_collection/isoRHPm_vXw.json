    "transcript": "Whats up guys! Lew here Back with another video and today, as you can tell I'm out of the usual setting, I'm out here in the bigger space Because we are looking at a bigger thing Now this box is not huge but the thing that came inside of it is It's actually four feet tall t's name is Meccanoid And this is not for the fane of heart. This is for real enthusiasts that wanna dig in and build something You can program to say different things Do different movements He can mimic your movements There is an app that allows for you To take it to the next level To take your relationship to the next level He speaks a number of different languages So you can plug him in via USB and pick the language that's right for you You can build him using this components into a number of different things Including this little dinosaur here or little droid that moves around and picks up various objects (robot moving noise) and sometimes He sneaks up on you as well Not creepy at all Okay a little bit creepy Meccanoid So here he is and as you can tell He is made up of a number of different parts and components Once he is build, there is a number of different ways that you can use it You can interact using these buttons here to put him in a number of different modes This where you put a phone for example if you want to use the app and have him mimic your movement in the shoulder here this will pivot a couple of ways and in the elbow Down below he has actually got wheels So he can move around pretty quickly His head also moves Another couple motors here that allow his eyes his head sort of pivot couple different ways and on the back this allows you to switch him between robot and drone mode Drone mode activated Drone mode deactivated you get the idea ? As mentioned you can interact with him a couple of different ways either from voice Through the microphone here These buttons or the app If i launch into this section here you can see there's various controls You can basically just grab hold of these control points Like that And have him do something specifically And than he records that as A programed sequence Okay so it's now in motion capture mode It is got me there Now he'll do a countdown And then he'll try to mimic my movement See there you go hands up Hands down...All the way down aaa. He is doing better with me standing that makes sense Two arms up and then back down I'm gonna disconnect him from the app and show you... ...what he does in the absence of the app Unbox Therapy (Robot) Unbox Therapy You can have him roll up on your friends And say something funny you know where I'm going with that You know where I'm going with that Tell me a joke Prepare yourself for amusement Human companion Does an apple a day keep the doctor away? Yes! If you aim it well! Forward Forward Forward Forward FORWARD! (Laugh) Dance! High five! Engaging high five #Best day ever Hashtag Best day ever Walk with me! So, there you have it Mechanoid. A personal Forefoot Robot dude This thing is as much about the project and building it? Building something that actually interacts? As it is about the experience up that in interaction? I don't know, may be you're looking for project to do with your kid and your kid Is showing interest in this kind of Uhhh? You know, this kind of project That might make sense for you. You know one thing that we didn't show them Jack? Was him doing the TANGO..It's my favorite dance.",

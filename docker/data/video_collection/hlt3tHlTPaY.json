    "transcript": "- Oh my goodness! I would say hey guys, I'm gonna unbox something exciting for you today but it's already here, I already unboxed it in the sitting on my desk. Today we're taking a look at the Xbox series X and the new Xbox series S. I have to say it very slowly because every time I say it fast, my home pod thinks that I'm saying, hey! (energetic music) These are just display models so they're not actually working, but these are a full size replica of what the actual devices will look like and I could not be more excited. The series X is $499 and the series S is $299 and they are both available on November 10th. I think a lot of people were expecting X-Box obviously do a smaller console that is a more cost efficient, but I think one of the things that we didn't think was it was going to be out at the same time as the actual series X. So let's just take a look at them side by side. So the S is digital only and this does have a storage up to 512 gigs and the X has storage up to one terabyte and this do have expansion slots. So you will be able to expand the storage up to one terabyte. When I first opened these, I was kind of shocked because I actually thought that both of them would be a lot larger than they were. This S is so small, it does have a lot of ventilation both on the top and on this little, kind of looks like a camping stove, like that's kind of what I see. And it does have these little leggies right here on both one side and on the bottom. You even have some ventilation there too so depending upon how you want to place this, actually that's a perfect size. So you could have it here or could have it like this, let's take a look at the back ports. We've got ethernet, two USBs, HDMI, this is the storage expansion slot and I imagine this is where the power supply will go to power the whole device. Sink, it's got a nice USB port on the front, power button, does not work, but very soon it will, well not in this device this is not real, there's nothing in here. It's crazy how light it is because there's nothing inside of it. So it will be interesting to see the weight when there's actually components inside of it. So, very similar to the S we have HDMI, power, expansion slot, two USB ports and ethernet, ventilation on the back, there's ventilation on the top and on the bottom. Here's a really cool example of the airflow to keep the console cool and quiet. It also has a split motherboard, which is the first time ever on a console. This allows for even temperature control for more output power. I'm definitely excited for next-gen consoles, but I think what's interesting is the fact that they did decide to launch both of these side by side. The S is quite interesting because Microsoft was taking into account that most people would prefer to have higher frame rate as opposed to 4K gaming. So with that, the S was born and here it is. This really, it's just a quick little video to show you guys what these actual devices will look like in the wild when you finally do get them. Something else that X-Box has been doing a great job of is the integration of Game Pass, with Game Pass Ultimate, you can play on a mobile device, PC and even on your consoles. So I would love to know what you guys think, I feel like on Twitter, a lot of you guys were of course, very vocal, the console wars, that PC master race, just play what you wanna play. Do you like playing video games? I don't care what you play on, you wanna call me an Xbox fan girl, here, let me give you a little more fuel to that fire. This is the Advanced Warfare Xbox one, this thing is beautiful, I mean, just look at this, look at this stuff. Isn't it neat? What did you think of my Xbox collection? What? Oh! Complete, it's not, because we've also have my other favorite one. This is the Xbox 360 Star Wars edition. Can you just look at this? This also has a C-3PO controller and it's so cool. Normally, if I do have other X-Box is like this, I will either donate them or give them to friends. These are the Xboxs that I've kept in my collection because they are my favorite work they have sentimental meaning. This was the Ombre Xbox, this was the one that Taco Bell sent out a while ago, like last year, it just looks pretty awesome. Also one of my favorites, this is the Gears exclusive Xbox One X this one has so many details and I love that they really went for it. I mean, there's like cracks some texture and design as well and Xbox One S. This is the one that I really wanted to compare the size to for the S, there was also an Xbox One S digital version, this is not the digital, this has the CD slot. I did have a really cool Gears 360 Xbox, but that actually went to my grandmother. We did upgrade her to an Xbox One at some point, I mean, I don't know how many of your grandmothers have consoles that are just, I'm sure some actually, my audience, I know you, I'm sure you guys have grandmas that have console. So we're on the same page here. Okay, I'm gonna stack these up, right here. It's just, wow! That is Xbox One X is beefy, the 360 design, it's pretty good. Xbox One S in comparison to the Xbox series S, it's so small, like, look at this. Are you seeing this tiny, small, (bright energetic music) I mean, this in comparison to, it's even kind of hard to even compare it, like how do you? Because this is such a new form factor like Xbox hasn't really done anything in this kind of, I mean, it's like a big rectangle, you can display it either vertical or horizontal. I'm curious to see like what most people decide is the way that they're going to use this. I wanna compare this though, to the Xbox One, because that, my God this is so many, I'm so weak, oh geez! that's probably like 50. We wanna say that, like this is? This is basically this, but squished. It's shorter, I really think if you kind of just squish this down, it would be the same thing. (bright energetic music) I don't even know what the best way is to show the size comparison, can you tell? There's a connect port, connect, rest in peace. One more thing. Sea of Thieves now has dogs in the game and they sent out this cute little press package. I wasn't gonna unbox this, but as soon as I opened it up, it was so cute I had to, I'm gonna take this off and put it on my dog's cage. This is a very cute box, this is awesome. A small scroll, if you will. This is nice too This looks like they're wax seal this is super cute. Sea of Thieves now offers pirates their chance to sail the seas with a canine companion, but even the inside of the box, cute, the details, banana, apple and blueberry dog biscuits. Oh, it's actually for a dog, it's not for human consumption. When communicating publicly about Microsoft X-Box precision, so I have to disclose that I have not received compensation, but this is a free product that I have received from Microsoft, so thank you. They told me to use easily understood language. Okay well, I think you guys understood it. Oh my God I think we found some treasure. Oh, look at this, this is so cool. If you guys don't know, I love skulls I have them all around my house. It basically looks like Halloween here all year round. So this is awesome. Wonder if there's a game code on the inside. Oh, look at these. These bags are so cute, what a cool press kit. Thank you, Microsoft for sending this I love Sea of Thieves, it's such a fun game. Do you guys remember when I had a CFU birthday party? two years ago? Happy birthday, Aye Justine, do you guys get it? So I would love to hear from you guys what do you guys think of these consoles? I'm sure there's gonna be a big war in the comments, which is not really welcomed, but you guys are going to do it anyway. So who am I to tell you what to do? Make sure you guys subscribe and like this video and hit the bell, so you'll be notified when a new video comes out and I've got a lot of really great videos coming out very soon. So stay tuned, I'm excited. It's official gaming season, sensation. I feel like this whole year is actually one gaming season, 'cause we can't leave the house or do anything else. So gaming season upgraded. (energetic music)",

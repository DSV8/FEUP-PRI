    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   TurtleCell Headphone Case for iPhone -   This iPhone accessory aims to make sure that you've always got headphones with you. It's also for those who wish that their iPhone operated more like a vacuum cleaner.  From the Amazon page -  The Turtle Cell is the first protective iPhone case with premium, built-in retractable headphones and the first solution that eliminates losing, tangling and breaking of headphones all in one device. With the Turtle Cell, simply pull the headphones out to any comfortable length and they lock into place for convenient listening. Hands-free calling is safe and easy with the in-line microphone and push button controls. When you're done using the headphones, just push a button to retract the headphones back into the case for safe storage. The case also features a built-in kickstand so you can effortlessly enjoy hands-free media anywhere. An audio switch on the bottom of the case allows users to engage or disengage the headphones without ever removing the case. The Turtle Cell is built from a high-impact polycarbonate material and has a 1mm lip over the front of the phone to provide superior protection. Even with a full-length pair of headphones and superior protection, the Turtle Cell only adds 7mm of additional thickness to your phone.

    "transcript": "Put me in coach. This one goes out to Peter Borough.. so recently you saw a video in which I discuss the upcoming iPhone, the iPhone 7 and everybody's all upset because there might not be a headphone jack in fact it's pretty obvious at this point. Now there's a lot of people that are not too happy about this so I decided to bring you a video here to talk all about headphones and jacks.. and \"Jacks\" This my friends is a retractable headphone case from TurtleCell. This is a case with the headphones in the case. *Did you hear me? Its crazy right?!* *Let me just have my drink and give you a moment to think about that* I know it's crazy I don't know who this is for that's what it looks like. Now they claim that these headphones are good as well Kevlar fibers for increased cables.. I don't know- I don't know about all that. Let's find out if they're any good or maybe.. They suck! Little tips here.. Alright, there is the case. *Laughing* Man, it's kind of big to be quite honest. Alright, it's just.. Oh my gosh! Okay, so that part comes off here's an iPhone 6s, now is made for the 6 but.. as you know. At the bottom over here there is a mini jack connector which goes into the audio jack here now obviously iPhone 7, this ain't gonna work. That's it. *Pulling earphones out* *Surprised face* When I was a kid we had a vacuum cleaner that did.. did you have one of those? So this part clicks in. And you know what!? It's not crazy and you want to get those headphones out you just kind of grab on like that and then hit the button. WHOA! You have the cut out for your camera still, all your buttons sort of moved to these locations on the side.. hang on a second.. yeah there.. Pull that out now the headphone plug will not be in the phone so the speaker should be functioning and then back in and then you're golden. Now the kickstand situation. I mean that straightforward; kickstand you're eating lunch. Oh look at that! Those are magnetic! Alright music, how do they sound.. *Dubstep music from the eaphones* I think they sound pretty good I'm amazed at how many decent headphones exist now. It feels like human beings have figured out the headphone, because these things sound pretty decent. Does that really change the fact that it's a it's this bizarre oh?.. That's fun! I mean I could do that startles me every time. Here.. Wow! Maybe you're the type of person who always forgets to bring your headphones. There's nothing worse than wishing you had headphones when you don't, like, you're in a waiting room somewhere you know what I'm talking about you're waiting for something to happen and you're like \"Oh wanna watch this Youtube video right now\", but at the same time the person next to me - I don't really want them to be involved. They're like emergency headphone and a kickstand and a crazy look in case called TurtleCell. And you know I like turtles.",

    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to... (presenters laugh) - It was really loud. (beeps) - Hello and welcome to This Is. There's a new kid in town when it comes to gaming. It's not Nintendo. It's not Microsoft. It's not even PlayStation. - Sega. - It's definitely not Sega but maybe it will be in the future. There's a new streaming service a new player and it's Netflix. - I am gonna be very honest and transparent with you. I don't get it. (laughs) That's the gist of my conversation for this video. What is, okay so I understand that Netflix have acquired a number of studios slash licensed games. - They have very quietly, over the past several months, they have been inquiring left and right in a lot of IPs. - They're gathering up this gang of studios. And they are trying to release games that will be included with your Netflix subscription, for now. On the surface, it makes sense that Netflix, as an entertainment company wants to be involved, to have their hands in every entertainment pie they can. right I get it. Gaming is a huge, huge revenue driver. Mobile games make billions and billions of dollars. Like I get it. What I don't understand. First of all, how someone who has a Netflix account even knows about the games and second of all, how do you download them? - So what it's really trynna do, it's poised to try and be a competitor, not to like Game Pass or like Stadia or Amazon Luna. But what this one is meant to compete with is like Apple Arcade or Google's Play Pass which I have. Apple Arcade just because I have it through Apple One. It's their all in one subscription service. It's pretty nice. Like I'll be honest. There's a lot of good games on there. I don't know if I would actually pay the five bucks or whatever it is a month. The main thing with these particular types of streaming platforms is that they are actually trying to break the status quo of mobile gaming a little bit. - Yeah. - Where there are no micro transactions in any of the games found on these platforms. - It's like the old school, you know, you buy the game or you get include in your subscription. And then you've got the full experience available for free assuming that you're paying your $77 a month for your Netflix subscription - We're up to $20 a month for the premium Netflix which is insane to me. - It's a lotta money. - Right there and just-- - So... - It's rotated here. There you go. Okay. - Oh, Jesus Christ. - Oh (mumbles) wait. My label's not straight. There we go. My label's straight now. - Are there different flavors of Coke Coffee? - Oh, there are actually. Dark blend-- - This video is not about coke coffee. - It's delicious. Honestly, I'll hook you up. I'm just trying to add a little extra spice a little extra flavor in your life. Much as Coke Coffee does for me. (laughs) I will give them a little bit of props, that a Netflix I think has the widest catalog of not only licensed but also original content. Like I mean, if I was gonna drop every streaming service I think Netflix would be the last one I would keep just because there's so much stuff. But I get the idea that they're trying to via gaming give you a little extra spice on your subscription. - Yeah. - Make it worth $25 a month or whatever they wanna charge you next month. But the thing that I don't understand, I really need you to guide me with your Jedi like wisdom, even though it's Disney, how as a Netflix subscriber, can I get access to these games? 'Cause I'll tell you I am a Netflix subscriber and if I wasn't paying attention to all the news I would even know that this is included in my already paid subscription. - And that's... I'm gonna say that this is probably the most confusing and worst (presenter laughs) way that things have been launched. I don't know whether this is like a soft launch that Netflix is trynna do. Like Netflix has not sent, been like, oh yeah, come check out Netflix gaming. They've not done that at all. You know-- - Is it even called Netflix gaming? Do they have actually like a brand for it? - I don't think so. That's like-- - It's just games. - They're just like oh yeah, we bought all these gaming studios and each of these devices here. So we have an iPhone, a Samsung Z flip, the 5g 'cause I don't get the new one and then a Microsoft Surface zero two. Because I'm the third person in the world who has this. Each one of these has a different interface on how you see and discover games. I'm gonna go ahead and open up my Netflix app on here. Bring up Netflix. I'm gonna go to Austin. - I have one profile? - Yeah. Made a profile for you. - Oh, that's so sweet. - So if you look here, not a whole lot are gonna like, it's movies. But if we scroll down, I mean it's very much mobile games. It's Kittens, Teeter Up, Bowling Ballers whatever. They bought the rights to all the Stranger Things Pixel games - Which is kinda weird because those were licensed by Netflix in the first place but what about like, so it seems like an okay selection. What happens on an iPhone if I tap one of those games. - So it's the same for both Android and iPhone. They're not in the app. It brings you here, get the game. And it brings you to the App Store for each of these. - Which makes sense 'cause obviously they would immediately get super duper banned by apple if they tried to let you play games inside the app. So it is just a glorified link from the Netflix app into the App Store. I'm assuming if you actually purchase and download the game, you will need to authenticate then log in with your Netflix account to play it. - You can go and get all these apps on the App Store, like without going through the Netflix first. But you need to sign in with your Netflix account, which if you have the app there it just pulls in the authentication there. - Oh, that's clever because that gets around having to pay Apple anything because it's free free free and Apple's not gonna get a chunk of your or Netflix subscription. - Yep. What I'm curious with there is like whether it's gonna stay that way. - Yeah. - So right now you don't have to pay anything extra. These games are included for free with your already very expensive Netflix subscription. Correct? - And that's kinda what I'm, like, I mean, Netflix has the worst track record. Every year it feels like they've been increasing their price by a buck or two. The cheapest plan is still four ADP, right? 480 P and it's still fairly expensive. You know, it's still like double what I was paying for when I first started Netflix. - Matt, have you ever heard of the thing called inflation and profits? Cause both of those - Yeah. - combined are a bad combination. - I'm gonna give them credit and then immediately take it away. - Much like I immediately take away that a delicious buzz I get from Coke Coffee available at your local retailer. - Lemme see that real quick. It's just-- - No, you can't damage the brand, our-- - Okay, you know, you're really turning me around on this. - I don't believe you. - That's just... - But here. (can clanks) - I'm gonna... (presenter laughs) - This video has been brought to you by Matt's bad temper. (beeps) - I'm gonna give Netflix credit and say like, it's great that they're actually just including this in your already existing Netflix account. However, I do think they're just gonna use this as ammo and next year they're gonna be like, you know what? Look at all these additional services that we're offering you, when it will now your price is gonna be $25 or something like-- - Or what they could do is if they build out a big enough library of games, whether they're licensed or purchased, they could actually offer you a Netflix gaming subscription and just the same way as everything else, I feel like Apple might get a little salty about it. But they could theoretically with the workarounds that they've done, you pay the $5 a month or whatever for Netflix gaming and instead of just getting pure video or something you actually only just get the games that are available. So like there's interesting sort of ramifications for why Netflix is doing this. I agree. It is incredibly bizarre that they are doing it in such a weird, like kind of quiet. Like it feels like a beta, more than anything. But-- - I feel like this is a soft launch beta 'cause right now they don't have any blockbuster titles. Like the Stranger Things games. They're actually pretty fun but they're definitely not like platform selling things. Like on Apple Arcade, they have like some of the like LEGO games specifically. They have like a LEGO version of Super Smash Bros, which is like a really good game. They're also like proper games on Apple Arcade. Right now Netflix doesn't have that. So I feel like what's gonna happen is they're gonna just continue this kinda like soft beta, let people kinda trickle in, start to get some data on it, stuff like that. And then like, alright when they have like Squid Games two like the season two come out and they have like a properly first person licensed game that's when they like really announce it. You know, they're in a position here and I feel like this is actually what Sony's gonna be wanting to do a lot in the future for this massive vertical integration of, look if Netflix really wants to become a gaming company these are the first baby steps, you know? Yeah. We're focusing on mobile games but what happens when Netflix wants to get into like a Triple A game? What happens when they make that game and they actually are able to leverage getting like proper voice actors, like the actual actors from the show are like voice acting in the game. - Well they've been experimenting with this even before the broad games, right. Because they've also done the interactive things. Remember there was a Black Mirror episode a while ago. - Yep, Bandersnatch. - Bandersnatch (mumbles)-- - You're in that. Sorry, mate. Wrong path. - [Man] Sticking around? (wind blowing) - As far as I'm aware, none of these games are available like on your TV or anything like that. - Yeah, yeah. - One of the things is like all right, well how profitable is this gonna be? Because you know, mobile games are super profitable because of all the micro transactions. - Sure. But you know it's also profitable paying an extra two bucks a month. Times millions and millions and millions of Netflix subscribers. But let us know what you think in the comments below. Does Netflix gaming stand a chance? Are we are all about to give up our game pass and our PS Plus and our Steam Deck ultra services in favor of Netflix? Let us know, subscribe and let Matt know that if he throws my Coke Coffee again I'm gonna lose the sponsorship that I've never gotten in the first place. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "What's up guys Lew here back with another video. ...and... This is a little different. It's a 3D L.E.D. lamp from \"Liuyao's bosom\". I saw this on Amazon and I was like, \"That!\" \"I need that!\" Look at this thing. Some kind of 3 dimensional lamp... ...projection Could it be the coolest thing ever? It's possible. Unlikely...but possible. No idea what this key thing means on the front. Key or ring, or whatever. I like it, it's from \"Liuyao's Bosom\". It speaks to me. Holy jamolios. This is, uh... ...gonna' go on my bedside table. ...Somewhat underwhelming currently. O.K. this... ...is a skull. It's like an etched out skull. Oooh, listen to this guys. Whoa-oh-oh-oh... Greyskull. Castle Greyskull. He-man What was his name? Skeletor! Kind of looks like Skeletor. There's this little base... ...here... ...and a power port... ...for this. No power brick though. I guess you gotta'... O.K. I'm gonna' go ahead and assume...you gotta' have your own U.S.B. power brick. Well listen; it's like 18 or 20 dollars, right? Stop whining. U.S.B. Ooooh. Oh! Why not? Wireless. You just tap right there... ...and the L.E.D.s go on. Magic time. Woooo! That's spooky right there. That's, uh... ...what can I say? It's... ...for anyone who's into the kind of Halloween decor. Look at this little guy; completely cordless. Tap him; he's off. Again; he's on. Your own little skull lamp. Who know's you're looking for a different kind of lamp... ...something with a little attitude; maybe this is for you? Like I said they're like 20 bucks. Check out the designs. I'll put a link in the description. There you have it.",

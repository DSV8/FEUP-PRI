    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here This is the third and last CES video that I'm gonna do this year and again apologies for the non normal image quality being shot on a phone Checked out the Asus event they didn't have any amazing laptops I mean they had some refreshes and stuff But nothing that was like really amped up about but they did have this really cool Bezel remover thing so for triple monitor setups. You know you can normally see the bezels in between each monitor now They have these plastic bars That serve as lenses to basically hide those bezels And it's actually very effective you didn't think that something that was just a piece of plastic could look this good But they put them on and it actually looks like a bezel free display There's a little bit of distortion from the plastic lens, but it actually looks quite good And it's weird how inexpensive this thing's going to be because it's just a piece of plastic and how effective it is They also have this external GPU that looks really slim and sleek It's just like a very narrow box for what external GPUs often are but the thing that made this thing special was its price tag This thing's going for 330 bucks, and it's actually one of the better-looking external GPUs out there So I think that's gonna be cool now in regards to laptops there were two laptops that stood out at CES for me the first Is actually an XPS 15 2 in 1 so it's not replacing their regular XPS 15 They're still gonna have those, but this is the first tuned one that they've had for the XPS 15 lineup Here's the thing when I first heard about this thing when I first saw the press release I wasn't impressed because I'm not a big user of 2 in 1 devices that are big like a 15-inch two and one device is gonna be big and when it's in tablet form I thought it would be pretty uncomfortable to hold and just not a great device for me personally So I'm gonna check this thing out with not particularly high hopes, but this thing is awesome. It's not great as a tablet It's still not gonna be a comfortable thing to hold But this is excellent as a laptop and really really good in like Presentation or tent mode it has this Maglev keyboard that uses magnets to keep the keyboard really thin so this thing only has a zero Point seven millimeter key travel, which is really really shallow, and you'd expect something with that short key travel to feel crappy But it doesn't at all It's not the best keyboard certainly not But when you type on this thing it actually feels like a one two a one point two millimeter key travel It feels really nice it also has lots of USB-c ports with four lane thunderbolt 3 support finally, which is great the micro SD slot a bit of a buzzkill. I feel like on a device like this That's obviously geared towards creatives. It's weird to put a microSD instead of a regular SD slot It has pen support and because the whole XPS lineup tends to have a stiffer hinge you can just write on it without the screen Wobbling too much now. I was only able to test it in 3d paint which isn't the most optimized program the thin strokes We're fine. There's no latency It's actually felt really good, but the thicker strokes with more complex textures and just bigger brushes had some lag to it They're running the new Intel chips that have the 8th gen CPU combined with the Radeon Vega MG views. It's pretty cool I think that those will have performance similar to a 1050 1050 Ti I'm not sure exactly that we weren't able to benchmark it But I'm excited to test that thing and I think one of the big advantages of this thing is Thermals like the way that they've designed and engineered this chip should definitely help with thermal output so overall it's a pretty cool Device, I have to test this thing more thoroughly to really give a final opinion on it But I think it should be pretty good They also have this Thunderbolt 3 external drive Which is I mean it's a really really fast drive for people that need it there aren't that many options out there for a Thunderbolt 3 external SSD so it's nice to see them in the game the last booth I've got to check out was LG, and they have a couple monitors that are pretty neat I mean the one that stands out for me is the 4k Thunderbolt 3 capable one, so now you're able to connect two displays daisy-chained to a single MacBook Pro Which is pretty neat? They also have a 5k Widescreen panel that isn't curved and also uses Thunderbolt 3 so you can have that single cable set up Which is nice now the star of the show? Was this thing the new LG gram so if you follow my channel from earlier I did one of the early reviews of the original LG grant 14 is such a Cool idea like a super super thin laptop super lightweight laptop, but I hated it I felt like the thermals were bad the build quality was poor. It just wasn't a good product and this was like what? 2015-2016 they've improved on a year upon year and it's gotten really good But this iteration is freaking amazing So I feel like they changed so much on this thing and basically Listened to everybody who had anything to complain about the LG gram and made it what people wanted it's still the same kind of design But they improved on the build quality again, and this time and it feels extra tanky so this has actually been certified by the US Department of Defense was something that and it's surprising to see a device this thin and this light With that kind of certification it also has a 72 watt hour battery just to put this into perspective XPS 13 Razer Blade Stealth those have batteries in the 60 watt hour range Just like the previous LG Gramm, but this new one is 72 watt hours. I'm just quick math It's like like 20 25 percent better. That's a significant improvement in battery life. It has Thunderbolt 3 support although I'm not sure if it's 2 or 4 Lane They've improved the webcam location like instead of being in the middle and the hinge looking up your nose It's now at the top and the mark traditional spot. They have slightly better speakers They have a better location for the fingerprint sensor And they now have to drive bays inside so for people that want extra storage you now have that option Visually it doesn't look that different, but in the short amount of time. I got to spend with it I think it's gonna be a great laptop. I think it's a significant improvement from the previous generation ok last video at CES Hope you guys enjoyed them thumbs if you liked it. Subs if you loved it. We'll see you guys next time",

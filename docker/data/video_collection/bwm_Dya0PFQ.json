    "transcript": "Today Id like to show you what might be my veryfavorite camera. This is an Olympus Pen EES-2. Its a 35mm point-and-shoot camera from the late 1960s and there are two remarkable things about it. The first is that this is a half-framecamera. Rather than expose the typical 36 by 24mm section of film (the standard 35mm stillimage) it splits that in half and shoots an 18 by 24mm frame. The upshot of doing this is aslightly smaller camera (?) and supposedly the Pen name comes from the cameras diminutive size. [said ever-so-skeptically] Imean its not that small in the grand scheme but I... I guess Ill roll with it. Oh, citation needed. Interesting. Anyway, my favorite consequence of halving the frame is that you get double theexposures on every roll of film. Thats pretty neat! Youll see that the exposure counter goes to 72 rather than the typical 36. However many exposures are on the roll youre putting in the camera, this camera will let you take double that! Half-frame cameras were something of afad in the 1960s, but the fad would quickly die out. Frankly, Im not sure why. Youd think peoplewould appreciate getting double the exposures with every roll of film, even if it meant a slightreduction in quality. I mean, for basic family photos and snapshots a half-frame still holdsplenty of detail. These are some of my favorite shots I've taken with this camera; Ive enlarged themto 8X10 size and theyre still sharp-as-a-tack. Actually, as a matter of fact, the sidewaysfilm frames this shoots are the same size as a 35mm motion picture frame. And backin the day we were regularly blowing those up to movie screen sizes. Because, yaknow, movies were shot on this film stuff. If I were to guess what caused the demise ofthe half-frame concept, it would be that unlike virtually all cameras which orient the frame so that it matches the cameras orientation, this one is backwards! Holding it up in thenatural camera-holding position produces... a portrait frame, and if you want landscapeframes you need to turn the camera sideways. Thats a bit awkward, and since people tend to want a wider-than-tall image, this may have been seen as quite a downsideback in its day. There were some half-frame cameras that got around this by running thefilm vertically through the body, but as a result they had wildly different form factors from what people were used to in a camera. Theres really no way to get around thisbasic shape, so while you might be able to move controls around and make this its morenatural orientation... that would still be weird. For what its worth, I find this pretty interesting froma creativity perspective. Its easy to overlook turning a camera sideways for a portrait shot, but thats this cameras natural orientation so you almost have to consider it. As it happens,Kodak recently released a point-and-shoot half frame camera so I suppose the idea might becoming back in vogue with the resurgence of film. Especially since its getting kinda pricey. Onething people like to do with this format is plan images in pairs and print them together like this, though frankly Ive never really considered that and just treat them as individual images whenIm shooting. I think that got started because most film processing labs and scanners reallydont know what to do with half-frames despite the fact that the film edge markings clearly accommodate them and have since forever ago! so the roll gets scanned or even printed as 36 pairsof images. But cmon, folks. You can crop them. Anyway Im still talking about the half-framepart, and thats not nearly as interesting as the fact that this camera has fully automaticexposure control, yet it doesnt need any batteries. In fact theres nowhere to put them because this is a light-powered camera. OK, powered might be a stretch - you still wind thefilm manually with this thumb-wheel, uh, this crank is for rewinding at the end of a roll... basically thefilm-handling bits are all human-powered. But the shutter speed and aperture are set automatically. It will even prevent you from taking a picture if theres not enough light - a little red flagpops up in the viewfinder, and a mechanical interlock prevents the shutter from releasing. This is atrue point-and-shoot camera, completely automatic (aside from focusing) despite not needinga power source and being entirely analog. [shutter clicks] You might be wondering how this works. Good thingyou clicked on this particular video cause Im gonna tell ya! But first, a one-paragraph explanation oncamera basics. Photographic film has a certain sensitivity to light, and to form images correctlyon the film, you need to control how much light hits it during exposure - too much, and theimage will appear bright with little detail, not enough and an image may not form at all. Acamera has two means of controlling the exposure: a variable lens aperture which changes how much light is allowed through the lens, and how long it keeps the shutter open and exposing the film to that light, known as the shutter speed. Adjustments to these values are made in whatare called stops, with each stop doubling or halving the amount of light allowed onto thefilm. For example, a 1/50 of a second shutter speed allows one stop more twice as much light compared to a 1/100 second shutter speed. That can be compensated for by closing the lens aperture down by one stop, which allows half as much light through it. Professional photographers might want to do that to increase the depth of focusing field, orthey might want to open the lens wider and use a faster shutter speed to reduce motion blur. This camera, though, well it handles all that for you. Most of this cameras exposure control isdone with the aperture. In its resting state, the aperture is closed all the way. What youreseeing in the center of the lens is the opening made by the aperture blades. This camera hasa square aperture which is a little weird but it works just fine. The itty-bitty almost-pinhole is the lens in its most stopped-down state, /22. The aperture is mechanically linked to theshutter button, and as you press it in, the aperture opens up. When its all the wayopen, the camera lets as much light through as it can. In this case the widest -stop is 2.8. Just to be clear, this is not the shutter. Thats behind the lens and we cant see it here. Theshutter remains closed, preventing light from hitting the film, except for that fractionof a second when you actually snap a photo. You can manually select different aperturevalues with this ring. Youll notice that when I pick a value somewhere in the middle, the bladesstart to open with the shutter button as before, but now they stop opening mid-way. This hereis /5.6, a fairly typical setting. But, watch what happens when I switch this to auto mode. Theaperture is back to opening all the way with the shutter button. But if I shine a little light intothe camera's lens and press the button, well now the aperture doesnt open all the way. If I make thelight very intense, the aperture hardly moves at all. Somehow, this is reacting to more light hittingthe lens and reducing how much the aperture opens to compensate and produce equivalentexposures on film. Thats pretty wild. To understand how this works, first I want toshow you something else. When using a fully-manual camera, to know what aperture and shutter speedsettings you should use a light meter is awfully handy. This here is a simple handheld lightmeter which consists of a light sensor here, a dial with a buncha numbers there, and asimple display down below. The needle in that display moves depending on how much light hits thesensor, and by turning the dial so that the little red-circle-on-a-stick thing surrounds the needle, you end up with a chart of acceptable shutter speed and aperture settings. Changing the filmspeed setting simply moves the aperture values independent of the rest of the mechanism whicheffectively factors in the films sensitivity. The reason I wanted to show you this particularlight meter is that this also doesnt usebatteries. The sensor here is a selenium lightcell, an early photovoltaic cell. Think of it like a really old solar panel. When light hitsit, it generates a voltage and thats whats moving the needle. Basically all this is is anold-fangled solar cell hooked up to a voltmeter thats been repurposed alongside a clever slide-rule-like chart handy to photographers. The characteristics of the cells output are very useful in photography because its logarithmic; each doubling of light that hits the cell moves theneedle the same amount. So if theres twice as much light it will move the needle one -stopover, which of course realigns the chart by one stop once you move the circle-on-a-stick thing. A quadrupling of light would move the needle two stops over, an eight-fold increase would result in three stops of movement, and you get the idea. The honeycomb lensing in front of the cell makes it most sensitive to a cameras general field of view. I dont know what exactlythe frame is this guys looking for, but the idea is that you can just pointthis in the general direction of where you want to take a picture and itllgive you decent exposure settings. Itll be a scene average so more particularphotographers would want to take that intoaccount for high-contrast scenes, and mighteven want to bring this guy up to something in the scene that will register as a middle-grayand take a more selective reading. Oh and you definitely want to shade the sensor from direct sunlight as that will absolutely skew the reading. Now, you might have already noticed that the lens of the Olympus Pen is surrounded by a similar-lookinghoneycomb stuff. Intriguing, right? Now might bea good time to mention that the EE in EES-2 stands for Electronic Eye. Lets go ahead and assumethat the honeycomb stuff is some sorta light meter (because it is). How could we design a camerawhich uses the mechanism of a conventional light meter to automatically set an exposure setting? Well, remember how the aperture functions? It starts out all the way closed, and its opened by the shutter button. But when enough light lands on the lens, something stops it from opening all theway. What could that something be? Well, through the Magic of Buying Two of Them, I have an alreadytaken apart one right here which I can show you! Here is the light meter and viewfinder assembly from an earlier variant of this camera, the PenEE-S. We have the selenium light cell here, anda couple of itsy bitsy wires connect it through a resistor to this thing. Notice theres aneedle sticking out of it? Well, watch what happens when I shine more light onto the cell. That needle moved! This is the same exact concept as the hand-held light meter, but rearranged,miniaturized, and stuck into a camera body. But hang on, how does that translate into anexposure setting? Surely there must be more to it. Well, through the Magic of Buying Three ofThem, I have a not-yet-taken-apart-one right here! This is another EES-2, but in grey, and I needto disassemble it because the shutter blades are sticking and need to be cleaned. This process is fiddlyand finicky, involving tiny little screws and also removing the lenss front element. Which is a prettyprecarious proposition as focusing is accomplished by rotating that element and thus slightly unscrewing it fromthe body, so before you take it apart you absolutely need to set focus to infinity and mark the lens positionsomehow so you can put it back exactly where it was. If you mess that up, all your pictureswill be blurry as heck. Ask me how I know! Anyway, once were to this point we can see the needle barely. Its tucked right up here. Right nowits free-floating, and you can see it react to incoming light. It really is justlike the light meter we were looking at. But when I depress the shutter button, well the magichappens. An intricate series of linkages cause a pair of feelers to move upward towards thatneedle. The first feeler touches the needle and jams it against a stop right above it to keep itfrom moving. Then a second feeler with sloping, stepped teeth approaches the needle. That secondfeeler is connected to the aperture mechanism of the camera, and where it stops along its journeyupward determines how far the aperture will open. And the needle is what stopsit. See where this is going? When theres less light hitting the camera, the needle is farther to the right, which is among the skinnier parts of the feeler. Thatallows it to travel farther upward - notice how the thicker parts of the feeler are now above theneedle. With the feeler in this high position, it opens the aperture blades a great amount. But asmore light hits the camera, the needle is pushed farther to the left, so the feelers thicker partswill hit it first and thus it cant travel as far upward. That prevents the aperture from opening asmuch, reducing the amount of light that can travel through the lens to compensate. Each doublingof light hitting the lens pushes the needle one stop over, which in turn restricts the opening of the aperture by one stop, thus the amount of light that makes it through the lens remains consistent no matter how bright the scene is. Pretty clever, huh? A simple integration of aselenium light cell and analog meter mechanism into a camera bodys aperture mechanism allows for automatic exposure control. But you might have noticed that the aperture feeler has two sections to it. Whats going on with that? Ah, well, thiscamera actually has two shutter speeds. It will either shoot at 1/200 of a second or 1/40of a second, and that first feeler which traps the needle is what determines which one it willuse. Oh, by the way, this arrangement is often called trap-needle metering. Probablyshould have brought that up earlier. Anyway, you might have caught that the first feeler itself had two steps to it. If the needle is far enough to the right that the higher part of the feeler hits it, the shutter will engage with a delay mechanism which holds it openfor just an itty bit. Thats the 1/40 of a second speed. Heres how that works: winding the film puts theshutter mechanism under tension. When it releases, this small cam will quickly make a complete rotation, which rapidly opens and closes the shutter blades through this linkage. On thatcam is a protrusion which will hit this piece of metal and stop its motion. That piece of metalis attached to this spring-loaded brass weight, which right now Im preventing from moving. When I letgo of it, the force of the shutters spring will push the weight out of its way, and theshutter closes. The function of the lever and weight is to deliberately (and literally) getin the way of the shutter mechanisms movement, with the mass of that weight providing a calibrated delay that slows it down. But if the needle is beyond that first step, the feeler will travel a bit farther upward - just enough so that this lever will travel beyond this linkage and allow it to move. Now, as the shutter button is depressed, the weight and its stop are pushed out of the way by the linkage. With the delay nolonger in the picture, the shutter mechanism fires in one swift motion. Lets look atthat again. With moderate light levels, the needle stops the feeler here so this leverprevents this linkage from moving with the shutter button. When the shutter fires, the shutter cam will slaminto the weight, briefly holding it open. But if theres enough light, the needlestops the feeler here. And now that lever out of the way of the linkage, so it will actually push theweight out of the way as you press the shutter button and therefore bypass the delay. Take a listen to what those shutter releasessound like - the difference is a bitsubtle, but see if you can hear it. At the slow speed, you can hear the shutter open and close as two discrete clicks. [two discrete clicks] But at the fast speed, you only hear one click as the shutter is opened and shut in one smooth motion. [one click] The transition between steps in the shutter feeler lines up perfectly with the aperture feelers little kink. And this is designedto prioritize the higher shutter speed. The farthest right position represents a1/40 of a second exposure at /2.8. Thats the widest-open lens at the slowest shutterspeed. But as soon as theres enough light to make a 1/200 exposure work, the aperturescale resets and we start again at /2.8. This wont mean much to you if youre notfamiliar with cameras, but for a consumer camera this design makes perfect sense as a 1/40second exposure requires a fairly steady hand, but 1/200 is much more forgiving. Best to usethe faster shutter speed whenever possible. Ah, but what about that red-flag shutterinterlock doohickey? Hows that work? Well, if theres not enough light to take a photo, theneedle wont even reach the position of the feelers. That means theyll go right past the needle when they startmoving upward, and that jambs the shutter mechanism while lifting the little red flag up into the viewfinder. One of the things I really like about this camera's design is that its lens cap covers the light sensor so ifyou left that on it wont let you waste the frame. Very nice. Oh, and to explain the manual aperturesettings, theyre marked for flash as thats their main purpose. On manual settings the sensoris ignored and the shutter will always fire at 1/40 of a second. Using a chart on your flashunit and estimating the distance to your subject, youll set the aperture accordingly. The hotshoe on top was one of the things added for the EES-2. Now, you might wonder how the camera compensates for different film speeds. There is a film speed selector ring on the lens and this model willmeter for any speed between 25 and 400 ISO. How is it doing that? Well, watch as I changethe film speeds. Notice how as I get closer to 25, the numbers are getting closer together. Understand why? To make this work with differentfilm speeds, Olympus didnt need to do anything fancy like incorporate a variable resistor, instead... they just cover up parts of the sensor! Its hard to see but the actual sensor only occupies half of the circle around the lens, and turning the speed selector is sliding acover over it. When shooting 400 speed film, all of the sensor is exposed to light so its atits most sensitive. The needle will move as far as it ever will with a given amount of light. But when you use 200 speed film, which is half as sensitive to light, you need twice as muchlight to hit the film to get a correct exposure. And as silly as it sounds, just covering up halfof the sensor surface will compensate. That will make it so that twice as much light is needed to put the needle in the same position as before. See how that works? Its basically just foolingthe light meter into thinking theres less light, so it responds by opening up the aperture by one stop for every half of the sensor you block. Cover up half again and now only of the sensor is exposed, so it is as sensitive as it was; perfect for 100 speed film. Leave only ofit exposed and youve dulled the sensitivity another stop, making it work with 50 speed film. And at the slowest speed setting, 25, you need 16 times as much light so only a tiny sliver - 1/16of the sensors surface - is exposed to light. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this metering system is how well it works. Despite being a design originally from 1961, a design which is mostly mechanical but with a selenium light meter cleverly hacked intoit, this camera still functions perfectly. That is, once I gave it a little help. A common problemthat pops up after 40 or 50 years is gunk on the aperture blades, which jams the mechanism. I needed to fix that on this camera when I got it; its very common but cleanup withisopropyl alcohol usually does the trick. Assuming its mechanicallysound, though, this just works. Ive never taken a photo with thiscamera that wasnt exposed at leastmostly correctly. Negatives have decent anduniform density, color or black and white. About the only thing that occasionally happens is a bit of washout in high-contrast scenes, but thats to be expected with a meter whichsimply averages the frame. So long as you arent shooting the fastest speed one of these camerassupports, you could compensate by adjusting the ISO setting upward, causing it to underexposethe image. But leaving it set to your films box speed will almost always produce decent results. The lensing in front of the sensor is apparently very good at rejecting light from areas notin the cameras field of view. Even shooting partially into the sun results in apparentlydecent exposures. I mean Im sure Ive done it several times and yet *all* the images Ive takenwith this are workable... exposure-wise at least. Now I should note that Olympus wasnt the only company making cameras that worked like this. The selenium light cell made its way into loads ofcameras, even movie cameras like this one. But Im nonetheless enamored with this particularcamera. Its design and simplicity are just right in that sweet spot. And apparently Olympusdid such a great job with this design that theyd slap it onto full-frame cameras like thevenerable Trip 35. Once you get these side-by-side its clear that the design of the Trip 35 wasmore than just inspired by the Pen EES-2. These are the same camera mechanisms just with different bodies and lens focal lengths. I mean even the lens caps are interchangeable. Oh! And the Trip has the same red flag which means it doesnt fill the viewfinder because its toosmall! Oh right, and youll notice that the Trip... is barely any bigger than the Pen. Imean, I guess its enough to be significant but Im really not sure that making a smallercamera was the true goal of cutting the frame in half. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this look into thesecameras. There were quite a few Olympus Pen models back in the day, but its the EE series whichintrigues me the most. Taking the concept of the humble light meter and using it in conjunctionwith simple levers, feelers, doodads, and whatsits to create a fully-automatic camera is the sort of genius that we dont often see today. Some really interesting innovation can happen when you taketwo different technologies and connect them. [oof] olympically smooth jazz Today, Id like to.. Ouhh bleglebleblbblblblberblbulbb Vooooogue. Sa, sa said that really weird. Kodak recently released a point-and-shoot... oh yeah I was sposeda pick up the camar ba GAARRGHGHHGHGHGHG Though, frankly, Ive never really considered that and just treat them as individual shots when Im ppbbt! Ive made an error in the script! Uh, so anyway the roll getsprocessed or even printed eugh [some sorta beastly snort-growl] A light meter is awfully handy. Thishere I cant grab things correctly. When its all the way open, the camera left as much light through Nope, that was just me not reading. So, apparently a lot of you giggle at \"Pen EE-S\" I gotta be honest, I'm not smelling what you're stepping in. That's similar to \"pennies\" - pen, E. Pen E. The other thing you might be thinking of starts with a syllable that rhymes with \"keen.\" I mean, at least it does in my neck of the woods. Y'all are weird.",

    "transcript": "Not in the back. Where's my lens? Where'd you put it Jack? Alright, so it's camera time! I'm back with another video for awesome stuff week. This is the new A7R from Sony. A massive, megapixel monster. See the way I put that together there? 42.4 megapixels on a full-frame sensor. It also has something I'm really interested in, which is 5 axis stabilization in the body. That's image stabilization if you're unaware. Now normally that's in the lens itself, and the problem with that is you know some people they want to go use vintage lenses or specialty lenses like I like to shoot on wide angle and often those won't have any kind of IS so having it in the body means you can run around, run and gun, Jack knows what I'm talking about, and you can end up with smooth shots none-the-less. Especially important for video. So let's jump inside the box and take a closer look at this guy. Now I said also it's a full frame sensor that means the 35 millimeter equivalent when you stick a lens on here, as opposed to having to do some weird kind of calculation to figure out exactly how wide a particular lens might be. *Exclaims* Got some nice weight to it. Also a strap, battery charger; now this is pretty cool I noticed that we've actually got two batteries included that way with your external charger you can have one charge it up all the time while another one is in the body. Now this body feels pretty comfy that's... that's sort of my immediate reaction to it. It's... It's a little bit heavy but that's kind of the idea, it's super rugged, right? This unit here is the body itself, so you will still need to pick some glass for it, but of course that is the whole point of an interchangeable lens system, is that you're going to have a couple of different lenses for different purposes. I've got one in the back there that all install onto the camera. Not in the back! Where's my lens? Where'd you put it Jack? Very fast. Now what I'm interested in is video mode after all, I make videos. You probably know that already. Now this is also going to have a microphone input. Separate microphone input as well as headphone monitoring; Again, super useful for video makers and it's got a bunch of different formats too. But, if you're about that professional visual life, then it's worth selecting the highest end codec. Even as I zoom out and it becomes a little bit tougher to keep it steady, it's actually pretty cool. Awesome. Now obviously you want to see what I'm seeing you want to to see what this thing is capable of so let's go ahead and take this outside see what it can do. Alright so now you're looking at me through the A7R II in beautiful 4K. Well the 4K is beautiful, not so sure about me. *door opens* [Hey Louis] [Yo what up dude] What are you guys doing ? What are you doing more like ? [we are doing each others santa beards] I'm testing this Camera [oh maybe you want a santa beard!] NOO! thankyou I have to take care of this camera That is.... *Giggles* its a tie! Bye, Lewis. So there you have it A7R ll From Sony shoots 4 k video",

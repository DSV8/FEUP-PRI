    "transcript": "This HERE is another Viewer's Broken Gaming PC Welcome back to fix or Flop this rig was assembled with used components from eBay and has had issues as severe as not even powering on as far as I'm aware this graphics card has been replaced and so has this power supply the owner was eventually able to get the system to power on which that's step one right but then they ran into a no post issue where they weren't getting a signal to their monitor and that is where we are today this thing has been through a lot and it has not functioned since day one in fact it's not even Windows on this SSD because they haven't gotten a chance to install it they can't because they're not getting a signal at this point so um yeah hopefully we can fix this also the owner drove all the way from Jacksonville that's a pretty committed drive from Orlando especially considering I-4 traffic so I'm gonna do my best to have this one up and running for them are you ready stay with me

to grow with products offered for a wide range of applications check them out including their new xg8 drives by clicking the link below hey there and welcome to fix or Flop I'm not going to run through the same spill I always do you can find relevant info in the video description if you're interested in having your PC potentially fixed for free that's the one thing I want you to know about all the work you see us do here we do not charge these owners anything at all for any of the work that we do the troubleshooting the time it takes nor the parts if we have to replace components we can either dip into our own Pockets buy things from eBay second hand or Reach Out directly to vendors who would happily send something in exchange for a bit of exposure in the playlist your viewership by the way is what allows us to continue doing this so thank you for that continued support first things first first we're going to attempt to replicate the issue described by the owner the latest symptoms exhibited are just no post which means that we're probably going to see things light up but we shouldn't get a signal to our monitor we've got power at the rear power up front okay so it looks like front panel at least is wired correctly all of the fans are spinning motherboard LEDs are lit graphics cards lit graphics card fans are spinning already this by the way is an Intel platform I think it's actually yeah it's a z270 platform so that's Intel's 7000 series I recall correctly and um unfortunately this board does not have a doctor debug LED it has no debug LEDs at all of any kind that I can see so we're going in blind and well that props makes for a slightly spicier video I think the first thing I'm going to do is try to clear the CMOS and then we're also going to check Ram seating the two easiest things you can do when testing any rig oh and very quickly you can see we've got a bit of a mess down here Cable Management wise that's not a problem at all we'll take care of that of just yeah just questionable cable runs all around we do have two fans here one for the CPU Cooler one at the rear set to exhaust a piece that's totally fine but then we have this top RGB fan and this one's set to intake up top that's a bit strange even though it is dust filtered it's just um yeah it's a tad odd and then this front fan is set to exhaust which is also not conventional although I think this person did this because this aerocool Cylon or whatever this case is called it's just like the worst for airflow there's zero channeling anywhere around here for air to get through and so maybe they just did this because they wanted the aesthetic of like the LEDs to light things up inside I'm not sure I'm going to bring it to their attention but I'm not going to change it because I think it was intentional this case is just yeah it's a cheaper case it is what it is in a budget build now you can see right here it says clear CMOS and that I believe is corresponding to these two pins next to this fan header so you've got the system fully powered off and I'm going to jump these two pins for about 10 to 20 seconds also checking that dram is seated properly I have reinserted each of these dimms into the correct slot let's try Pat oh this is does the camera get that this is super loose it should not be turning like this we'll definitely have to tighten the CPU Cooler once we get this working now the other things we just did worked so now I'm going to rip the right side panel off and disconnect all non-vital cables so that we've isolated things down to just our platform the graphics card and the power supply let's see how it looks behind here carefully get this off all right I'm not bad this is not a modular power supply so nothing super obvious on this side of things I did verify that uh major connections are sound on the other side as well so yeah let's go ahead and rip out all the non-vital stuff you can see all this stuff down here disconnected some stuff further up as well and we still do not have a post so I'm going to shift my attention to this graphics card possibly an issue with video out here I think we can bypass it and run off integrated Graphics in the CPU Easy Does It This by the way is a Zotac GTX 1070 and it looks fairly clean considering I believe it was purchase used it's actually in really good shape really like the way this card looks by the way so will this be the answer to our problems I'm kind of hoping not but it would be a sin in my view not to test a graphics card earlier on because it's so easy to isolate and remove just listening to the fan curves here well that uh that answers that still no post so I think I think our GTX 1070 here is still okay that's a good thing I wanted to quickly test the power supply even though I didn't expect this was the problem just based on the symptoms we were seeing and sure enough it passes no issues at all I just powered off because it needs to cool down but uh this is not our problem I think what we're looking at is either a motherboard or CPU issue at this point we've pretty much rolled it down to only the platform we can check ddr4 very quickly I don't suspect that either of those dimms is bad but that could certainly be one of the reasons why the system wouldn't post these are eight gig Micron dims by the way I don't see any physical issues with them they're just cheap they don't have the heat sinks on them like most modules do nowadays but that's okay in a budget build it actually makes sense to go this route now just in case his Intel 7th gen chip doesn't have integrated Graphics which I'm not sure if they even made any back then it didn't unless it was like a very budget oriented chip I've got our trusty XFX card in here and did it just turn off power cycle and I also have a Nona working ddr4 module in here as well we're going to see if this fixes it if it does then we can work back just a tad since we've changed two different things his card variable could be dead and we just have some other issue as well at the same time as this oh my gosh okay it did both I'm really hoping that's one of these dimms I'm hoping it's a cheap ddr4 kit I I think that's our problem okay so what I'm going to do now is work backwards by removing this XFX card again and slotting in the GTX 1070. we'll connect that to power and wow I mean that would be really nice if that was all it was just a bad stick or potentially two bad sticks of dram easy fix so back in you go nice and easy here okay and then we'll just wire up supplemental power and again try once more I think this is gonna work I I think the card is fine it would be a shame if there were two different problems with this but it definitely can happen especially when buying used it sounds like the system's posted because the fan curve is ramped four down very quickly just what it did last time oh I you know what I should should probably connect this and FYI while I'm at this is because we turn the system on without a display cable connected to either the screen card or the motherboard at this point with the system still on if I connect this HDMI cable you'll see that we still won't get a picture out don't freak out here this is normal sometimes it just defaults to integrated Graphics if the discrete card isn't connected out of the gate you can see yeah there's no signal here but I I bet you if we turn the system back off and then power it back on I bet you now it's going to work right away see and so don't be misled by that perfectly normal if a system is not connected to something right away for it to not actually send a signal out where you want it to once you do connect that cable without powering the system back off so power cycle before you run a test like this and there we go we are in the bios so it's one of these for sure I'm going to very quickly figure out which one it is or maybe it's both but either way I'm going to upgrade this person with a full two-stick kit of nicer dram uh just for a sweet little upgrade there and then I'll return whichever one of these dims is actually still working maybe they can repurpose it in a different build by the way the system still posts with our working dim in the second channel so Channel B which is I think on the outside channel is on the inside so this is not a dead memory Channel issue not something CPU or motherboard related again I think it's just one of these speaking of there we go let's figure out which one is actually broken so I want you to watch these lights here where this yellow bar is on this motherboard that will indicate Board of power and I'm going to turn the system on with one of the old dims connected look at that see the flickering it does this several times before the system just full blast the fans and refuses to post and both dims do this and I don't really know why it's it's strange for both to be bad I got the product listing pulled up here and it doesn't look like this is ECC memory it's just a gig density a pop nothing out of the ordinary I don't see a reason why these wouldn't work and we've already tried clearing the CMOS multiple times so we're working with default bios settings and the system still refuses to post with either of these the easy thing to do here is obviously just to replace them they still might work in other rigs but for whatever reason I can't get these to work in this person's rig out of 16 gigs of Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB sound these two modules look super sweet they have RGB functionality of course it'll be a nice little upgrade for this owner and we go one at a time here put a bracket under the card as well to help with sag it was pretty rough before it looks a lot better now not perfect but close right now I am rewiring things just trying to sort out Cable Management a tad I would normally at this point try to power the system before we commit to this but um I'm feeling confident so why not and if I blunder at least it's on camera I know I said I wouldn't be swapping this fan around but I am just because I feel like it's not going to hurt to flip it and have it pull in whatever it can from the front even though the panel's totally choked off I will however leave the top fan set to intake as well it is filtered up there and I think any bit of air getting into the case is going to matter a lot for something that is otherwise regarded as a hot box I quickly tighten the CPU Cooler because boy oh boy and you look at that play like that's that is not good so we gotta torque these screws just a bit more some of them actually are tight but some of them there's no way yeah this one see this one's not even it's not even held in I'm not sure why it was omitted but it's not threading in so that would explain why things are so loose here I'm going to straighten up just a tad back here we do some zip ties and things it's um a bit of a mess as it is and there's not a ton of room behind this tray to actually route cables so I'll give it my best shot there's really not a ton again I could do with this case but uh I mean at least things are somewhat kind of orderly now they do stick out a good waste so we're gonna have to press that right panel on a bit a bit harder than normal but other than that I mean yeah it is what it is not bad and here's what she looks like from the left side looks a lot cleaner now I think the cables have been routed appropriately we've got the graphics card anti-sac bracket in there as well I'll have that link below it's like 10 bucks or something super cheap if you want one and then we fixed the CPU Cooler it was unevenly mounted super loose that's tightened up we've got the new ddr4 in there this thing looks a lot better in my view let's go ahead and power it on I'll need to install Windows I told them I would do that because they never had a chance before and this thing will be a good to go let's turn on power at the rear power up front and hope for the best we don't have one fan spinning oh that would be that would be my fault now it's spinning all right everything looks good we do have that post and if I have the correct USB drive installed we should load straight into bootable media to install Windows 10. there were a few wonky settings in the Bios to workout to even boot into this uh bootable media it was really strange I'd never run into that before but we're going to go ahead and install Windows now and then we will be finished with this PC this here is our SSD you can see it's a one terabyte drive not bad we're gonna go ahead and click next and let it do its thing and here we are Windows is installed and the rig is finally finally ready for some action thank you so much for watching this first episode of our fourth season of fixer felt I can't believe we're on a fourth season already and I know these aren't really coming out every season so to speak I'm just doing 20 per chunk and that allows me a bit of breathing room between so I can set things up again change things if I need to especially on the Forum when viewers submit their rigs I think we've got a really good thing going here I'm excited to eventually at some point down the line spread this out to where we can fix viewers rigs in other places as well we get tons of inquiries from folks who don't live anywhere near Florida and to to those I have to say currently there's nothing we can do I'm sorry we can't even help over the air there's just no time there's there's frankly not you can get a lot of help from our Discord server however and that is totally free of charge to join there's a tech help section and a lot of good folks there who might be able to point you in the right direction if you run into issues like these here with that if you have a broken system and you do live in or around Orlando Florida be sure to submit a form Linked In the video description if you guys enjoyed watching this video give it a thumbs up consider subscribing if you have not already and stay tuned for the next one again I want to thank you so much for watching these videos and allow us to continue doing what we do here my name is Greg thanks for learning with me",

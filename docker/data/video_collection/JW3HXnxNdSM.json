    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? So I am off to San Francisco right now and this is, hmm woops. My original flight was supposed to be at 10:30 and it is now 12:30pm. Last night we were shooting so many cooking videos and I was so exhausted that I woke up this morning, I was like, there's not possible way that I could physically get up, go to the airport, and make this flight on time. So thankfully Southwest is amazing, not sponsored, but you could just change your flight and they don't really give you a penalty. So I changed my flight, went back to bed for two hours, and then cleaned my kitchen which surprisingly, it cleaned up quite nicely. You guys don't even know the mess, like I'm just gonna, just wow, wait for Valentine's Day and St. Patrick's Day cooking videos and you'll see what has happened. There's still some icing on the floor. Well, I guess let's head to the airport now that it's time for my actual flight. (techno music) I made it to the airport and since I got here, I was like god, I need a coffee so bad. So I waited forever because they just made a fresh pot of it. And as I'm walking, I spilled it all over myself. (In Your Arms by Henyao) Let's do a hotel room tour. Here's the shower. It's like a nice little bathroom. Plenty of room. Oh, here's my office. It's a nice view of nothing. Oh, look at that, just making sure my outfit is on fleek. Um, what? It this a-- Are these steps? Oh, this is gonna go down tonight. The luxurious sleeping quarters. Give me something to drink. Oh god, there's nothing to drink. So for some context to see why I'm pretty shocked, there's nothing wrong with this room, it's clean, it's nice, but I think I got tricked because these are the photos that I saw online and this is, this is reality. Expectation. Reality. This is a very unique design, but definitely not what I signed up for. And not even that, I left my camera in the Uber. Obviously I'm vlogging on it right now so I got it back. So thank you very, very kind Uber person for returning my camera to me because if you hadn't, this vlog wouldn't even be happening. Because I wouldn't have a camera and all the footage that I shot this morning wouldn't even be ever seen by you guys. Okay. Going to the bathroom. Bringing up all my stuff. Here we are. Made it. (upbeat music) So some of you guys might be new to my channel, probably don't know that I made some of my first Apple Store videos when I moved to California in a San Francisco Apple Store. And right in front of me is the brand new Apple Store here in SF and it is oh my goodness, it's so beautiful. It has an incredible open front design. Like the entire front of it is glass. It's two stories. This thing looks just, oh my god. Guys, I'm having a moment. Okay I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna switch to vlogging on my phone. So, here goes. (upbeat music) Look at this beautiful glass staircase. My emotions are running very high right now and people are watching me vlog. Obviously because you look silly vlogging no matter how many times, and how many years you've been doing it. Look at this upstairs. Wholly crap. This place is incredible. They have this whole open floor. There are actual real trees here that people can sit and enjoy the outdoors but yet indoors. Look at how beautiful this screen is. And these beautiful-- oh my gosh, you guys, I just want to sit. I'm gonna sit. This is so cool. Okay, let's go see on the other side. This screen is massive. This is something that I need in my house. I basically just want to make this building my house. They got like trees and stuff in here. It's like a nice little outdoor patio. Look at this. I can come out here and I can enjoy the outside. But yet, the outside is inside. So it looks like you can enter this store from either the front or the back and the back is actually the second floor. So right now, we are up here and this whole wall is like covered in green. Oh my god. So far this is probably one of my favorite Apple Stores that I've ever been in to. It's perfect. Let's see if I can find something to buy. Something that I know I definitely need is a new dongle because my sister broke mine. She put it into her computer and then she dropped her computer and then it bent the USB C port. So I don't have the C card reader right now. So that's gonna prove to be a problem. But since I'm vlogging on my iPhone I don't really need one because I can just Air Drop everything to my computer. Look at these. These are very nice. Like a little cord organizer. Oh this is fancy. Okay, well, they don't have any USB C card readers so I guess I'm gonna leave now. But I just wanted to show you guys the store because I've been wanting to visit it for a really, really long time and I've been waiting very, very patiently for it. So, here is it. And it's-- It is stunning. It's really loud, the music is pretty much overpowering probably my own voice. But I stopped at Starbucks to get an espresso because I'm super basic and what else am I going to be doing at you know, six pm, after you go to the Apple Store. I'm so excited though, because The Museum of Modern Art is open until 11 pm, so guess where I'm going? That's right. We're gonna go see some art. Oh no. I'm so sad. I walked all the way down here, I was so excited. I was like, oh great, the museum closes at 11. Well guess what? They're having a private event today so I can't go. So now I guess I'll just find somewhere to eat dinner and play my iPhone game. (instrumental music) So I started playing this game, it's called the Last Day on Earth and I a hundred percent have to blame Nick because he was playing it all through his ES. But, I'm playing that game while I'm eating dinner. And this restaurant is so good. Like, it's been a really long time since I've had a meal that is this incredible. One of the things that I love about San Francisco is the food, in pretty much every restaurant, is incredible. This is so good. I'm having an incredible meal. So good. This game, is so addicting. This is it. It's trouble. It's a lot-- oh no, I died. Oh no. I should loot my body. I just looted my own body. So this is dessert. These are like doughnut bignet's with chocolate and caramel and then they gave me ice cream as just an added bonus. This is a lot of dessert for just myself. Like I'm not even gonna be happy. I can't even look at it. Like my stomach is so full from the amazing dinner. Guys, I just finished eating some of that dessert and then they brought me another tiny mini dessert. This is overwhelming. A mini dessert. Look at the little mini. It's so cute. This is something that I should definitely try to make in a future video. Is mini macaroons. This is cute. I'm back. I'm out of breath because I was like, you know what, I just ate so many desserts and so much delicious food, take the steps Justine, take the steps. And wow, the steps I took. Now, I've gotta go up more steps to get ready for bed. Brush my teeth. So hmm. This hotels is still so interesting to me. I've never stayed in such a random hotel room like this. It feels like it's pretty newly renovated because everything is clean and I feel like maybe they're missing a few things. Maybe I can help them out a little. Let's hide this. Nope.Okay. This is gonna change the whole feel of the room. I'll be the cord manager. Well I have a bunch of meetings tomorrow and then I'm heading back to LA. I'm hoping that, depending on when my flight is and when I get done my meetings, that I will be able to go to the art museum since I didn't get to tonight. I was so excited to go. I've never been. Even though living in San Francisco, I can't believe I've never actually gone. But today was gonna be the day. Maybe today just wasn't my day. Judging by the amount of things that went wrong today, just the things that I've documented on camera for you, it feels like Monday but it's definitely not. It's just one of those days.

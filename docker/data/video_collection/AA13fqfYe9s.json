    "transcript": "- Oh boy, the Oculus Quest two. I've been really excited for this because I don't know if you guys know, but I've been exercising at home with the original Oculus Quest plan, beat saver, fit X, I don't even remember what it's called, the boxing one. Yeah, it's one of my favorite things, pieces of tech to come out in quite some time so I was excited when Oculus said they were making a Quest two and now we have it here. Oh, and thanks to Oculus for sponsoring this video. Now, one of the reasons the original Quest was so cool is because it can be both a standalone VR headset and a PC VR headset. When we did the Linus tech video on this, me and Linus said that it was like, it's kind of like the Nintendo Switch of VR. I think this might even solidify that placement a bit more. So enough preamble, let's open the box. Okay, very exciting and there she is. So they went with a white color scheme this time, which I have to say I appreciate as a minimalist. Check out that video if you don't know what I'm talking about. So yeah, look at that. Oh, very nice. Oh, a little letter. When was the last time you played for real, man? (grunting) What's going on? Ah. (laughing) what's this? A shirt? Play for real. Hey, I'm filming over here, guys. - [Jono] He's playing for real dude. - I will! And what else we got? And a hoodie. Wow, whoa, we got all the swag. A stainless steel bottle, play for real. Okay, to be clear, that was really nice of Oculus to send us that stuff, but this is probably not what you're gonna get when you just buy the regular consumer version of the headset. Just so you know, just so you don't have some false expectations, you know? Okay, that's all that's in the box. I'm ready to play for real. Let's go! Okay, oh boy, that is, I mean, it's a nice looking headset. So the previous quest was black and it also had kinda this matte finish. But this is real nice, I like that they kinda switched it up. Okay, so they got this guide for the IPD adjustment inter pupilary distance which is something, if you've never played VR, that's something you need to adjust to make things the clearest because we all have different spaces between where our eyes sit. On the old Quest, there was like a slider, a physical slider to change that number, and on this one, it looks like you physically move them with your hands. I believe there are three positions, yeah. There's kind of like a far apart, a middle one, and then close together. We also have this glasses spacer which I will need to use because I'm wearing glasses. So I'm just gonna put that on actually right now. Okay, this goes in there. Oh, nice clicks. Great, I'm just gonna put that on. Actually no, I'm not gonna put it on yet, first let's talk about the controllers. Okay, so I think that more or less, these are a very similar design to the first Quest, but it has a bigger ring and I think that the overall controllers are bigger as well. So, oh, the battery door. This is something I believe that they worked on because there were some complaints with the original Quest about the battery door sliding off really easily because it was like a magnetic attachment. But this one, it's definitely more secure. Yeah, it clicks into place not with magnets, with like a little plastic doohickey so that's good. Okay, and finally the last thing is this box which has reference guide for how to get started and stuff. I think I already know how. And we got the USBC power adapter and USBC power cord. Now, I don't believe that this is meant for Oculus Link which probably makes sense 'cause it's only this long. So you won't be able to connect to your PC and have a comfortable VR experience that way. And you might ask, why didn't Oculus include an Oculus link-capable cord in the box that was long enough for you to be able to play PC VR. I mean, you know, they gotta make some compromises some places because remember this is a 299 headset, that's a hundred dollars cheaper than the first Quest for the 64 gig model. So you know, I can understand it. The sweatbands work great to kind of be a cushion between the straps, maybe some lttstore sweatbands just if you're gonna get a Quest two, okay, it can help a lot. The physical design of the headset is very similar; it's got a power button on the right side, USBC and headphone jack on the left side, and four sensors for tracking and the pass through plus feature which lets you see through into the real world. Now this is one of the coolest, I can actually see you right now because of the pass through feature. Look, I'm gonna come right up to Andy and go. (laughs) I love you man. I will say that I was a little disappointed not to see the old strap design return, but this one is very comfortable. The other one kinda has that plastic on the side that turns into. Actually the back is hard plastic on the original Quest as well. So I understand why they did this now because it is a little bit more comfortable having this fabric strap instead of a plastic crown on your head. Guardian feature, so one of the coolest things about the original Quest was the fact that it's built in tracking and the Rift S has built in tracking as well. But the cool thing about the Quest is that you're not tethered to a PC. So you can make your area as large as you want with no consideration for a cord going to anything. I'm gonna make it the entire area, even where you're standing, Andy. The other cool thing is that you can walk around in this space, look at how big my space is. Now, my other initial impression right off the bat is that things do look significantly sharper. So the Quest two has two LCD displays, the resolutions of which are 1832 by 1920, is that right? At launch, the refresh rate is 72 hertz which is the same as the original Quest, but they're gonna send out an update soon that will enable 90 hertz. And so one of the reasons that they were able to up the specs in that way, to support more resolution and refresh rate is because they're using the snapdragon XR2 chip which is made specifically for virtual reality and augmented reality applications. I know you guys want me to try Beat Saber. I can feel you thinking that, but I wanna try Vader Immortal first because it's Star Wars and it's an amazing experience. Okay, yeah, your hands definitely look, like things look sharper. Like, I can see like the leather stitching and stuff on the gloves. Oh, it's a light saber! Oh, there we go. Oh, now I have a light saber and a blaster. (laughing) That is just as amazing as I enjoyed it the first time. I gotta say, one thing I did, they said that the headset is 10% lighter. I'd say that's an accurate claim. As you guys probably gathered, the fact that I just played an original Quest title means that the Quest two is backwards compatible with all Quest content as well as the Oculus PC VR games that you can play through Oculus link. Let's play something else. Beat saber! Oh my gosh, people are gonna get so mad at me, I'm doing so, what?! So Beat Saber's really good for testing the speed of tracking because you know, I can't talk and do this at the same time. Oh my god. (laughing) I failed again. Okay, so the reason (laughing) The reason that I'm failing, I would guess, is not the fault of the Quest; it's definitely mine because I've only played this game like once. Super hot. Oh my God. I killed him. I killed him! Dead, dude. Okay, the other thing is I have this giant space that normally you don't have. Oh, give me this, give me that gun. Bottle to the face and this guy's frickin dead, dude, you're dead. Well, I gotta say as a regular Quest one user, my experience today with the Quest two has been pretty impressive. Now, one thing I haven't really mentioned is that you do have to log in with a Facebook account if you're gonna use the Quest two and I believe by 2023 if you wanna use any Oculus product, you will have to use your Facebook account to log in. And once you do that, it'll be permanently merged. There are other VR options on the market if that's not something that floats your boat. However, this is super compelling. If you've never tried the Quest or PC VR and you've tried like Oculus Go, it's completely different. This is a fully immersive room scale standing VR controller hand presence VR experience. Now, one major thing we did not look at today was Oculus Link: the ability to also function as a PC VR headset. And we are gonna be looking into that more in depth in an LTT video so make sure you're subscribed. Stay tuned for that video and thanks to Oculus for sponsoring that video, this video. I'll see you in the next one. Play for real! (laughing)",

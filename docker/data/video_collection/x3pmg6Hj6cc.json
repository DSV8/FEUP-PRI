    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is. Tim Cook. He might have made a couple mistakes along the way, but this ain't one of them. - Wait, no no no, it the opposite, Matt. - No nope - You're setting me up for the opposite joke - Nope nope - This was his biggest mistake - No, miss snake, his biggest miss snake? - Hello and welcome to This is Austin's got something stupid to talk about today. - What? It is not stupid. Okay, so here's the thing, Matt and I, we were part of an elite club for a whole 373 days. Yes, my friends, we were mini boys. - I don't know if anyone in the history of anything would ever classify me as a mini boy. - Cast your mind back to the wonderful world of 2020 there was World Peace, uh, everything was great. Most importantly, Apple brought out the iPhone 12 Mini. Quite possibly the greatest device, crafted by Timmy Cook's giant hands. The iPhone Mini was, by all accounts, the greatest iPhone of all time. However, while Matt and I spent a glorious year, each using the iPhone 12 Mini as our primary devices. Unfortunately, our time was cut short. There was the iPhone 13 Pro, which was quite a good phone, that we both switched over to. And now of course we're on the iPhone 14, and it's all fine and great. You know what Matt? - Almost exactly a week ago, to this very moment, I went to the Apple store. I bought an iPhone 13 Mini. (man squealing) - I want to expose Austin Evans here okay? Austin posted this on twitter like, \"Oh guys, please try and talk me out of buying this\". Listen here baby birds, he had already bought it at that point. - No, that's actually not true, no no no no no. Here's the thing right, I was thinking about the iPhone for a couple days, so then I was like oh you know what? I kind of want an iPhone, let me tweet it ha ha ha. And I got literal hundreds of people telling me to do it. So about three hours later I went to the Apple Store, and bought a green iPhone 13 Mini. - I will say, It's a really nice color. - It's a good color right? - It's a nice color. - So, there are a few reasons why I have downgraded from an iPhone 14 Pro to the iPhone 13 Mini. Now, just to be clear, I'm also still using Z-Flip, of course! For the last three four years, I've carried both a Z-Flip and an iPhone of some variety. And the happiest I ever was, was with the Z-Flip and the iPhone 12 Mini. And I basically recreated this set up. Now Matt, as a fellow mini connoisseur - I don't know where you're getting this, I've literally never used an iPhone a day in my life. The only mini that I use, I use the palm phone, if I wanna mini phone. I don't know where you, why you try to rope me in, all right? I'm not some i Sheep who's just using whatever, whatever phone twitter tells me to get. - I regret telling Matt what I wanted to talk about today because he was clearly prepared. Okay, but look, with a wide variety of different little baby phones. Let's actually talk about this, because this iPhone 13 Mini specifically is one of the - You're not doing great right now. - Best devices that I've ever tried. This is the very last mini phone that Apple have created. They made the 12 Mini, the 13 Mini, but for the iPhone 14, they replaced the Mini with the iPhone 14 Plus. Which is basically just a big version of the iPhone. It doesn't make sense because you might as well just get the Pro or the Pro Max, cause it's not that much cheaper. And it's just a significantly worse phone. But using the Mini has been like a breath of fresh air. Have you ever gone to your dryer, opened it up, and you got all the dryer sheets in there, and you get that first whiff of that warm dryer air? - Rich boy over here has a dryer. I live in an apartment complex. I have a communal dryer. - Does it smell like butt? - Yeah - Oh okay, I'm sorry, well - Yeah - Imagine if it smelled lovely, and you just go like ahhh. That's what it's like to switch to the iPhone Mini. - Look, I agree with you, that was the best phone experience I've had in a very very long time. And I'm not even going to argue that, about, like oh you downgraded because, let's face it, like, it's not that much different. - My main concerns with the iPhone 12 Mini were with battery life and with camera quality. Those were my main two issues, right? And I will say, while is obviously a little bit different compared to the 14 Pro it was coming from, this is a actually a pretty significant step forward on both sides. - This is where I have to just like hard disagree, because I never once had a problem with battery when I did my 12 Mini. I'm a power user, I was, I play a lot of mobile games. I would end up charging it throughout the day, but I never felt like I had to. It was just integrated in my life style of just like oh I'm driving home, it's char-, plugged in or whatever, I'm at my desk and I just got it on a charger. - For regular day to day use I agree, cause I also like when I'm driving to work I always have my phone plugged in, right. But here's the thing, the iPhone 12 Mini didn't hold up well on like a long travel day and what not. Like you pretty much always had to hit the battery bank, if you were really hitting it hard. With the 13, while it is not as good as something like the iPhone 14 Pro, or whatever other nonsense, it is actually a good step forward. Yes, this is a little bit of a downgrade, but it's small enough downgrade that it doesn't bother me. Same thing with the camera. So the 13 Mini actually has a significantly better camera than the 12 Mini did. Again, maybe not quite as good - Yeah, but when you actually look at the photos though, it's not like if you're pixel peeping sure, but like most people don't. For example, every thumbnail that was on This is, for the year of 2020 was shot on a 12 Mini. I make all of our thumbnails using an iPhone, and it was fine. If they had put a Pro's features in the Mini's form facture, I would have been all over that. I've talked about this in numerous, numerous pretty much every chance we get. I'm at a point where I don't care about specs of a device, I want to know how does it feel in my hand? How does it feel to use? And the Mini was the best feeling, uh, phone I've used in, I mean probably since smartphones started if I'm being real. - Look, I can put it in one hand easily, - And he's got tiny little hands, they're smaller than Phil Spencer's - [Austin] How dare you. For full transparency I am one week into the iPhone 13 mini; however, I have a year of using the iPhone 12 Mini, so I'm very use to this form factor. There's good and bad, do you want to hear the good first or the bad first? - I want to hear, yeah let me hear what's good about this. - Okay, the size is incredible, so I'm a back pocket phone boy, so this goes in my back left pocket. - I would never trust that. I would never trust that. - I sit on this phone, oh dude I've sat on every phone ever. - I don't know if you know this, I'm a pound or two heavier than you, so I wouldn't trust that myself but. - Well for me not problem. I sit on this phone all day long, as I have with pretty much every other phone I've used for many years right. The fact that this phone easily fits in my back pocket, or front pocket whatever. It fits so well I don't have to think about it, is a big deal. If I've got a larger phone in the pocket, I'm always taking it out tossing it on the table. But the Mini I don't have to do that. Another thing that's nice is just how easy it is. It is so convenient to be able to one hand type. It is so convenient to be able to use one thumb, and swipe from the top of the screen. It's the right size of a phone. Honestly, I really really believe that. In fact, so much so that even though the Z-Flip is obviously a smaller device when it's folded. When you unfold this thing it's actually so much bigger, that I immediately go like oh this is my big phone, this is my little phone. - I've been telling you that, for the entire time you haven't shut up about the Z-Flip. All right Z-Flip is double the thickness. - Not true. - When you fold it. Are you kidding me? Double right there, double. - You, you know what they say about thickness? Sometimes thickness this goodness, Matt. - Yeah, me. - The iPhone 13 Mini is the perfect size. Between being able to easily fit in my back pocket. It feels so much better to use a phone, which is actually designed for human hands. Now, yes I get it that it's a smaller screen. And some people are going to be all grumpy because they want their six point nine inch chungas, and they want to be able to watch video in 21 by 9. Blah blah blah If I have to deal with a slightly smaller screen size for video. In exchange for a phone that's actually designed for hands. I am so okay with that compromise. Okay do you want some more reasons why this phone is great? - Yeah, why? - Guess how much this phone cost me? - How much did this cost you? This year old smart phone. - Let me look up the receipt actually. - Oh my god! - I purchased this iPhone 13 Mini, mind you I got a 128 because I don't need a ton of storage, including tax and including my screen protector, it was 702 dollars. - I don't think that's great. - It's not amazing, but it's, dude, for the best version of the iPhone for 600 bucks. It feels snappy and responsive. - Yeah. - Now mind you, I do notice the lack of 120 hertz. This is now the only device in my life that is not running at a least 120 hertz. I will not say it feels slow in anyway, but you do notice, you know, some of the animations aren't quite as smooth. I don't think it's anywhere close to a deal beaker. Especially the smaller screen helps to hid it a little bit. Mind you, again, I do slightly miss some of the stuff on the iPhone 14, specifically with the cameras which I think are a notch above. And obviously it's got the big notch. If you can get around those, I would say relatively minor to moderate sort of downsides, what you get in return for a much cheaper price, but even just ignoring the price. The size is absolutely incredible. - Yeah - And, another part of it is we're 6 months in, roughly, to the iPhone 14 Pro. There's very likely going to be a pretty major upgrade on the iPhone 15. There going to have capacitive buttons, it's probably going to have a periscope camera. Like, It's clear that the iPhone is about to take a pretty big leap at the end of this year. - I'm not excited for that. - No, but here's the thing though, you know that both of us are gonna end up having to get one. - Yeah. - So, we have to talk about it in videos blah blah blah. - Yeah, but that doesn't mean we're excited about it. - No, no, but here's the thing, this is my last opportunity to use an iPhone Mini. Once these new devices come out I'm gonna have to switch over, I'm gonna have to use them. And I'm sure they'll be great, and I'm sure they'll be wonderful. But I look at this, they're not making anymore minis. This is still available brand new. It's not wildly out of date. And I'm going to try experience a blissful six months of using the best iPhone that Apple's ever made. I am telling you right now, Apple made a mistake when they canceled the Mini. They canceled the Mini to bring out the Plus, and the Plus was dumb! - I have a brighter future. - Okay - Okay - I don't think it's the last time were ever seeing the mini. I know that they didn't sell that great. - [Austin] Which is why they canceled it. - [Matt] Correct, but a lot of the trade offs people saw on paper were why they didn't buy it. And again, I say on paper because every person I know who actually held a Mini, who actually used a Mini, said \"I love this thing\" - Yes! - And most people just didn't do that. Most people buy their phones online and they just order them. I think we see, start to see, some of these phones get smaller and smaller and smaller again in the near future. In the past couple years, we've had some pretty big advancements in batteries. - Yeah. - So, batteries can get much longer life while being physically smaller. The components themselves can get smaller, more precise. And we don't have to have the massive trade offs like we did previously. Part of the reason the phone is that size is because when we talk about the 15 it's gonna have a periscoping camera. How do you physically fit something like that - Put on the Pro Max baby. - As soon as we can start getting some of these components little bit smaller, little bit smaller, little bit smaller. I think we have this coming back. - I will say, my gut is that the iPhone Mini is dead and not coming back. The only shot I could see that the Mini form factor could properly come back, is that they maybe reuse this sort of cache for a new iPhone SE. - Yeah. - I would be so happy with that. The problem though, is that the iPhone Mini didn't sell well enough. And I'm sure Apple looked at it and go, \"You know what that's not the move\", but I would like to think that now that they've switched over and they replaced the Mini with the iPhone Plus, which obviously is the complete opposite direction. It's way bigger for the standard iPhone. Maybe they'll rethink it. Maybe they'll realize, like, we don't need 17 versions of the big phone. Maybe we'll at least make one good small option. - I'm curious if you're in the comments, if you bought a Plus let me know because I've literally never seen one in the wild. - Never seen one. Not one, which is a wild thing to say about a new iPhone. - Right. - Another reason why I think the iPhone Mini was a good deal was because it was 100 dollars less than the standard iPhone 13 or 12 or whatever. The iPhone Plus is 100 dollars more than the regular iPhone; which basically means it's almost within sort of spitting distance of the iPhone 14 Pro and go up another hundred dollars to the Pro Max. And those phones are so much better than it makes zero sense, right. So, I think part of the reason the Mini should come back is to have a slightly more budget priced device, but also I think it makes sense because this phone, the size is so good that I have happily traded in a newer, more powerful in every objective way, short of the size of the device. Purely because I love the size of this device so much. And I'm not gonna lie when I bought the phone, I took it home I started transferring stuff over, and there was a moment of hesitation of like, am I completely crazy should I not listen to twitter? And you know what? I have not had the slightest shadow of a doubt that I made the right decision. - Well, again I - Not even one bit. - I'm gonna reiterate what I've been saying forever. These phones are so good that you talking fractions of a second faster in swiping over, like .000001 faster whatever. You don't feel these massive differences. And that's why, like, people need stop looking at specs on a sheet and thinking that is what makes a good phone. Because it's not, it's how does it feel to use. - Take a look at ROG phone; which is a great phone and certainly for a good market. - Awesome specs-wise. - But the thing is those phones are huge and chunky and for me that is an instant deal breaker, that's not something I want to carry with me everyday. I have my lifestyle, my routine, which revolves around a phone that can easily live in my pocket. And the thing is I already love my iPhone 12 Mini, right. So, I really went into this with those fond memories of that device. And while I skipped the 13 Mini when it came out, because I looked at the iPhone 13 Pro at the time, which was the you know iPhone I was using and I was like you know what this thing is so much better, the ultra wise is better, it's got 120 hertz yada yada yada. I think the iPhone 13 Pro is still probably the best, overall phone that Apple ever made. But now that I've come back to the mini and really appreciated what they did. This is a much bigger jump than I think a lot of people gave it credit for back when it came out. Imma send this to you, Jeff, If you're thinking about doing the Mini, if you've even been tempted. Now is the time. These phones are still going to be supported for a long time they've still got terrific specs. But if you want to buy yourself an iPhone Mini, this is your last shot the train is leaving the station. And you can enjoy your correct sized phone for many years in the future. - I don't disagree with you but again, asterisk buy a used one. Don't do what dumb dumb did over here and take a Twitter poll and go and buy a brand new one in the store. - That's fair. - I would try and find a used one of these. - I would do a 13 though. The 13 is a major upgrade over the 12 like it's, like I'm surprised by how much better it is. - Look, again, you're saying major. I think for a lot of people that like, the major upgrade is not going to be noticed by a lot of people. If you're resigned to getting a couple year old smart phone, yes I agree the 13 is better than the 12, yeah. But I feel like you can get way cheaper of a 12 Mini - Here's the problem though with the 12 Mini. The battery life wasn't great when that thing first came out give it two years on the battery, I bet that the iPhone 12 mini, most of these ones that you can buy today are bordering on not okay anymore as far as battery performance. Whereas the 13 already has an extended battery life. - That's fair. - And it's a less old phone so I would say personally, that the 13 is probably worth the upgrade, mind you I'm saying that without knowing the exact price difference. - Yeah. - But, like, this phone is so good I'm so happy with it. - Let me check that with my - It's gonna take you an hour to try and look something up on the palm phone. - 13 Mini renew 470 - I think I'd pay the difference. - I no, no, no, no - I'd pay 150 dollars more. - Let us know in the comments whether you would pay the difference for a 12 or 13 or whether you're going to say shut up and just buy a palm. - A one plus - Like, follow, subscribe, we'll catch you in the next one. - Buy an iPhone Mini! Before it's too late!",

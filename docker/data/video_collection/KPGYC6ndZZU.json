    "description": "The NVIDIA RTX 2060 is here and while it does cost $350, its gaming performance is pretty impressive. Just don't expect this GPU to be affordable.  Spec wise, Nvidia didn't cut all that much when compared to the RTX 2070. The RTX 2060 ends up with the exact same specs as the last generation GTX 1070 generation GTX 1070 but uses a narrower 192 bit memory interface and 6 gigabytes of fast GDDR6 memory and even runs at the exact same speeds.  When compared to gains of the GTX 1060 that it's supposed to replace the RTX 2060 is superior in basically every way. It has 50% more cores and texture units while also offering a ton more memory bandwidth, the 6gb's may be the only limiter in some games but with Turing's updated memory architecture it may not be too much of an issue.  The real question is about the price and honestly guys the entire RTX series is pretty expensive. The RTX 2060 will be compared directly against the GTX 960 and that card launched at $300 for the founders edition and pre overclocked cards but eventually settled to around 250 bucks.

    "transcript": "a new rtx card the 2060 so I'm here in Montreal and right before CES look what shows up rap it's another rtx lunch we're gonna have the all- put a clickbait title this sucks but there's a really that bad you know what Demetri it might be pretty damn good which is it let's find out right after this what would you like so I'm looking for a gaming headset with a bit of everything but not overkill something that folds on your neck sure how about the light frame without excessive clamping force yes yes you have to will ear cushions with proper internal padding excellent I will take the cable and the microphone are removable fine fine this is the one multi-platform compatibility with virtual surround sound dongle avail can I just take one and the sound quality you'll be satisfied with so the new cooler master MH 751 and 75 to are here to make your gaming experience alright good people so let's talk about the specs because Nvidia actually did not cut all that much when compared to the RTX 2070 the RTX 2060 uses the exact same tu 106 core but it cuts out six streaming multi processors to 32-bit memory controllers some Rob's and l2 cache that means the RTX 2060 ends up with the exact same specs as the last generation gtx 1070 but uses a narrower 192 bit memory interface and 6 gigabytes of fast GDDr6 memory and even runs at the exact same two speeds too but when compared to gains the gtx 1060 that it's supposed to replace the RTX 2060 is superior and basically every way it has 50% more cores and texture units while also offering a ton more memory bandwidth that sexy gigabytes may be the only limiter in some games but with Turing's updated memory architecture it may not be too much of an issue and the real question is about the price and honestly guys the entire RTX series is pretty expensive but obviously the RTX 2060 will be compared directly against the gtx 960 so that card launched at $300 for the founders edition and pre overclocked card but eventually settled to around 250 bucks the gtx 1070's these days go for around 350 and the gtx 1070 TI for around 450 but what about the gtx 1080 well good luck finding those at the reasonable prices and so the RTX 2060 is launching at $350 for the founders edition and board partner cards so there is no fe tax and will be high priced for pre overclocked models and so it's basically $100 more than the GTX 1060 is right now and you know that $100 price hike is quite a lot to ask for a 6 Series cards so from a pricing perspective it aligns a bit more which is gtx 1070 and then the gtx 1060 and also remember the RTX 27 t cards start at $4.99 so could this be the RT x card we've all been waiting for let's see unlike other efi cards this one is not overclocked and does not have a premium price it looks amazing it's probably one of the best-looking RTX 2060 cards around it measures only nine and quarter of inch so about 23 centimeters which is pretty compact there is a 6 pin connector on the back location is not too much of a problem for most cases even ITX but be aware that it will add about one inch to the overall length of the card and video says the location of the 6 pin was chosen to be placed in the back so that the top looks much cleaner when installed inside the case and I would agree there's black area next to the power connector looks like it's some sort of accessory but it's actually for support brackets that system integrators sometimes used to secure the GPU in place and like the 2070 it does not support SLI now for this review you wanted to do things differently so you'll still see individual benchmarks later in the video but right now let's look at the overall performance of the RTX 2060 so based on an average of all the benchmarks the RTX 2060 is about the same performance as the gtx 1070 TI and also nearly beating out the vega 56 that means it's also between 40 and 50 percent faster than the gtx 1060 6gb version depending on the game and one interesting thing is that it cost $150 less than the RTX 2070 but is only about 15% slower on average and honestly guys this makes the r-tx 2070 look like a pretty poor value for 1080p and 1440p and speaking of value check the sound guys with the RTX 2060 sitting at $350 it leads everything else based on the amount of money you pay for performance at 1080p and sure if you find that gtx 1070 or 1070 TI on the crazy sale you might be better off with those but the 2060's price to performance ratio is still pretty far ahead the nice thing about the 2060 is that it's performance does not fall apart at high resolutions and it actually pulls a bit further away from all other cards at 1440p and this could make it a really good option for someone who has plans to upgrade their 1080p monitors in the future to 1440p 1440p for life and while the RTX 2060 may be ahead in these charts it is expensive when compared to the GTX 1060 really expensive since paying $100 more is a huge amount in this category and the 350 dollar price point really means it takes over from the gtx 1070 and the older 970 rather than the gtx 1060 and honestly if you already have a gtx 1070 there's absolutely no reason for you to upgrade alright so let's get into the benchmarks as we go through these charts I want to talk a bit about price creep because it's a real problem that's been highlighted here the second someone here is about a sixty series NVIDIA GPU they might right away think it's you know an affordable graphics card that combines performance with great value and yes the 2060 does provide good value for its price in our charts but that does not mean that it is affordable at $350 this is an expensive GPU that will not fit into many people's budgets remember the gtx 960 was launched at $200 the gtx 1060 had the shelfs starting at 250 and now the r-tx 2060 is $100 more putting it into the same you know price territory as the original $380 lunch price of custom GTX 1070's and that really hurts for anyone expecting a cheap RTX 2060 like I said if you're sporting a GTX 1060 or a 960 this really is not the card for since it costs a lot more than what you originally paid the worst part about the situation is that GTX series cards are not only running out of stock but are also starting to get price hikes due to supply versus demand so unless AMD comes up with something really interesting anyone looking to upgrade or build a new gaming system will be forced into this higher price structure there's nothing consumer-friendly about this guys especially when those are RTX features can only be used in a few games luckily given its performance the RTX 2060 does not consume a lot of power like the AMD cards but its overall performance per watt is not much better than that of the GTX 970 and the 1070 TI but it's also pretty quiet I do have to mention that the lack of any RTX games aside from bf5 and some benchmarks you know that's a big problem for Nvidia especially because you know it's been almost four months since the first RTX card was launched and all the other games that were promised with RTX features enabled are taking forever to be delivered to hours as gamers and so if you pick up the RTX 2060 you know it's pretty expensive and without those additional features your money is just going towards a promise and nothing else so there you have it guys the RTX 2060 what do you think about its performance and its overall kind of placement within the market I am hoping for more competition in 2019 to hopefully bring those prices down all right guys I'm Dmitri thanks so much for watching and we'll see you in the next video and this is Mike signing off from Montreal that's been the RTX 2060 video and we will see you yes",

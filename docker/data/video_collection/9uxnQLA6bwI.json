    "transcript": "Sometimes the anticipation of getting a new truck is more fun then the actual getting of the new truck. I've driven the same truck for about 6 or 7 years now. This is a '98 Tacoma. And I've loved it, and it's still running like a champion. It has about 250,000 miles on it. It's been a really good truck. But today it's time to get something new. I'm getting a 2018 Toyota Tacoma, a truck 20 years newer than what this one is. The reason why I've waited so long though to get a new truck is because this truck is still running just fine and does 90% of what a brand new truck would be, so I haven't been able to justify the cost of a new truck yet, because I 100% believe that buying a brand new truck off the lot is a terrible financial decision. I'm going to do it anyway, but I'll explain why. I tried to buy a truck here locally in Utah, but it didn't quite work out with the dealership here...car dealers aren't my favorite. But I did find the exact truck I want in Boulder Colorado. So come check it out with me as we fly over to Colorado and drive the truck back. Let's get started. [Intro] So let me introduce you to what I've been driving for the last 8 years. I've been through a lot with this little guy. I put about 100,000 miles on it. I bought it when it had 160,000 and now it has 250,000. So starting back here, this is where a fence jumped out in the road and hit me. I fixed up most of it. It did kind of damage this part right above the wheel, the fender. I haven't done anything to the suspension of this truck, but it does have a little bit of damage along the back. I did replace this quarter panel from that same fence, and I never did quite get this light fixed all the way. It's kind of got a little gap. It used to be held on with duct tape. Eventually I'll get that bottom section attached. The bumper's also kind of falling apart. The truck's kind of been held together with duct tape mostly. If that duct tape was gone, the bumper would be hanging halfway down. Not the safest thing. Over here on this side, no damage. I do have a truck box full of tools you never know when you might need them. The exhaust was wearing out a little while ago, and so there's a huge hole in the center of the bed. You can see the exhaust there and you can see all the way to the ground. I did replace the exhaust myself and now everything's working fine. I'll give you a little tour of the inside so we can compare it to the 2018 Toyota Tacoma's. Here we have the inside of the door, we have the windows up and down....it's a little bit dirty in here. Door lock, window lock, center consoles. And here inside of the truck we have the almost 250,000 miles on it. The check engine light never does go off. Hopefully the new truck doesn't have that same issue. The deck I did replace myself. I did install a 10 inch subwoofer in the back. Gotta have your tunes going. So yeah, basically pretty low key. There's not a whole lot of technology going on in a truck back from 1998. It is a manual transmission. It's a 5 speed. It does have the four-wheel drive in it as well. This is the off-road package, which is exactly what I'm looking for in the new truck as well. And one change I am excited about is the new truck is a 4 door, where this is just a 2 door, and it just has that, you know, half a person spot in the back. You can see the subwoofer here that I've wired up kind of fun. So the anticipation has been there for about 2 years now. I told myself when I hit a 100,000 subscribers two years ago that I would buy myself a truck as like a reward, but I could never justify it because this thing is just working so well all of the time. Toyota has never died. I was actually looking into some statistics of how much it costs to keep trucks going and keep vehicles going, and Toyota was like number 30 on the list. I'll put the list right here so you can see it. BMW is like number one with the highest repair costs, and Toyota was the lowest. So that's one of the reasons why I can justify buying a new one. As well as, I looked into buying a used one and the prices even 3 or 4 years old were almost the same as a brand new one because they hold their value so well. I bought this truck 7 years ago for about 7,000 dollars, and even now if I was to turn around and sell it on the classifieds, I could get about four or five out of it even with all the miles that it has. Toyota's last forever, they hold their value forever. It's a good deal. Needless to say I am very happy with this Tacoma. I've had no problems with it for the entire time I've owned it. I've only had to replace the starter motor...except for these last couple months. At 250,000 miles, things are starting to disintegrate on a regular basis. I did have to replace the clutch a little bit ago, which was about $1,000 and took a couple days out of my time. And that's another reason why I need a new truck is because as soon as it stops becoming a tool and more of a hindrance and eats into my productivity, then something else needs to happen. Now, buying a brand new, $37,000 truck is a bit on the extreme end of solving that problem, but I'll explain the justification to you as we grab the new truck. Let's go to the airport. [Music] So the plan has landed. We've gotten all the way over to Boulder Colorado and I see the truck. It's right here brand-new 2018 Toyota Tacoma, 4-door. This is the cement color. This is awesome! It's got the sunroof up top. It's got the short bed in the back. I'll run you through the whole thing in just a minute, but this thing is awesome. It's got the tow package. It's got rear lockers, four-wheel drive...this thing is sick! And the best part is that this truck does not have the massive rust hole in the bed of the truck like my previous truck does, so that's a step in the right direction. So after years of waiting, the truck is finally here. I'm going to go grab the keys from inside, it's already paid for and everything. Just need to take off and give you guys a tour of the inside in just a second. So normally, when you buy a brand-new truck and you're the first person to drive it off a lot, you instantly lose thousands of dollars as you pull out of the lot like I just did. But that's not the case with me. I bought this truck and I'm going to use it as a tool, you know, it's a business expense. Plus what I'm going to do to this truck is going to increase the value of it over what I just lost by pulling out of the parking lot. So yeah, now that the truck is off the lot and mine, I'm going to walk you through some of the features. So we started off with 10 miles on the odometer, now we're at like 78 or something like that. I think we're in the middle of Colorado somewhere. Colorado's much flatter than I anticipated. But I'm going to walk you through some of the features of the truck and why I chose it as my daily driver. So first of all I chose the cement color because it's unique to the Tacoma, and it is also unique to the 2018's. Now you can get the off-road, it's not limited to just the TRD package. And so here we have the front grille, we have the headlights, this is like the projection bulbs and stuff like that. It's a 4-door so I can fit 5 people in it. Then here we have the interior. I did choose the black leather. Leather was not my first choice, but it is part of a tech package or something, and I did want the sunroof in it so that was fine. I think the tech package was mandatory with the leather, so I'll survive. Here we have the rear outlets for the back of the truck. There's an outlet in the bed of the truck, which I thought was pretty cool. It has a clutch start cancel which helps you when you're off-roading and stuff, or trying to get up a hill. So inside the truck we have the dash, we have the leather steering wheel. We have the center console here. And the parts that I think are pretty cool is that there's a wireless charger down here at the bottom. So I can take my Galaxy S8 which has the wireless charging enabled, same as the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10, and I can set it down on this pad down here at the bottom, and then it'll automatically start charging. That light turns on here and I can turn on and off the wireless charging. It has a bunch of safety features, like this is a blind spot manager. So if I press that, if someone comes up in my blind spot, in that mirror there's a light on the side and the light will blink letting me know that someone's in my blind spot. So one safety feature there. And that is one difference between this truck and my old truck. So this one has side airbags. And you can't really put a price on safety, like where I was talking about earlier that my old truck does 90% of what a new truck can do, the old truck does not have the side airbags and as many safety features as this truck has. So this truck has one of those radar management systems. When you're driving on the freeway it'll track the car in front of you and if the car in front of you stops, the truck will stop automatically. It also has the lane divergence systems where if you start to drift over one of the lines on the side of the road, like if you're drowsy or something like that, it'll start beeping at you and wake you up and make sure that you know that you're drifting off the road. My old truck definitely doesn't have those features, and if the features save your life, there's no way you can put a monetary value on that. So, kind of cool that this truck has it. We also have the heated seats for the driver and the passenger, kind of fun, and the climate control on both sides. So this truck is also a manual Tacoma, meaning that I shift all the gears myself as I'm driving. The representative that I talked to said that only 5% of trucks that are sols are sold with manual transmissions. But I like having that kind of control when I drive and go off-roading. And now let's check out the back seats. Kind of the same thing here. There's a ton of storage behind these things, so I can lift those up and stick like tools and stuff. Remember with my old truck I had the truck box in the back, and that's not the case with this one. Since the bed is shorter, I'm going to leave the truck box out and just use the space underneath the seats to store stuff. Also, the whole thing lays down flat, I can pull the headrest out and then stuff that stuff, and tools, and boards, and construction equipment down inside of here with more storage space behind the seats. Coming back to the bed of the truck. Drop this down, and this has a power outlet. You can plug in power tools, you can plug in lights if you're working like a construction project out in the middle of nowhere. Having a power outlet is handy, especially in a truck because a truck is built to be useful. And then, you know, you have more storage compartments for, you know, tow straps and jumper cables and things like that as well. I mentioned before that it has lockers on the rear tires. I am going to add a lift kit to this truck, which are all kind of things that I had on my old truck. Also right here there is a headphone jack and a USB port so you can plug in, you know, the auxiliary cables and stuff. Definitely useful to the phones that have extra features. So I'm going to go drive the 450 miles back to Salt Lake Utah where I'm from. Was it worth the wait? Time will tell. I don't have the buyer's remorse yet. I'm pretty excited to have this new truck. It's a huge step above the 20 year old truck that I've been driving around for the last 7 years. A lot of people buy cars for better gas mileage and stuff, but for me, my personality and what I do, I need something with a lot of features, and having a truck will all of those bells and whistles helps me accomplish the things that I want to in my daily life. And Tacoma, after looking at a bunch of other brands, is what I want to use. I was talking with a friend one time about the usefulness of trucks in general, and he said that a truck can win a race against any vehicle as long as the truck can pick the route or the payload. We can put my truck up against a Tesla if the payload's a piano, or I can pick the route, because there's no way a Tesla can follow me up a mountain. I'll be doing a couple more videos on this truck on my channel, just showing the lift and showing the light bar installation. If you have any questions, obviously leave them down in the comments. Let me know what you think of my truck, and let me know what your dream car is down in the comments. Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you around.",

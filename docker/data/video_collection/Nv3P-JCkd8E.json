    "transcript": "- [Presenter] Quick, what are the three things you wish your iPhone 7 had more of? If you said battery life, storage space, and headphone jacks, good news. Not only are you great at rhetorical questions but they're might just be an accessory out there that solves your problems. I'm Michael Fisher and this is a quick hands on with the Folio from iXTRA. (digital music) iXTRA calls this the perfect iPhone case and while that's an overstatement it does come close just in terms of features. Some qualifiers, the version I'm using is the Folio case for the iPhone 6S. The case for the 7 is due in March so keep that in mind. The company tells me it hasn't yet decided where it's putting the headphone port but it'll be 3-1/2 millimeters just like you're used to so you can leave the dongle at home. On the other hand that thing will never become a reality if these folks don't hit their Kickstarter goal so keep that in mind too. The hardware is pretty basic. The faux fancy look has never been my favorite but at least the imitation leather is understated in black and the rubber is rigid enough that I'm not worried about the iPhone getting hurt while it's inside this thing. When it's installed your phone draws power from either a 1,700 or 2,000 milliampere battery within the case until it's topped up. Unlike similar charging cases there's no switch or button to toggle charging. It does it automatically or you can control it manually through the app. Now, firing up an app to toggle charging on and off isn't my idea of a good time. But here's the thing. You need the app anyway to access the other halo feature of the Folio, the additional storage. Either 64 or 128 gigs of solid state memory is built right into the body and the included file manager lets you organize it into folders and move media files around at your discretion. The real space suckers of course are photos and video. You can dump those directly into the case storage and even set up automatic syncing. Though, as you can see there's plenty of fine print there. No official word on the read and write speed of the storage, which will vary depending on what quality level you choose for your backups. This is not at all a final version of the app so I can't weigh in on that as yet. As a bonus, if you're storing sensitive material you can hide the files behind a passcode or touch ID. If I have a major complaint about the Folio case, it's the lack of lights and not just because I like a lot of blinkies on my technology but because there's no way to tell the charge level of the case unless you go into the app. If your phone is off you're outta luck and if you're charging the case separately the only way to tell it's working is by feeling it to see if it's warm, lame. But then maybe you're willing to take that hit in exchange for a big price cut versus the competition. SanDisk ofers a case with integrated storage but it ranges from 70 to $130 and the battery is sold separately. Mophie has a case that pulls the same double duty of power and storage and its battery is quite a bit larger but it's almost 200 bucks. By contrast, iXTRA is gunning for the wallet-conscious crowd here. The Folio starts at $80 and maxes out at 190 and for 190 you get two of 'em. Now those are Kickstarter prices and they come with the usual Kickstarter risks but for those who've buttered up against the confines of the iPhone in one way or another they may well be risks worth taking.

    "transcript": "It's called the \"Loud Basstard\"? Loud Basstard... Not 100% percent sure. It's a hand made bamboo sound amplifier. Now this falls in to the category of phone amplifiers that don't need to be plugged in to the wall instead they're using strictly acoustic amplification. I have thought these things are pretty cool for a while. Not sure how much it's going to amplify sound but i'm looking for somewhere to just quickly drop my phone in move it around desk to desk. Maybe even just amplify the speakerphone on a phone call for example. So this one does that and I think it looks pretty good. It's made out of bamboo. You know I like bamboo so there's a picture of the side doc and play. That is a pretty straightforward package. Whoo pretty sleek. This is a giant package of silica gel for Jack there you go buddy. It comes in a couple of different colors this is kind of the classic bamboo look. It also comes in some darker finishes it will not that is.. *smells the Basstard* that is very nice. I mean it looks like it's carved out of a chunk of stock of bamboo. Maybe it is? On the side here engraved \"loudbasstard\", \"basetard\". Now because the slot here is so big it doesn't really matter what your device is. I mean for example here's an S7 with a battery case on it. And that goes in there. Here's a regular iPhone 6s. I'm not really sure if you want to kind of have it that way, that way or slid down. There's all kinds of like professional versions of this as well as like this DIY versions. You'll even see some people turning beer cups into acoustic amplifiers. Or some people just under bedside table have like a glass that they dropped their phone in and then that helps amplify it as well. Essentially you're looking at it an acoustic amplification technique. This stuff is super old fashioned and been around for awhile. But anyhow this is just on an iPhone.. iPhone 6s as you know speakers on the bottom. That's your volume you're working with so not very much. Now let's see what happens when we drop it in here. *music playing* So it gives it a little bit.. A little bit more low-end again let's do a comparison here without and then with. So it not only kind of amplifies it a bit but it also gives it up a bit of a thicker tone as well. For the sake of it I'll do it on the S7 here as well. Now into the device here. Now I would say it worked even better on this one. It's not going to replace like a bluetooth speaker for example. But it's kind of like a nice little, I don't know design piece? Aesthetically it might be pleasing to you. It's really easy to move it around. And it's kind of just a place to stick your phone anyways. I could see people just having it in your kitchen and just kind of dropping your phone in there and boom it's a little bit louder. It's not going to take you your music to stadium level. But it is certainly going to do the job of slightly amplifying what you're getting out of your smartphone speaker without the need to plug anything in. And with that I don't know kinda aesthetically pleasing look to it. They're not too pricey. Check them out.",

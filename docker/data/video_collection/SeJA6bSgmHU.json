    "transcript": "- Can we confirm; this is an actual real item that Apple approved. Jony Ive said, \"Yes, ship it.\" (short beep) - Hello and welcome to This Is. Austin, go ahead and tell us what we're gonna be doing today. - The most overpriced Apple products of all time, starting with insane refurbished units, such as the $43,000 Mac Pro or the $6,000 iMac. Can you justify these at all? - I don't know if we're gonna be able to justify anything on this list. - This is insane though. - This- - $43,000 for a used Mac Pro? Buy a M1 Ultra Mac Mini or, whatever Mac, Mac sells to you. - Okay, yeah, but does the, the Mac Mini Ultra have 28 cores of Intel Xeon Ws? (Austin blows raspberry) - As if that's better? (laughs) - No, like- - Obviously when the Mac Pro first came out you could configure it to insane levels of- I wanna say like 50 grand or whatever. - Yeah. - I assume that this is one of those $50,000 models that got returned or whatever. This Mac Pro cost probably $50,000 when it was new and a five- or $6,000 discount's pretty good. But when you consider that there's a Mac studio you could buy that would probably outperform this thing and would cost maybe six, seven grand? - Six, seven grand, and it like, is this big. - Yeah, no one is ever gonna spend $43,000 on this Mac Pro. - I could just say this on any of the Intel stuff. No- you shouldn't buy... - No - any Intel apple product period. - Unless it is incredibly cheap. If you're getting a three- or four-year-old system for like 400 bucks, sure. - Sure. - But six or $43,000. Hell no. - Hell no. (thunder rumbling) This is one- - Can, can you say it? Can you say it? Pronounce it. - [Matt] Her-mez? - No! We're not continuing until you say it correctly. - Her-mezz. - No! - Herms. - [Matt] Equestrian inspired design. So they- (Austin laughs) - What?! - So they looked at a horse and like, \"man we need to, (Austin and Quin laughing) we need, we need to skin that thing.\" - Keep in mind that while you can buy this watch and band together you're mostly buying the band because while you can get it with like the watch face, it is par for the course for Herms, - [Matt] Yeah. - and these high-end fancy fashion brands- - You know, it's fashion. It it's like, how much did I pay for this band? - Is it calfskin leather? - Do you even- - Is it equestrian inspired? - My point is- - Did it come from the Herm-ees store? - Do you think that this is the first-party Apple watch band? - That looks fine. - Exactly. This was $4. I guarantee you can go find this, this thing, that's not gonna be handcrafted calfskin leather. It won't be in-queskwi- equestrian-inspired. But maybe be like, I don't know, dog park inspired, but it'll be 12 bucks, and you shouldn't, shouldn't buy this one unless you're stupid rich. - Do you wanna know how much it costs? This is $1,499. - Oh, that's a lot. Okay. Like more That's actually more than I thought. - Okay, we were way off. We were way off. Moving on. - [Austin] The Mac Pro (RED) 2013 model. - [Matt] I forgot about this! - It was definitely one of those like charity pieces. It was auctioned for, I assume is a, an egregious amount of money. But normally this system was a few thousand dollars based on how you spec it out. You get like a 12 core CPU, couple of d700 GPUs, one terabyte SSD, 64 gigs of RAM, which is a lot in 2013. - Do you know what actually made this special? It came with every album, including live and deep cuts, - Don't you do it. - Of U2. - Hello, hello! (beep) - You have to guess how much was this? - $12,000. - I'm gonna say that the (RED) one was $250,000. - So this was sold at a charity auction for $977,000. - I remember this because they made one of one of 'em and it was cool- - I saw this. I wanted it so bad. - You could have bought a Wu-Tang album for this. - Or you could have bought a limited edition - Oh good lord. - 2019 Ford focus ST. (car engine passing) (honk) - Do you know that you actually could buy these Mac pros? Not the (RED) one, obviously, but the regular trash can Mac Pros, are only like four or 500 bucks. You could actually buy one of these and paint it red, and you could live out your $900,000 fantasy. - Yeah, but then I'm stuck with a Mac Pro from 2013. - They're still good. - Nah, I'm movin' on. The Apple QuickTake released in 1994. I actually know this one quite well, because it was manufactured with Kodak. This was one of the first consumer-available digital cameras. - Digital cameras. - It was still stupidly expensive. - Well, and also, it was only VGA quality. 640 by 480. But this had in-unit digital processing match. - Yeah. - Your fancy Cannon camera with Kodak film doesn't do in-digital built processing. - Because it's analog. Was this like 900 bucks? - [Quin] This was 999. - 999, yeah. - It was $1000. - Like I'll say, like it was, - Which is $16,000 in 2022 money. - This was in the nineties. Apple's like, man, we got all this money. People have all this money. Now we can take pictures. - Yeah. I'll tell you what, that was not what Apple was dealing with. They were almost out of business throughout the nineties, 'cause they made the rebranded Kodaks instead of actually good products from Jony Ive and Steve jobs. But moving on, we have the Double Telepresence Robot. - [Matt] Okay. Fun story here, okay. - (impersonating robot) Boo bop, boo boo boo bop. - So this, this self-driving magical robot was only 30 SPS. So sorry, gamers. (robot sounds continue) We were once at a- Hold on guys! (robot sounds continue) (beep) - These things are dumb and while yes they basically just used iPads in like Segways- - Yeah. I think these were like 2,500 bucks a piece. - [Quin] These are $2499.95. - That was actually really impressive Matt. - If you watched our Costco video, you know, I did pretty bad because I'd never been to a Costco, but Matt knows about things when he know- when he goes to do things. So we have the WILL. - [Austin] Is this- - [Matt] Leather goods. - Is this sold from Apple? - This hand burnished and vegetable tanned leather. What is vegetable tanning? - I think actually, that is a way to tan leather. I do know that. - Oh. I thought it was just carrots sitting out in the sun. (Quin laughing) It's a cognac brown. Unique hand burnished leathers to tell the intriguing tales of wear and use. - Does this mean that- - That's a weird way to say it is not durable at all. It connects you with the rich history of Americana, like being rich. (Austin laughs) Despite that big honking metal clasp in the front, it doesn't even lock. - How much do you think Apple charged- Tim Cook himself personally charged- for this leather briefcase to connect you with the rich history of Americana? - $1800. - No! - 1800 bucks. - $400. - No. No. - [Quin] This was 699.95. - I'm a lot closer. I know my leather goods. - So- You're right. You're right. I was factoring in a lock. So... - We have the iDiamond iPod Shuffle. You are not telling me this is an actual Apple product. They did not sell this. Can we confirm this is an actual real item that Apple approved. Jony Ive said, yes, ship it. This is an iPod Shuffle. The cheap $50 iPod that your stinky cousin always wore. 430 diamonds, as well as another 118 on the headphones. Please gimme some context here. Why was this approved by Apple? How much it sells- Give me something. - [Quin] So this was sold in 2007 at a charity auction for 40,000, similar to the (RED) Mac Pro. - Wait hang on. You said $40,000? - [Quin] Yeah. - It's actually cheaper than I- - How much of these diamonds? Yeah, that's actually like not a good price at all, 'cause it's dumb. - Moving on. The Apple Lisa. (laughter) - This shit was expensive, man. - This is one of the first machines with a GUI, which is a Graphical uni- - User Interface. - Graph, graph, Graphical- - U2 interface. - Come on, more U2! - Yeah. - This was a commercial failure with only 10,000 units sold in the matter of two years. This had a whopping two megabytes of RAM, that's at least 40 Chrome tabs. It had a five megahertz CPU and a five megabyte hard drive. Let me tell you that drive was very hard. (laughter) This thing weighed a whopping 48 pounds. - Okay. So there's like a deeper- actually kinda sad story about the Lisa. So when this was being developed it was being developed alongside the Macintosh. - [Matt] Yes. - And they were almost kinda like competing products but the Lisa was a big failure and of course the Macintosh was iconic, was absolutely revolutionary, and propelled Apple for quite a few years. I don't know how much it was off the top of my head, but I know it was incredibly expensive when it first came out. - This was like 10K or something. Wasn't it? When it came out? - [Quin] Yeah. In 1983, this is the top of the line version, It was 9,995. - Three points to Matt for gettin' the price right. - How much is that in 2022 dollars? - [Quin] Yeah, in 2022 money that's $29,735. - That's as much as a Mac Pro! - Which is still cheaper than the refurbished Mac Pro! (Austin laughing) - It was a bargain! The iPod Sock. Because the \"iPod Condom\" wasn't a good name. - [Matt] It came in a six pack. - This was a thing. This was absolutely a thing. I remember I never had one but I know some people did have socks for their iPods. I don't- - Which is what to keep it from getting scratched. - Exactly. Because these things, if you looked at it the wrong way it would be scuffed up on the very very shiny stainless steel on the back. - Yeah, probably what $50 for the six pack. - I'm gonna say it was 30 bucks. - [Quin] It was 29.95 when it came out. But if you wanna buy it now it's $50 on eBay. - Careful about buying a sock on eBay. - Do you have a story about socks on eBay? - I can't tell this story on- what? - What if we sensor it? Can you tell me the story if we sensor it? - Yeah. All right. So- (long beep) (playful music) making- (long beep and playful music continue) and like, it was just kind of like out this, like. - Oh! Okay, okay, okay! Moving on, moving on the next item. - And yeah. - The next item, which is... - I told you, I can't say it on YouTube! - From NewPotato Technologies, the Classic Match Foosball Table. - [Austin] What a stupid idea! - Look. No, no, no. - Who thought this was a good idea? - Because in the early days of iPod it was a lawless lawless land. - There was a lot of game systems. - Everyone was making every type of accessory for the iPad. Every alarm clock was a doc. - Yeah. - And companies were making millions if not trillions of dollars on all of these accessories - Like I get that there was an era where iPhones and iPads were the next big thing. And it seemed like what everyone was going to go for. But this was a dumb idea. - The latency on this had to be terrible. - Even if it wasn't, this is not foosball. This is not, that's not foosball. - We- I mean like I'm gonna say that this was $140. - Nah, it was like 80 bucks I think. - [Quin] This was $99 in the Apple store. But if you wanted the app, that was an extra 15. - What?! It didn't come with the app?! Who buys that without the app. It's- - Well, if you wanted to- if you wanted to use this control to play Temple Run. - The Smart Ball. The 94Fifty Smart Ball was water resistant. A world class basketball. - Wait, wait, wait. (electronic buzzing) Before we get too far. - Yeah. - I can't help but notice you put water resistant in quotes. - Oh no, wait. It was water resistant, Matt, just like you're water resistant. - What?! - A regular basketball is already water resistant. This isn't a feature. - [Austin] Users participate in specific drills. The results to which they can upload on Twitter with #topthat. - Yo, top that! (man screaming and cheering crowd offscreen) To detect whether you've made a shot or not. You can also get a Smart Net. - A scoreboard exists. - Yeah. But what am I Amish? When I play basketball, I wanna be living in the year 3005. Wind Surfing board. No. No. No! - This was an actual thing that Apple sold? - Look, I know that Tesla made the Surfboard. That was more like a promotional whatever. But the iWind Surfer. - No, it was not called the iWind surfer. This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life. I think we are done. This is the end of This Is. - We found, we found the dumbest thing that apple has ever sold. - There's no reason to subscribe. We, we did it. Congratulations team, we've successfully completed the goal of This Is, which is to find the dumbest thing ever. This, this is it. (silly cheer) - It was released in 1985. The Apple board wanted- the Apple board, like the board of directors. - Yeah. Not the Apple windsurfing board. - Not the Apple surfboard. - Yeah. - But the Apple board of directors wanted to diversify. But this caused Steve Jobs to quit in protest. - This was the thing to push Steve Jobs over the edge. He quit Apple and did not come back for over a decade. - He was right. - This is insane. - Why did they make the iWindsurfer? - Can I ask you a question, Matt? If this was on eBay today, you've gotta imagine this would be the most collectible of collectible items ever. - If this was on eBay, Quin would've bought this, years ago. - I will say, while this is a dumb idea at the time, with the knowledge and the context of what Apple became later, this is the (cartoon face says OOH) coolest thing I've ever seen in my life. - Yeah. - I think it cost- - I think - $3,000. - 3000? I'm gonna say 5,000. I have no idea. I have no reference on what this costs to begin with. So- - [Quin] Yeah, so in 1985, this costs $1,500 which today is just over $4,000. - Talk about a collector's item. It is retro and cool, but also what? Did it come with a life vest? That's what I wanna know. I think people need to subscribe for the next era of This Is. Now that we've uncovered the literal dumbest product in the history of the universe. We're about to go into our next arc. And friends, - You're not gonna want to miss it. - Our next arc is gonna be all downhill from here. - No, no, no, no. - We've found it. - No, no. - We've found it. - We're gonna find our edgy arc. We're gonna- - Edgy arc? - This is the edgy arc of This Is: subscribe! So you don't miss it. - We're cool and edgy. - Like the cool kids. Subscribe, like, follow, friend me on MySpace. - Yeah. - Peace out fellow kids. - Word. (soft jazz outro music)",

    "transcript": "- Guys that is so awesome. Oh man, I love this thing. Guys, I am so excited because what I have in front of me is what I hope to be the future of all smartphones going forward. In front of me is the Xperia Pro-I. And for those of you who have been paying attention Lan listed as short circuit on the Xperia 1 Mark III about three or four months ago. And that phone is really similar to this one with one key distinction, the pro I name. And why is it called the pro I? Well the I stands for imaging, which is why I'm here about to unbox this because this phone is Sony's first phone and one of the first phones in the world, with a one-inch sensor. Yes. This phone behind this camera bump, is a one inch sensor. I, I can't even describe to you when I first read the article rumoring this phone, saying that they had put a one-inch sensor and from the RX100 Mark VII no less, the same sensor in the RX100 Mark VII, is in this phone. In a phone! So you might be asking, what is the one-inch sensor? Brandon I have no idea what you're talking about. Why does this matter? Well, if you've ever watched a camera video, but even if you haven't, you'll probably understand that a larger sensor in a camera is generally better, better low light, better dynamic range. There's lots of reasons that in terms of performance, that it is better. So the fact that they took a one-inch sensor, which is much larger than the typical smartphone sensor and put it into a phone that is also like, as thin as a flagship smartphone would be. Guys this is a really big deal because nothing like this has really exist. Even the iPhone doesn't have a one inch sensor. Okay but before I get ahead of myself, let's look at the phone physically on the front, we've got a 6.5 inch old LED display. Love to see that. On the right we've got a volume rocker power button, which doubles as the fingerprint sensor and two shortcut buttons, one for the videography pro app, which has this fancy animation when it launches. And then the camera, if you look really closely, the Shutter button on the camera is actually knurled kind of like a Shutter button on other cameras just to give you that like tactile. Okay this is my Shutter button for my camera feel, also it makes it easy to know that that's the shortcut button that you're going to press for your camera. So you just have to hold it. Camera opens really quickly, and you're ready to go. On the left of the phone, we've got a tool-less SIM and micro SD card slot. So you can run a micro SD expansion or dual SIM. Love to see that. And then there's a little islet for a like wrist strap if you want to have that extra like security, just kind of like a pocket camera would be honestly. And the device itself feels very, very nice. Almost forgot on the top. We have a headphone jack love to see that because it is now becoming a feature. And then on the back of course, we got our three cameras, the 50 millimeter (telephoto), which on our pre-production sample is unfortunately disabled, but that's okay. We've got two other cameras to try the 24 mil with a one-inch sensor and then a 16 millimeter wide. So that's three cameras on a phone that has a one-inch sensor. And it's still again the size, the camera bumps not even that bad, like it's really not that, I have an iPhone here. And I'd say, let me take this case off. I'd say the bump on the iPhone might even be slightly more. And then I also actually have a Pixel Six Pro here, the bump on the Pixel Six Pro. The bump on the Pixel Six Pro is a quite a bit more significant, a couple more things about the camera on this phone is the aperture is actually mechanical. So you can go from F two to F four, there's a little like thin aperture blade thing in this camera. And it can actually change from one to the other, which is again in this form factor really cool because that gives you more control over your depth of field, which is typically something you can't really do on a smartphone or I'll say do it kind of with, you know, computational photography. So Sony has made a couple of apps on here specifically for video and photo because this thing can also do 4k One 20 FPS, just like something bigger like the a, oh wait, this can't even do 4k One 20 FPS. One of their new apps is the videography pro, which is supposed to be, cause they also released the cinema pro on the other Xperia's that they've launched. But apparently they tried to simplify the process and make it a little bit easier to use for different users. And so let's take a look at the video pro app, but first we got to thank our sponsor Altium. Thanks to Altium for sponsoring today's video. Altium designer enables engineers to connect with every facet of the electronics design process. It's intuitive you can interact in a 3D environment and it features interactive routing. They've even got Altium 365, which allows multiple people to work on the same project at once. Get a free trial of Altium designer viewer for a limited time at the link below. When the device temperature becomes high, the following icon will be displayed. Do not hold the device directly in your hand while this icon is displayed, doing so may result in burns. Oh, I mean again, I guess that's understandable. It's a one inch sensor on a very thin phone cooling will probably be an issue, it's not active cooling as far as I know. So yeah, this thing's going to get hot and that's that. We'll see how this goes. Let's see, we've got manual focus and auto focus. Whoa, So manual, Whoa. That's so cool. And then if you want to do wide, can you change the lens in this mode? Oh my, they might be locked on the 24. Oh, you can do tele or you can like zoom in kind of like on a broadcast camera. It's got like that power zoom. Well no, I think this is digital zoom from Luxembourg. And then if you do auto off, you can just change your Shutter speed. Like a normal camera, Andy. Look at this. And it's, it's a pretty easy simple view. You've got a giant record button here and then you just go, let me see if this videography pro button works. Oh that's so that still brings us to the mode. So you have to hit the record button on the display okay. They probably intend you to use their grip because Sony actually is going to sell a vlogging kit to go along with this phone. And it actually comes with a front facing monitor that you can connect to the, to the phone and a microphone on the top. And then it uses their Bluetooth tripod handle thing that I've shown in the past. And honestly, the vlogging kit. Here's some images of it. Like it looks pretty cool. Jono just asked me how much this phone costs, because I've been nerding out about how awesome it is and all these features. Unfortunately it is not cheap. This phone goes for 1799USD. Guys think of the technology though. $1799, yes incredibly expensive. But you get so much for that. You get a camera that is also a phone, but more camera than a phone to be honest. So in cinema pro I have ah, so I have frame rate here. 24 FPS or One 20 audio functions not available. That's fine. Okay. We're going to have to properly try that One 20 in a minute here. You've also got different looks. We've got Venice Color Science, Bright or Pink, Warm, Strong. Whoa, These are drastic. They're also flat though. Oh, so you can use both lenses in the cinema pro app nice. Okay. Probably want to stick to the 2,400 white balance. You can set auto or custom and then if you hit for cord, it just goes in on your screen and then you can change your focus from here. Oh, you can like rock focus mid shot. That's so cool. And then, oh, you can set. You can reset your A and B and then you can do Andy, this thing can do a one button focus poll for you. I'm pretty impressed with this app. It is very, very intuitive to use, especially if you've ever used a camera before, like any of Sony's cameras. Okay, but before we start doing test clips, I want to try one more thing. I want to try their photography. Full disclosure, I've actually been using this phone for about two days and I've tried the photography app a decent amount. And it is again pretty good, on the right of the display. You've got all these controls that you'd want on a camera. This is like the, the quick settings in a Sony camera, but on the right of your display. And then you have a couple of different modes you've got basic, which is just what changes that. But if you, as soon as you go to auto gives you that like more camera alpha series view. And then of course you've got program Shutter speed priority, manual and then memory recall. So once I go to manual I've got my Shutter speed here. My aperture is right here, two to four. See that, that's mechanical. So if you guys look really closely at this lens, you can see the mechanical Shutter or the mechanical aperture in action. There's F two, here's four, there's F two, here's a four. F two, F four. Guys that is so awesome. You can actually see it working. That is, oh man, I love this thing, but let's actually do some test shots. Let me grab a couple of things and we can try. I have a tiny scene here of these three Funko pops talking about how they're going to kill Lucky the dragon. Oh man, that actually again, I have to look at this on a computer, but from the Ola display on this phone this it looks really good. Even just this focus feature, the fact that I can rack to Lucky and then rack to these guys as if I was using a real camera. Oh man, That is awesome. And yes, of course there are phones that give you manual focus adjustments and you can do them on all the smartphones, but on this phone it feels so natural as if it was like a real camera. And then you can look at the depth of field from here just to my background. Lucky's not even that far away. He's just on that part of the table, but he's very naturally and nicely out of focus in this clip. So that's the videography pro recording clip. I want to try this on the cinema pro. Footage off of the cinema pro app is supposed to be processed in post color-wise, but just for comparison, I'm going to record a clip on this as well. You can see it's a much flatter profile. I just love how easy this is to rack focus. And it's so natural looking at least on the phone. I have to look at on another computer, but there's Andy back to our huddle. And then to Lucky, this is so easy. Okay. Here's just a quick and dirty test of the One 20 FPS. I keep getting thrown off with the Xperia, because the the Shutter button is a physical button, not just like a tap on the screen. Andy just asked if I could have pressing and get focused and yeah sure you bet I can, obviously I'm not going to be able to tell from the phone displays alone, but first impressions on the phone display the Xperia looks pretty good, but then so does the iPhone and so does the Pixel, I'm gonna let you guys be the judge. Here's the three photos. Let me know what you think in the comments down below, but I'm not sure yet which one I think is the best. Just taking a quick look at the photos that we did of Lucky. The iPhone you can see did a pretty good job in terms of like detail and the lens doesn't look like it has a lot of fringing, on the edges of Lucky here. And then on the Pixel, we actually see a, quite a bit more fringing on the top of his head. It's present on the Xperia a little bit, but really not that bad. Funny aside, I actually got so excited about this phone, I forgot to look at what was in the rest of the box. So I'm going to reopen the box. We've got a Sony 30 watt charger and a Sony type C cable. So I didn't miss much, honestly unfortunately, that is all the time we really have for this phone. If you want a deeper video, maybe comparing these three phones and a couple other's cameras, let me know in the comments down below, because I mean like, there's things we didn't even get to. We didn't even get to the fact that you can use this phone as a monitor. If you have something like an A74 or a Zed VE 10, which is super cool because it's like a 6.5 inch Olin monitor. And the last thing you guys might be asking is who is this phone for? Because it's $1799. Well, it's for the type of person who already has a Sony camera and wants a phone that is almost as good or maybe better in certain scenarios as there are X series, portable, compact travel camera. And instead of having like that separate travel camera, you can just have your phone and your professional camera with you at all times, instead of carrying two cameras for two different purposes. I got to say, I want one of these because it is super, super cool. Anyways thanks guys for watching. And please subscribe to short circuit.",

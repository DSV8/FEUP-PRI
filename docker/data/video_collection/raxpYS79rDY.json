    "transcript": "this gaming laptop has a mobile RTX 3050 in it which is like a slightly cut down version of nvidia's Little Boba RTX graphics card that they stuffed in a laptop and considering that we had a look at how the desktop RTX 3050 handles Ray tracing I thought it would be fun to see how the mobile RTX 3050 handles getting its teeth kicked in by Ray tracing foreign if you compare the specs of a desktop RTX 3050 to its mobile Brethren the difference is not insignificant I'm no expert but those numbers are definitely smaller the mobile version even has fewer tensor cores and Ray tracing cores which is nvidia's dedicated Ray tracing hardware and that's not to mention the thermal limitations of stuffing a graphics card into what's basically a keyboard with a screen glued to it now the reason that I draw this comparison is to show that the mobile RTX 3050 is the least powerful RTX graphics card by some margin and to complicate things further there are several different Power draw versions of the mobile RTX 3050 but luckily the Asus strix laptop that we're going to use for today's video has the most powerful 80 watt version and that paired with the ryzen 5 5600h and 16 gigs of RAM and dual Channel means at least we're giving the mobile RTX 3050 a fighting chance and with that little bit of context let's throw the baby mobile 3050 into the ray traced alley knife battle RTX demo is a great first game for videos like this because there's such a clear difference when you turn Ray tracing on here with none of our Rays being traced you can see that it just looks like Quake 2 a 20 odd year old game running at 700 frames per second and then when we go into settings and we change the renderer to RTX and that's made a massive difference you can see that the lighting is all super realistic now and there's like lights reflecting off of things but at the same time we have also lost more than 600 frames per second but who needs frame rate when you've got Reflections this sexy but really every time I run this I'm so impressed with how much of a difference a very realistic lighting can make to an old game like this and I'm still disappointed that we don't see more old games remade with this technology because it just breathed so much life back into them you know like if they made a ray traced version of Morrowind or something like that that would be really cool but anyway moving on and this also just really illustrates how much of a performance hit Ray tracing can have on his system now with modern games the difference is much less pronounced so having said that let's see how the little mobile 3050 deals with Battlefield 5. now with Battlefield 5 at 1080p High settings it's running pretty well looks nice it feels nice and stable the little mobile RTX 3050 is also running its heart hat you can see core frequency wise it occasionally jumps to just about 90 oh yeah we've got 1900 megahertz there so let's turn on txr and see what happens well I'll be damned it's actually running at above 60 frames per second ish with dxr on high with all of the other settings on high as well they've clearly done some optimization to the ray tracing performance of Battlefield 5 since it's been out um because we're not getting that much of a performance hit anymore it it's down or can't visually tell the difference between an on and off but the performance hit isn't quite that bad although it does very much depend on the scene like when there's a bunch of fire and smoke and stuff it does dip into the mid 30s which is not ideal for Online PVP but still it's it's kind of running it which is impressive now here we're running control at 1080p High settings and I actually already had to turn anti-aliasing off because that just straight headbutted laptop's performance in the face even before we turned Ray tracing on but anyway like this it's running fine you know it's a visual Safari game you don't need super high frame rates but let's see what happens when we start tracing them Rays so I'm just gonna say hi all of it there we go it's it's definitely running slower but I'm surprised at how small of a performance impact there actually was but I don't know does it look any better you know you like run in here with the marble floors and the lighting and you're like wow there's Reflections and stuff it looks really good but if you go into the settings and you turn Ray tracing off the reflections are still there now they're definitely not quite as convincing as the reflections were with Ray tracing on but they still look pretty good you know like they're they're decent Reflections but anyway that's not the point of this video let's try another game Minecraft is another one of those games where visually Ray tracing makes a very big difference here with an off the frame rates pegged at 120 FPS it would be much higher with the frame rate uncapped but this is bedrock Minecraft and I'm a boomer so I couldn't figure out how to uncap the frame rate but anyway let's turn Ray tracing off and see what it does so you just do that 12 render chunks it's actually giving us a warning here Wow we lost a lot of frame rate it's all input laggy and molassity now this is not a very usable Minecraft gaming experience but it does look all shiny so that's very nice I will play around with dlss a bit later my favorite RTX feature but first let's just try a couple more games now fortnite at 1080p with competitive settings which is everything low except draw distance is epic it's running very well although it is a bit more stuttery than I remember it being with DirectX 11. let me know in the comment section down below if it's like a known problem the dx12 adds stutters to fortnite but with that let's turn on Ray tracing whoa we've taken quite the hit dropping from 200 down to 60 frames per second but it's still running well like this little mobile RTX 3050 has been handling Ray tracing quite well let's play around with the settings a bit the first thing I think we should do is just crank all of the ray tracing which seems like a bit of a stupid thing to do considering that we have everything else on low oof that's made a huge difference this is about a tenth the performance we had before after spending a while playing around with fortnite settings it became clear that ambient occlusion and Reflections had by far the biggest performance penalty of all of the RT settings so Reflections not even once clearly is the moral of the story here it's finally time for everybody's favorite PC ball torture cyberpunk 2077 this is running a 1080p medium settings medium preset it's actually not running quite as well as I was expecting it to run in all honesty even without Ray tracing on but again it's usable let's start off with things on medium setting Ray tracing seven frames per second no never mind it's jumped up to 10 now so that is a lot better let's try and get it to handle Ray tracing medium Ray tracing which is the lowest Ray tracing setting for some reason so in terms of the most basic Ray tracing setting possible for cyberpunk um it's still not usable but we've almost hit that cinematic frame rate of 24 frames per second psycho straight up psycho is it just gonna explode when we go out of the pause menu oh yes there we go this is this is Peak gaming although it has jumped up to seven frames per second not sure if this looks like seven frames per second to me but according to MSI afterburner we are getting seven frames per second which in all fairness is actually not as horrific as I was expecting it to run and then as I was about to turn on dlss I got distracted although actually no first let's try Fidelity FX which is like amd's free dlss let's start off with balanced and see how it Compares it's giving us almost 30 frames per second it is quite blurry though you can really tell that it's on like it's it's got a serious Vaseline effect especially like in the distance anything that isn't right here gets very very blurry it looks like we're several glasses prescriptions behind I then switched over to dlss balance that was surprised by the difference we are also getting about 30 frames per second although it looks a little better I got about the same performance with Fidelity FX 1.0 balanced and dlss balanced but in person dlss had a reasonable lead in terms of image quality although apparently Fidelity FX 2.0 is a big upgrade over 1.0 but at the end of the day as is always the conclusion with these candid raytrace videos dlss is the most exciting part of the RTX technology Suite with both cyberpunk and fortnite even with extremely demanding Ray tracing settings dlss could make the game playable and especially with fortnite it looked really good you could barely tell it was on although it's not always Flawless with Metro Exodus enhanced Edition dlss added this weird smearing artifact and with that my main takeaway from this video was I need to play around with Fidelity effects more let me know if you want to see some igpu Fidelity FX gaming action and with that thank you for watching until the next video bye foreign",

    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   Had the chance to be first to check out the new Samsung Gear S3. The Gear S3 will come in two variants - the Frontier and the Classic. The S3 is now larger making it a better fit for my wrist. The styling on the Frontier is more rugged featuring a rubberized strap where the Classic is more refined with leather strap.  *Sponsored by Samsung  From the manufacturer -  The Gear S3 has the aesthetics of a truly premium watch with advanced features built right into the watch design. That's why it's so easy and effortless to use the Gear S3. It's also built for you to go days without needing your phone or to recharge. You get to feel free with the Gear S3.  The Gear S3 looks and feels like a real watch, but does more than a regular watch and without requiring any extra effort on your part. The features that already exist on a watch, the bezel, the crown and the crystal, can be turned, pressed or tapped for convenience, fun and pure freedom from your phone.  Transform the appearance of your Gear S3 just by changing the watch face. With 15 preloaded designs and more available at the Gear App Store, it's really a matter of choice. Each one comes with a corresponding Always on Display version so you get a seamless look through and through. For something more personal, design your own watch face and Always on Display and make it truly yours.  Watches serve a functional purpose, but they're also valuable accessories. Meet the occasion by dressing up, dressing down or going all out with a watch band of your choice. And since the Gear S3 is compatible with standard 22 mm bands, lack of choice is not an option.

    "transcript": "What's up guys! Lew here, back with another video! And today, it's an exclusive one. We are taking a first look at the new Gear S3. It now comes in two different models. We have got the classic right over here, as well as the frontier. The classic, it's a little more elegant, and you got the leather strap. The frontier that one, that's the one that speaks to me personally. It's a little bit more rugged, like I am. You guys know that. This one looks at home on there. It's not too dainty. Also wanted to mention about the straps. There are different sizes And they are interchangeable. I've got the large installed on both. You can get a small and medium as well so, regardless of your wrist size you should be covered. You can see here there's a number of watch faces to choose from And some of them can even be stylized. You can go with an orange maybe a red. Now. Navigation! The fact that you can navigate the watch using the bezel. The reason I think that's important is because On a watch you are dealing with a smaller touch screen right Smaller than your phone. But you don't wanna go to your phone to do all your various functions either. Cuz that kinda defeats the purpose of the watch. You use the bezel and as you'll see its a very fluid kind of interface. The first thing here is the notifications, communication. What if you get a message? It's gonna ping you And you can go in there and actually interact with it right here. So there we go we got a message from Jack here. I can open it up, he says \"what's up.\" Then I can respond to him right on the watch. If you click on the Emoji icon up here. Of course you got all the classics in here. Happy, sad, mad. One of my favorites, you know, the flame. Jack really likes to receive pictures of himself. So... We're gonna send this back to him. BOOM! Right in the thread My very own portrait of Jack. But what about phone calls? Oh, here we go You can hear its a phone call from Jack And you can actually spin the wheel here and answer the call that way. Lew : Hello [Female Voice] : Hello? Lew : Jack is... is that you? [Female Voice] : Who's Jack? Just like comic books You can answer your phone on your watch. Now an improvement on these two guys From the S2 is, battery life We're looking at three to four days of battery life on a single charge Now that's important When it does come to charging these up you are gonna use this little tiny dock over here, I'll show it to you. Now this has a magnetic back to it so you just kinda drop the watch on. Finds the right spot. So once you have the little dock plugged in. You get the LED illuminated and you also get A kinda cool green bar which identifies just how much of a charge you actually have. It acts as a cool little bedside clock. There's also a find my phone feature so if your phone is like jammed down behind the couch cushion or something like that Click that button It'll buzz, you can track it down. A big concern for people is what What's it going to do from a health perspective, from a fitness perspective? So this one has a number of different features built in through 'S Health' You can see here, you can check how many calories burned, the number of steps you've taken And one of the more interesting features to me is an active heart rate monitor You see the heart pumping there. It's trying to get an accurate reading. 75 BPM. I'm within average right now. This becomes more interesting when you're actually doing a workout. Feel like a doctor on here. Built in dedicated GPS. It has the ability to track your exact location. And then send your whereabouts to selected individuals. Both the Frontier and the Classic, feature 'IP 68' certification If you haven't heard of that before, that means there's going to be water resistance as well as dust resistance. But it's one thing to say it... And another thing to show it. So... We're going to do the dunk test. Aaaaaaaand, action. That's the shot right there. So there you have it. Gear S3, the Frontier as well as the Classic. Completely different look from last year. It's a lot more inline with my style. Especially with the Frontier version over here. Just. It looks like it belongs there.",

    "transcript": "oh hello good people the one keyboard brand I'm super excited about is ducky I just received the mecha mini I'm gonna shut up now so we both can enjoy the unboxing experience if you guys have not tried the ducky keyboard yet highly recommended beautiful quality mecha mini is no exception just listen to the sound of the feet nice so the mecha mini is based on the one 2 mini keyboard the exact same layout the exact same concept behind it but with a few key differences let's check it out after this want to step up your air flow game look no further than the master fan SF 120 M from Coolermaster featuring a damping frame designed to ensure stability a connected fan Lane design for optimal cooling performance and an anti vibration motor that ensures better acoustics it's very simple to install and it comes with three fan speed controls check it out down below alright so why don't we start off with the price difference which isn't that significant $120 versus $100 and that is actually quite impressive considering the new cast aluminum frame on the Mecha Mini it's really heavy good luck trying to bend it and the frame is now low-profile with this floating style key cap design and a spaced out perimeter around the keys that gets illuminated beautifully I honestly did not mind the flex on the one too many it's plastic but now I understand why he made the Mecha mini it's a strong tie that's pulling you in and letting you experience one premium product the finger marks are not an issue on top and a little bit more visible at the bottom but who looks there anyway and we no longer have the dual step angle adjustment now only a single step foot with that wonderful sound I really cannot wait for the one 2 SF the 65% Mecha version because I need those arrow keys but this is the first Mecha keyboard and their Mecha collection and knowing ducky you know they're just politely teasing so as with the one 2 many we get a key cap cooler a rubber type C cable an extra space bar and I got special treatment with this unique trick-or-treat space bar that I will keep forever a set of colored key caps that are in this gorgeous deep blue instead of the borderline pink that we saw with a black one to many the key caps are double shot DVT with wonderful smooth texture a great solid structure with minimal shine through inconsistencies only visible at the @ sign the dollar sign but whatever the white floor and the Nita key caps helps with the light spill I love the bright yet elegant appeal and I think the font might have something to do with that as this is one of the best-looking fonts my only gripe is the default white color that has a pinkish hue for example when I activate caps lock and I have the same issue on the other ducky keyboards not exactly sure why but one unique aspect about the extra key caps on this model is that there now shine through and see-through unlike the fully solid ones on previous models the keyboard is still driverless by the way you can change individual colors with Z X and C plus many effects are built-in for experimentation you can save profiles and layers of macros all through a few button combos there's even Mouse navigation and dip switches at the bottom to change out a few functionalities of the keyboard in terms of the layout and what it can do it's exactly the same thing as the one to many and the sound profile is slightly different between the Mecha and standard plastic body and I got MX brown switches on both keyboards because I love the soft tactile points from ducky so here's how they sound both extremely satisfying might I add the mecca mini in my eyes is an exciting step forward towards delivering in premium product and even though it is a 20% increase versus the standard one-to-many with a plastic frame I feel like it's still pretty reasonable considering how much gaming keyboards cost these days unfortunately the 60% layout is definitely not my thing I'm a 65% minimum and tkl preferred but if you want a compact strong and powerful keyboard then make a mini satisfice thanks much for watching check out this other relevant content over here I'm a Dimitri I'll talk to you guys in next video",

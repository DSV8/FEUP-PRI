    "transcript": "- Yo guys, Jonathan here and this is your exclusive first look at the OnePlus 6T camera. Now I can't show you guys the OnePlus 6T yet, or go over the specs because that would completely ruin their keynote, but I'm excited to share some of the world's first photos taken on the OnePlus 6T, with a twist. So, what's going down today is not only camera samples taken off the OnePlus 6T but a blind comparison test against the iPhone 10S Max, Google Pixel 3, and Galaxy Note9. So these shots are straight out of the camera, untouched, and first up we got little Homer there, kinda chillin' with an indoor shot. It's fairly dim in the room and really the only source of light is coming through that window. (hip-hop music) This next shot is lookin' straight down with the window light coming towards the top and the only thing I'll say is the actual table itself is more of a mass off white so keep that in mind and look out for the detail. (hip-hop music) This shot here is the last of the indoor pictures and again, I will say the overall room was pretty dim with the biggest source of light coming straight outta that window. (hip-hop music) Movin' on to this outdoor shot, this was right before sunset so this was a good chance to check out the HDR, dynamic range, and I'm curious to know what you guys like best and also what you think is which so far. (hip hop music) Next scenario we got the Brandon Havard building shot which is also a good test of HDR and sharpness and it's pretty interesting that really only one really stood out. (hip hop music) Next scenario would not be a camera test or a comparison with how that flower shot. This one kind of surprised me, they all performed very, very similar. (hip hop music) Next scenario, shout out to the magnificent Ken Bolido for helping out with this portrait shot. I think it's safe to say that Ken looks good but I'm curious to know which you guys think looks the best. (hip hop music) Next scenario we got more Ken goodness with a front facing selfie. This is not portrait mode just the standard front facing camera with us in the frame. (hip hop music) Next scenario is going to get interesting because we are moving on to front facing portrait selfies and I'm willing to bet that a lot of you out there are going to assume you know which camera's which, but I think once I reveal the results tomorrow you might be surprised. (hip hop music) Next scenario, I kind of feel like I suck at landscape shots, but here's my attempt. Again this is a good test of HDR so look at the colors, the overall image, and definitely also the sharpness. (hip hop music) Next scenario we got one more front facing portrait selfie. In this case, from the first I showed you, we are not battling the sun so it's a little bit different of a lighting situation. Again like most of these, all of them perform pretty similar, but I was pretty surprised with the results. (hip hop music) Now this shot in particular was pretty challenging. It was after sunset so it was getting pretty dark and really I was pretty impressed with all these, but I'm willing to bet that at this point no one really knows which camera is which. (hip hop music) Next scenario we got Pumpkin Kisses and Harvest Wishes. Say that 10 times fast. This is with out a doubt a night time shot so we are looking for low light performance and also the sharpness in the text. (hip hop music) This shot here for me is pretty fun. There's a lot of symmetry and here again, this is after dark so it's definitely nighttime so pay attention to: one, the sky, and also the detail in the shadows. (hip hop music) Next scenario we got some full blown, nighttime, low light tests. It's nearing Halloween so pumpkins are only fitting. With this shot we have a couple of extremes, those bright, punchy, vivid lights, and those darker shadows. (hip hop music) Hey there Mr. Pumpkin-Spider Dude? This shot here was super fun. It's really vibrant and I think all four cameras did a pretty solid job. (hip hop music) Next scenario we got something straight out of Stranger Things. Personally I love all of the purple and bright colors here and I'm curious by now, do you have an idea or do you think you have an idea which camera is which. (hip hop music) Next scenario closing things out with a nighttime portrait selfie. I kind of have a favorite or at least a top two. Let me know what you guys think with a comment down below of what you think looks best. So those are the photos but now, how can you vote? So actually over on my Twitter @tldtoday that's where I'll place the photos in an A, B, C, D comparison. There will then be a thread with a poll where you can then pick your favorite, we'll tally up the results, and then sometime tomorrow after the keynote I'll be revealing the results and which camera took each photo. Also one more reason to follow me is I'm teaming up with D-Ren to give away five brand new OnePlus 6T's wrapped in this beautiful Dbrand skin or your choice of color. So make sure you're following both of us and again if you guys haven't subscribed yet make sure you do so and hit that bell because tomorrow, when the results are revealed, it's going to be fun. Thank you guys very much for watching. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later.",

    "transcript": "I havent said thank you for helping me hit 1 million subscribers on YouTube. This channel would not be possible without you guys coming back and watching my videos. I really appreciate it. I have a lot more videos planned for the future, including this one, which is a beautiful castle that I shot in Germany. Its the third video in my drone history series. So Ill explain what youre seeing in just a second. I hope you enjoy it! [Majestic music playing] Nestled into one of the quiet hillsides in Bavaria, Germany is the Neuschwanstein Castle. This famous palace is the inspiration for the Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland. Construction was initiated in 1869 by the reclusive King Ludwig the Second of Bavaria. It became his lifes work, partially so he could get away from his royal duties. Even though he was king, Ludwig was not a fan of large public functions or formal social events. He paid for the castle mostly out of his own personal fortune and lots and lots of borrowing. Ludwig the Second never married and rumor has it, he actually preferred courting males, which is a minor issue if you plan on having heirs at some point. Ill have to explain how that works in a future video, but since he never married and had no kids, there was no one left to inherit the castle or the massive debt he accumulated during the construction. Its ironic that it was supposed to be a place of peace and quiet for the king, but because of his large financial deficit, the castle was opened to paying visitors less than 6 weeks after he died. The Neuschwanstein Castle currently hosts about 1.3 million visitors annually. Luckily, due to its secluded location in Germany, the palace survived both World War I and World War II without destruction. All of this footage was shot with my DJI Mavic. If you enjoyed this drone history video, you should check out my Hawaiian Stairway to Heaven, or Hitlers Antiaircraft Tower video. And tell me in the comments where the next place is that you want to see reviewed from the sky. Thanks for watching. Ill see you around.",

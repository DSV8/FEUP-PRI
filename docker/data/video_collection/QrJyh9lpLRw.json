    "transcript": "I don't know. I kind of enjoy being doubted. It's... you do? I mean. How do you still enjoy it? Why do you enjoy it? I don't know. If too many people kind of get or think that what you're doing is obviously going to happen, then I don't know, I just think, it gets a little comfortable. So you feed off the hate a little bit? It's not... hate is different from doubt. Right. Haters. Well, I actually think one of the difficult things about running one of these companies or just being like a public person on the internet now is separating out people who are constructive about trying to build something versus people who are just haters. I mean, there's a lot of people who are not trying to help anything. And you probably have more haters than just about anyone in time. I mean, I think. Yeah. Once you reach a certain scale, I think you get saturated.",

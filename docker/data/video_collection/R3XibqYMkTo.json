    "transcript": "- Oh, my goodness, I am so excited, you guys. Today we are gonna be unboxing something very, very exciting right here. Here it is. Check it out, check it out, check it out. This is the LG OLED EVO G3 TV. And as you can see here, I have a very empty wall and a very empty TV stand which is gonna be perfect to put this on. A huge thank you to LG for partnering with me on this video. So let's get this all unboxed and set up. Oh, I think that's our controller. Thank you. Instructions, some batteries and a cable. It looks like we're just gonna lift this up. (mellow music) So we have the TV stand here, and this is actually sold separately, so if you do want to mount this, it does come with this wall mount here. If you do want to mount this TV with this one wall design, it can get so incredibly close to the wall that it just looks so seamless and beautiful. But I like putting my TVs on stands. Look at that. Beautiful. The installation of the stand actually looks super easy. We basically just have to clip it in and add a few screws and we're good to go. Oh, that is so satisfying. (plastic crinkling) (Justine chuckling) Wow, this looks really good. So there's a few reasons why I was so excited to check out this EVO G3. Now the panel is a 3840 by 2164K Ultra HD self-lit OLED that supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 allowing for brightness of over 2100 nits, 10-bit color depth, and a hundred percent color volume for amazing details and color. The EVO G3 is powered by LGs Alpha 9 AI processor which powers the native 120 hertz refresh rate. And the AI tech that automatically adjusts the brightness levels, picture and sound volume depending upon what you're watching. This processor also powers the brightness booster max feature which produces a 70% brighter image compared to non OLED EVO models for high contrast picture quality, even in really well-lit rooms like this. Oh, my goodness, this is so wild seeing this on such a huge display. I mean, I was editing this on my computer, so actually seeing this in person, it feels like I'm actually back in the Maldives. Oh, I miss it. Oh, my gosh. Like even the viewing angles, it feels like I'm flying above the ocean right now. Whoa, okay! Whoa! Let's see what it sounds like. (upbeat music) Oh, yeah. It sounds good too. Something else that was super impressive is the sound quality. I love the automatic volume adjustment, because a lot of times I'm watching a lot of these shows and sometimes the voices are super low, and then you have these high action scenes, and it's really cool because it makes all of those quiet parts so much easier to hear and the loud parts not as loud. Now with the OLED EVO G3, you're also getting the latest version of ThinQ AI and the newly added webOS 23 for browsing content, quick cards for organizing apps, a magic remote for easy navigation, along with a five year panel warranty. Now, I don't know if you guys are like me, but I really don't watch a lot of traditional cable television, like live TV. I do have it just because it kind of came with my internet package, and like when my family comes to visit they sometimes like to watch the local news. So we keep it just for the sake of keeping the peace. But I don't really watch it that often. So I'm downloading a bunch of the apps, and I really love this webOS 23 interface because it gives you access to all of these great apps and you don't actually need to have a traditional TV service. So I'm hyped about that. This is fast. Whoa, this is really speedy. I'm so used to my old TV, which it felt a little laggy every time I would scroll. This is so fast. In addition to Dolby Vision and HDR10 support, the LG OLED EVO G3 also has FILMMAKER MODE and dynamic tone mapping pro. This really lets you see the content the way that the creator intended and you can get incredible contrast in every scenario. Now, as you know, I am very obsessed with playing video games. So for me, personally, I need a TV that is going to be topnotch for gaming. And the LG OLED EVO G3 is actually optimized as a gaming TV. It has a less than 0.1 millisecond response time, which is so crazy fast. Plus, it supports Nvidia G-Sync and Free-Sync premium for smooth, hair-free gameplay to minimize any distractions while I'm in the zone. So when I click into the settings this will automatically take you into game mode when you switch to the console. So you can see, we have our frames per second, we have a black stabilizer, you can turn on and off low latency, and I like this as well, it has a dark room mode so you can choose various levels on or off. You also could have a multi-view, which I think is pretty awesome. So if you want to play games and watch TV or YouTube at the same time, or even watch a live stream, this mode is pretty awesome because you can basically be playing video games and watching content on the other side. There's also different modes too so you can change this to be a different type of multi-view. Instead of side-by-side, you can also do the picture-in-picture. So depending upon what type of view you want, you have that flexibility. So when you go into the game optimizer, this gives you some more settings to further optimize your gameplay depending upon what game you're playing and the room settings that you have. So it's really exciting that you can go through and customize all of these. This lets you further improve your gameplay depending upon what game you're playing. It's pretty cool that you're able to do this, especially if you're the type of person that plays a lot of different genres of video games. This will let you fine tune to whatever game you happen to be playing at that time. I also just cannot get over how bright and colorful this TV is, and with the enhanced contrast, even darker games come through very clearly. Overall, I'm super stoked on the LG OLED EVO G3. I'm gonna put a link in the description where you can find more info and you can also search \"LG OLED\" to learn more about its journey during the past 10 years as 2023 marks the 10th consecutive year of LG and OLED TV making.

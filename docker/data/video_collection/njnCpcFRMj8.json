    "transcript": "- I've been off on vacation for a week and man, do I ever wish I had me one of these. These are the JBuds Frames. And Luke and I have talked about this on \"The WAN Show\" before, that there is literally no human way to wear sunglasses without looking like a douchebag, but what we've never talked about before is whether there's anything you can do to your sunglasses to make you look like more of a douchebag. And now we've finally got the answer. The answer is yes. These are the Jbuds Frames. They're wireless audio for when you're on the go. And basically it's, as far as I can tell, a Bluetooth speaker/headset accessory that clips onto your sunglasses. So instead of spending a bunch of money on sunglasses that might be, you know, kinda mediocre sunglasses with kinda mediocre speakers, now you can have really good or even really crappy sunglasses with presumably mediocre speakers. In terms of accessories, they come with a charging kit... Oh, okay, yeah. Neat. So this is a... How does this go on? Oh, it's magnetic. Don't try and put that on the wrong way. It's gonna be like, \"No, please don't put me on that way! Ah! I'll run away! I wanna get away from you! Ah! No! No, I'ma dodge you!\" You know what? I gotta say, thanks, JLab, because this is a nice, cushiony sunglass case with whatever this little rubber accessory thing is in it. Oh! Whoo-hoo! Look at that! It's like a party and all the rubbers are invited. That's what these are for. There we go. Why didn't they just come pre-installed? I don't know. Okay. Well, that's on there. Oh, yeah. That's on there real good. Look at this. That's quality speakers. Won't even break off. Oi! Outta 10, how cool am I right now? - [Andy] He looks like a Justin Bieber. - I said outta 10. Wait a minute. Justin Bieber. Well, okay. Are you a Belieber or not? - [Andy] I don't know. You tell me. It looks pretty good. - Yeah? Is it too bulky? From the front it's bulky. - Yeah. - In terms of the weight, I've actually gotta give them credit. It doesn't feel that different from just having sunglasses on. I mean, in fairness, I have a fairly grand nose, you know? So there's a lot of foundation for the glasses to rest on there. But yeah, it's not bad. Actually not bad at all. All right, let's go ahead and fire these puppies up. Presumably you just hold the button and they go into pairing mode. \"Ready to pair.\" Hey, I can hear it! Big thanks to Grammarly for sponsoring today's video. Grammarly is a digital writing assistant that helps you with your grammar and can offer spelling suggestions as well.

So go to grammarly.com/shortcircuit to sign up for a free account and get 20% off Grammarly Premium today. Seriously, guys, some of the cover letters and resumes that we get... Use Grammarly. No, I mean they don't use it. But they should. Now, so far I've only heard anything out of the left one. And if the little voice talking to me about the battery being full is anything to go by, this are going to sound like absolute ass garbage. You know what? Let's listen to some \"My Little Pony\" music. Okay, they're working in stereo now, so that's good. Wow. Oh boy. So this is a song about Cheerilee, the schoolteacher. I'm at the, \"Hey, you're approaching hearing damage,\" levels of volume thing right now and I can barely hear it in a quiet studio with everyone, \"Quiet on set!\" kinda thing. (cheery music) Hold on a second here, ladies and gentlemen. \"Respectful sound. The open speaker design features powerful 16mm drivers that produce sound perfect for just you. The unique design targets your ears without annoying those around you while being aware of your surroundings.\" Okay, so the idea is you can hear what's going on around you, but we got a bit of a problem with that theory. Problem number one: the speakers point down. They're ported down the bottom. Like, down. Also, it appears, based on the picture, that the speakers are meant to be mounted... Oh, no, no, no, no! They're meant to be mounted farther back. Okay, so maybe that's part of our problem here. So let's move these back. Okay, I'll give 'em another shot. I'll give 'em another shot. Let's see if this new fitment paradigm enhances the experience. This definitely looks stupider, doesn't it? - Yes. - Okay. (tinny, upbeat music) (crew laughing) I mean, you guys can just hear this fine, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - I can... This is like... I can... Like, I can hear it. - [David] I think we can hear it more when it's on your head. - Well, it's because the speakers are ported down. - Yeah. - Yeah. Actually... They're ported to the outside too! Am I wearing them back... (crew laughing) No, I'm not. Now, maybe that's to give them a more open sound. But it does mean that, yeah, you guys can hear it just fine at what is a comfortable listening volume for me. What if I crank it? You're getting that skull resonance. (upbeat music) Wow, that distortion is something else. (crew laughing) Okay. But, but, this product can absolutely be redeemed. Eight hours play time, okay. How's the water resistance? Says absolutely nothing about that. That's not encouraging. But tell me this: Jono, how much does this cost? - [Jono] 50 bucks. - 50 bucks. Well, there's your answer right there. If you want a pair of Bluetooth speakers that clips to your sunglasses and you don't wanna spend a lot of money, then hey, frat boy, here it is right here. And when you lose them in a drunken stupor, you won't even care, because Daddy's trust fund's gonna take care of you just fine. Wow, I don't usually get that antagonistic in our videos. I just love sunglasses because I don't like having the sun in my eyes, but I hate sunglasses because I hate who I am when I wear them. (crew laughs) Yup. And these... You know what? For 50 bucks, you know what? Yeah, sure. Yeah, fine. - [Jono] You can also make calls. - Call Yvonne Ho. No, wait. We're listening to TheFatRat now. Okay, but it turned off! You gotta be kidding me. They're supposed to go on the other way? (crew laughs) Okay. Hey, at least the controls make sense now. Okay. So volume up right there. Double-press for play/pause, okay. Press and hold for one second, track forward. Okay, cool. So double-tap... Call Yvonne Ho. - Hey. - Yes, hello wife lady. You're on speakerphone. Um, I just wanted to check in with you. - [Yvonne] About what? - Does my voice sound good? - [Yvonne] What do you want? You sound like you did something wrong. - No, no, I didn't do anything wrong. I... Why would you assume that? (crew laughing) I just want to know if this microphone is any good. - [Yvonne] It's fine. - Okay, all right. All right, thanks. Man. So what we gotta figure out is what is it: some quality of the microphone, or is it something about being a douchy, indoor-sunglass-wearing (beep) that makes your wife thinks you did something wrong? By the way, oh, for those wondering, no they did not sound any better in the correct orientation. They're suitably adequate, if you don't care about sound quality, but you don't, because you have clip-on sunglasses speakers, so... You know what? I stand behind it. If you want one of these, I think 50 bucks is probably about what you deserve to spend on it. Thanks, everyone. Don't forget to subscribe to ShortCircuit. See ya later.",

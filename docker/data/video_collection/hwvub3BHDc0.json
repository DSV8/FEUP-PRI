    "transcript": "- Tech News, Tech News never changes, except when it does, three times a week, it changes. Other than that though, never. - [James] Is this Batman? - Not even once. - [James] Is this a Batman thing? - Maybe. This morning, the same hacker group that hacked Nvidia, Lapsus$, with a dollar sign on the end, 'cause that's fun, also claimed to have hacked Samsung, who confirmed, that some source code for the company's Galaxy devices was stolen. What is going on? Did someone leave a literal back door open at the tech giants Clubhouse or something? - [James] Come on in. - (laughing) Ooh, what's all this? Samsung says no personal information of consumers or employees was compromised, but the hackers did post a 190GB torrent online, which is currently being downloaded by who knows who. - [James] That's nothing. My NaaS, have you seen it? It's huge. - I haven't seen your NaaS and I don't want to. So find out soon enough, whether Lapsus$ wants something from Samsung, or whether they're just the type of people, who want to watch the world burn. Wrong Batman movie, that's a different one. Stay tuned to \"They're Just Movies\" we're doing the real one this week. - [James] I'm Vengeance. - We're finally doing the real Batman movie. Meanwhile, the Nvidia hack just keeps getting worse. Among the data that was leaked by Lapsus$ last week, was a fair bit of sensitive information, including drivers and certificates. Nvidia has continued their refusal to negotiate with the group and now these certificates are already being used, to sign malware disguised as real drivers. Although the certificates appear to have expired, anything that was signed before their expiration date, will still install on Windows with no issues. Meaning an update from Microsoft will probably be necessary, to block anything with compromised certificates. - [James] Windows loves that. (Riley laughing) They love updating. - I love any certificates, I'll take 'em. In the meantime, don't go downloading programs claiming to be Nvidia tools from questionable sources, even if they're wearing leather jackets that seem super real. It's probably just vinyl or something. Russia has been hit with about every economic sanction that Western governments can muster, including ones that hurt the country's ability to obtain legal copies of everything, from software licenses to Hollywood movies. So it appears that the Kremlin is considering legalizing online piracy. - [James] That's awesome, that's so Russian. - Sounds like Linus is down. High ranking members of Russia's parliament have reportedly suggested unblocking torrent site RuTracker, as a way for citizens to access Hollywood films, as well as limiting, or eliminating, liability for trademark and copyright infringement. But with Putin's pension for punishing pundits that don't agree with him, I can only imagine this ending in government approved torrent sites, with restricted content. Which would make this type of piracy less like, I am the captain now and more like, Disney adults of the Caribbean, which is like, I was never scared of Jack Sparrow. I didn't think he was gonna gut me. Please gut me. - [James] He might not me pick you up from school on time. (Riley laughing) - Now it's time for quick bits brought you by Vessi, maker of footwear known for being lightweight, easy to pack, comfortable and most importantly waterproof. Are you always on the move, sometimes through very shallow bodies of water? Well, Vessi's everyday move shoes are for you. We're talking enhanced breathability, added support, a pull tab for easy on and offing, vegan swayed lace cages, extra midsole cushioning and of course, the same waterproof Dyma-tex technology that's going to make you wanna wear them everywhere, even in James's car. - [James] I wouldn't mind to bet. - So keep your feet dry and save 25 bucks with our offer code techlinked at vessi.com/techlinked. Quick bits are high in fiber and just like that healthy cereal, it's gonna cost you, J-K its free. Nvidia is reportedly going to be releasing an RTX 3090 Ti near the end of March. But if you were hoping to get your hands on a 3070 TI 16 gigabyte variant, team green has reportedly canceled it, - [James] See ya! - The 3090 TI will of course be an absolute beast in terms of performance and what it will cost. Nvidia isn't planning to make very many of them so expect to pay around $5,000. - [James] Shut up. - I mean probably yeah, probably more. You know, if you actually, if you expect to buy one at all, I think we need to have a talk, dude, get rid of the expectation. Get a Steam Deck. Intel is reportedly strongly encouraging motherboard partners to only support DDR5, not DDR4 on its upcoming 700 series platform code named Raptor Lake. - [James] Who do you work For Intel? - The memory companies. But this isn't that concerning Intel probably just wants it's own chips to realize their full potential. Not because they're scared of bad reviews because of a RAM bottleneck or anything because these chips are their babies. They didn't save up that college fund for nothing, just to have the chips end up running Minecraft (laughing) - [James] Hotheads on the couch. - A new report indicates that more Ryzen CPUs will be hitting store shelves very soon. These will all be Ryzen 5,000 series processors. So there'll be additions to the existing product stack rather than a surprise early release of Xen4. - [James] And I like 5,000. - That's a good number. Two of these models will have six cores and two will have eight cores. And yet another two will have hard cores. Don't look at 'em the wrong way. They are too badass. According to Electronic Frontiers Australia the country's proposed anti-trolling bill has some big issues. While the, there's trolls in it. (laughing) It's not doing anything. While the bill helps people access a given trolls personal information for the purposes of filing a lawsuit, it's still incredibly expensive to bring an action for defamation between 20 and 80,000 Australian dollars. Tech giants are also opposed to the bill as it would require them to collect large amounts of personal information. Oh such, we have to do this work that we're already doing and also possibly expose the tech giants to liability for defamatory content. So it's unclear who this is helping. Although so far, no one has asked the wallabies. And if you're the owner of a new OLED Nintendo Switch and are worried about screen burn-in from all those static UI elements while you're gaming is a very specific, - [James] Person. - Person we're targeting. you probably shouldn't worry about that. YouTuber, Wulff Den did a test where he displayed one image on the screen for an insane amount of time, and it turned out there was only very slight OLED ghosting after a whole 3,600 hours. How many days is that? Just kidding, I already did the math, it's 150 days. - [James] Yeah okay. 24 hours? - Also important to note is that the switch doesn't have any of the burn-in prevention measures you typically see on OLED TVs. So if you own any kind of newer OLED device this probably shouldn't be a huge concern for you. Great. So PSA, and oh boy, would it be great for you to come back for more Tech News on Wednesday, the one day when Tech News changes? No, I mean, three times it's one of the three days. I forgot what I wrote in the intro. These things go so fast. Whoa.",

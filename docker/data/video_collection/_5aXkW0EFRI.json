Will the Nokia name honor the incredible battle tested invincible 3310 phones of the past? Or will Nokia slack off on their newest Android smartphone and let the durability falter?

    "transcript": "Ever since the Nokia 6 was launched at the beginning of this year, Ive had so many requests for it. Everyone is curious if the new Nokia smart phones have the same nuke proof durability that the old 3310s had. And, well, theres only one way to find out. [Intro] I have tested the durability of every major smart phone that gets released over the last few years. I think Ive tested about 60 different phones now, and its Nokias turn. Pulling it out of the box, it already has a heavy feel to it, which in my book is a good thing. I purchased the slick looking matte black version. As always well start with the scratch test. I have a set of Mohs picks that allow me to differentiate between different materials. Plastic scratches at a level 3. Tempered glass scratches at a 5 or a 6. And sapphire would be at an 8 or a 9. The Nokia 6 has advertised Gorilla Glass 3 on the screen, and it scratches at a level 6; perfectly on par with other flagship devices. On to the fingerprint scanner. Now this is pretty sweet. Its not a button just a pad but its totally scratch proof. My razor inflicts no damage to the scanner. There are only a few other phones with durable fingerprint scanners, like the iPhone 7 and the One Plus 3. Most phones scratch. The 8 megapixel front facing camera is also under the front screen glass so it is scratch resistant as well. But the earpiece, on the other hand, it seems to be made out of a super fine cloth; almost like the cloth we saw inside the Pixel. This one cant come out. Now obviously I pulled this one out on purpose, but over time on your own phone, through heating and cooling and normal phone abuse, the little bit of adhesive holding this earpiece in place can become weak. I imagine after a year or two of this rattling around in your pocket, your phone might look the same as mine. Its an unfortunate material choice. Ill just stuff it back in and pretend like nothing happened. Nailed it. Might want to turn up your volume for this next part. Its real metal. Definitely one of my favorite sounds and feels on a smart phone. Now today Im going to switch things up a little. Art class with Jerry is temporarily canceled. Last month I had about 50,000 views on my channel from the lovely little country of Finland. And in Finland, there is a tiny town thats actually called Nokia. Its right about here. It turns out Nokia originated in Finland. Who would have thought? If any of you are planning a vacation to Nokia, my map will help you get there. Its a good map. Probably the best map. The 16 megapixel rear camera protrudes quite a bit out of the back metal housing. Not quite as good looking as the completely flush LG G6, but the Nokia 6 still has a scratch resistant camera lens. My razor blade does nothing to it. Its good to see that most cell phone companies these days have stopped using plastic on their camera lenses. The flash is still plastic, but thats fine since light will still flow through no matter how scratched it is. The top of the phone is metal. The Nokia 6 does have plastic antenna lines like all metal phones do; these are similar to the wrap around corner design that the iPhone 7 currently has. But this phone has one distinguishingly useful feature that the iPhone 7 does not havea headphone jack. The volume and power buttons are completely made of metal as well. So no matter where you are holding this phone, you will be touching metal. Im not going to lie, its a good feeling phone on the outside, but its whats on the inside that really counts. Well find out more in a second. The phone does have stereo speakers. Thats a bonus. But it is still living in the micro USB world. Im starting to like this USBC thing more and more, so Nokia needs to get with the program. The Nokia 6 has a 5.5 inch 1080p IPS display, which means that if I take a lighter to it, well get about 10 seconds of life before the pixels go black and turn off. Luckily though, with IPS displays, the pixels do recover and within a few seconds of the heat being removed, theyll be back to normal. Now Im still using my Galaxy S7 Edge that I tested about a year ago on my channel. The burn mark on the AMOLED screen doesnt go away. So dont try this at home kids. Im a professional. The ultimate test of build quality is the bend test. Out of about 60 phones that Ive tested in the past few years, only 5 have catastrophically failed and snapped in half. This is the first Nokia smart phone that Ive ever tested, so I was nervous, but this is literally one of the most solid devices that I have ever felt. There is basically zero flex to the frame, pressing from the front or the back. This Nokia 6 is definitely a contender for the most durable phone of 2017. The only thing I would change is the earpiece fabric. Overall Im very impressed with Nokia. So far 2017 has been a pretty fantastic year for phones. Im looking forward to testing the Galaxy S8 in a few weeks, so make sure youre subscribed for that. And let me know in the comments what phone you want to see me test nextIll be reading them. Thanks for watching! Ill see you around.",

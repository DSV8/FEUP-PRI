    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, how's it going? It's Justine. And today I'm joined with Armando. How are you? - I'm doing great. How about yourself? - I'm doing awesome. And I'm so glad that you're here. I've been doing a bunch of videos talking about the new MacBook. And I also mentioned that I needed a friend that knew Premiere. And guess what? He's here. - I'm here. Thank you for inviting me, by the way. - Yeah, thanks for coming. This is so exciting. You know there's been a lot of drama going on about the i9 throttling, but Apple did come out with an update and patch. So it was a software thing, not a hardware issue. Which was exciting us for all of us who bought the i9 MacBooks. - I still have to buy mine. - Well, that's okay, 'cause guess what? We've got one right here. - You got one? That is beautiful. - Oh my goodness. And, yes, it looks absolutely incredible. - That's nice. - What did you bring today for us to test out? - I brought cooling pads. I figured, okay, so, I went on Amazon, I started doing research. And I found out that a lot of people like these things. In fact, if you go on Amazon right now, thousands of people are giving these five stars. I'm gonna be honest with you. I don't believe this is going to help in any way. - You don't think so? - I don't think so. What do you think? - Why not? They're fans blowing air into your computer and it's being elevated. So I think it has to help a little bit. - I don't know. We're gonna debunk that myth. And that's why I'm here. - And we're gonna be testing this out in Premiere, because that is the most taxing on a system. I do want to try Final Cut Export to see if any of these would help out the export that I have been testing previously. So I don't know. We'll see. Which ever one does the best in Premiere, we'll test it in Final Cut. - So let's do that. Let's go ahead and do a baseline run first to see what it does. By the way, we are in a controlled environment. Very nice temperature you have here in your studio. - Normally, I turn the air conditioning off, but we're gonna keep it on. I think it's like 72. - That's nice. - A nice 72. - Let's do it. - Okay, cool. Ready? One, two, three. - YouTube, 2160P, 4K. We are going to start in three, two, one, go. Okay, so it's estimating. See how it fluctuates? - So what this project? Like what is it shot on? What's all the details? - So this project is A7, excuse me, A73 footage. I shot this in SLOG3. It has a simple grade. And it's a five, I wanna say five minutes. I guess we'll look right now. I think it's like a five minute clip. - So in between each of our little tests here, we're gonna have either a story or some Apple facts. But you can tell us a story first. - I'll you a story a friend told me. So I had a friend who was relatively close with Apple, Steve Jobs, and all that. He tells me all these stories. So when Apple and Google were still friends, the Google logo was off by a little bit, and Steve Jobs was so mad that he like basically called or emailed them and said, \"You need to fix the Google logo \"so that the pixels are perfect.\" That's how meticulous Steve Jobs was, that he wanted everything to look good on the iPhone. - Oh, man. Okay, so I just found my FLIR ONE, and this connects to your phone so you can see how hot your computer's running. - We have to do it for the other ones. That's gonna be great. - We do. This is gonna be great. - Especially 'cause of the cooling pad, we'll see where it's performing, and that's gonna be good. There is 60 seconds remaining. We're almost at 10 minutes. That's a long time. - That's a long time. - For a five minute export. - So, here's a question that I have for you. Why aren't you using Final Cut? - I shoot in RAW, and Final Cut Pro does not support, excuse me, let me rephrase that, 'cause there's gonna be people in the comments. - My friends. - Does not support Canon RAW Light, the values to edit the RAW file. You can playback. Oh, it's done. Stop, stop. I would say 10:34. So 10:34 for the baseline. Let's go ahead and write that down. Oh, that is sweet. - So this is our first test. The baseline test. - So while we unbox this, it gives the laptop a little bit of time to kind of cool itself. 'Cause right now, we just checked, and it's pretty hot. - It is. - This is the first one I grabbed - Ooh, I'm so excited. - I'll let you do the honors. - All right, let's put you off the side, my little friend. Do we need a knife? - Sure. - [Justine] Do you want a knife? - Uh, no. - So this is a nice kitchen knife. This is actually one of my favorite ones though. This is definitely my favorite. - I will not mes with you. - You can use these for throwing. - Yeah, go ahead. - [Justine] This is our first one. - Who makes this? - Frustration-free. - [Armando] Yeah, I don't know about that. - I'm not really sure. - I don't even know who makes this. Frustration-free. - I feel slightly frustrated. - TeckNet. That looks interesting. - [Justine] It looks industrial. - So this looks like it just has two giant fans. On and off switch. USB. - [Justine] Oh, very nice. - I never read instructions. - I don't either. This is pretty, I think, self-explanatory. - The question is-- - I don't want to hear the question, 'cause I know. Where do we put it? Let me get a dongle. - Did you bring the dongle? We're good? - I think so. - Let's turn it on. RGB. - Wow, look at these lights. - I don't know. See? This is what I'm talking about. There's no way. - I mean, it's not gonna make it worse. - Very true. - Or will it make it worse? 'Cause it's now sucking a bit of the power from your computer to power it. - You know what? That's a good theory. Are we ready to do this? - I think we are. So this our second test using the TeckNet cooling pad, whatever this thing is. - On three. Two, one, go. Exporting. How much faster do you think it's going to render? - I don't really have a lot of experience with Premiere, so I feel like I don't really know at all. I mean, I would say maybe it is like seconds. I can't imagine it'll be minutes, because that would be crazy. - Do you have any Apple facts? - This isn't a fact, but there is one of the biggest private collections of Apple gear, products, everything in Prague. It's called the Apple Museum, and it is the most fantastic place that I ever accidentally came across. Well, I was in Prague, and I was like, \"I'm gonna find out if there's an Apple Store here.\" Google'd Apple Store, Apple Museum showed up, and it is beautiful. It even has like Steve Jobs' shirts and his shoes. Like it definitely goes that route. But it was really cool. So if you guys are in Prague, definitely check it out. - I wanna go now. - I actually wanna go back, because I only had a little bit of time, and I wanna spend more time there. - That's really neat. I'll hit the stop here really quick. 24, 23. It's gonna be really close. No way. - What? - 10:30. - Wait, I don't know why I'm upset, because I definitely said it's going to make a difference. - Four seconds. We can't say it didn't work. - Basically, like four second difference. - Understand that Premiere Pro, it just taxes the CPU. This test in Final Cut could render different results. I have another here for you. - Let's sit this one off to the side. That was TeckNet, so this one's the (gasps), guys, okay, so when you showed me some of these that you were ordering, this is crazy, because I don't know if you remember, but a long, long time ago I used to have a bamboo desk, and I had this. You know what? I never plugged it in. I just used it something that looked nice. Yeah, it's cool. - Tell me all about it. You probably know more than I do. - We just plug it in. - We're gonna wait a couple minutes for it to cool. And then we'll run the test again. This is much louder. - This is much louder. - I'm sure you can hear that. - It's so loud. - On three, okay? Three, two, one. Go! Now, this is not an Apple fact, but what is the most unique item from Apple that you own. - It's still in a box right now, and I haven't opened it yet. - Really? - It is a 1984 original, it's the 128K 1984 Mac. I've been waiting to do the video. It's still in the box. I just keep thinking about it, just waiting for the moment. So soon it'll happen. What about you? - I have a mousepad, old school. - Like one of the old school, like the Apple logo one? - Yes. - That's so cool. - We are at the one minute, thirty second mark. - So this is our bamboo. - This looks hotter. - [Justine] I think because that air is being blown up like that. So these are the fans right here, and you can see the heat is now blowing up. - [Armando] No way. - [Justine] Is it better? - 10:24. I'm just puzzled how this is much smaller, like the fans, but here's the thing, it's much louder. - It is much louder, so the fans may be running a little bit faster, and also this is wood, so I don't know if the wood is maybe drawing some of the heat out of it. - Well, another thing, lift it up. I'll show them this little pattern design. So, like you said, you're right, you're absolutely right, it's dissipating, or it's sucking all that heat into that wood. Now, here's a gaming one. How would you pronounce that? Nobebird? Nobebird? That is crazy looking. - Nobebird? Nobebird? - I don't know. - Oh, this looks like it would be made for a 17-inch. - Plastic. Whoa, look at the braided cable. It kind of has this nice, almost like a beveled-- - [Justine] Yeah, and it's got this nice like mesh. - It almost looks like something Republic of Gamers would make. - It does. - ROG. Like an ROG. - Oh my gosh, I had one of those massive, it was like a 17-inch one, that thing was so incredibly loud, but it was so powerful. - Look at this. What about this? Oh, fan controls. - We gotta turn it up to the max. So this definitely can hold a 17-inch computer, because this is huge. - This feels a lot cooler. I am going to say this one is probably gonna do pretty good. I'm hoping now. - I think so. And because it also is extending over the sides too. - You're right. - [Justine] And this is gonna be interesting. - Three, two, one, go! I didn't think any of these were going to work. - I just keep saying, like, it definitely makes sense, because it is slightly elevated. - True. Check the thermals. What are you looking at? - We've got like, 120, 121. I mean, it's basically about the same. - [Armando] Stop. 244. - No! - So it was the same. This was one of those that it looks like it's going to do great. - This is metal. So that's actually heating up. Hmm. This one is so far the worst, which I actually thought this would be best. - Yeah, me too. I thought for sure this is gonna be better. - Look at this, guys. This is super fancy. So this looks very similar. It's another six-fan, also metal. - Smaller fans. The bamboo had the smallest fan, which are almost as equal as this. - This is the first one that has something that will make sure your laptop doesn't fall off, and you just lift this up like this. - It feels very flimsy, like it's going to break. - Does feel like it's gonna break. This is an aggressive stand. The fans seem very low. Like I don't really hear them very much. - No, it's quiet. Three, two, one, go! - And now we wait. So we're having the same sort of effect with the heat pattern kind of flowing up on the corners there. - [Armando] Time. 10:41. - 10:41. - So not the worst. - [Justine] Shoot. - [Armando] Yeah, bummer. - So I got a few fans. - It reminds me of like those trucker fans, you know? The ones that they use. How many stars did-- - I didn't look. What if this ends up being the best? - No fan control. I think you're just gonna get-- - You're asking for a lot. - Look at that? - What does it say? Take it easy. - Take it easy. - You can program it, but I'm not sure how. I didn't read the directions. - Just take it easy, guys. - [Justine] Are you ready? - I am ready. Okay, on three. Two, one, go! All right, let's wait and see. What do you guys think? Better or worse? - You'll find out very shortly. Wait, we haven't been doing Apple facts? - Time for Apple facts. Or story. - So this is actually a really fun story that will be in a upcoming video. So this actually happened back in May. I went to, it was the MoMA in San Francisco. I was looking at one of these sketches. It was of the original mouse, like the design that then became a mouse. And I was like, \"Wow, this is so cool.\" And I met this guy there, and he went to the museum to see his sketch. It was the guy that made the sketch in 1983. - So you happen to be there at the right time. - I'm actually getting goosebumps just thinking about it, because it was just the craziest time ever. And he was telling me all these really cool stories about Apple and Steve Jobs that I'm not gonna share, but it was such an incredible moment. - That is awesome. - I was like, \"Are you sure?\" He got out his ID and showed me, because I didn't believe him. Like would you believe him? No, I wouldn't. - No, of course not. No way, no way. - Incredible. In most of the other tests, you guys might remember that the heat was flowing upward, where now-- - It's kind of concentrated more down, right? - [Justine] Yeah. - I'm gonna say 10:36. It was just ramping really quick. We got one more to go guys. - My science experiment has failed. - Look what we have here. - Oh boy. This one looks really aggressive. And it's designed in, uh, it was still made in China. Well, either way, it looks very scary. Oh, yeah, I probably shouldn't hold it towards us. - [Armando] Whoa. - The New Bee. The New Bee, like newbie. - [Armando] Do you think it's even gonna rank? - [Justine] See, I just think the reason the bamboo one did so well is because it wasn't basically acting like a skillet. Like this metal is heating up, and it's completely defeating the purpose. - Ooh, this fits nice. I think this is one of the nicer fitting ones. - Look how good it goes with the skin. Whenever they launched this black camo, the dbrand, I was freaking out, because I feel like every tech reviewer had it on their phone or their laptops knows like this is so great. So now I have one on mine too, and I'm so excited, so huge thank you to dbrand for sponsoring this video. Link in the description, if you guys wanna check it out. I have been such a fan of theirs for so long. - They make good stuff. - I know. So thank you guys. I love it. - You even have a dbrand desktop right now. - We were talking about that. How cool would it be to get this all, I mean, they have so many different colors. I could just send them the dimensions. - You should. dbrand, please. - Oh my gosh, I want a marble top. - Ooh, that would look good. - The marble one that they have. I saw everybody has those as well. - Or concrete. - Oh my gosh, I have so many ideas. I forgot what we're even doing. - Okay, let's do this. It's still loud, but it's not obnoxious. - It seems comparable to the previous on that we did. - I still think the worst one was the bamboo. - And that so far is our winner, so it makes sense. - Three, two, one, go. I'm excited. This is our last one. - Do you have an Apple fact? - I do. I have really good Apple fact, actually. So, I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I heard this story. My law here in California, you don't have to put in a license plate on your car for six months, meaning for six months you're okay. If you get pulled over, it's fine. They give you that grace period. So Steve Jobs had an agreement with the dealership, every six months he would renew his lease, so he never had to put a front license plate. Actually not front, just license plate, period. - That is so good though, even like to think of that. - But it shows like Steve's character as a rebel. \"I'm not gonna abide by your rules.\" - But he still was abiding by the rules, because he was releasing ever six months legally. So technically, he was abiding by the rules, but just finding the loophole. - Exactly, that was it. Did you know that? - I did not actually. But I have Google'd his car before, because I once saw somebody that did have a license plate that said like STVJOBS, and I was like, \"Is that Steve Jobs?\" And it wasn't. So this is our last test. This is the Killer Bee, Bee Instinct, whatever. I'm not sure. - The New Bee. - [Justine] You're about 98. - [Armando] So I'm not sick? - [Justine] No, you look good. - [Armando] Seems like these gaming ones are just more hype than anything. - It's the metal. You're cooking your laptop. - 10:42, oh gosh. This is the worst one. - Killer Bee has killed-- - Oh, wait, stop. 10:57. It just randomly stopped. Like, we're done. So now Final Cut Pro. - Yes! So we're gonna do Final Cut on the bamboo. - [Armando] We're gonna get a baseline first, and then what we'll do, is after we have our number, 'cause this is with the update. We have to clarify, update. - With the update. Time to try the export. So we're gonna try this now. What are we even doing? The whole day's gone by, and we're like, \"What are we doing here?\" What is the meaning of computer life. - Oh, it's done. I didn't see when it finished-- - It's okay, it doesn't even matter, 'cause we don't really need it. - I'm gonna say it was like 13:15. - Without bamboo. So that is probably the fastest that has exported. Previously it was 13:03. Bamboo. - Dongle. - Dongle. Here we go. We are off the races once again. I don't even know what we're hoping for. Are we hoping that it wins? I'm not even sure. - Exactly, I don't even know. Do we want it to win? Do we want it to succeed? What do you think? - I don't know. I mean, I wanna believe. - Will this change computing forever? No. - No, it won't. - It's just fun guys. We're just trying to see if this is even gonna make a difference. Almost done. It's 9:50. I don't see it change. Oh, wow. - [Justine] Here it is. - That is old school. - I think it was like 2007. It even has like the little button you have to push to unlock it. - I remember that. - The battery is dead, but I did get a charger for it. And all of my old YouTube videos are on here. Like, I used to make videos with this iSight. Like, that's what I filmed my first few videos on. - [Armando] Let's get the knife out of the way. What's the time? - 13:17. So, now it's worse. - So it was two seconds-- - Slower. - So, check this out. Justine and I actually ran a couple of tests behind the scenes, and it will always fluctuate a little bit. - Conclusion time. I think the conclusion that I've at least come to, is it doesn't really make that much of a difference. So if this is something that you're gonna get, it's more sort of an aesthetic thing. If it is something you're putting on your lap, maybe it'll potentially make a difference. But all in all, the results that I saw is not enough to make me go out and buy one of these. - No. And I think also, another thing is, how well Final Cut Pro is optimized, so that it doesn't matter the variation of temperature, it's just gonna run optimal no matter what. That's probably why you saw a little bit better gains in Premiere, just because it was a lot cooler than it was with Final Cut. So I think that's another thing that you could, I guess, take away from this video. - And I think we've already-- - And I'm not switching. - I was gonna say, I think we've already established that Premiere is definitely not entirely optimized for Mac. So that is something that I've heard that Adobe is working on. So hopefully-- - Adobe. - Please, come on, guys. - Get with the program. - They need you. - Yes, please. - But I'll be over here in Final Cut, just chilling, 'cause it's like cooler. - I got it. - Oh, I'm not very funny. Anyways, thank you guys for watching. We had so much fun doing this test. And thank you-- - Thank you for having me. - For joining me on my channel. Make sure you guys go check out his channel. I actually, I remember finding your videos years ago, looking for how to color grade, 'cause I'm not very good at it. And then I was like, man, I wish you had some Final Cut LUTs that I can download. Well, I guess, it'll still grow both ways, I guess. - I do have some LUTs coming soon. - Really? - I want you to test them out. - LUTs get crazy. - Yes, there we go. - Thank you again. Make sure you go check out his channel. He has tons of really great tech videos. Lots of color grading stuff. And if you guys are Premiere fans, then you should probably go over there. Check it out. - Come on, guys. - Check it out. Thank you so much. Make sure you subscribe. I will see you later. - Thank you. High five. - Bye. Success.",

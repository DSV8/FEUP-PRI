    "transcript": "good people I'm Dmitri this is the Sennheiser GSP 670 it had disappointed me in the past and I'm told then you GSP 370 is supposed to make up for it let's see if it does this headset has so much potential I mean it's Sennheiser we're talking about they make fantastic hardware they sound great they last forever but the software is not their strong suit as you guys should know by now I keep all relevant headsets in my collection so when new products come out I can do a proper comparison will do mic test and conclude with my current wireless headset recommendation should be fun the new cases by metal gear come in three variations newest silent neo air and neo G to satisfy your build and visual preference with the good i/o excellent internal layout and RGB fans included on neo G and air models check the description to see which neo is best for you right off the bat these are a lot more comfortable then the bulky GSP 670 the 370 has a smaller frame and less clamping force and they still look a bit ridiculous but nowhere near the ugly fit of the 600 series we have a nice and tight seal for a great passive isolation and the ear cups are fantastic with this velvet top layer that makes contact with your skin and the leather body for the exterior that beautifully traps those base hits no issues wearing these with glasses too and this is easily the most comfortable wireless headset in my collection plus I appreciate the dark tones color wise it's a good-looking pair these are not Bluetooth unlike the GSP 670 the wireless connection is handled by the USB dongle that is labeled on their side for clarification and the little tip you can always stash the USB inside the ear cup for storage everything is plastic the way it should be to keep the weight down with insane flexibility of the frame and robust size extensions and as usual the massive boom mic is non removable but is muted when in the upright position and the volume wheel on the right now has these soft tactile steps that move in two percent increments and the actual volume adjustment is not immediate it catches up in a few seconds you charge the spare with the micro USB at the bottom kind of sucks that they still have not moved to type C yet and the power button is the dinky s slider that I've seen that doesn't even deserve to be in such a premium body the reason why I initially consider this to be my new favorite wireless headset is because Comfort battery life and sound quality so comfort wise their fantastic battery life has impressed me the most because they rate it for a hundred hours and I use them for a week extensively over 70 hours of usage minimum and only then I dropped to the 20% low battery beep so as advertised these will last you for a long time and as for sound they are pretty powerful I run these between 60 and 80% volume so there's a bit of headroom left in terms of power output they are tuned to sound a bit more open so the sound stage is not super claustrophobic and closed off like you would find like on the course Center virtual so for example the detailed resolution is nowhere near what I would get with a wired pair like my HD 58X but the sound clarity here is more pleasant to my ears it's smoother than the HyperX cloud flight the G935 and the virtuoso combined the trouble is smooth nice roll-off typical Sennheiser fashion with nice bass trapping in there as well that doesn't overpower frequencies and the main thing is you can tell this a wireless headset because the clarity and the resolution of the detail that you would normally find on the wired pair is not exactly on the level but it's pretty satisfactory I will say the layering is so much better with a 370 versus the Corsair virtuoso and the cloud flight but they do sound pretty comparable to the 935 from Logitech and I really like that sound signature this was a very good pair for csgo and quake listening to all my regular audio cues for awareness so everything in that sense was well delivered and environmental ambience and ready to and fall in order perfectly fine no complaints with the driver performance and this is where we stopped the hype train and talked about all the issues the microphone and the software and this is where the microphone sounds like really poor performance for the price point $499 especially coming from some Heiser furthermore the site own feature is disabled unlike it was fully enabled and working properly on the GSP 670 and the noise cancellation slider is also grayed out so you cannot even adjust the newest cancellation properties so much for the noise canceling broadcast quality microphone mm-hmm this is unacceptable for my ears let me know if you agree for comparison here's a corsair virtuoso headset also wireless pair of course and this one to me just sounds slightly better notice compressed and note is like nasally it's a bit more clarity in there it doesn't have as much base as the Sun hazard pair but I think this is a better sounding microphone this with the HyperX cloud flight sounds like ouch it's an embarrassing quality not as bad as the GSP 370 but this thing is half price so you decide just for reference here's a proper quality microphone the pc3 7x also some Heiser prayer this is a wired one and I'm running it through the sound blaster x3 that has a mic input fantastic quality over here and this is what you are up against in terms of sound quality on the wireless side versus a proper wired one and now here's an embarrassing fact as I plugged in the GSP 670 into my machine to record a mic sound test in comparison to the 370 my machine crashed and this thing is not being recognized by the dongle I have not used this headset since the review you can watch that video and hear the microphone test versus others but the Sennheiser gaming suite software man they really have to do something with it unfortunately I've also experienced many other issues with the GSP 370 on my main editing and the threadRipper system like crackles coming through the headset when the dongle is plugged into the front USB port on the case when I plug the dongle into the motherboard the crackles become less frequent but they're still present the headset will also not wake up after i reboot the system and I have to replug the dongle every single time which does not happen on any of my intima Sheen's so why but I will say the microphone did stop working while I was in game twice everything else was working perfectly fine I could hear my audio but my microphone just stopped picking up my audio until I replugged the USB dongle and at one point audio got fully distorted which is actually something that I've experienced with the GSP 670 really early on before firmware updates before like you know it was fully public and stuff it's kind of strange to hear that and you guessed it it was all resolved when I we plugged the USB dongle and so the entire experience with the 370's kind of rise and fall the software and all of its issues killed the competitive nature of this pair despite then being super comfortable and then sounding very good for wireless pair but to be honest no headset should cause this much frustration as I have experienced both on the GSP 670 and the 370 now and Sennheiser I'm sure they're working on upgrading the Sennheiser driver's suite software but it was also a big weak point for the previous wireless headset right now my wireless recommendation still stands with the HyperX cloud flight even though the microphone sounds like trash and they don't sound as good let me tell you that like the GSP 370 or the 670 these are extremely comfortable I've never encountered any sort of issues in terms of drivers and the microphone not working the audio distorting it's shutting down my system it's not working with the Vinci resolve like the issues that arise with something like that are just unexpected from the Sun higher side which is why the clouds flight still is my wireless recommendation thanks much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content I'm a Dimitri I'll talk to you in the next video",

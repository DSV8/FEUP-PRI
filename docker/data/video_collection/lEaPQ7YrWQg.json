    "transcript": "- When a gaming PC shows up in a giant Pelican case, we always know there's gonna be some kind of cool gimmick. But the problem is a lot of the time they end up being all flash, no dash. This one is the exact freaking opposite. This was hand tuned by the one and only Allen \"Splave\" Golibersuch, one of the world's top Overclockers, and the gimmick here is (light thuds) Anyway, the gimmick here, if you could even call it that, is that every possible dial, every knob, every bell, every whistle, has already been perfectly tuned to make this the absolute fastest gaming computer that money can buy. How much money, you ask? It's so much that he doesn't even know. Well, I, for one cannot wait to take it for a spin. Now let's spin over to our sponsor. - GlassWire. Instantly see who or what your PC is talking to on GlassWire's network monitoring graph plus see what your computer may have connected to in the past. Use code Linus to get 25% off at the link below. - Right out of the gate there are some unexpected design choices here starting of course, with cooling. The keen eyed among you might have noticed that there is no water cooling anywhere. Instead, what we've got is a bank of three 140 millimeters, two 180 millimeter fans, a 140 millimeter exhaust and then a gigantic mesh back on this case from fractal that Splave says allows him to overclock this thing to the max, without resorting to having any liquid near your computer, but you need more than just airflow to deal with Intel's 12th Gen Core I9's. And that is where this comes in. This thermal siphon cooler from ice giant is actually competitive with the best dual AIO coolers on the market. And they have a copper version coming. Did you bring it? - [Splave] I did bring it. - You brought it? Okay. I wanna see it. (plastic rustling) That doesn't seem copper to me. - [Splave] The bottom. - Oh, that's all they had to turn. Wait they turned the base copper and that was good for nine degrees. - [Splave] Yep. - Shut up. Did they change anything else? - Nothing I can comment on right now. - Wow. The point is, this is the best of the best when it comes to air cooled components and it gets even bester. This CPU is not a regular core I9 12900Ks. This is a Splave Edition. So the OEM that he's working with to actually put these things together. Ironside Computers will buy a hundred 12900k's. Which if you're not familiar are the top bin of Intel's 16 core chip right now. They'll buy a hundred of them only the top 10 make it into the Splave PC. And it gets even better than that. For RAM, not only did G.Skill create a special Splave Edition DDR5-6400 CL-32 kit they silk screened his logo on it, and naturally it's over clocked even past that. Of course, the question is how much does 6,600 mega transfer per second versus 6,400 mega transfer per second, really matter? How much can you even over clock this thing once Intel already essentially overclock the bloody things out of the factory (snickers) to find out we went ahead and using off the shelf components, we built our own Splave PC. That's right. We've got the same 3090 Ti FTW3. We've got okay. It's not the same as rock Tai Chi. Is it a Tai Chi board? We've got a Maximus, whatever extreme we're up to now. We've got a Noctua cooler. Imagine apologizing for the Noctua cooler in your knockoff. But point is, we're gonna bench this against that and see just how much professional overclocking tuning actually helps. Quick Andy. You've missed the whole boot sequence, the fast computer. I guess the first question then is, am I gonna notice? Am I gonna notice a difference? Like, should I fire up a game that I play all the time and see if I can even tell? - Yeah, absolutely. - Wait a second. Have you done any like windows process tuning or anything like that? Because this is extremely low CPU usage on about 0.6% of the desktop - Maybe. - Okay. But for real, have you? - No (laughs) - No really? - Windows 11. I think that Task Scheduler is pretty good. - Okay. I haven't touched Windows 11 much. - Yeah. - You know what? No, we're going straight to the BIOS. What have you actually changed then? Here's what ended up getting changed. For voltage mode, we go from stable to OC. Not stable, who needs stability? Why would you change microcode update? - The 16 microcode performs better than the current one for all core loads. - God, I actually didn't know that you could roll back previous microcode. - Another reason to have an ASRock motherboard. - You've actually, now this is interesting. You've actually undervolted? - Correct. - The CPU. Well, that's not really what most people do when they overclock. Can you explain why you've done that? - So I undervolted the CPUs, because they are so highly binned. We're able to do so and with doing that and through controlling the power limits, we're able to hold the boost clocks longer for multi core. Five five is never a problem with the K S turbo standard. - Never a problem. Sure - Right. We'll see. The idea was to have the best silicone in order to maintain those high frequencies for longer, for multi threaded, like your R20 or your blender or other programs that are for productivity. - Will it be faster for gaming in this configuration or not really? - It should hold boost higher. So it should give you higher clocks and everything. - Okay, lot, a lot, a lot of tuning to the memory here. Holy crap balls. We've changed the DRAM gear mode. Yes, I overclocked. Now you've got Intel extreme tuning utility on here. Surely we're not using that. Are we? - No. - That's just for monitoring? - Yeah or some score testing stuff we did. - Got it. Okay. What should I have open? What's your preferred tool? Are you hardware info kind of character? - Sure. - Do you have like firm mark on here though? Can I just see what it'll actually hold? - Just don't kill the card please. Or did you wanna buy a PC? - I mean, it's not my problem. - Did you wanna buy a PC that doesn't have a cost yet? Just give us your credit card information. - All we know so far is that it's a lot of dollars. Or really a lot of rubles - For comparison. The one that we build is $5,100. - And it costs more than anything cool from lttstore.com, like our new colors of water bottles available in 40 ounce and 22 ounce. Holy shnikes. We're at 470 Watts. We went beyond the scale of the GPU power breakout graph. What are you doing, man? - I don't know. I've never run this program before. - What clocks are we at? Show graph. - [Splave] 1400. - [Linus] Yeah. - Cool. I don't know. Is that good? - I have no idea, man. - We'll see over here. - We're gonna blow a breaker in my kitchen. If we try and run this in that and I make some toast. How's this one doing? - It's marginally slower. We're getting a little bit under 1300 megahertz - Really? Because I am managing in the mid 1300's even actually high 1300's just shy of 1400. - What's the power? 450 Watts. - Okay. So we squeezed a little more power out of this one even though it's the exact same model of GPU. Huh? Man this card throws heat! Man. It's going right into the CPU cooler though. Is that not a concern? - No. - Okay. - You'll See. - You'll see. You'll see he says, okay, fine. You know what? fine - Don't worry. - I feel challenged now because this guy is all cocky up in here. - [Splave] Hey. - Where's my Cinebench at? - Are you running both of these at the same time? - Yeah. - [Splave] Linus's electrical test. - Yeah, let's see if they wired up my house properly. Three, two, one, and let's go boys. Oh man, you know what? I think that's why my GPU is getting more clocks than yours. The second we fired up a CPU test, my GPU power draw, and my GPU clocks dropped. So I think it's a question of how well the CPU can actually keep up. - Oh. with driving the GPU that hard. Also have you thermal throttled already? - Oh yeah. Instantly - What? With an NHD 14. Oh, that's a 15. - Yeah. It can't handle it. - Wait. Oh, I did too. - [Alex] Yeah, it makes sense. - Oh. - Oh. - Clock watchdog timeout I think we blue screened. This one's at 280 Watts. Actually no, more like 240 - On the CPU. And then what's the GPU at now? I bet it's way down. - [Alex] There we go. Oh wow. - [Linus] Still 450 Watts. - [Alex] Yeah. 450 Watts. That's a lot of Watts - But you're thermal throttling. - I'm very much thermal throttling - Okay. Let's back off the Furmark. Let's Cinebench drag race them. Yeah. CPU packages at 115 right now. So is it possible that this cooler moved again on you? - It's possible. - Okay. Well that could be a problem. Might have been a little damaged in shipping here unfortunately. Okay, we might have to go a little easier on you instead of going full Furmark and Cinebench R23 at the same time. In fairness though it's actually managing to hold both of them now. - Yeah. That's good. - In spite of the reported thermal throttling though almost all of our P cores are running at five gigahertz. What are yours running at? - Oh, this test didn't keep on running. Let's just see here. 4.4, 4.5. - Interesting. - Damn, that's a big difference, oh. - I just blue screened again though. We might have found our culprit the fan profiles didn't apply. We're fixing them Splave is fixing them. I'm watching. Okay, core temperature Core temperatures are now at 94 degrees. All you did is recede it? - Yeah, it must have shifted. - Ah I mean, not to say that water cooling is better but that is an advantage is the heavy components of your cooler are mounted to things that don't matter. And then you've got nice lightweight blocks mounted to the CPU socket. They are less likely to shift during shipping. However, if you guys are gonna have this packed in nice and tight I would imagine that will resolve that for the end user. But if you have mondo rubles and you buy yourself a Splave PC, what's it called? - Slave PC. - Okay. Looks like I got it right. - TM - And your temps are not great. Call your courier. - One thing I'm curious about-. - Whoa, I'm hitting five to 5.1 now! I don't have any under five. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off. Just this is cool. It's way cooler than what you're doing. - Well, I wonder if just because of like power and stuff. If I hit this one, that one will become unhappy. - Are we even on different circuits or are we on the same one? - I have no clue. - Okay. - That's holding. - It's holding. Well, that's way better. And I have not thermal throttled. I did exceed the core power limit but that's exactly what Splave said was going to happen. So it is power limited to prevent the thermals from getting out of control. It is tuned. Oh, I crashed! Alex! I was doing fine until you started running your crap machine. Interesting. I wonder if that's actually it? Wait, it's not, it didn't crash. - Oh it didn't. - No, it's actually still running. - When that got shut off. Was that it? - Yeah. We turned this off and it came back - Your house is cursed. - Oh no It's totally still running all the benchmarks too. Furmark is still running. Cinebench is still running in the background. I've never seen anything like it. - One other thing that I learned before is that having our wireless microphones on causes a lot of interference. So maybe it's the combination of these which is brutal for over clocks. And this and Linus's bad power was enough to just tip her over the edge. because now, it's fine. - I did manage to thermal throttle. So my belief is that the heat being kicked off the GPU cause we're running two power viruses essentially at once here going right into the cooler is affecting us. But because we're sitting it anywhere from 105 to 110 on our peak course I think if we could squeeze a few more degrees out of a better cooler, that would actually resolve it. Anyway, let's play some games. No \"Doom Eternal\"? That's fine. I have two and a half gig internet. - It's the internet CPU test, right? - Shouldn't take long. That's right. This is actually an excellent CPU benchmark. How fast is it? Check this out. We are sucking back. I saw it peak at over 40% of this 12900Ks that has the snot over clocked out of it. And that was only at a hundred megabytes a second. Okay. We're at 123 megabytes a second 141, 144. We're at 60% CPU. You hear those fans go? Furmark, barely managed to get the fans going, but downloading games on steam. That's a real benchmark. Whoa. We peaked at 77. We're at 64 right now. Look at this. She's going boys. Ooh. I bumped the power cable on. I think it shut down. I mean, I don't know that this is the world's most amazing. - It doesn't look like it. I wonder why we're having power troubles? - Well, I look, I don't know Alex. This is gonna be the big test. At the same settings, running the same game, does the tuned PC outperform our stock one? And is it really stock? Like did you enable XMP and all the good stuff? - XMP is enabled, multicore enhancements on. - It's not even really stock. It's like good stock. Okay. You're marginally faster than me. Should I be expecting a big difference? - It's the same hardware. - All right, but there was so much stuff changed in the bios 220, 220. A little higher, but we're talking like five FPS. Okay, spoil it for me then. You already did the proper benchmarking. How much faster is it? - In games? 5% across the board. Pretty much, no matter GPU CPU bound. 5% faster. - Okay. I mean that's actually not insignificant. What about like minimum frame times though? - 5% faster. - Okay. So just mid max average. Just it's a little faster. - Yeah. - Well do you wanna run Ida - Let's run Ida. Let's do a re-test. So we're running at, I think it's 50, oh, 5200 cl 38. Wow. That is a lot faster. You're like 20% faster. Well, depending on the workload then if we're doing something really memory intensive this thing could absolutely crap all over our stock machine but then we could also put better memory in our stock machine. - Sure. And most of the performance gain is in the tertiary timings, not in the main ones you see? So the 32 42, 42, 58. - Yeah. - I mean some would see 42 versus 38 and think that one's better. But in fact, those don't matter as much as the timings. You don't even see in windows, all those timings we changed in the bios. - Right? In a nutshell the Splave PC, must be hard to have it judged right in front of you, is what you'd expect it to be. It's a balls to the wall tuned overclock machine. Which is gonna come with all of the things that come with that. Yes, it's gonna be faster, but it's gonna come at an additional cost. We don't know exactly how much at this point in time. And well, when you're flying that close to the sun. Ah your wings might not get burned, but it is possible they could get a little singed. Meaning that if there are any environmental variables around you. Say for example, you live in a very hot climate, or your power's a little unstable in your house. Well it's not undergoing the same kind of validation that it would in somewhere like Intel or NVIDIA's lab. Where they're ensuring that out in the real world, no matter what you throw at it, it's gonna run as expected. - If you can afford this PC, you can afford a ups and it will run great. - That's a fair point. Anyone with a PC worth more than I'd say a thousand bucks for the tower should have a ups on it. So your mileage may vary, but it'll certainly be fast mileage, just like this fast segue to our sponsor. Drop! Looking for a new keyboard? Check out Drop's expression series, Keysterine Keyboard.

    "transcript": "Whats up guys, Lew here back with another video And today is one of the more unusual things That i've ever seen here on the desk at \"Unbox Therapy\" This is called \"PRYNT\" Of course, spelled in a fancy 2.0; startup kinda way P-R-Y-N-T \"PRYNT\", photos from your smartphone instantly What?! You've got your iPhone or Android phone There's different adapters that are sold for it And now you're printing? Instantly!? Alright, \"No ink\", \"No Wi-Fi\", \"No Bluetooth\", \"Powered\", \"Stylish and elegant\". You just need to download the \"PRYNT\" app and try it out This is the main unit, and then you get an adapter; depending on your device. ohh, did not notice that, Professional unboxer and didn't realize.... \"PRYNT CASE\", \"MICRO USB\", \"ZINK STICKER PAPER\" 10 Photos; 20 Prints on the battery life. Here's a grip, the battery, shutter button So, this kind of becomes the camera too as well Woah, Woah! thats what like a real Polaroid type of situation here Sticker paper! So that's cool.. What is this? Micro USB to charge it up Woah! Kinda shoots that little guy out right there Ohhh, That's where your paper goes. USB on the bottom As well as a reset button Woah! Ok so this is the adapter for our phone Lightning connector right there Gonna do this side first. Yes!

So like you're sliding off And the photo is sliding out OHHHHH! That's your boy, Jack! And you see that little key in the corner?

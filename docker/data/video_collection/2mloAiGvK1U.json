    "transcript": "Oh, I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it baby! Alright, people I'm out here At the University of Ontario Institute Technologies I'm in the Ace Wind Tunnel I'm feeling the beutiful wind Today, we're going to find out How much wind it takes to kill a drone Let's check it out You gotta knock the hat off! I want more! Ohhh Ohhhhh There it is Ha ha ha ha Haoooo *Wind* Ohhhhh Yeaaa!!! Wooo! *Louder Wind* *Laughing* YEA!!!! WOOOO!!! *Wind becomes louder* *Laughing* Oh man, if kept going up, this would of been my body slammed agianst here This is what I would have looked like If he kept going up Look at my poor hat, got flatten out That was-- How high did you get up to? Person: We got up to a hundred You got up to a hundred? Hundred kilometer an hour wind Right in there It's amazing, it creates like This-- Essentially this tunnel of wind Out here, These people are all safe But you step right in here, Where that wall begins, Boom. WOOO!!!! So the question is: When it comes to The drone that we're about to throw in here, It's a DJI Phantom 4 It's like, at what point, Do all of it's systems for stabilization give up completely? At what point, at what type of wind speed, is it slams against That back drape? That's what we're here to find out *unclear speach* And it should go down and there into that chamber What's up brother?! WOO! Right now, When I cross over that line, You can see the speed up there 13km/hr No problem 13, stabilizing itself Easily Here we go, we're going to jack it up I probably shouldn't stand behind it *Laughs* This is what the drone is seeing right now 17! Oh! It's starting to dance around a bit now Still stabilized, still beautiful at 19 20! 20km/hr! You know, heart of the storm baby! 23! Still, kicky! OOOOOOOOOOOOO Person: And I thought you were ready to give up! Lew: Amazingly stable! We're almost at 30km/hr now Woahhhh! 40! I'm getting kicked out right now! Raah! Ohh! Get in there! GO!! YEA!! Oh, boy! I'm gonna pull it out real quick Oh! This is out here at 50, it found itself agian! What do we say? Do we jump back in? OHH!!! 53! Whooahaaaoooo Oh! *laughs* Ho ho, Man! He can dive in and out! He can dive in and out!! You wanna get nuts?! Boom, let's keep up! 57! I'm in! Come on brother! Come on brother! *screams* *laughs* *calms down* Man! Holy! Look at this I got one propeller over here, This one busted, But otherwise, The battery poped out, the camera's okay It might have some life left in it What was that at? What was the speed? Person: Almost 60 About 60 right? Yea, if your diving in 60km/hr winds, You're going to have a tough time keeping control of this thing I did it a few times though, I dove in, dove out *really loud wind* What do you say Jack? We got the wind tunnel up to 150 kilometers an hour now We repaired The drone Replaced some compents I'm going to try to dive in there With the drone, see what happens But first, let just check out how powerful this wind is Just to give you an idea of what kind of wind we're working with here *laughs* So as you can tell, It's not the optimal enviorment for a drone! It's a hurricane out there It took the beating the first time, But it probably going to be a whole different type of beating It's going to put my pilot skills to the test *just loud wind* Ohh, easy brother, easy! Ready?! Here we go! OHHHHHHHH!!!! OHHHH!!!! *laughs* It's no match for 150-- 150km/hr But It did do quite well Up to about 50km/hr Which I was impressed by Yea, as you can see, it's just all black now But I think it was pretty impressive, all the systems were at play Tried it's best, lets go check it out, come on Oh! So, the damage was a little more severe this time Once again, a couple of propellers bit the dust The leg, this li- Oh, both... legs Got it, a little bit crunched Oh! The camera, where's the camera? *laughs* The camera got a little bit ripped off This is the real testing right here. Alright? And that's uhh Scientific, truthfully. Courtesy of this really cool facility here The wind tunnel At the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, check it out So big shoutout to them for having us in here, And now you know. Cam you fly your drone in wind? Yes. Certainly. Little bit of wind, no problem You step up to 100+km/hr And your drone might end up looking like this. Shoutout to DJI Cool stuff man, I was really impressed. Balancing itself Now it's time for the next one What do you guys want to see me do in here next? Let me know in the comments.",

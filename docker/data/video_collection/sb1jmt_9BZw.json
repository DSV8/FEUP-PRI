    "transcript": "Did you know that Cisco passwords can be cracked? If you use the enable password that is shown in clear text by default so my enable password yes Cisco I can use the command service password encryption to encrypt that password so show run now shows that that password is encrypted. Very bad idea to use enable passwords we should be using secret passwords because these can be decrypted. On my website as an example if I paste that encrypted password in notice password is decrypted. Let's change the password so enable password hello123, we're told that the passwords will be deprecated and we shouldn't use them and that's simply because the passwords can easily be cracked. Let's take that password I'll put it into the tool on my website notice there's the password hello123. Don't use enable passwords so use the command enable secret rather than enable password secret passwords take precedence over enable passwords put in the comments",

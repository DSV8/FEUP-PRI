    "transcript": "well what's going on everyone I have an awkward camera angle setup right now because I want to showcase this build here that you just saw us build this is this build here that you just saw us build wow that really really nailed it there what's going on everyone wanted to showcase and show off another PC build we put together here in the studio this is not sponsored might be quiet but it is utilizing many be quiet components because we wanted an emphasis on the silent factor with this one so what I'm gonna do in this video is run through the specifications first and then show you what I mean by silence because this thing is dead quiet it's actually a really nice PC to edit with especially if you're gonna be filming next to it you really can't hear anything I think I hear my personal rig across the room more than I hear this thing so I'm going to show you what we use to build this PC this the parts in particular I have those parts by the way linked in the video description if you want to build something similar they are tied to our Amazon and Newegg affiliate account so me to get a small kickback if you decide to purchase anything through those links so the first piece to this puzzle is probably the most obvious and that is the be quiet dark bass 700 this has RGB integration out of the box you can actually control the RGB themselves on the case actually up front they have a little toggle switch there you can also utilize USB type-c 3.1 which is pretty cool I talked more about this case in my dedicated review right here but building in it just gives you like more of an in-depth analysis of the cases layout and how things work and where optimal placements are for certain things like SSD trays and for cutouts with cables also out of the box you'll find a few be quiet silent wings three fans these are some of the best fans on the market in my book they are super silent a bit pricey but you get what you pay for now one of the tech specs we have first off an i-5 80 600 K which I'll be reviewing a dedicated video here shortly excellent value in my opinion CPU get six full-on cores no multi-threading support but for under 300 bucks this is a heck of a gaming CPU for sure maybe not the best for content creation I would still opt for the i7 in that case but for purely gaming and even some streaming you could definitely take that on with the 82nd okay especially if you want to overclock it to something like five gigahertz the motherboard we're using is the MSI gaming Pro carbon - sexy board with RGB support I've got everything set to yellow right now because this is actually Lisa's build and she's a big yellow fan so she's really happy about the the support there we also got the G scale tread and Zee RGB modules to match the bore they actually sync up perfectly with MSI's mystic light software so it will detect the g.skill ram out of the box like in the software itself which is really cool I didn't know that it would do that and it even detected our Coolermaster keyboard so now everything is kind of set to like an orange-yellow there is no specific yellow color support with the case so we just picked orange so it's all kind of like an orange gold yellow combination but you get the point the next thing I want to show off is the be quiet dark Rock TFT f stands for top flow so this is actually a top-down flow CPU cooler and it does have two silent winks three fans built-in so we're literally going full-on silent winks three fans with this bill but that's why it's extremely quiet you'll see that here shortly this has a an insanely high TDP it allows for insane overclock so I think we're at 5.1 gigahertz right now on the eighty-six hundred K and temperatures are still staying around eighty degrees Celsius under full load in I 264 so very impressed with this and it does maintain a very quiet profile throughout which it's pretty impressive now the next component want to show off is the EVGA gtx 1070 TI for the win this card is a beautiful sexy card I've always loved EVGA cards they send a 10-7 ETI out for review I decided to put it in this system here not only because it is fairly powerful for the cache but it's also very quiet which fits the theme beautifully so we're gonna run some benchmarks with this build in particular because I expect that people spending I don't know around 1070 1070 TI money for a gaming PC are probably gonna pair with something like an i5 or maybe a loc'd i7 or on a rise in side maybe rise in five 1600 ish territory so that's why it's in this build also be benchmarking like I said with this build in particular stay tuned for that video but this card I can say just right now is literally silent because the fans are off that's just how it's designed and when it gets thrown under load the fans pull up they still stay pretty quiet because this cooler is but a silent build wouldn't be truly silent without a quiet power supply and that's what we want with a be quiet dark power Pro eleven I've used this particular unit in the past quite a bit it's still going strong and that's why I want to emphasize it in this build it's not cheap but again you get what you pay for if you want products that last then you got to pay a bit more for them otherwise buy cheap hardware and keep replacing the things every one or two years and a power supply let me tell you is not something you want to cheap out on this unit is semi modular but I mean come on who's not gonna use a 24-pin and all of the modular cables are in fact black sleeve which means that they're not gonna look hideous in your case I expect that most modern power supplies will have black sleeves but still it's nice to have them in this bill because everything is black now you're not seeing them because I decided to use custom sleeve cables from two different companies or two different people so the 24 pin here in the AP EPS up top were actually made by primo chill and I just had them laying around from a previous build I wanted to throw something else in here to to spice things up a bit more and then the - eight pin cables here the - 8 pin feed VGA cables are from Tony from Rayleigh PC customs as YouTube channels link the video description the guy makes a ton of sweet cables he's done it for us for several months on the channel and I just want to give another shout out and really show off how good these things look even in a case that doesn't have any white components you can find a use for white sleeve cables now wouldn't make much sense in a build with silent emphasis to throw in a hard drive because those do have literal spinning components I mean think of them like fans like they're still making noise because they are moving and that's why we went with a 500 gigabyte Samsung SSD in this build only you could add a second one go raid zero or raid one if you wanted to get fancy with it but an SSD is a wise choice in the silent build because there are no moving parts inside now to end all of you our suspense I'm sure most of you clicked on this video to hear how quiet this build actually is like no aggregor I bet you it's still pretty loud we'll see in a second here at idle it's virtually silent and under load it's actually still really quiet even with the side panel off but I'll put it on and I'll put the microphone in the build so that you can hear what happens when the heat kind of builds up in the case right you get the side panel off then things are going to be artificially quieter because you're basically cooling off your system or allowing it to have more access to air from the outside so that build be compared to just for kicks my personal rig which is a fully custom cooled bill that'll be interesting to see which one is quieter custom cool build or just you know air-cooled build using the quiet components I do have a d5 pump in there along with a 360 ml rad and a 240 ml rad so with that here are the sound tests well there you have it folks clearly this thing is really quiet in fact I was actually surprised by how much of the fluid I could hear in in my personal rig moving I guess I don't really pay attention to it because like water drops and like water moving through pipes and whatnot actually sounds pretty peaceful to me I just don't realize how loud it actually is but that and the in combination with a d5 pump makes it a louder system than I originally anticipated even though I sit next to it literally every day it's pretty loud especially in the case so with that if you have anything you'd like to add if you want to show off your a build if you have a really quiet build that you want to list aspects of or something along those lines may be using Noctua or a competing company to keep your PC quiet I want to hear about all of that in the comments below be sure to give this video a thumbs up if you thought it was cool or interesting give it a thumbs down if you building weed opposite or if you hate everything about life you should please subscribe I need to have it arraign stay tuned for more content like this it's the science to do thanks for building with us",

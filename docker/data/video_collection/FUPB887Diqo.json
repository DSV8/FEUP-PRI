    "description": "Two brand new 360 cameras have been released recently. The Samsung Gear 360, and the LG 360 cam. Both of them make spherical videos.  But which one has better picture quality? Only seeing numbers on a page never does justice.  The only way to REALLY judge cameras is to see them side by side.   I take the LG 360 cam and the Gear 360 and put both images side by side. If you are watching on the YouTube app on a smart phone, you can rotate the phone, or use your finger to see the full sphere.   If you are on a computer than you can just use your mouse to drag along the video and look around. You must be using a chrome browser for it to work correctly!  Make sure your video quality is turned all the way up so you can see everything!  HERE is the price of the LG 360 Cam:  HERE is the price of the Gear 360:   LET ME KNOW WHICH CAMERA YOU THINK IS BEST IN THE COMMENTS!!

    "transcript": "Today were going to do a camera test between a Samsung Gear 360 and the LG 360. As I walk around with the cameras Im going to explain a little bit about them. If youre on a phone you can just tilt your phone and look around, and you can explore the environment in 360 degrees. If youre on a computer you can use your mouse to just scroll along the window. It really does help if you turn your video quality up as high as you can go because then you can see farther off into the distance. So as Im walking around Im going to switch the audio between the two cameras. Right now Im in front of the LG 360 and the audio coming from this is actually 5.1 surround sound which is perfect for VR or virtual reality because then you can hear the sound coming in the direction its actually coming from. But as I walk around over here to the Gear 360, this audio is actually stereo so its only coming from 2 directions which isnt as good. But if we jump into the resolution, the Gear 360 comes out on top instead of the LG 360. Lets do that. So when it comes to camera quality, the Samsung Gear 360 that youre looking at right now is pretty much a 4K camera. The LG 360 on this side is pretty much a 2K camera so it has half the pixels that the 360 does from Samsung. Now theyre the same size right now because in my video editing software Ive up-scaled the LG 360. So its going to be missing some pixels but it will be the same size overall. But you can still test the quality between the two pretty easily. Now as far as bit rate goes, which is the actually quality of the image inside the resolution thats playing, the Gear 360 has a bit rate of about 60 megabytes a second, while the LG 360 is like 18 or 19 megabytes a second. So the quality is almost a third of what the Gear 360 is. Pretty big difference, but theres also a big difference in price as well. Right now the LG 360 is around 200 dollars, and the Gear 360 is pretty much double that. Its not officially released in the United States yet so the price is going to change. Ill leave both links down in the video description for LG and Samsung so you can compare the price between the two of them, you know, as time goes on. So the Gear 360 has a couple more features than the LG 360. That comes with the added increase in price. But the camera itself is water resistant; its got a cool little rubber seal around the battery compartment. It also stabilizes the image. So if youre walking around holding the camera the image is going to be way more stable than with the LG 360. Also with the Gear 360 it has slow motion. So if you drop the resolution of the 360 cam from Samsung down to the resolution 2K of this LG 360, itll go 60 frames a second instead of 30 frames a second which isnt a whole lot of slow motion, but its something. So make sure you look around. Tell me which camera you think is best down in the description of the video. I will leave both cameras linked so you can check the prices on them as well. If you havent subscribed to my channel yet make sure you do that. I do camera comparisons like this fairly often, usually with cell phones, but its nice to do something a little bit different like this 360 video. Thanks a ton for watching. Hope you enjoyed it. Ill see you in the next one.",

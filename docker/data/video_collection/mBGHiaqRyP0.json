    "description": "In a previous video where I ran a script against an Android phone, a lot of people commented that this wouldn't work if the phone is locked... well... think again...  See my previous videos for other myth busting and information about the OMG cables.  You can buy the OMG cable here (affiliate link):   #wifi  #android  #iphone",

    "transcript": "In this video we're going to talk about some of the myths in the comments that I've received when I've created O.MG cable videos. So here I've got an O.MG cable. Here I've got an Android phone this phone is up to date but what I'm going to do now is lock the phone so the phone is now locked and I'll plug in the O.MG cable. I reset this phone to factory defaults and then simply upgraded the Operating System I've made no changes than that on the phone. What I can do now however is connect to the O.MG Wi-Fi network running within that cable and then run a script from let's say Payload 3 I'm going to press build and run on the iPhone I'm not going to touch the Android phone but notice I was able to log into the phone and I was able to Rickroll you. You obviously need to know the pin to be able to log in but notice the O.MG cable does work on a locked Android phone.",

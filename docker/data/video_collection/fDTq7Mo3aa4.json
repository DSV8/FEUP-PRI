    "transcript": "It feels like we didn't assemble it correctly because it it keeps wanting to fall forward. Why do you want to be able to do that on a gaming chair? What is the point of this? I knew it from the moment I first sat down in that chair. I knew it had to be user error. And I checked the assembly like three times but apparently, I missed the fact that I put the base on the wrong way around. And that was why the chair was trying to buck me out of it like a Bison on heat. So, for today's video, I have attached to the base the correct way around, and I'm going to give you a fair assessment of the SK-Depot gaming chairs chair performance. Now, just a quick recap for those of you that missed the initial video where I incorrectly assembled a budget gaming chair. Uh, basically the premise of that video was to compare one of the cheapest gaming chairs I could find, to I think the most expensive one that exists. And I spent 12 hours straight sitting in each of the chairs to evaluate what it did to my body and at the end of the two 12 hour stretches, I was actually really impressed with my young, youthful, powerful body! Apparently, as a relatively limber guy in his 20s, sitting for 12 hours in a bad chair didn't seem to phase me very much. But I was just being jebaited by my body, because over the period of the week my back just slowly deteriorated to the point where I could barely walk anymore. And I'm still kind of recovering from it. It's been a while, I'm definitely better, but it was a bit touch and go for a while there. So my two main takeaways from the video was that the sk depot chair was terrible and regardless of what chair you're sitting in, don't sit for 12 hours straight.In between gaming sessions get up, do a stretch, walk around, go chase your cat around the apartment, whatever, but just don't sit stationary for 12 hours at a time. Because even if you're sitting in Nefertiti's lap, it still isn't good for you. Now a very fair response to that video is 'Dawid, maybe the reason your back committed harakiri was because you assembled one of the chairs incorrectly', which is fair enough and we'll address that in today's video. But first I need to make some excuses. In my defense, a lot of people in the comment section of that video said that they did the exact same thing with their gaming chair, and it's because a.) the instructions are terrible. and b.) the bass can go on either way around. Now, again in SK depot's defense, there is a big arrow on it pointing to the front. Which I missed. However, if they just changed the spacing of the holes a little bit, they could have made it so that it can only go on the correct way. So that even if you're a pepega like me, you couldn't put the bass on the wrong way around even if you tried. Um, so yeah, there we go. That is my excuse for myself. But anyway, I put the bass on the correct way around and then decided to spend some time sitting in the chair to see how much better it was and well it didn't buck me out anymore, as you can see here. I can sit upright in the chair without it trying to pull me forward the whole time. And it makes it a lot easier to get the correct posture in the chair. The problem is just that now that the chair is actually correctly, balanced it means that you have to actually lean into the backrest which is very uncomfortable. The first thing that you'll notice with the two little pillows there, is that the bottom pillow really pushes your back out and the top pillow pushes your head down so it feels like you're being wedged into somewhere uh which isn't very comfortable. Now, to remedy this. I did remove the pillow from my neck which was a little bit more comfortable but still, the chair was not very comfortable at all. And it still feels rickety as all hell. Like genuinely, it feels so poorly made still. That wasn't entirely due to the fact that I put it on the wrong way around. That wasn't the main reason it was as janky feeling as it was. Now, after correctly assembling the chair I did decide to do another extended stint sitting in it, to see how it holds up this time. But I set myself a two-hour timer because I really did not want to have to spend 12 hours in that chair again. But the funny thing was, 45-minutes into the two-hour session, it was like my back was having a PTSD response to the chair because it immediately flared up. My shoulders hurt, my lower back really hurts, and the part of my back where the muscles flared up the last time, which put me in so much pain just immediately started flaring up again. So, 45-minutes in, and I tapped out because it was so difficult to get comfortable in that chair and it just kept flaring my back up. And bear in mind, this was pretty much two weeks after the initial two twelve-hour tests and I did a lot of yoga in between those in between those two sessions. But yeah my back did not respond well to that chairs, so at the end of the day, yes, even while correctly assembled that chair is still very uncomfortable. It's maybe like five percent more comfortable than with the base the wrong way around. Like it didn't make that much of a difference in terms of comfort but I think the comfort is still not my main problem with that chair. And the main problem is something that I mentioned at the end of the previous video. And it's the fact that that chair just feels so janky. Again, even with the bass on the right way around it feels like it's not going to last very long. Making it seem like a product that's just Landfill fodder at this point and not the correct use of human resources because it's just going to break down so quickly. Um, so yeah I think that if you are shopping for a chair, it is really important for you to make sure that the chair fits your body type and that it feels like something that can actually handle your body weight, and not like something that's going to break out from under you when you're sitting on it. And with that it brings me to the end of the video, let me know in the comment section down below how your current chair is holding up. Like durability-wise. And if it's as durable as you expected it to be. It's always interesting to hear about that. Also, we've got some exciting videos coming up soon. We're gonna get Anna to build like a gaming pc kit and that should go very well. And aside from that, some of you may have noticed that I'm actually at home today as supposed to the office. Now the problem is, over the course of the weekend, it seems like one of the prebuilts has actually gained sentience and found a way to interface with some speakers that I have in the office, and they just keep playing obnoxiously loud whale mating sounds for some reason. Now, I would just turn it off. But the problem is this sentient prebuilt has actually gotten access to a taser which it uses to tase me vigorously in the belly button every time I get near to it. So I'm kind of trying to figure out how to deal with this. The neighbors are all very angry because they're sick of hearing just engorged whale sounds, uh so I don't really know what to do about it I'm thinking I should hire someone to help me just kind of release it into the street and then hope that it someone else deals with it. I think that's probably the most responsible way to deal with just like a very aggressive aroused whale sentience. But anyway, thank you very much for watching, if you enjoyed the video, like and subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one, and until the next video, bye!",

    "description": "Finding the best smartwatch and fitness tracker in 2019 isn't easy.  Some like the Apple Watch are expensive while others have a lot of problems.  I ended up choosing the Withings Steel HR Sport hybrid smartwatch instead of the Apple Watch or Fitbit since it looks like a normal chronograph but it also includes a heart rate monitor, sleep tracker, step counter and more.  The experience didn't all go according to plan since there were some problems.

    "transcript": "hello young traveler is time important to you no but step sorry the steel HR sport is my very first SmartWatch I looked into getting the Apple watch series 4 but that was a bit too pricey and the fact that has to be recharged every two days or so was just a complete write-off it's not something that I want to worry about and this thing is supposed to last for 25 days it sounds like I'm an easy man to satisfy but the journey with this hybrid is one I'm excited to share did you bring the stuff I sure did it's so compact this brushed aluminum plates floating 1/2 high keycaps MX cherry low profile which is a Type C connection and comes in different sizes - the cooler master SK series careful not to missing links below so this thing has travelled a bit with me and I'm pretty happy that I bought one its link description below if you are interested also my very first watch had a massive white fiber on the black screen so right there and visible I had again that replaced via Amazon while the second watch the replacement one was stuck at the hundred percent of battery life for like a whole week and after a firmware update only then start to decline so it wasn't like smooth sailing for Withings for the two models this is the replacement one but it's been pretty solid since so it connects to your smartphone via bluetooth and catches the time from your smartphone hassle-free timezone switching if you travel a lot so that's pretty awesome and the only physical interaction you have is the side button to see your time your heart break distance and battery life or select a particular workout one of my main goals of getting watched like this was to highlight any loopholes that the half of my physical activity given I spent so much time in front of the computer editing videos and that is well the second small face at the bottom of the watch shows that is my daily goal step counter I set it to 10,000 and at the glance I can see how inactive my day has been sometimes I go to sleep with like 2,000 steps on the watch and that sucks but it's also a good reminder and realization that I need to be more active and the fact that that reminders on the wrist and not somewhere in the app is a good thing it's that further encouragement that I think many people would appreciate you do get a star notification on the watch once the daily goal is hit and the game of finding the whole overall activity is how you get sucked into it I also wanted something a bit more practical for everyday wear like a low profile body that there's 40 millimeters in size with an elegant face and this watch meets that requirement pretty well and it's especially a nice departure from the really bulky almost ankle house-arrest g-shock watch that I used to wear and that broke as soon as it passed the 2-year warranty period so kind of sucks on the g-shock as for the watch face I love the font but the red plus within the logo is slightly mismatched to the red tips on the hour and minute hands the watch face does not illuminate and darkness but you can always check time with the press of button so that the round screen while small is a brilliant design that makes this a fantastic hybrid I like the overall design but eibar finds it a little bit too bland so let me know if you'd wear something like it for $199 I feel the value is there for a beautiful watch with a really really long list of features so first of all the watch is waterproof up to 50 meters you can shower with it you can swim with it but the top rubber layer on the silicone default straps has worn out in just three weeks the replacement straps are easy to swap with good color options available I got the leather one to match my iPhone case and then blue silicone one to much my another blue case but they are quite expensive ranging from 25 to 50 bucks the watch is a very accurate steps counter and since I never take it off all of my activity is being recorded versus like having my phone left somewhere else and those steps are not counted so this way everything is in the app we have heart rate monitoring throughout the entire day and one second interval when the workout is enabled it's especially useful if you're trying to train to hit a particular heart rate intensity during your workout the watch also tracks your sleep with a breakdown of light and deep sleep and even interruptions and heart rates throughout the night it does not detect sleep lower than three hours so my naps are not recorded probably a good thing to eliminate any evidence of sleep during working hours and let's say your day to night cycle is shifted or switched it does not matter as long as you sleep more than three hours that sleep will be recorded it can measure distance traveled when connected to your phone's GPS it can send vibrations and visual alerts for all types of apps via that circular screen I have mine enabled to vibrate for phone calls so when my phone is on silent I can still feel them coming through so I don't miss them and all my credit-card activity goes onto my watch which is kind of cool we'll never make a purchase online or in-store the amount shows up on the watch it's not very comfortable to read fast-moving text for let's say SMS notifications but that's obviously an option and many many others my only complaint would be the vibration intensity as it's quite weak so it's easy to miss if something is vibrating for a phone call for example if I'm in motion but if I'm standing still I can sense it a little vibration and the cool thing is you can set the watch to vibrate as an alarm clock but I'm a deep sleeper and it's never been able to wake me up the screen auto brightness is very good but at harsh sunlight it's hard to see what's on the screen and for workouts you can set your five favorites that you can access on the watch and long press to activate that workout and during this time the screen is always on so you can see real time heart rate calories and any other info based on that activity and the other part of this experience is the health mate app which I would say is pretty fantastic for both Android and iOS you can see all your daily and weekly summaries and occasional achievements - based on the distance covered and I review my sleep performance every morning and it helps to kind of remind me if there's something going off wrong if I'm not getting enough deep sleep or my heart rate is too high and so I can monitor that and be aware of something that's happening and potentially make changes and also because the watch is quite small I've never had any issues sleeping with it it's pretty comfortable as for battery life their claim of 25 days is actually pretty correct with my first watch I had 24 days until 2% while the second one because of that whole hiccup with it being stuck at the hundred-percent for like 10 days I'm 22 days in and I'm still at 29 percent of battery so I'm not sure if - it will die before it hits zero but so far it's going strong and it recharges very quickly by the way with this magnetic base my next steps with the watch is to resume my running activities and having it doesn't force me into anything but it's like a subtle reminder to be more cautious about your physical activity and potentially in the long term bring more balance and some concluding issues I've had with the watch only once I've had it when they did not record my sleep cycles so half the night was just not present for some reason heartbreak during my weightlifting session was not recorded once while all others was properly recorded and sometimes the watch is not connected to the app or it can't find it but a restart of the app helps to resolve all those issues and this is my first ever SmartWatch so I can't really comment on what's it's missing based on the competition but based on my experience with it I would say it is a recommendation from me and so that is my experience with a steel HR sport it has not come off since getting the first model so that says something and I would love to hear your thoughts on this whole activity tracker and it being sort of built into this elegant chassis that lives on your wrist I'm happy with mine but let me know what your thoughts and what is missing here I would love to hear your opinion if you're into smartwatches physical trackers and all that stuff I'm 3-3 thanks much for watching check out this other relevant content and we'll see you in the next video stay health my friends stay healthy",

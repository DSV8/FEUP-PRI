    "transcript": "- Justine, we're both awake. - I am not. - Don't you feel like the day should just have nap times? - Yes. - Built into them? - I've been napping the last two days. (beeps) Hey, it's Justine, and this is Ro. - Hey, hey you guys. - We have made so many videos together in the past. If you haven't checked out Ro's channel, be sure to do so. I'll put all of her links in the description, but today, Ro, I brought something very, very fun. This is Hot Wheels Rift Rally. So basically this comes with a car. (voice distorts) It comes on an iPad or a PlayStation using augmented reality. - Whoa! - (voice still distorted) So this car will be driving around and you'll be able to see the track on your iPad or your PlayStation. (normal voice) It's so cool. - Okay guys, I'm gonna be honest, a 100%. Justine explained to me what augmented reality was. 'Cause I was very confused. - I mean, I'm sure you've experienced augmented reality like things with like Pokemon Go, where you're not necessarily taking yourself out of the world. It's sort of just adding things to the world. So virtual reality, headset, you can't see anything else. - Right, like you have the Oculus on, you're in a totally different space. I've done that and I didn't realize that augmented reality was like we're putting things in your reality. - So we're gonna turn your house into a Hot Wheels track. - Oh my gosh. I'm so excited for this. - Me too. Okay, let's, what kind of car do we get? - I don't know. - There's all these cars on the box. How do you know which one we get? - Well, because you can actually make your car look however you want in the game. (Ro chuckles lightly) Yeah. So the car will look one way to you. But then... - So ours is gonna look like a clunker, a robot. And then we can pick in the game what it looks like. - Yeah. Here, could you just hold that. Okay, there we go. - Let me get the, this is like a big shoebox. - So we need to download the app. So I'm gonna be playing this with my iPad. - [Ro] Here's our car! Okay, that's not bad looking. - No, that's like really cute. There's a little camera. - Oh my gosh, that's amazing. - So you may have seen, they came out with a Mario cart version of this as well. So it's a very similar thing, but now it's for Hot Wheels. We've got all kinds of little accessories. We've got a charging cable. - Look at this. - Yeah, I don't know what those are yet. - Ta da! What are these? Are these stations or laps? - We're gonna find out. - We don't know. I got lipstick on your box. - Oh, that's okay. - Oh, it's just gonna drool. (beep) All right, what else do we got here? - The signs. - Oh, it drives under it. - I don't know yet. Yep - Oh yeah. - Yep, yep, yep. I did it. (yells in surprise) Please go on the bottom. - Oh yeah, look at our checkpoint. We are set. So now we're gonna download the app and then we gotta connect our car to it. Okay. - Whoa! He's so cute. - Your Chameleon is the last car you'll ever need because it can simulate the look and feel of any other car. So we can make this look like anything. - Love it. So it's gonna change its characteristics based on which one we picked. - Yeah! - Whoa. - Let's browse the cars. So it looks like none of them are unlocked yet. Oh wait, they're gonna give us some bits to start our collection. - I like when he gives you things, he turns green. Like, he's like, I'm generous. - Look what we got. This is the Bone Shaker. - I love it. - It's so nice. I think we're ready to play. - I'm ready. - Okay, the campaign map. Each node on the map is a challenge. Okay, we gotta point the car towards this QR code. We've got a full battery. Okay, we're establishing our connection. Launch activity. So how, we gotta set up some stuff. Oh my God, he's moving. Oh, geez. Look! - Whoa. What a messy route. Whoa, We gotta set these up. - Look, look. You can see Schmidt. Hey Schmidt! - I know. Look, there's our car. - This is cool you guys. So in person, this is cardboard, right? But in the game, it's like this cool, look at this. You set it up. - I know. Maybe we'll just take it for a quick spin here and see what happens. Okay, here we go. - Oh, I can't wait. Okay. Okay. - Go ahead and drive and get the feel of it. Joystick, okay. - Oh my gosh. You drive it from this? - Yeah. So here we go. - Okay, okay. - It's going. It's going. - [Justine] It is going. Okay, he going straight. - Well we can go straight. - (yells) Oh, I don't, he fell into the sink. - I'm so sorry. - That's okay. I can see you. 'Cause you point it at your face (laughs). - Hey! Can you see if I have anything in my teeth from lunch? Justine, it's turned red. Is this bad? - He's mad. He doesn't like that. - He's mad. - We gotta we gotta reconnect him. (Ro imitates car revving) Okay, so we figured out the mechanics. Now I think we need to make a little track. - There's a loop around my living room. - That would be great. Okay, let's do it. (beep) So we've got our track all set up and I also customized the car. You can add different color appearances to, look at this. We can do different colors. I'm kinda feeling the pink. - Me too. Oh yeah. - And then we also have performance, so you can tune different stats. So I have turned the top speed all the way up in our acceleration. - Yep. - Let's do this. Look there we are, there we are! - You can see us. Let we wave to our car. - There it is. Here we go. Okay, so yeah. So if you tap, there it is. Okay, got a point. - Perfect, perfect! Here we go for number three. - Go little car! - Oh my gosh, the dogs are losing their mind. Okay, so it does go over carpet! Wow, this is fun. Okay, here we go through number four. - Yes, yes! And you can see the dogs losing their minds in office. They're so excited. - We go back through number one. Okay, do you wanna try it? Yeah, I wanna try. I'm so excited. - So this goes is, and this turns. - Oh, watch the screen. Don't watch the car. - Don't watch the car. - Oh no! Justine, I missed the checkpoint. - It's okay, you can turn back around. - Mike, open your legs! Mike, open your legs! Oh, you're messed up. - Whoa! - Michael, move your foot. - Michael, I can't get through. Michael, you stepped in front of me, I think. - Beep, beep! - Oh, shoot. Wait, reverse, reverse. (Ro blows raspberry) Okay, okay. - It's saying hold gas and brake. - Aren't you not supposed to do that when you're driving? Don't hit 'em both at the same time. Okay, I'm gonna try it. Ready? (car engine revs) - (gasps) Whoa, it revs it all up! - Maybe back him up. - Okay, I'm gonna back it up. - Okay, there we go. Oh my god, he's going so fast. - Okay, I want... - He's going so fast! Dude, he's like picking up so much speed. - Oh, we're going. - I love that we're doing this like a tag team now. Like you're driving and I'm steering. This is so fun. - I'm full speed. - Okay. Now when we turn around this corner when we get to one, let's do the gas and break again. - Okay, ready? - We have so much speed. - Right after we go through here, right? - Yeah. Okay, yeah. - One, two (Justine yells) - Oh! - I think we did a pretty good job. Let's see if there's another activity we can do. (beep) We get to build our first track! Well, we thought we did. I thought we did as well. - I thought we did. But I guess this was the stunt driving. Oopsies. Okay. Well we already built the track. - We did all of this already. We're ahead of, we're ahead of it. So this is our track! - Oh my gosh, look how cute this is. - Okay, so we're at gate one. We're ready. Oh, you know what I have to do? Okay, I have to tap here. Okay, here we are. This is epic. Drive through the gates in order. The path you take will be the track for upcoming races and challenges. So we're, this is our, it's actually gonna be our track now. No, wait, look at this. - This is cool. - This is so cool. - They added a ton of graphics. This is really cool. - Yeah, look at this! - Whoa. - [Ro] This looks awesome. - Look at the graphics. - It's all different colors and it's like you're breaking glass when you're like driving through them. - [Justine] Here's gate three. - Ah, satisfying. I love it. Oh, no! - Here's gate four. - Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah! - Okay. Look up at (car crashes) oops. - I just ran into our dude. Oh my goodness. Okay, okay. So look up at the top. It's creating a track. Do you see it? We did it. So now, look at that. That's so cool. Like, that's our track. Okay, so now we're gonna test out one of the courses. So we defined our track. And the augmented reality, as you can see, it's turning all of the different gates into like different themes. - Oh no, I'm not ready. Justine, you got this. Here, I'm here for moral support. Yes, yes, yes. Here we go, here we go, here we go! Look! - You've got this. There's other people on our track. - Oh, and I love it, they have the outline of the track. And they try to stay in it. Oh, they have little bumpers. That's kind of helpful. Oh, oh, oh, oh. You've got, you've got a chair. Oh no, oh no, oh no! - Oh no, oh no! - (speaking rapidly) Go, go, go! Yes, yes, yes, yes! - [Justine] I'm trying so hard to stay on the track. - [Both] Oh, no! - I got this, I got this! Oh man, so close. I'm stressed. - You can catch 'em. You can catch 'em. - Do you wanna drive the last one? - Oh, yeah. This is victory lap baby. - Victory lap, you got this! - I hit everything. Oh, I missed. - Oh, you missed the gate. - What happens when you miss a game? - Just keep going. That's fine. - I think, you know what, you just keep going. You're just gonna keep going. - You're doing very well. - Oh, I'm just pedal to the metal. I'm just hitting accelerate at this point. Okay, we're ready. - Wait, maybe it's seven laps. Four of seven. - Okay, this is an endurance thing, this is endurance. That red car just pushed me. - You got this. - We don't like him. - I'm feeling kinda offended (laughs). - It's so funny how boring this looks in person. - But it's so fun. - It's epic on the actual screen. - Yeah, it looks so cool. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. ( frantically) Too sensitive, too sensitive. Oh, what am I done? - You're almost there! Get through! - I'm supposed to go through the gate. - Oh, man, there's one more. Last lap. This is it. - I got this, I got this. This is a long race. I'm pretty sure the other cars have, oh there they are. - I think they're going backwards because they're like, - Are they taunting me? they're like we already finished a long time ago. How rude! This is my first race. - Finish, finish! - We've done it. - We came in second. - How did we come in second? - I don't know. We were honestly tragic. - I'm actually really into this. This is cool because one of my favorite video games is Mario Kart. - Yes. - And it has some really cool things that are similar. - There is a Mario Kart version of this. Yes. - Are you kidding me? - No, there's a Mario car, there's a Luigi car. And you guys can play together. So it looks like I know what I'm gonna be bringing over next time I come over. - Yes, and let's set up a track not on the carpet. - No, we're gonna, this is gonna be serious. Well, thank you guys for watching. Don't forget to like, comment, subscribe. And be sure to go check out Ro's channel and of course hit the bell to be notified when we both post new videos. See ya! - Bye! I made a bell noise for you. - That was so good. A little sound effect. - (laughs) Why would I do that? You were like, \"Ring the bell.\" and I was like - [Both] Ding!

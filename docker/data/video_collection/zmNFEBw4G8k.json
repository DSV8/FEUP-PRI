    "transcript": "in today's video an asus system for professionals tries to win back some honor for asus prebuilts on this channel but first today's video sponsor is back due to popular demand and it's none other than lenode lenode is a linux based cloud computing and web hosting service that offers multiple products to manage cloud storage websites databases game servers kubernetes and they can even handle whatever computational load you can imagine also if you value good customer support which you should lenode is one of the best in the business i mean look at how happy these two are with their service if all of this sounds good to you sign up to lenode using the link in my description below to get a 60 day hundred dollar free credit thank you lenode for sponsoring today's video now today we're not looking at a gaming system no this is a pc for professionals people that do serious adult things on their systems and you can tell it's a system for serious professionals because it's got a font on the box that isn't quite legible now pronus aside this system caught my eye listed on best buy site because asus's pro art monitors are really good and i was like wow okay maybe this is going to be a decent professional system and then i started looking at pictures of it and um well yeah with that let's let's just unbox it and have a closer look what's in here i guess this is the professional e-waste okay so we get a power cable and one of the worst looking e-waste mice i've seen in a while oh yeah that is an s-tier e-waste peripheral right there the keyboard's not quite as shocking as the mouse but clearly professionals get the e-wastiest e-waste it comes with some volatile corrosion inhibitors in it i've never seen that in a system before but what if i want volatile corrosion wait why is there dust on it now on the one hand it's quite promising it means there's actual ventilation in the front of it uh but it's not supposed to be dirty right now aside from the dirt the front looks fine we've got this kind of like wood slat black plastic effect that hides the quite restricted ventilation and then next to that we've got a couple of light bars which i think shows cpu and gpu load now on the top we've got a massive power button which sounds okay it's not the best power button ever but above that we have a lock which i think is that oh it locks off the power button for whatever reason next to that we've got a full-size sd card slot two usb 3 ports a usb type-c port and a microphone headphone jack now these bits that poke out of the top of the case actually function as carrying handles which is very convenient now on the side there's not much although we do have some ventilation for the graphics card and then around the back we've got a surprisingly lackluster rear i o for a professional device there's nothing particularly modern back here and there's not that much of it although we do have a graphics card that's got some reasonable video outs and we'll have a closer look at what this gpu is once we open up the system and then up here we've got a small exhaust fan which if you don't know much about fans basically you don't want a small fan because they have to work harder to move the same amount of air it's a big fan so this 92 mil fan could be quite noisy as an exhaust but we'll see later on and then finally we have a power supply down here wow that is a really thin lame bit of sheet metal for the side panel of this case i then noticed something very exciting would you look at that this system actually comes with dual channel ram that is in fact 32 gigs of ram so we've got two 16 gig sticks but next to the very exciting ram we do have a pretty losery looking cpu cooler so i'm thinking this may be a bit of a hot loud boy now under this sad little cooler we do have an intel i7 700 which with its eight cores and 16 threads should be decent for productivity but nothing special now aside from that i'm actually not that horrified by this interior we've got a standard m80x motherboard in here and we've also got standard atx power cables which means this is a surprisingly upgradable oem crap box in fact i don't see any proprietary connectors in here which is a really nice touch good job on that asus we've also got quite a chunky looking cooler on this rtx 3060 that comes with this model another thing that's a bit disappointing is this 512gb nvme drive is just pcie gen 3 which for gaming would be fine but for productivity may be a bit of an issue depending on the use case around the back the cable management is nothing spectacular but it's perfectly serviceable and then we also have a cpu cutout on the back of the motherboard tray which is supposed to make changing out the cpu cooler easier aside from having been savaged by a marker for some reason the mounting holes don't quite line up with the cutout so ah it's not a great implementation you've got some nice easily accessible hard drive bays for some additional professional storage and then in terms of the power supply apparently it's an 80 plus gold rated uh that's a great wall e500 as far as i understand it great wool is not an amazing power supply maker and it is a bit of a low wattage for the system but it shouldn't be an immediate fire hazard but with that let's close up the little pro art and see what kind of vd it comes with after a surprisingly jet turbine startup sequence windows 11 did some update downloading and then we could finally check out the bloatware situation oh that is a very professional looking background and we've got some professional bloatware on here as well we've got mcafee which is like the alpha vd bloatware but other than mcafee and the pro art creator hub thing i was surprised at how clean this windows install was i was also very impressed to see that the ram is actually set at its rated speed straight out of the box which is rare for an oem system good job asus that's really nice so with that i know that this is a pro system and it's probably going to void the warranty but i do want to try some gaming on it considering that we've got reasonable gaming hardware in here oh well that's a good start oh damn well we're using 1080p very high settings and okay it's running pretty well the temperatures are actually dropping on the cpu now that there's a higher load for some reason uh and the fan is quieter so i don't know that's some weird behavior right there that 11 700 is not boosting very high actually i think they may have done the age-old very limited boost window so that you can cheap out on cooler trick which that's a that's a real oem classic but we'll confirm that with cinebench a bit later first let's try a game that more evenly stresses the whole system battlefield 5 has been running for about half an hour here at 1080p high settings and as you can see the cpu core frequency is even lower than before and uh the graphics card the rtx 360 is kind of being bottlenecked it's it's not running at its full potential despite just that 65 watt power draw you can see the temperatures on the cpu is still pretty high interestingly the curry's system that i bought in the uk also had an rtx 360 in it but it had a 12 400 f so a different cpu in it and that actually performed a decent bit better in battlefield 5 at 1080p especially in terms of the 1 lows anyway let's try out cinebench and see what the cpu does with a more serious load the initial cinebench r20 result was uh interesting whoa that loses out to a first gen ryzen cpu with the same core current and while running cinematic you can see the cpu initially draws more than 65 watts and then almost immediately gets rained in and then sits at 65 watts for the rest of the test now i doubt it's gonna be anything but let's check out the bios to see if there's anything we can do about the power profiles on the cpu okay so this is what the bios looks like it looks like a standard asus bios which is a good thing you do want that power management let's see turbo mode despite initially seeming quite promising it was still a very basic bios and there was nothing i could do about it so i had to resort to intel's extreme tuning utility whoa the default turbo boost power time window is just 5 seconds that means it's only allowed to boost above the 65 watts for 5 seconds so let's drag that slider all the way to the right up to 128 seconds and see how much more performance that gets us and temperatures and after changing the power profile running cinebench felt like torturing a baby animal oh it's just pegged to a hundred degrees celsius uh it sounds like it's dying wow that suffering just gave us about a thousand extra cinematic points now in all fairness to asus that is just intel's minimum spec for the 11700 but it does show that these systems are very much built to minimum spec and that's it and it means that there's quite a lot of unused headroom left in these cpus having said that i did use the system for some relatively basic david editing all tabbing between premiere pro and photoshop just to simulate my standard editing process and with the 4k footage that i use it was stuttery and a bit noisy but definitely usable for my workflow also i tested the ssd and it's a pretty fast nvme drive that should be enough for anybody looking to buy a system like this now that you've had a nice intimate look at the asus pro art let me know in the comment section down below how much you think this system's worth because it cost me 2 300 canadian dollars from best buy which is about a thousand eight hundred us dollars and i don't know aces that's quite a brave price for this thing it may basically be peak oem crap box but that's like being the least virulent strain of gonorrhea it doesn't really make it a premium product and that price puts it right in the firing line of a different premium brand that professionals really like although i forgot about the light bars nope never mind definitely worth the price oh",

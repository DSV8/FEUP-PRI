    "transcript": "- Old computer hardware doesn't slow down, we've proven it multiple times. So then why does your old PC feel so much slower than when you first got it? The answer lies in the software, and it's the same reason that your phone feels slower as it ages. Each subsequent Windows update adds features and bloat that can drag down performance. So then, well, what? Do you have to run an old operating system full of compatibility and security issues? No, there's a new kid on the block. Its name is Atlas OS, and thanks to Acer sponsoring this video to promote their recent Earthion green initiatives, we're gonna be taking it for a spin with some hardware that is so obsolete that we paid less for this entire box than the cost of the included Windows license. Let's see if we can get this puppy running like new. Spoiler, we can, and it is super awesome. Our adventure begins with a bog-standard, obsolete, big-box store PC. We wanted something from Acer, of course, since keeping old electronics out of the landfill was a huge motivation for them to sponsor this video, and we settled on the Aspire TC-780. It's in that weird anti-goldilocks zone. It's too new to be retro and too old to be current, and most businesses would basically just pay a recycler to haul these things away by the pallet full, which is good because it means they go for cheap. We paid 150 Canadian dollars, or about 110 US, and that included the keyboard and mouse, which weren't amazing, but yeah, let's say we could flip them for 10 bucks, giving us a total of 100 US dollars for our tower. Internally, I don't know, it's probably, oh, seen better days. Anthony, your fix for the dead fan is still on here. - [Anthony] Oh crap. I meant to fix that. - I'm just gonna un-that. Spoiler, spoiler, we have to fix a dead fan. I'll get to that later, one moment please. Overall, nothing a can of Dustoff can't fix and, she powers on. Four pin CPU power, 24 pin motherboard connector. Oh, front USB-3. That's nice to see. And four pin for our CPU fan. Also standard MATX motherboard and ATX power supply. This is gonna make the process of refurbishing this thing a lot easier. Well, isn't that just fantastic? Wow, does this even have M.2 support, Anthony? - [Anthony] It does. - [Host] What? What? That's awesome. Seventh gen had M.2 support? - [Anthony] Yeah. - Oh, I guess this is as good a time as any to talk about the CPU in here. It's a Core i5 7400. So that's four cores, four threads, 3.5 gigahertz max boost. It was kind of the seventh gen's bang for the bucks CPU with higher core clocks than its predecessors, but at the same cost. Not only was it less expensive, but compared to higher end chips, it had a 65 watt TDP and could easily be cooled with low cost heat sinks, making it a great choice for a budget system. For that reason, we're not actually gonna replace this almost Intel stock cooler in here. We're just gonna destroy our lungs by wiping it down, and we're gonna put a new fan on it. Wonder how many people worth of dead skin cells I've inhaled over the years of doing this? It's a really uncomfortable thought. What's not uncomfortable is that 400 class Core i5s have long been considered excellent value for gaming, with the more recent 12400 and 13400 being solid contenders for entry and mid-range gamers. For us though, there is absolutely no need whatsoever to change anything in here. We're just gonna get some zip ties, put this just random fan we found, it happens to be an (indistinct), but yours doesn't have to be. Put this random fan in here, and we should be off to the races. Look at this, I found an 80 millimeter fan kicking around, and I don't even need to zip tie it anymore. Totally lines up. Nice. Now we just plugged this into the CPU fan header, and no need to change anything here. In time, you might find that multiplayer games are gonna demand more cores, but it's certainly enough for a responsive desktop experience today, and could even be upcycled later into a home server. Solid investment. Moving on, our current RAM configuration is a little suspect. We've got a four gig stick and an eight gig stick for a total of 12 gigs, which is a lot of ram, but not ideal because we're not getting dual channel. And the speeds of these sticks are mismatched at 2133 and 2400 mega transfers per second. Unfortunately, the bios of this machine does not support X and P or setting the RAM speeds manually, so it will simply match the speed of the slowest stick to ensure compatibility. Our best course of action then is to pull out our four gig stick here. See you later. And replace it with another eight gig similar speed dim. Timetec. These can be found online for about 20 bucks since they're slower speed, makes them not super desirable. Now you could potentially flip that four gig stick to recoup a little bit of your cost, but I think it's probably worth more as a spare for troubleshooting. So I would probably just hold onto it. Now let's power this up, and for a total of 30 bucks for a stick of RAM and a generic 80 millimeter fan, we should have 16 gigs, four cores, and a working cooler. There are still some things we need to do. Yes, we're gonna do hard drives, but first we're gonna do power supply. Now the power supply that's in here is an FSP unit. Good brand, rated for 300 watts continuous, which is probably fine too. Like this is a perfect fit for the original hardware and probably perfectly reliable. With the CPU's 65 watt TDP and no GPU, it probably never ran at more than 50% of its capacity. But the lack of PCIE power and the possibility that it's deteriorated over time to become less efficient means we should probably replace it proactively, if we have space in our budget. With that said, don't throw it out. You can still totally use this thing as a hobbyist bench top power supply, if you're so inclined. And personally, I use what I call \"door stop power supplies\" for all kinds of things like just running fans, for example, to cool something outside of a computer. Like, they're just very, very useful. One nice thing about the old school ketchup and mustard style cables is that they're color coded for voltage. Red is five volt, yellow is 12 volt, and black is ground. So you can put whatever connectors you want on these things, as long as you don't overload the rails, which are conveniently labeled on the side, and power whatever you want. For a replacement, we don't need something super powerful. We just wanna make sure that we do our homework and get something decent. So we settled on this EVGA 400 watt unit. That is a power supply, I think. I mean it doesn't really, we're not recommending the cheapest possible thing. EVGA does stand behind their products. RIP EVGA graphics cards, wish they still existed. It doesn't have modular cables and you know, ketchup and mustard make a triumphant return, but it's more than enough for what we are going to be doing. This is actually an older unit, but as the lab ramps up their testing, we're gonna be building a database of the performance characteristics of every budget power supply, so that whether you're refurbing an old machine or building a new budget machine from scratch, you can get something decent without overspending. Oh, on that subject, our water bottles on lttstore.com are all the same price regardless of capacity. You can get any size you want without overspending. Now while I pointed out earlier that our board supports M.2 drives, we don't necessarily need the fastest drive. You can get an inexpensive, 500 gig SSD for about 40 bucks on sale or even a one terabyte for around $60. SSDs have gotten shockingly inexpensive lately. For us, we're going with an old WD Blue 250 gig and the main reason is that you can pick these up for even cheaper on Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. Thankfully, Acer included mounts for two and a half inch drives. Are they toolless? Nope. All together now the correct number of screws for a two and a half inch SSD is, one. Look, that's good enough, right? Ah, she's not going anywhere. This is an extra screw now. - [Anthony] The place for an extra screw is not inside the chassis. - That's true. That's true. That's bad what I showed you just now, in fact, I'm gonna punish myself by making myself put in another drive for the SSD. Sata data or sata data? Ooh, there's gonna be a war in the comments tonight. Everyone typing it? It's sata data. It's sata data. I can't tell which one. It's a little late in the day. We all just want to go home. Now, there are many GPUs available on the secondhand market that would suit our needs just fine. We could go super low end here. 1050 Ti's can be had for under a hundred dollars, but the bang for the buck of the 1660 Ti is hard to argue with. It should be able to game at 1080p medium at least in this system, and it fits within our thermal, power, and space constraints. These go for around $200 new. That's a lot, but this is the e-waste pc. So realistically, we would suggest picking up a secondhand one on eBay for anywhere from a hundred to 150 US dollars. The 1660 Ti doesn't have AV one codex support, but it'll accelerate H264 and H265, and has the higher quality and Nvenc encoder. Whatever value GPU you end up going with though, be aware that some require a resizable bar to reach their full potential and older systems like these don't always support it. Fortunately, Acer still has the full support site up for this desktop, which is great and super important for helping folks like us extend their lifespans. Last step, power. Oh, and also this, I guess. Why is this not clipping anymore? Did I break it? - [Anthony] Did you break it? - I think I broke it. - [Anthony] It was all working. - Oh, I bent it. I bent it real good. Nice. Plug the HDMI into that now. Obviously this isn't gonna boot until we configure our SSD with an operating system. Let's talk about that. Thankfully our system has USB-3, otherwise this process would be a little on the slow side. We're just gonna fire up the media creation tool, plug in a USB drive, and while this is imaging, Acer sent over their Vero laptop. Full disclosure, I have a stake in Framework, a competitor, but Acer has clearly been making great strides of their own when it comes to sustainable computers, starting with an easy to open chassis and non-soldered components. This is what they're calling a green PC and it's part of their Earthion initiative. It's Acer's mission platform for a greener future and it's literally green, which is because this is super cool. You can actually see the flex of post-consumer plastics just kind of mashed together in order to make this chassis. I actually kind of like it. Earthion encompasses everything from product design and packaging, all the way through to production, logistics, and recycling. This particular one is powered by Intel's 13th gen core processors, then is Intel Evo verified. There's enough horsepower on tap to handle most tasks, while maximizing battery life, meaning you need to charge less often, which prolongs battery health. When you do need to charge, it's fast charge capability means you can add four hours of endurance with just 30 minutes on the wall and their ultimate goal is to bring in their business partners and use their shared technology to change the world for the greener. You can join the movement by advocating for sustainability wherever you can, or simply by living a greener life. We're doing our part today by pulling potential e-waste from the landfill. But if you're not up for all this work, choosing to support initiatives like Earthion and machines like the Vero can help. Of course you still wanna see what this old thing can do though, right? And you're saying the track pad is made of ocean plastic? - [Anthony] Yeah, it's made from ocean bound plastic. The entire chassis is 30% post-consumer recycled materials, so. - [Host] That is super cool. - [Anthony] Yeah. - You might be wondering, why not a hundred percent post-consumer materials? We've actually been learning a lot about this for our acoustic panel project. You just can't because of the unpredictable way that it'll shrink after molding, but 30%? Pretty darn good, especially post-consumer 'cause I think we were able to get as high as like 45%, but that was just reground, new plastic. That wasn't post-consumer. - [Anthony] Well, you wanna know what's even better. - Yeah. - [Anthony] The key caps are 50%. - Shut up. They don't even look or feel like, bad. - [Anthony] Yeah, even the key caps, 50% PCR. I dunno how they managed that. - Yeah, that's super cool. Here, while this is doing its thing, I'm just gonna open it 'cause it looks like it's that easy, right? - [Anthony] It's all Philip screws. - See the thing is, I don't care if my investment wins or if everyone else just does better, I just want more stuff like this. In the long term, I wanna see this kind of concept make its way into their higher tier products. But I understand you've gotta start somewhere and obviously, you've gotta mitigate the risk of the development somehow. So starting with something that's relatively small is a way you can do that. I just need one clip to release so that I can get under it. Did you get it open, Anthony? - [Anthony] Yeah. - Oh, okay. I wonder if part of this is just because of the plastics. - [Anthony] That might be. That might actually be why there's so many clips and screws. - Yeah, because there's the tolerances are going to be not as tight with this post-consumer plastic. There it is. Socketed ram, socketed SSD. Everything very easy to access in here, actually. Socketed wifi, which you can't even take for granted anymore these days. That didn't used to be impressive, but now I'm seeing a lot of soldered wifi. Two screws on the battery total. That's it. Very cool. I gotta say, this started out as just sort of sponsor talking points and has turned into I'm pretty impressed. This seems to be more than just paying lip service to green. This is like, super serviceable. Okay, editor, good luck. Before we game though, I feel like we should do a peel here. Oh you, this is very old electrical tape. It's icky. Oh, what? Why did they, why did they put on tape to keep the peel on? You monsters and you know who you are, because nobody else put on tape quite like you did. Let's play some games. Oh, wait. Well first, I guess we should just sort of navigate the operating system, right? You know Chrome launch? Yeah. All right. And we're not screen recording locally, it's an HTMI pass through to a separate PC, so it won't affect performance in any way. Things are definitely a little bit hitchy. This is a standard Windows 10 install. Fully up to date, with some mild manual decluttering. So we uninstalled OneDrive, Skype, et cetera. It's chugging a little. Whether we're talking alt tabing out of games, launching programs, I mean, even start menu animations. It's chugging a little. There's no denying that. While we wait for this to load is a perfect time to talk about Atlas OS. You might remember the video we did on Windows 10 Ameliorated, a project that got pulled because they were technically distributing Windows ISOs without Microsoft's approval. Well, Atlas OS used to do the same thing, but thanks to the efforts of Ameliorated dev, Actrons is now using a new framework called AME Wizard that led to do all of the ripping and tearing out of excess bloat post-install. Meaning that they can do what they used to do, but they no longer need to distribute pre-modded ISOs. So the whole thing is fully above board. We've actually got an early access version of it here and by the time this video goes live, you should be able to download it for yourself. It'll work not only on older hardware, but also on modern hardware, which is super cool. Okay, we're gonna try our little Halo game, then we're gonna fire things up with Atlas OS. Boom, boom, double kill. Let's go. Okay, well there's no denying it. It's a gaming machine for gamers. No, Mike, help. Mike, he'll get outta here. Who does that? Who does that to a teammate? All right, rage quit. Let's fire up Atlas OS. We did some movie magic. Anthony's the one who set up Atlas OS ahead of time. I haven't touched it yet. I am super stoked. Check this out. The E-waste pc, love it. All right, Google Chrome. Interesting. - [Anthony] Why don't you take a look at the process list? - [Host] Is that it? Whoa. This is markedly more responsive. I don't even need the side by side. This feels like a brand spanking new machine. Look at that. Look at her go. You know, this basically kills Linux as like. Well, right? 'Cause that's what people use Linux for is getting more life out of old hardware that can't run Windows anymore. If you can run Windows with this kind of performance, jeepers creepers. I mean even Nvidia control panel launches without being dog slow. With that said, I am not expecting markedly better performance in games. That's really just constrained by your GPU. However, you know, we might get a little less stutter if our CPU's less busy working away at background crap. I just got got rid of my last Windows 8.1 Embedded Industry Pro. I'm just gonna use this. - Why not, right? - This is awesome. Oh man. What? This is on a quad core from seven years ago. - [Anthony] Quad core, four threads. - [Host] She's responsive. - [David] But what's the compromise? What are we losing? - You're losing telemetry. - Automatic updates. - [Host] Oh, okay. - That's probably something they turned off. I don't know. I actually haven't looked that closely at it. - [Host] What's our memory usage right now? Look at how quickly I can check that. We're at five gigs with Halo Infinite running, and that's 2.4 gigs. So we are sitting at just over two gigs of total system use. Other than, no, because another over 200 mgs is also Steam. This is incredible. Our RAM usage outside of Halo and Steam is like, negligible. I know this is a lot of hoops to jump through to extend old hardware shelf life and you can obviously only go so far before you are adding to the e-waste problem. Just like, buying more stuff to what? Be greener? That's why it's important to think carefully about the computers you buy. A machine with enough power to handle what you need today and a bit of room to grow into tomorrow, always a good bet. And recycled material construction and packaging are huge bonuses if you want to be environmentally conscious. Equally important is that old hardware, like this, doesn't have to die just because software keeps getting more bloated. For less than 350 bucks, here we've got a machine that may be a little old, but is still totally capable of handling modern titles at decent settings. This is 1080p medium. Life doesn't always have to be about the latest and greatest, especially when the environmental cost can be so high. Remember, the three Rs, reduce, reuse, and recycle are in that order for a reason. Now with the 13th gen core processor, back to our sponsor. Acer's Aspire Bureau has plenty of power for today and tomorrow, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't give Alice OS a try on it. If nothing else, it should contribute to battery life savings on top of the bureau's already impressive endurance, which as Acer already had us point out to you, is good for the longevity of your battery as well. And hey, later on down the road when it's time to upgrade, who's to say you can't use it for something else like streaming, serving media, or even a thin client. It's more modular design makes repairs easier and it's already made out of recycled materials. They've taken care of the reduce and recycle. So, it's on you to reuse. And we're gonna have this linked down below. Now it's time to place some more Halo Infinite here. Ooh, let's capture the flag. - Well, thanks for watching guys. If you liked this video, hit like and subscribe. Maybe go check out the video on reusing your old computer as a server. - [Host] That's a good one. - A really good video. I really liked it. I hosted it, but. - [Host] Not biased at all, right? - Not biased at all. I didn't write the video. It was somebody else who wrote it.",

    "transcript": "Zooba lee zoo Zooba lee zoo. Magic and wonder awaiting for you. zooba lee zoo It's as bright as the sky is blue. Welcome to zooba lee zoo. You see... In this town... We unbox things. It's been a little while it's been a few days in fact... so it's time for us to pick it up a notch take thiiiiiiiiinnnnngs to a completely new level maybe even act like a kangaroo some would say. well have I got the answer for youuuuuu.... look what I just did to the floor man might officially be the weirdest intro in unbox therapy history look at that thing... show them Jack Jump higher run faster it's called Air Trekkers... and you strap these things on to your legs and all the sudden you can jump six feet in the air is this dangerous yes is it a possibility that i will get terribly injured possibly disfigured yes but that's why you're tuned in and I thought that thing on amazon i was like man if I can figure this out that might be a lot of fun and if I can't figure it out it'll probably be fun to the things that kind of like Springs on there and there's a little pad on the bottom you can look on youtube you got a bunch of people doing flips and acrobatics and stuff I'm not doing that but I just kind of want to see what this is all about alright hope you'll let me give you those elbow pad oh man you know that's a problem when they give you that nothing says you're in danger like elbow pads those looks like elbow pads did they give you a knee brace post ACL surgery so I got to step a step ahead the ability to jump 2 meters in the air with incredible speed so here's the unit oh my goodness this is a serious piece of machinery that's all metal there are different versions depending on the weight class that you fit into holy smokes i guess if you know I've never really been on stilts or anything before and this is obviously a far more extreme spring-loaded version of that I'm starting and nervous about this we kind of stuck with this stock height here I just tighten those up but i think by default they're loose so that you can run this peg down to the right height for you but we'll see can you imagine inventing something like this is scoot this in real quick, oh there we go I see these things online and I'm like all that be that'd be a good idea this is exactly what unboxtherapy people need to see next thing you know it's here in the studio is too late to bail out holy smokes the old then you're gonna need I need help man dude I mean somebody just what are you even talking about men don't make me laugh it I need something to hold onto to at least get the bearings did you see the videos with you guys man jumping all over the place yeah six feet in the air you kidding me right now oh dude dude does not safe men i need to watch a video real quick so we just learned something here I had been straps way too low they're meant to be positioned below your knee you can tell it's not nearly as hard as it was I'm not ready for flip yet I feel like some sort of mech warrior through (dum dum dum dum) but I got a whole new appreciation regardless for those guys doing flips on these things holy whoa easy boy so standing still a little bit tough to do but as long as you're moving and you really start to get the hang of it ha haha this is like the future the future soldier walking with these things (dush dush) get used to get more and more used to it as you do it oh just smooth walking i just am on my way to the grocery store like this think anybody's gonna notice oh haha this is probably not a good idea I do not advise anybody take off Oh take it easy there Lou getting too comfortable now",

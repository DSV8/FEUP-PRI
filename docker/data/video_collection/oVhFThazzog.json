    "transcript": "- You've already seen the God of computers. Well, this is GORR, the God butcher. It's the first server from EK with two epic Milan CPUs, seven GPUs, and it's all water cooled by EK water blocks. - [Man] This one only has five GPUS. - Five GPUs? Well, that's still pretty impressive. Let's crack it open. And let's crack open this message from our sponsor. Hetzner, Hetzner offers high performance cloud servers for a great price. And they're currently offering free setup fees for all AX dedicated route servers with AMD rise and CPUs. For a limited time only. Learn more at the link down below. (upbeat music) I haven't even seen pictures of this. So step one is to crack it open with my trustee, Jerry Rigg, everything knife can confirm. These are very sharp, by the way. As exciting as the packing materials are though, the contents are much more so, because this is one of the few of these EK servers in existence, and it's actually a prototype. So very few people on earth have ever seen one of these. Whoa, have they done their own chassis or do you even know anything about this? - I know quite a bit, but I don't know what that is. - Four power cables. The plot thickens. - And this, I actually don't know what this is. - That looks like VGA to HDMI. - But there's also USB. - It's got a set of server rails here. Clearly it's intended to be rack mounted. If the hope was that there were a lot of heavy accessories, we could take out one by one and the machine wouldn't be that heavy. I guess that's dead. - Yep. Well, let's lift it. - I can barely get my fingers under the foam. Up we go. Oh my God, it's so slippery 'cause of the- - And it is very slippery. - You good? - Yep. - Okay, hold on I'm not good. I'm not good. This is not... Wait. Okay, yeah, I'm good. What the hell? I mean, I know it's water cooled but how much water is in it? Here, just to give you guys some idea how heavy it is. It makes that sound. What the hell is Xeno Wulf motherboard? I've never even heard of Xeno Wulf. But you know they're serious 'cause it's W-U-L-F. - They actually make servers, they have for a bit, and like water cooled workstations. - Xeno Wulf does. - Yeah, and so now they're like teaming up with EK to make a server with them. - Oh. - I do not recognize this chassis, but that doesn't mean that it isn't an off the shelf design. It could very well be. And at the back, count 'em one, two, three, four, five GPUs. No idea what kind they are yet. Four power supplies. Each of the 1200 watt variety. To be clear, it doesn't actually consume almost 5,000 Watts of power. This is for redundancy. - But it can draw 3000. - So only one of them is redundant then. - Two can be redundant, but then you're really pushing. It's pretty much only one. - Nice screwdriver, Alex. - Thank you. - Ittstore.com. - Soon hopefully, geez. - Very soon though, for real. Prepared to be wowed. (drum roll beats) Are they wowed? I haven't seen it yet. - I haven't either. - Are they wowed though? - [Brandon] That's a lot of tubes. - What the hell? - Oh, she's beautiful. - That's a lot of water cooling. Holy crap balls. What are we even looking at here? This appears to be a completely machined Delrin custom reservoir. As much as we love the look of acrylic, it's not the most durable material and this is much more likely to stand up to five, 10, 15 years of deployment. Got not one but two windows in it. I guess we could use... Oh no, this is the fill port. Well what are the windows for? Oh, you know what? I bet so that you can have it in either orientation and you can see a fluid level. - Ah, makes sense. - Oh sick, I love this thing. It has dual, D5 pumps. Again, if you wanna deploy something for five, 10, 15 years, that's what you want. My single D5 lasted me, I believe it was either 12 or 13 years. - Not bad. - Yeah, Those things are fricking bulletproof. And this, this is really cool. This seems to be some kind of distribution manifold. We've got our pump going. Oh, I love this cable management, or I should say tubing management brace here. And it's not just the parts and material choices, it's design choices. Look at how close the spacing of these hex head bolts are. There is absolutely no way that this O-ring could come out of the groove. You could probably get away with maybe 150% this spacing on a consumer product. - So Linux. - I have noticed something. - Yes. - Is it what you're going to tell me about, that green board back there? Because that (beep) is trippy. Look at this. There is like raw ass soldered contacts for the 24 pin and the eight pin power connectors on this weird PCB back here. What it does is it takes the interface of these power supplies, which you can see right here, is basically just a gigantic ground, a gigantic 12 volt. And then all the other voltages that you need, and converts it into something that a standard motherboard can use. It's something that I have thought about before that I've theory crafted, something that I've wanted actually to build for ourselves, but I've never seen it in existence. And I've certainly never seen it in a commercial machine. It's just exposed too, which is fine in a completely enclosed machine. - It's only 12 volt. You can't hurt yourself with 12 volt DC. - I mean, you could maybe start a fire. - You'd have to try pretty hard. - Okay, what were you gonna tell me about? Sorry. Were you gonna show me how these are quick disconnects and that's super cool because it means that you could actually swap out a CPU just like that, boom, swap out CPU or was it even cooler than that? - More than that. All of this water cooling is a single unit. - Shut up. - That you can just take out, all at once. - Shut up. - So I kind of wanna do that. - I mean, I can't see any reason why not to. - Yeah. - Oh my God. Is this whole thing the radiator? I don't think I've seen a rad this thick since the Fessor Company. - There's three of them in there actually. - Three radiators. - Three and they're low fin density and made out of aluminum. - Isn't aluminum there like budget crap? - They said it works better, they tested both of them. And they also say that if you had copper in here, you can't touch the GPUs because they're just holding a lot of heat in. Whereas these aluminum ones, it just gets rid of it immediately. - Well I don't wanna speculate anymore on that. Oh, temp sensors, both at the inlet and outlet. That's really, really important because that'll tell our control board over here if we have some kind of a failure of our fans, for example, if our inlet in our outlet are the same temperature that might mean there's an issue with the cooling system. I see two thumb screws here and here, is this something to do with... Oh, oh, they're not even thumb screws. You just... - So I think we might need to take this off, and it comes out the front. - Alex, I do not see an obvious way for this whole thing to come out. Are you sure you're not mistaken? - I also don't see an obvious way, but I am not mistaken, but let's put it down and have it facing out this way. - So you have no evidence that you are not mistaken. - No, I talked to one of the guys that helped design this yesterday. - He designed it yesterday? I think the whole thing just slides. - Yeah, I think we need to put it down first. - You keep wanting to put it down, Alex, live a little. Look at him, he's all sweaty. He's all stressed out. - I am the opposite of stressed right now (laughs). Just put it down. - It was a very short distance drop. I'm trying to put it down. - Goddammit. We don't even know how much this cost. It's probably like 70 grand. - It's only got like 512 gigs of Ram in it. And I don't even see any storage, Alex. Oh, this is as good as it gets. This is Milan X with the 3D cash. - Yeah. - [Jake] Those are $9,000 USD. - $9,000 each for the CPUs? - They said that there might be two screws that we need to undo. - Might be, what do you mean might be? I thought you said they designed it yesterday. They should remember. - Well, but they didn't remember if they put them in for shipping or not. - Okay, I found this little pole tab. Whoa. - Oh, we did it (laughs). - What the trip is going on here? Holy Frank. - Ooh, wow. - So here's your cooling right there, buddy. This is like freaking the size of a cooler for a small vehicle. - Oh yeah, most of the parts are automotive. - What is the deal with the flow layout of these radiators? Because I remember Corsa telling me in no uncertain terms that stacking radiators like this does not work. And yet it appears that EK is doing just that. If you put your pumps in series, the flow rate is identical, but the head pressure doubles. If you put them in parallel, the flow rate doubles, but the head pressure is identical, is my understanding. - That makes sense. - Okay, so we want higher flow rate, I guess, because we've actually got a very wide water cooling system, thanks to this manifold. So we're coming out of the two pumps into the ends, we go out from here, we come back into here. Then on the one side, we go into this rad, and back to the reservoir. And on the other side, we go into these two rads, the one at the... There's three, three in the stack, we go to these two radiators, which are running in parallel. And then they come together here. So the radiators that get... No, they all get the same temperature water it looks like. Well, I like it. - Oh, also this fan controller is insane. It has actual processing on board. - Right. - That does AI stuff to optimize the fans based off of water temperature, CPU temperature, and stuff. The USB connector is not USB, it's just pure serial I2C bus stuff. So this cannot interact with your system. - Right, so it's not an attack vector or anything like that. - Right. - Cool. - But what you can do is connect WiFi and Bluetooth to this. So you can monitor your system from anywhere you want without connecting your actual system to the internet. - Not even the IPMI, just- - Right. - This module. That's pretty cool. This is some funky tubing that they're using for these really tight bends here. Check this out. There's actually two different kinds of tubing in this system. And to be clear, both of them are extremely non porous style tubing. So you're not gonna get a ton of evaporative water loss through the tubing. But then there's also this one, which seems to be rimmed in such a way that it allows it to bend at 90 degrees in a super tight space like that. I've never seen a tube that holds its shape like that while it's spent like that. Is it possible that they've put something inside the tubing, like some kind of inner skeleton to keep it from being able to collapse? - Doesn't really feel like it. - No, it really doesn't. That's wild. Here's a better look at our pumps while we've got it out. And this is cool. This is the power interface that I was referring to before. So you slide it back into the chassis. It clips into here, or doesn't even clip it just slides onto here. And boom, this whole module is powered by this weird intermediary board that I was talking about before. You can actually see from here, the raw leads are coming off of this first intermediary board back here that the power supply slots into. Those are soldered to this board. Then everything that goes to the motherboard or GPUs is using standard PC power connectors like this. - They did say, I think it's right here. There will be a spot for hot swappable SSDs in the future, but they don't have that done 'cause it's a low priority. - Low priority, yeah, this ain't a storage server. I guess that's as good a time as any to discuss what the crap this thing actually is for. - Rendering mostly, lots of rendering, machine vision, that sort of stuff. - Yeah, machine learning, - Big Hollywood studios would render animated films on something like this. They said that they could- - Or something like many of these. - They said this server alone can do like frames per second of animations. - Shut up. - Yeah, they were getting like three to 400 frames per minute in I think it was Redshift. - If you lack the context, that's a lot. - Yeah. - It wasn't that long ago that we were talking about seconds per frame. And it wasn't even that long before that we were talking minutes per frame, this will never stop tripping me out. The way that Invidia's reference design for this professional grade card just has like, soldered fricking power connector, wires running into the back of the board like this. - Well, and they still have the big fan cutout thing. - Yeah. Even though it uses a completely different cooler from the consumer grade, 3090 and 3090 TI reference boards. I'm sorry, I meant this uses the same board as the 3080 class cards, not the 3090. The 3090 is taller. - One thing they did mention is that they want to create their own custom envy link connector. So that normally comes with two slots spacing, but then they can't fit five or seven GPUs in a server. - Right. - So they want the single slot one and they're just getting Invidia's blessing to be like, good luck, can we make it? It seems like it's gonna happen. - Really? - Yeah. - Okay. Invidia can be very easy to work with. There's one thing that could be a little bit tricky for us to plug back in, Alex. - What's that? - I accidentally ripped out this USB cable and I have no idea where it goes. - Oh. - It's possible that it's down here. That would be really bad. It's mangled. - Oh, yeah. - That's- - [Alex] Oops, sorry, okay. - More like, sorry us. It's not like we're sending this back to them. Good luck getting it back EK. In fairness to us, EK told us this thing, did they use the word hot swappable? - Well, not hots swappable, but like- - Well, what did they- - Quick swappable. - Quick swappable. - Something fails, you can just pull the whole thing out. Chuck a new one in, power connector. Quick disconnects, you're good to go. - Well then it wasn't entirely unreasonable of us to think that that meant we could pull the thing out without also removing a cross brace and a GPU and a USB cable. And before you say it, no, you're not expected to remove it from the other side, 'cause it's actually cable managed into everything else here. So we were wrong, but they were wrong too. That's the closest you're getting to an admission of fault from me. - All right, let's put it back together. - One cool thing about this system, not that it would ever matter for a real world deployment, is that the cooling system will work the same regardless of whether the top panel is on. 'Cause it's all in this just self-contained unit here. This thing is wild. I will tame you, JK, I like you wild. (machine engine roaring) - Power supplies are loud. Three and four. (machine engine roaring) - Wow. - Yeah, I believe these are 6,400 RPM fans. They're going to put 7,200 in the final one. They don't need to run it that fast that's just what they're getting. One thing that is unique about this one is ours came with Windows 10. Normally it will come with Linux or Windows server, but they were like, you guys are gonna want Windows 10. - That's fair. I guess they don't want me to break it in under an hour. Task manager. (Alex laughing) - Beautiful. - All righty, that's a lot of course. That's a lot of Ram. Oh, that's a lot of a 6,000 GPUs. So we've got a whopping 512 gigs of system memory. Then another, almost 250 on the GPUs. - Also you should check out X vision. - X Vision. - This is their fan controller thing. - Okay, so we can monitor our fan RPM here. They're only at 1700 and they do excuse me, pardon, over 6,000? This isn't the kind of thing I would recommend during a windows update, but it's probably fine. It has at least one power supply worth of redundancy. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna unplug the power supplies one at a time and plug them into our power meter. See, no problem. There. He's happy. I swear we have better power monitoring stuff coming. Not just coming, actually purchased and in the lab, we just don't know how to use it yet. They're sending someone up to train us. Okay, so what's on the agenda here? - Well, I did a couple benchmarks on this and realized that I had just absolutely no context for what it was doing. So I brought over this beauty right here. 12900K, 3080 Ti. - That's a nice gaming rate. - Yeah, about as fast as like a mortal could have. - And we're gonna drag race them. - Yeah, I fully benchmarked already. We don't wanna wait for this to finish, but... - Ouch. Let's do blender. - On our origin system, this took one minute and 30 seconds. - Holy crap. - It's sticking longer than I thought it was. - Wait, what? Yeah, no, this isn't right? - Yeah, that was not- - Oh, wait, 18 seconds, it's done. Oh, I know what happened, Alex. We read it as minutes, but it was seconds remaining. It was working just fine. How's our power consumption? - About 1000 Watts, 900,000 somewhere around there. - I hear the fans kicking in now. - Yeah, one thing the Camino does have going for, was it was a lot quieter than this. That's mostly because of the power supplies. - Yeah, and I was gonna say that feels like a bit of a choice that they made. - Yeah. - Wait, holy crap, Alex, it was CPU rendering and it still went that fast. - Oh. - I specifically told it GPU, I don't know what its problem is. But let's have a look at what GPU performance looks like. (Alex laughing) Under eight seconds. The really wild thing though is that that CPU run was not only fast, but we were drawing 900 to 1000 Watts on GPUs, especially five of them, that's very reasonable. On CPUs, these things are freaking hungry. All right, let's have a look at what power consumption looks like in GPU rendering. Okay, I'm going. (soft beat music) Okay, render is over, did you catch it? We need five seconds. - Five seconds. - 5.83 seconds. - I think I briefly saw 1100 Watts. We need a longer render here. - Okay. - Well do a classroom. So that took our test PC three minutes and 37 seconds. - Three minutes 37 seconds. All right, you better look quick at the power consumption 'cause it might disappear. - This one is all CPU rendering, looking like it'll be about 40. Shaving three minutes off your render isn't too bad. - Yeah. Little bit wow those cores though. - Yep. - On CPU, it was 41 seconds. Can we run it in GPU? - Probably. - Holy crap. That was an 1130 second classroom render. We're gonna have to go harder. I wanna see gooseberry. Holy (beep), that was a one minute gooseberry. And most of that time was just loading in all the assets and preparing to render. Do it again. Building optics, acceleration structure, blah, blah, blah. We're up to 40 seconds now. The GPU have not even kicked in yet they are doing nothing. Boom, here we go. Okay, we've got 15 seconds to look at this, 250 Watts on that GPU, 260 on that one. What's our overall power consumption? Quick Alex, look, look, you got three seconds. It's done, under a minute. - We had 1700 Watts, I didn't miss that. - 1700 Watts. - Yeah. - Whoa. This is like a multi minute benchmark on even high end machines. What do you want me to do now? - SolidWorks visualize. We can do more later when we want to really see it. This is just to compare to the origin PC. - Got it. - Which did this, which is ridiculous settings in three minutes 51 seconds. - Okay, can I start it? - Yep, and this should hit all of our GPU's and all of our CPUs at once. - Time remaining, three minutes, two minutes, three minutes. Wait, is this not gonna be faster? Whoa, I hear some fans going. - We got over 2000 Watts there. - One minute, 19 seconds. So it is a third the time. Is it possible that having the CPU in the mix is actually slowing it down? We've seen that in render before with really fast GPU setups. - We can try it. - The really wild thing to me is that the kinds of productions that can afford one of these, afford many of them. - It is worth it. If you're rendering out like full movies in super high detail. - And to be clear, you're not rendering them once. If you were, then you could just wait, you are rendering again and again and again and again, and looking and reviewing and tweaking, and to be clear, the software we're using for rendering right now is not for a feature film or a production. This is more for mechanical design. One minute, 15. So not, it's slower. - No, it was one minute, 19 last time. - Oh, wait, yeah, it's faster. - Slightly improved it. - Okay. Okay, what's next? - We can do V Ray. - All right, V Ray, which one do you want, Kuda? - So on our origin system, we got a score of 2,520. - Yeah. To be clear, we're not hating on origin systems. That's very fast. - Very fast. - It's just not fluid works powered by Xeno Wulf fast. - It's just an order of magnitude less money. - I wanna see the power consumption right now. What are we at? Holy crap, we're over 1000 Watts on each one. We're at 2300 Watts. This would blow the breaker. If we had the whole thing plugged into one north American, 120 volt circuit, 8290. - [Alex] Yeah, it's quite a bit faster. - See you later, buddy. Not bang for the buck faster. Makes you wonder why they don't just buy an army of gaming pieces. They're gonna have a cluster anyway. - I would trust this to work way more. All right, new test, I wanna see the CPU one. - Okay, I had enabled CPU for this. Is that right? - Yep. The maximum temperature we've hit on any of our GPUs is under 45 degrees. (Alex laughing) That is ludicrous. - All right, just under 18,000 a bit. - That's a bit more. - A little bit more. Turns out two epic Milans are about 472% faster than a 12900K. I'm kind of curious, I wanna submit this score and just see how we compare. So the most anyone's ever gotten in that test is 109,000. And I believe what we just did, yes, was the fastest that those processors have ever gone in V Ray. We like absolutely killed- - And that comes down to cooling. - Yeah, yep. These three are us, I did it yesterday too. (both laughing) - Oh my goodness. What's faster than 7763s, are faster in V Ray. - Yeah, it seems like it. - Oh, you know what? I wonder if it's over clockable or something. What's ASUS RS700A render Tron? Was this just some ASUS engineer just like dinging around or something. - It kind of seems like it. - It kind of looks that way. - The fastest Intel CPU has ever gone in this, is 62,000. - I think you mean the fastest two Intel CPUs ever. - Yeah, the fastest two Intel CPUs, the fastest four Intel CPUs has ever gone is even slower. Oof. - That does it for performance, it's fricking fast, but I still wanna know where we end up for thermals. - For performance there is one more thing, I tested the two of these in gaming. - Oh, shut up. - I only needed one game. It turns out the gaming system's way faster. - For gaming. - Yeah, shadow of the tomb rate got 209 FPS. This thing got 128, absolutely slaughtered. - These GPU, they don't boost up and suck back power the way that the gaming ones do. And unfortunately games can't leverage the fact that there are five of them. So they just get left in the dust. - Also CPUs, the one in there 12900K, five gigahertz. Not the gigahertz matters, but these are much slower 'cause there's like 64 cores. - I wanna see something that actually takes a bit. I wanna know how hot these things get. Oh, it's hot back here. - Oh yeah. It's not like hot-hot though. - Oh wait, hold on, hold on. It is true that it does not feel hot to the touch. Is that just 'cause there's so much radiator removing heat though? The tubes also don't feel hot to the touch. - You said that they're cheating. - Well, no, I just mean their explanation for it doesn't make any sense. - There is one kind of stupid thing that I want to test while we're doing this. - Yeah. - If their load balancing is good, they told me that you can just rip out a power supply during a render. - Or simulating a failure. - Yeah, so if it was to just like... Yeah, I didn't enjoy that, but it's fine. - You did. - Yeah, I kind of did. - It's fine. - Yeah, it's totally fine. - It dropped down to about 600, 5700 Watts where we dropped one of the power supplies and on the squid that has two power supplies, we're up to 1550, which is still well under the peak capacity of those two units combined. - I'm very sorry Mr. Server. - Okay, and it's immediately back. - [Alex] All right. - I was really thinking we might see some higher GPU temperatures after a while, but they are not doing that. We're at 46 degrees on the hottest GPU and the CPUs are sitting at 60. And you can see they're not going up anymore. That's freaking it. - This is like perfect cap bed temperature right now. - And this is the perfect segue to our sponsor. - Grammarly, so much time can be spent at work, trying to answer emails or draft proposals and it can become overwhelming.

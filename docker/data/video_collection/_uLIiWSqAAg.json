    "transcript": "Come check this out So if you guys follow me on Instagram You've probably seen this setup Or at least part of it. I've been working on it for a while! This has most of the things that I hope to use, and it's.. ...actually a kinda cool story about how it came together. I never intended on putting together something so crazy, But a few brands reached out to me and said \"Hey Lew, you wanna experiment with some of our stuff?\" And I said, \"Sure!\" ...and then this happened. *Points to setup* the first thing i want to talk about and the purpose of this video is to focus on these LG Displays. th-that make up sorta the core of the setup. now there's a lot to cover here. So I'm probably gonna split this up into a couple different videos But this one is about these monitors. So these displays are not quite 4K And that comes as a consequence of the aspect ratio which is of course unusual super wide angle and... curve if u come in a little bit closer you'll see on the top edge they actually curve in a little bit and this is to give a greater sense on immersion whether you are using one of the displays or using all three like I am doing right here so the back of the display is covered by this panel which helps it look a little bit nicer Done in this champagne colour which I think is a nice look And this panel pops off, I think you see, to expose all of your IO's you have your DC-In for power aswell a power switch A headphone output because you have HDMI-In options here. There's actually two HDMI's Display port in The Thunderbolt port. There's two of them so that you can daisy-chain these monitors together A USB-up port and then two USB-out essentially this thing can behave as a USB hub For example my tiny little mouse receiver, and... you're benefiting again from those Thunderbolt ports because they're not only carrying the video signal. they're also carrying the data signal for USB. And when you're sitting in the cockpit, in the center, and you see display sort of in your peripheral vision. it really gives you that immersion that i'm talking about and that's... that's the objective here, or as I've done in this case match it up with another monitor this giant 50 inch 4k display that I'll be talking about more in the next video another thing you're probably wondering is how the hell could you possibly power those displays or push pixels to all of them now what's amazing here is that I'm actually using these with a mac pro It's powering all of these pixels not just the LG display's but the big 50 inch 4k ...as well. You can see the brain, the workhorse, so that's a 12-core mac pro that is running the D700 graphics card so it is the top of the range for the mac pro line-up I do want to give a quick shout out to my pal Justin Mallar who set up this background here which is amazing as you can see, it's custom for this resolution for these three displays as well as the display up top and if you've seen this guy's artwork you know he does amazing stuff Check him out. I'll link him down in the description. Anyhow, what is it like to use this many monitors? In this particular case, it is a ton of work space. That's the bottom line. This is the most workspace that I've ever had and it means that i can set up a ton of tools and leave them open. This is one of the few ways that you can see a lot of films in their native aspect ratio, without black bars. Think about that! This is also like I said before, from a gaming perspective some of the best immersion that you can get. There's a number of things I do on a daily basis and so I do various setups depending on what that day calls for. I could have social media over here. I could have twitter over on this display for example. I could have my web browser, with way too many tabs open Let's say for Facebook or something and put that up on this display here so I can track my post to Facebook Over here I put Vox, my media player of choice I put Sparrow, my email client with way too many Gmail addresses, Skype goes over here So you can tell this is the command center and I'm absolutely loving it but this has just been like opening the gates to heaven I don't think you guys understand how many hours I actually sit right here a ton of hours and so this becomes like a second home and you want it to be something that inspires you so that wraps up this first portion of my explanation of what exactly is going on in my setup, I probably rambled for way too long definitely rambled for way too long in the next episode it'll be all about this VIZIO 4k television and how I fit that into the workflow because I don't just use it as an extra computer monitor that's the way it's set up right now so I'll go into more detail about that the speakers and some of the other peripherals alright now I have definitely rambled for too long like i said before that's it. thank you everybody for giving me all the crazy feedback on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, regarding this setup hope I didn't take up too much of your time, leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed this content. And... like I said \"I'll catch you on the next episode. Later...\"",

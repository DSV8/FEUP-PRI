    "transcript": "*sung* Brotheeeer... bring yer whiskeeeey... y'know I need a sip... BrrOOothEEeer I've been thirstyyyy... fer whiskey on my lips... (Ryan) Save the drinking for later, bud. (Lewis) Ohhhhh... backwards-hat brother. That's a hell of a statement, brother. So it's been a little while since I did a speaker video But they are some of my most favorite videos to make, Especially when Ryan is in the house. He's been known to get loose. He's got a few moves... and he's promised me today... that if the speaker sounds good at all, he'll make an appearance on camera and he's gonna show you his newest moves today. He's been working on these for many months. I'm looking at a special speaker, as well. You can tell it does not look like your average Bluetooth speaker. It's from the folks at Bluedio, I've featured their stuff before, I did, uh, pair of headphones with, like, a hundred speakers in 'em, alright, don't hold me to that. They're all about taking an unconventional approach when it comes to audio equipment, audio devices. Three separate drivers. Assuming the middle driver's probably gonna be the low frequency, and then... That's just a guess. It's got a microphone as well. This could be our new speakerphone conference caller. It's also got a carry belt with a carabiner?! This is like a boombox! Bluetooth version 4.1... I need a knife. How does this keep happening? This is Unbox Therapy! There's gotta be knives around! Jeez, man. Pfffft. Ryan, you ready to get loose? Ah, I didn't even nee-! Look! I thought I needed a knife and then thing comes-. Oh, my goodness. What a disaster. This thing looks like a... some kind of... submarine. Hoh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho Hoh-ho Wow. You think Bluetooth speaker and you wouldn't immediately imagine designing something like this, but... Hey, man, more power to ya. Ohhhh. This is the belt-carabiner combo that Ryan will be wearing. Wait 'til you see this guy prancing around. So. I'm gonna kick it off with the power switch right here... (Bluetooth speaker) (Lewis) Ooh! Oh, hello, there. Power on. Pairing mode. Guess who is connected. (Music) I'm gonna hit the 3D button. Let's see what happens. The one thing that definitely happens here is, like, the stereo separation.. ...in the sound, because of the width of it. It looks like a... some kind of a... like it belongs in Star Wars. As a vehicle. People'll be like, \"Whoa, dude, what is that thing?\" and then you hit play and they're like, \"...whoa.\" *More music* It's like Batman. You just start playing this song, it's like the symbol up in the sky. The Batman, he knows that the world needs him. The same thing applies to Ryan! You play this song, he knows the world needs his moves. And there it is. And there it is. Oh, my good-. Look at the improvement! Look at the looseness! Look at the joints! As they swing! With unbelievable lubrication! This is unprecedented. The man needs to be studied by science. So they can better determine... how to completely... kill arthritis. Okay, hold up. This is-. It's serious time now. 'Kay. And it... goes like that. (Ryan) Oh, yeah, okay, so then this goes on the bottom... (Lewis) It's a team effort over here. (Ryan) Oh, dude, it's backwards. Now these ones can attach on the front. (Lewis laughs) (Ryan) That's alright. *laughs* You got it. (Lewis) Wow, this is a statement. Oh, my goodness. (Ryan) Okay, yeah this is tight. (Lewis) Is it? (Lewis) Alright, get your carabiner on, there, brother. These dance moves are comin' to the people! *Laughs* (Ryan) That's strange, how I can hear it, and it's kinda like, \"is that on the 3D setting?\" Gotta love that. Okay... (Lewis) So you-? (Ryan) Ooh... (Lewis) Ah-. Pffft. Is that bass in the right place, Ryan? *Laughs* Now let's try the very front. (Ryan) Okay. How's that bass feel Ryan?! How's that bass feelin'? (Ryan) 'Salright. (Lewis) There it is. (Ryan) Feels like a toolbelt or something... I could-. (Lewis) Toolman Ryan! Alright, Ryan you close it out, I'm outta here, you close it out. Bye, everybody. I was thinking if you could hang it from the ceiling... or maybe a fan? That would be kinda cool. And it just like... goes around the room and it's playing music. I don't know if you have a ceiling fan? Maybe that's dangerous, I'm not sure, it's not really that heavy, though. So I think that would work. That's... That's about it. *Phone call outgoing* Hello? (Other line) Hey, Vin! Hey, it's Ryan, how are you, man? It's goin' pretty good. Yo, uh, can you hear me very well? Oh, okay, it's pretty crisp and clear? Uh, what're you up to tonight? (Hangs up) Okay. *ding* And there you have it! Everything works! *Outro music*",

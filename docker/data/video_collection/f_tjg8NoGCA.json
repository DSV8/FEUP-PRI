    "transcript": "- I'm gonna blow your mind right now. Pretty much every TV manufacturer is ripping you off. They're selling smart TVs that are actually dumb. Ever press a button on the remote, and then it takes forever for anything to actually happen on your screen? The reason is that TV manufacturers cheap out on the CPU that runs all those smart features. These companies actually don't make very much profit on the TVs themselves because they're pretty easy to manufacture. Which means there's tons of competition in the space that keep supply high and prices low. But they gotta cut corner somewhere and they're betting that you are more willing to put up with laggy menus than with bad picture quality. The good news is that a cheap streaming stick will typically give you much better performance. The bad news is you're paying for the same features twice.",

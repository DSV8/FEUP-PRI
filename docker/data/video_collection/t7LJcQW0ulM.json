    "transcript": "(camera shutter sound) - These luscious locks, don't just show up by themselves. My secret: tech news. We already knew that AMD is planning on joining ARM and Intel and using hybrid big dot little design in their processors. And now, a new patent has given us some insight into how team Red's hybrids will handle assigning tasks to either a big, powerful core, or a little, power efficient one. The CPU will have hardware to monitor both memory and processor utilization, both of which will be higher for more intensive tasks, as well as the memory access data rate. If those metrics are high for a particular task, the CPU can pause its first core and then move the task over to a more powerful core or vice versa if the task doesn't require as many resources. It's kind of like what they do with the DMV and I immediately list interest. - (groans) - (groans) DMV. Well, the rumors say we might not see this in action until the Ryzen 8000 lineup arrives in about three years or so. - It's over 8000! Sorry, keep going. - It's the next generation after that. So we have time to get excited again. I mean, hybrids are cool. Terminator, sweet tooth. - The Netflix show, you know about it? - I don't actually. - It's got a deer boy. - Facebook, the company, I trust least to meddle with AI, and I do trust them to least, continues to do so regardless of my wishes. Their latest project is called Text Style Brush. A name that must have also been AI generated. (laughs) - It's just as good as any of the others. - They're just generating AI names for other AI's that generate AI names. They're just going to keep going back and forth forever. This system looks at the way a single word is written or handwritten, and then recreates that same text style, meaning it could be used not only to identify or replicate a hard to find font, but also to duplicate someone's handwriting, a skill that would come in handy to say, I don't know, claim that someone authorized the use of their data when they didn't. - Oh, how could you do that? - Mark! The system works even if the image of the original texts is off center or a little unclear. Although it isn't perfect, the initial results have been impressive to the interns responsible for sourcing more data for the Zucc to vacuum into his gaping maw. - You got a problem, I'm calling a psychologist. - There's only so much you can do for a lizard person. - (laughs) - I mean either he's a lizard person or like an actual robot, in which case him actually being a vacuum cleaner makes sense. If you're still using Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 for your gaming rig, maybe because you've got some legacy titles that run better on those platforms, because he just liked them better. - Reminds me of my childhood. Huh? (laughs) - That's a little sad. Nvidia is going to be pulling the plug on driver support on the 31st of August. The move does make sense from NVIDIA's perspective, as around 93% of gamers are already running windows 10, and continuing to direct resources towards supporting older operating systems is a pretty big waste of time. Unless you're a software preservationist. Not to mention, we're already probably seeing windows 11 next week, so it's probably time to get with the times anyway, right? Teen greens announcement also said that Geforce 600 and 700 series cards will also cease being supported on the same date. - What? - Nvidia, that's just mean, what about my 680 classified? I had a 680 classified and it was a really expensive card and I want to keep it. - Yeah it has a cool font on it. - Yeah and I flashed it with Mac bios and sold it. But soft, what Riley through yonder video breaks! - Now it's time for Quick Bits brought to you by the quick bits of books, Blinkist. It's the app that takes the best insights and important info from thousands of non-fiction books and condenses them into about 15 minute chunks. Read or listen to audio summaries and a wide variety of categories. We're talking in business, finance, parenting, self-help, philosophy.

Everyone can get the seven day free trial and cancel anytime, but the first a hundred people to go to our link: blinkist.com/techlinked, will also get 25% off a full membership. So click the link below to check it out - If you've never tried quick bits, do not do it. They give you a wicked heartburn. Thi&s weekend, flight simulator would be coming to Xbox Series X and S, as well as the Xbox game pass on July 27th, which is sure to please console gamers who have been stuck in customs since the game's PC launch. (both laugh) No word yet on whether Microsoft will offer a hotel room as compensation for Xbox fans being stuck on the tarmac for so long. (both laugh sarcastically) John, these are the worst jokes. Speaking of bad jokes, Amazon's Luna game streaming service will be coming out of early access on June 21st with a seven day free trial. And Amazon is trying to sweeten the pot with a current discount on the Luna controller. It won't be included as part of your regular prime membership fees ala prime video, but it still might be worth forking over the six bucks a month you were spending on your subscribe and save order of that fancy three ply toilet paper. - Only the best for my butt. - I like three ply. On Sunday, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla will start allowing Bitcoin transactions again if Bitcoin mining gets over 50% clean energy utilization. - We're going back and forth here. Snip snap, snip snap! - This is why Bitcoin can't make any progress. People are just like, oh, I'll take it, oh wait, no, whoa, whoa, whoam well maybe a little bit, but no. It's currently estimated the Bitcoin mining gets less than 40% of its energy from renewables. So the 50% target is a little ways off, but perhaps still in sight. Bitcoin's price jumped back up above $40,000, marking nearly 10% increase after the tweet. If only I could make LNG stock go up that easily. I mean, assuming we had stock maybe we should sell stock at LTTstore.com. But right now you're probably just going to be sticking to these awesome shirts. You know how Nvidia its 2060 lineup for a while to help fill the GPU shortage? That appears to be coming to an end, at least to an extent, as Nvidia is reportedly slowing down production of these older cards to crank out more 3000 series cards. Hopefully this will be good news for broad availability, as Nvidia is now limiting mining hash rates on all 3000 GPUs anyway, which might deter miners from continuing to scoop them up in bulk like a scoop of bulk buy profit generating cashews, or something. - Solid analogy. - Yes. - And if you thought the razor toaster was cool, get a lot of what Microsoft has prepping for the 2021 holiday season. They're releasing an X-Box mini-fridge, presumably as a response to many observers saying the Xbox series X actually already looks like one. An over the top trailer claims it uses X-Box velocity cooling architecture, but I just hope it won't give me the red ring of death and I open the door to discover a room temperature bepis. - Oh my God, pepis? - (laughs) That's our show. Come back Wednesday for more tech news, chilled to a refreshing 35 degrees Fahrenheit. - I have no idea, is that below zero? - It's above zero in Fahrenheit. - Yeah, we don't do fahrenheit here. - Yeah, but you know 32 is zero, so 35 is like almost on the edge of, like it's perfectly chilled, you know. - Episode's over.",

    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, how's it going? It's Justine. And today we are testing out the new A7III by Sony. I'm super excited about this because I have been such a huge Sony fan for the past couple of years. I used two cameras in my unboxing setup and that's the A7SII so, I'm excited to get my hands on this thing, and try it out. One of the things that has already noticeably made my life so much better is the increase in the battery sizes. So this is the npfz-100 battery, hold on. As a comparison this is used in the A7SII and the 6500 that I use, and this is the A7III battery this is also used in the A7RIII. In addition to having better battery life, you can also shoot longer because there's now Dual SD card slots. There's an all new menu system and if you guys are huge fans of the play memories app store that is no longer a thing. I used to use that all the time to do time-lapses so there is a small work around that you can use, it's the S&Q setting. You can go in there and you can turn your frame rate down to one. Which in theory will give you a very simple solution to do easy time-lapses. Anyway, I'm in Hawaii. And my sister and I are going to go to the beach and fly some drones. So, let's test this camera and take it with us. And see how it does on it's first trip out in the wild. The other thing, the record button placement is different. It used to be on the side, and now it's kind of in the back and on the middle. So that, I need to get used to. So how many drones should I bring? Just two, you think? - [Sister] Maybe just one drone - Oh, my gosh it's so much heavier. I'm using a 24 to 105 lens. So it is a little bit zoomed in on my face, but I'm so used to my Asus 500 and the really tiny lens. It's like going from this to this, it's heavy. - I was like. - I had to fake open the door for the shot, Jen. - Well, I, - Obviously, don't you now how this works. (playful music) - We were out on a little walk. I was just testing out the 120 frames a second in the S&Q settings. It's pretty awesome because I can just switch from my movie mode back to that again. So it makes it very easy to switch between slow-mo and regular-mo. Regular-mo. How do you feel about regular-mo? - That's my favorite mo. (laughs) (playful music) - Here's the problem, the sun sets on the opposite side of the island. So we're just gonna try to fly our drones really quick. And I'm also gonna test out the time-lapse option on here. I'm using the S&Q feature. And I'll be setting the intervals to one. So, let's see how it looks. (relaxing music) (upbeat music) - We got some really great drone shots. I also took my first photo with this camera of Jenna. Am I allowed to use the photos of you Jenna? - It's gonna have to be Jenna approved. - Jenna approved photos. But man, I'm so excited for this camera. Jen, can you take a few photos of me? We'll test out, we'll test out that low light. (playful music) We are off an a hike today. We're going to Diamond Head. It's one of the most popular hikes. I feel like on this island. I also switched up my microphone a little bit, because the one that I was using before, this Rode microphone. I have a feeling that this got crushed in transit. Because the sound coming out of the first part of this video. It sounded really tinny and canny. So I think something might be wrong with this. I'm so sad. - We're playing a game called can we get there without our GPS. - I hate this game, because yesterday when we played it, we almost didn't make it home. - Yesterday, didn't work out so well. But today I've got, I've got a better feeling about it. This game isn't gonna go well. - Do you want me to map for you? - No, no. We need to figure it out. There's something happens and there's What's that EM? - Apocalypse, EMP? - EMP and we're like oh, God. I got to get to Diamond Head. And then you got to use your brain and. - If there was an EMP, the place that we would be going is not in the middle of a crater. - Why not? - Why would you, why would we go there? - Well where would you go? - I would probably just stay in the house. - Well you're boring. (slow rhythmic music) - So this is Diamond Head. Jen and I did this hike a long time ago. It might have been around, - 2011, 2012? - Ooo, I don't remember. - 2013 actually I think. - 2013, it's been a pretty long time. You could probably look back on each video. I remember somebody saw that I look a picture here and they ran up the mountain to find us and got a picture with us. It was like such a crazy surreal moment. I was like, how did you find us? They're like, you posted a picture. - There you go. - So now we got to go through this tunnel. This is our third attempt to do this hike. The first time that we came here the park actually closes at six o'clock. But they only take the last people in at four-thirty. And then we tried to go the other day, and it was so busy that we couldn't even find a place to park. And there were so many people that I don't think it would have been an enjoyable experience. (slow electronic music) - Oh, that font. Why would you use papyrus. (slow electronic music) I'm having flashbacks to Austria. And we went down that random tunnel. We've got two options to get to the top. We've got this one, which is a little bit windier. And then one that goes straight up. I think we're gonna take the windy one first. Jenna? Lost Jenna already. I remember this is where I shot an ask guy j video. Right here. I had like the camera mounted somewhere on one of these polls. Man, it is extremely bright. Which is not good for filming. and I don't have an ND filter on this camera. The climb. (slow electronic music) So I made it all the way to the top. I was testing out this new other camera. It does a really cool 360 videos. I'll do a video on that later, but this is all about the A7III, and our fun trip to the top here. Wow, it's really beautiful. There's so many people up here now. You definitely have to come do this hike here earlier. Or it gets super crowded. Jenna is freaking out back there. - I don't like crowds. (playful music) - Hawaii is one of my favorite places ever. It's just so beautiful. Every place that you go, it's just stunning, with amazing views. And now we are about to hop on a boat and go out to a sandbar. I also brought, how many drones? We brought four drones - We've got a lot of drones. - Four drones, several cameras. I definitely come way to prepared, with tech and sometimes takes away from the beauty of traveling and experiencing things in real life. But I do really enjoy editing, and then going back and reliving the fun. This is so pretty. Where are we? - (mumbles) - Yep that's where we are. (upbeat music) Okay, ready to take off. Wow it is like a perfect day, but I am so exhausted because we did the Cocoa head, crater hike today and it is like a thousand steps up and a thousand steps down. I posted an Instagram story about it. (upbeat music) - We are going golfing. We are are at a really really beautiful golf course. And the only size shirts that they have are large. I think it'll look good. It's a look, I mean should I go get myself a shirt that fits? No, this is way more fun. - [Man] Unfortunately, like I said that's all we got left - It's all good. - [Man] Alright. - Okay, awesome. Let's go warm up. (upbeat music) - [Woman] This right here is your parking brake you're gonna step on that - Wait now where do I go? - [Woman] You are going to go left - Oh, gosh, okay I think Suzy, you're gonna have to, alright. Okay. - Why do you make me? - Thank you - [Woman] Are you going to go off one, that'd probably be better. - Oh, my gosh. - [Man] Alright have fun out there! - Thank you! Oh, my gosh. I don't - I'm making Justine drive because I've been driving this whole time. - Do I go this way? Do I go down this hole? - Number ten tee, go right. Towards, towards. - Okay, okay I'm flooring it right now. - This camera's heavy. - It is a wonderful day here in Oahu. And what better place to celebrate a wonderful, beautiful day than golfing. If you guys don't know, I am basically a professional golfer. I have golfed probably four times in my entire life. The last time that I set foot on a golf course, I was dressed in a mermaid costume. And it was seven years ago. I'm not proud of it. But man that video was really funny and super embarrassing to watch now. (upbeat music) - Uh oh, wow, where'd it go? - I have no idea. - It might have went in. - How do we know if it went in? - Don't drive on the tee boxes. We've got to find our balls. - Seriously, oh shoot. Well now I gotta do circles. - So I hit the ball, a really wonderful thing. And that's basically the entire point of golf. But then I couldn't find it. So we decided just to move along. What's that All American Rejects song? Move along, move along, move along, just to make it through, move along. That one. Jen is up now. You got this Jenna. Be a champion. Do this for, do it for Tiger. - It didn't go anywhere. Okay. We're next to each other - Trash, that wasn't good. Maybe I just don't like this club. It's just not sized right for my body. (relaxing music) here, here, here, here - Go, go, go get it. Go, go, we need those. Very important. - Ah, move over, get in. (relaxing classical music) - Wow, uh oh. I think I hit a house. - Oh, I already hit a house. (relaxing classical music) - Uh oh. Oh no. Is our cart dead? - What happened? Go it wasn't on. - Oh, we got to get out of here guys. We are done, that's it. I think we have two more holes left. We got to go catch the sunset. (relaxing music) - Well, that was today's sunset. I hope that my drone was working okay, because I just did a firmware update. And for some reason it wasn't letting me focus. I don't know if that's a Mavic air thing, but I'm gonna look into it. For now we're gonna go get some dinner. And that is it for today. I am exhausted and sunburned. - We had some an adventure. - We really did. - We adventured. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "- Oh, wow. Freshly baked tech news. Mm. Just gonna leave that for a second there. - Can I have some of that? - No. No, Riley. Don't touch it. It's too hot. You'll burn yourself, let it cool. - You're too hot. - Wow that's weird. (chuckling) - Anyway, after years of speculation leaks and rumors had started to make us pretty confident Nintendo was going to release a Switch Pro with an upgraded processor that could output 4K video. Well, yesterday Nintendo did announce a new Switch with a bigger OLED screen, extended adjustable quick stand, and a new dock with an ethernet port, but it's got the same CPU and RAM from previous Switch models and... (screeching) Yeah, come on Nintendo. - Seriously wasn't that the Pro? - Yeah. (laughs) - The company also says the design for new Switch's Joy-Cons is completely unchanged. So, it doesn't look like they did anything to address the stick drift problem that they've been sued over by Switch owners. Now, hardcore Splatoon players don't fret yet because the door may still be open for a true Switch Pro. Some analysts point out that between the chip shortage and existing Switch consoles continuing to fly off shelves and tender just doesn't have a ton of incentive to release a new model. Other than, you know, trying to keep us and the fans happy, but they clearly don't care about that. You're going to buy the next tow tracker Redux without thinking anyway. - He's so quaint. - What even is that? - I love quaint things. - Quaint things? - He's cute. - Speaking of entities that like lawsuits, Donald Trump is back in the news after announcing separate lawsuits against Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and each of their CEOs. The goal of the litigation is to end shadow banning, blacklisting, and censorship on social platforms which Trump claims have disproportionately affected conservatives as well as himself. The former president is still banned from a number of social sites, including Twitter and Facebook. After his unsuccessful campaign to convince U.S. courts nationwide that the 2020 election was fraudulent. Most analysts seem to think these new lawsuits will meet similar fates, but hey it's a free country. - Say what you want. - Although, Trump might want to think about asking the new pro Trump social network GETTR to add some censorship. Since it's been overtaken with a bunch of very not safe for work art of Sonic the head what? - You get (indistinct) (laughing) - Little blue guy can really get freaky. - He's got a lot of hobbies. - Wow. That's not where I thought that was going. And current U.S President Joe Biden is planning to issue new executive orders directing the FTC to create new right to repair rules. The right to repair movement has been picking up steam as multiple states across the U.S. have proposed legislation. That'll prevent companies from restricting users options from repairing their own devices and equipment. It's unclear how applicable the laws will be for consumer electronics. Joe Biden only mentioned giving farmers the right to repair their own equipment. A reference to John Deere's restrictive repair policies. But the signs are that unlike the UK's right to repair legislation that doesn't apply to computers and phones. The new FTC rules could force Apple to maintain your warranty even if you take your iPhone to the janky repair shop in the back alley downtown. They're actually super nice there. - Yeah. - Yeah. - They've seen some. (laughs) Now it's time for the quick bits brought to you by Ridge wallet, maker of lights, sleek wallets, designed to fit easily in your front pocket, and add security, and confidence. They even have RFID blocking plates that keep attackers from stealing your information. It's over 30 colors and styles to choose from including Damascus and 18 karat gold, which your current wallet almost certainly doesn't have. - Definitely not. - Save 10% and get free roll by shipping at Ridge wallet by using offer code \"linked\" at ridgewallet.com/linked. - Oh wow. That was a nice bit of tech news there. - What you can have them now? - Yeah, I let them cool. - Whatever. - Do you want a couple of quick bits to Riley? - BS dude. - Well, you are going to get them. It looks like the GPU actually are becoming both affordable and available again. As prices in Germany have hit a six month low. Driven in part by Chinese miners flooding the market with used graphics cards after their country cracked down hard on crypto mining. So listen, if we can all hold off buying right away, the prices should continue to go down, and we can meet on the virtual fields of battle once more, without turning down the game setting so low that we're not sure whether we're looking at each other's avatars or low poly rocks. Can we do it? - To be fair, my avatar is a rock anyways so. - Yeah, to be fair. I also just use low settings to see people better. You know, you gotta go sweaty gamer mode, turn it all the low. (gun shooting sound) See the model's easy, - Who needs grass? - Apples app tracking transparency feature allows iOS users to opt out of being tracked by third-party apps. And not surprisingly about 70% of users did so. Meaning advertisers have now turned their dollars towards Android with ad spending on iOS dropping while ad spending on Android rises. Yay for privacy. But if Google implements a similar restriction, we might be looking at the end of free apps as we know them. Which is so confusing. I thought those app developers were just being nice. - Yeah I just thought it was like Christmas every day. - The Pentagon has canceled its $10 billion contract with Microsoft for cloud services. After years of lobbying by Amazon to choose the shopping giant instead. The defense department now says it will pursue a split contract with multiple cloud providers, including Microsoft and Amazon. Congratulations, Jeffrey you did it. - Yay. (laughs) - Andy Jassy. - Hey, if you print things better update your windows installation. As Microsoft just issued an emergency patch for the PrintNightmare flaw that could allow hackers to take control. What? Control of your machine. It could be kind of your own fault for still trying to print things in the year of our Lord 2021. But I get it you're quirky like that. - It's traditional. - I had to print things to send it to the government the other day, I was really mad about it. And Vivo has patented a smartphone design with a built-in quad rotor drone. Equipped with multiple cameras and infer what? (laughs) An infrared sensors. Seems more like a piece of concept art for a bond movie, but maybe it could start a new trend of physically delivering messages again. Project modernity, embrace carrier pigeons. (laughs) - Like your dad did. - My great great grandfather I guess. - I gotta love pigeon. - Yeah. Love pigeons. - Maybe to much. - So, oh no. Riley, the tech news is getting cold already. Okay, better stick it back in. You can have some on Friday. Anyway, goodbye. Get subscribed. - You're just gesturing in the open air. There's nothing- - No there's an imaginary tech oven here. - Are you okay? - Yes.",

    "transcript": "- Look at this Andy I'm using a touch screen on Mac OS. Monitors are pretty cool. In my opinion, you know, phones, you got phones, but they have really small screens. Monitors on the other hand, they got big old screens big as you want almost, but not all the time thick with two Cs. (Laughter) But the big problem with monitors, is the fact you can't move them around. I mean, you can move them around, but they gotta be plugged into the wall. Most monitors, you can't bring everywhere, but guess what? Guess what, this is? It's a portable monitor. You can drink it because it's called espresso. Espresso. (Laughing) This is a portable monitor. And I mean, as you point, as Jonno pointed out I do have sort of a thing for portable doohickeys. I liked the next doc a lot and that's technically- I'll give it to you Jonno. It's technically a portable monitor with a keyboard and track pad and ports and stuff. It's the espresso, 15 inch portable monitor, this almost like doesn't seem like a device. It just seems like a, like a mock-up or something. So, I picked up the box and I was like, this is heavy, but i now holding in my hands, I'm like for a monitor or even a tablet, this is quite light for its size. That's for the laptop, which we have over here, we got a Mac book that we're going to hook things up to because it works well with Macs? - It has A software for Macs. - It has software for Macs, but not for windows? It seems like it's geared towards Mac. - Yeah. - I mean, it's a monitor, so you should be able to plug it in to anything that has HDMI. But I mean, well who knows, I won't say that yet. I got to try it out. If you use a windows PC, you don't deserve this. Look at this, this is better than you. (Laughter) Wow, it's so thin. Okay so we got, looks like a micro HDMI or mini HDMI some sort of smaller HDMI port two USB-C connectors. And then over here we got a headphone Jack looks like and two buttons of some kind. Speakers on the bottom. Two speaker grills, just like an iPad, one of those USB C's is for power, and the other one is for power and display in I don't know which one is which though because it is not labeled, but hey, that's the fun of short circuit. We'll find out. (Laugh) It's a mini, HDMI not a micro HDMI. We got a USB, a to C cords, I'm guessing that's the power. Windows devices with USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt three or display board, alternate mode. You want to plug the thing into that, so this is the full size HDMI to mini HDMI. So, we also have these two boxes, a stand I'm guessing this is the stand of some kind? Is that the stand? Wait, before I find it before I actually figure it out, I'm going to open this one. What is this? This is a vesa mount adapter. It's magnetic. That goes down, and then you do that. There we go, now we're talking. Okay. So, so it lightly, there's some lights suction here. Magnetic suction, I think is the scientific term. Oh, he's suck. It scares me a little bit, just because the only way that it's mounted on there is with a magnet. It's pretty pretty, huh? Looks like an iMac. look like very wobbly iMac. (Laugh) Look at that. Let's turn it on. Let's plug it into the laptop, but before we do that, sponsor time. Notion is an excellent tool to help you collaborate with a team or work on your own. Notion makes it easy for teams to get more accomplished because you can easily share your work.

So sign up for notion for free, using the link in the description. Let's turn it on. Turn me on, turn me on. Look at this Andy, I'm using touch. I'm, using a touch screen on Mac OS. It wouldn't be that hard for Apple to just throw this in, if espresso can figure it out. I mean, this is pretty nice just to, you know it's nice to have that extra screen real estate and Mac OS, but it's also nice to basically hack away for you to use your fingers, to control Mac OS. (Voice Checking) Well, those speakers are not good. (Laugh) I mean, especially compared to the Mac book speakers like, it's nice that it has speakers, if you like really need, you know if you just need to kind of play something to to hear what the audio sounds like for a, for a hot second, but it's definitely not something that you are gonna uses as your main. - That sounds really bad. - Can you hear that? - Yeah. (Checking Speakers) - Oooff, big oooff Go back to the other one. Oh, that's very better. - Stephanie Warmer. - Yeah. I mean, as it is, it's not horrible, it's just like a little bit warmer than this one. My main complaint is that it's like, dimmer and this is like the max brightness, it can go. But I mean, when you're looking at it straight on, it's not so bad. Oh yeah, this is fine. So I guess the idea is that you can power it and use USB-C for both power and display, if I just do that, it's powered. That's all you need. Look at that. That's basically, I mean, that's a workstation. Okay. So now I got power and HDMI separately from my Mac book. So you could do that if you don't have Thunderbolt on your laptop, let's see if it fits in there. Bam, don't forget this when you're going to the coffee shop. Boom, I'm going to the coffee shop to write my next screenplay while I'm paying for my bills as a barista, at the that same coffee shop and no one's any wiser, then I'm walking around with a dual monitor workstation in this fricking backpack. Like that's amazing. It's not the first portable monitor on the market. Obviously, you know, as we said ASUS has at least one model, there might be more there are also options like the next dock which I've already covered on short circuit and we did an LTT on one of them as well, but that's kind of more like a like a really specific example of something that you would plug like a phone into to you use as your computer. But this, you could use this as just a regular monitor too because it does have the separated power and HDMI ports, as well as an integrated Thunderbolt port. You could use it however you want. And it's so light. Obviously we haven't used it a ton, so like maybe there's some like secret secret problems that I'm not seeing, but for now I'm pretty happy with it. We also hope it gives you a new way to interact with your favorite device, whether that be through your Mac or Nintendo switch. That's another use that i didn't talk about that I did also talk about with the next doc. This is a great little portable Nintendo switch thing. So, the 13 inch version is $329 US, and the 15 inch version is $379 US. You know that's not bad. Oh, there's also specs here that I didn't say at all at the beginning, 60 Hertz, 99% SRGB, 300 nits max brightness. So like, as I said, you know that's not super bright, but it's bright enough. Well, I guess at the end of the day, a portable monitor is a little better than a stationary monitor if you want to go places. And that's really the only conclusion we can draw here. This is super light, it's super portable obviously, it's got this really cool stand. I know the ASUES kind of different stand as well where it was like a pole and it had three legs that kind of made like a tripod situation. James reviewed that one I think. I'm a little concerned about, how the hinges are gonna hold up long term, but overall, I mean it's super easy to mount, boom. And there you go, you got a portable monitor. Anyways, that's the espresso portable monitor. Thanks for watching guys and check it out, If you want if you need a monitor that moves around just as much as you do. Thanks for watching short circuit subscribe to tech linked, - and carpool critics. - and carpool critics. (with commotion)",

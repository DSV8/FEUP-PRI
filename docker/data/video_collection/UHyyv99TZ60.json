    "transcript": "today we're going to do what seems like a stupid comparison between two systems that may cost the same but have wildly different use cases it's going to be kind of like comparing the IKEA chair I'm sitting in to a s_x swing yes they're both technically pieces of furniture which you can use to sit on I guess but it's important to know what the things are useful for so you don't accidentally buy a piece of BDSM equipment for a funeral or a salon [Music] in a recent video I had a look at this absurdly powerful Mini PC which despite being the size of a hand fruit really packs a whole lot of power in it but it did get me thinking how much more power can we get if we build our own system not limited by this tiny footprint so I decided to spec up a system prioritizing gaming performance because that's the only thing I know know how to do on a PC and I adopted the age-old budget gaming PC strategy of cheaping out as much as possible on every other component to maximize my graphics card budget within reason of course but despite really cheaping out on a lot of the components my Graphics Cod budget was still in this weird no man's land where there aren't a lot of new enticing options on the market at the moment but after ages of searching Canada Computers came to the rescue with one hell of a deal on an RX 6600 it was such a good sale in fact it put us quite a bit under budget and considering that I'd already bought all of the other components and getting anything more powerful will cost us quite a lot more money there's going to be a bit of a price disparity between the two systems but now that we have everything that we need let's get to comparison number one which is build effort so to build the Mini PC you just kind of oh that that feel that's not going well okay see the there is a little bit of challenge involved okay there we go that time it worked and just like that we're done whereas getting the custom system up and running is a little bit more involved now considering how I went about choosing all of these components okay so let's sort by lowest oh this is a surprisingly powerful pile of stuff but we'll have a closer look at the components as we get to them in the build ew that is a disgusting in rear IO Shield not only is it not integrated into the motherboard it's not even a gamer color azrock how dare you cheap out on this borderline irrelevant feature in what is the cheapest motherboard I could find on the market garbage now oh that's quite a nice looking motherboard for the price and it's got all the holes you could possibly want a CPU hole a graphics card hole and even an m.2 hole now to cool our ryzen 55500 which I still can't believe costs what it does I'm just going to use the conveniently included wraith stealth cooler which is installation process only requires medium crunches of death Ram wise I got a 16 gig 3200 MHz kit which is 1 DDR less and half the capacity of the ram in the Mini PC but considering the graphics card deal we easily could have gotten a 32 gig kit a yes the well-known M moment mt34 I also bought half the storage capacity but again we could easily have gotten mamore okay so now that we've got our core ready it's time for us to have a look at the case that we're dropping this in which as always is a deep cool case they really have cornered the market in affordable matx cases that don't release flesh eating bacteria into your house I mean that does look spiffy okay so this is a dope feature it's Fe to hang your headphones on and it like hides away so now that we've undressed our awesome little deep cool case let's drop our thermal tech power supply in there 600 WS ooh [Music] fancy o maybe fancy isn't the right word oh that's a lot of cables we're going to have to [Music] hide oh yeah come on ah oh that went deep under my nail oh oh yeah I know that's not great that's cuz of all the smack talking I did earlier who it's crazy how this motherboard manages to make this case look huge and after a bit more screwing in some cable management there was just one thing left to do and now we just have our tiny boxed RX 6600 to drop in here and then we have a pretty beefy gaming system oh that's such a tiny cute version of it we've got some heartbeat action on the back which I'm sure will get the medical professionals in the audience very excited its tiny stature does get me a bit worried about the temperatures though but it's a 6600 not the most power hungry GPU so hopefully it's fine and just like that the slightly more complicated setup process of our custom system is fine finally done oh and I I also still had to install Windows on it but after that it was definitely done now one of the biggest advantages of the blood sacrifice required to put together this system is upgradeability it is super modular therefore super upgradeable and obviously it's going to win against something like this however for what the Mini PC is it's no slouch when it comes to upgradeability you can easily get access to its insides through its bottom and there's a bunch of stuff in there that isn't soldered down so for what it is it's not too bad the rear iio on the little mini PC is absurdly good compared to that of the system down here there's a whole bunch of modern fast connectivity back here and there's even more on this side look at that whereas the rear iio down here would hardly have been impressive 10 years ago having said that we do have a lot more video outs here due to our Graphics cut so we can run four monitors if we want something which would still be possible on the mini PC cuz of all the USBC I guess so me cheaping out on the motherboard really cost this system dearly in this [Music] category who you can easily fit like nine of them in there and still have plenty of room under your [Music] [Applause] TV I mean it it kind of fits H should have bought a smaller [Music] case now we finally got into the category where the custom system can redeem itself cuz I've kind of kneecapped it in a lot of ways so that it can dumpster the Mini PC in gaming performance not all performance though as we'll see soon because the ryzen 7 7840 HS in that Mini PC is no easy prey but let's see to what extent the dumpstering is going to happen a GTA 5 at 1080p normal settings I.E low is happening because of the Mini PC uh but on the full-sized PC we're getting into the stutter Zone here it's running very smoothly at the moment but that is going to happen quite a lot our system is just too powerful for these settings which isn't a problem for the Mini PC with an average of about 120 frames per second in GTA we we get much better 1% lows because of the lack of stuttering and for an igpu that's a lot of frames to be getting at 1080p but the fight becomes much less fair when we crank up the settings oh damn even at 1080p High we're just skirting along the stutter Zone here this is about as high a consistent frame rate as you can get before the game engine starts having seizures whereas with the Mini PC we lose about half our frame rate opening a massive Gap in performance between the two systems Esports be running real well this is 1080p low settings but we're comfortably getting over 200 frames per second it feels really good but it's not like it was running terribly on the mini PC we're getting a surprisingly similar result between the two yeah the gaming system is running better but that's not a Shabby result for our igpu Laden Mini [Music] PC at 1080p low settings with epic draw distance fortnite is running very well like you don't really need more performance than this and it's it just feels great in fortnite the gaming system really stretches its Graphics muscle with double the frame rate we got with the Mini PC but again the Mini PC result is very playable at 1080p on a quick side note temperature- wise the gaming system is doing fine the graphics card tops out at just over 70 cus while gaming and it's as quiet as somebody with a phobia of Confrontation having their place stolen in line whereas the Mini PC actually has lower temperatures than the gaming system which is kind of wild but it's much more audible than the gaming system with a higher pitch wine oh damn at 1080p low settings the RX 6600 is not phased by cyberpunk at all this gives us a lot lot of performance Headroom to crank up the settings cuz cyber Punk doesn't look great at low settings uh but we don't have to play at low settings with this system and it's with these modern visual safari games where the Mini PC really starts drowning needing lifelines like Fidelity FX to get anywhere near playable results at 1080p low settings in fact the gaming system gives us a higher frame rate at 1080p High than the Mini PC on low settings and the story gets even worse with the next game oh yeah I feel like 1080p low settings is a spit in the face of this gaming system it wants more but even at lowly low settings the Mini PC has had enough and you have to crack Fidelity FS all the way up to vaselino Vision to get a playable result on the last of us so the Mini PC may put up a valiant fight in Esports titles but in the land of visual Safari a proper Graphics God is easily still King however when moving over to CPU benchmarks the story very much changes that 7840 HS is a force to be reckoned with easily curb stomping the desktop system and on a final side note because of the lack of encoder on the igpu in the Mini PC you can't use AMD adrenaline screen capture with it which is a real pet peeve of mine and is something to keep in mind and with that what did we learn in today's video well apparently tiny pieces are getting terrifyingly powerful and who knows maybe 10 years from now will'll all be gaming on PC small enough that with enough effort can fit inside your person and with that image until the next one [Music] bye-bye",

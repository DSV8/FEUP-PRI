    "transcript": "What's up baby, I'm back, with another kick ass monitor. This monitor is super cool, has at least three weird things about it that I hadn't really seen too much before. Number one, it's a mini LED monitor, super fancy. Number two, it has a brightness of 1200 nits, that's really bright. And number three, this is one of the first monitors, if not the first monitor, to support Dolby Vision HDR, which is cooler than HDR 10 that you might be used to. This is kind of thing you get when you get a work station monitor that you would use for color critical work. So it just tells you how close to perfect all the different colors are. So this is gonna be a very color accurate monitor. Guess this is the base, what is this? Oh this is a shroud, this is a monitor hood. It's gonna unfold and go on the sides of the monitor so there's less glare and reflection, just helps you to see the picture more easily. ASUS VIP membership warranty thing. Never gonna read that. Wow, this comes with a display calibration tool. I didn't know that, that's pretty cool. This is a ASUS ProArt i1 Display Pro from X-Rite. A generic cardboard box, containing, I guess this could be a shroud to cover the IO on the back. A quick start guide, and a bunch of cables. Looks like the base is assembled, and there's this cable tie on here, which is assume most people aren't gonna get. That's just 'cause I'm special. Okay. Well as long as it still has some stuff to peel, I'm happy. So it has a pretty big, wide base on it, which is nice for stability. This is a nice, elegant stand. It's got this little curvature to it. Little nicer than cooperate, I would call it executive. Okay, and here's the main event, I can already tell this thing is so thick, it's like. I'll tell you why, it's because it's HDRAF. High dynamic range, AF. And a free boat. Argh! It's in. 32 inches. It's pretty big. You can see all these little badges here, basically showing off how awesome that color accuracy is on this puppy. So it's a true 10-bit panel, a lot of panels claim to be 10-bit but what they really are is 8-bit plus FRC, which is Frame Rate Control. It's also says Quantum Dot Technology, which means there's a Quantum Dot film in here, and that gives you really awesome colors and lots of them. And you need all that color accuracy if you wanna have a wide color gamut for awesome HDR. Check out the back. I really like that gold, that looks sharp. Plug for your power cord, a switch just like you find on the back of a PC, power supply, a headphone jack, three HDMI 2.0 B ports, not HDMI 2.1, which would be cool, but a little too futuristic I guess. A single display port port, but it's display port 1.2 instead of 1.4, which is a little disappointing on this monitor, but okay, we can live with that. Then there's two Thunderbolt 3 ports, these type C ports down here and that's so you can pass through a daisy chain through this thing with Thunderbolt 3 which is pretty cool. And then we have three USB type A's over here. The regular kind and a Kensington Lock. Pretty nice looking buttons. The feel isn't great, honestly. You can tell they're all connected, they all move together. When I press one up here you can see these other ones move and then you got a joystick which I always like. And this is a pretty nice glyphs over here too. And of course, designed by ASUS in Taiwan. Obvious Apple rip off. Lot of vents here. See all this? For the air flow, 'cause this thing at 1200 nits, it's gonna have a fat back light. Look how thick this thing is. It's because it has Full Array Local Dimming, which means the back light is behind the screen and blasting light that way. The reason it's cool that it's mini LED is that there's lots of different lighting zones. With LED's that aren't mini, you might only have up to 384 lighting zones on a 16 by 9 monitor, which is pretty normal for a while there, but that means that the lighting zones are all about an inch by an inch, so when you're moving your mouse around you're gonna see a big halo around the mouse, or if text comes up on the screen, it'll have blooming white glow around it instead of being really sharp, but this, with over 1150 lighting zones, it should be small enough to really mitigate that, so we're gonna check that out here. That's a pretty smooth adjustment. Got some pivot. Oh sick. All the way to 90. How about the other way? Both ways, and tilt, and swivel. Wow, that is a far swivel. Holy cow, this is sweet. And look how low it goes too. That is a grade A monitor stand. The things that excite me. All right we're here, we're at 60 hertz, we're at 10-bit color, let's check for the menu. Blue light filter, look at the colors in here. Brightness contrast, saturation, (mumbles), Gamma of 2.2. Uniformity Compensation, interesting. Dolby Vision is great out right now. So this is one of the first monitors with Dolby Vision, which sounds very cool but it's also a red flag because if it's the first, that means you're probably an early adopter, right? So right now, there's only two games that I know about that support Dolby Vision. Those being, Mass Effect: Andromeda and Battlefield. Not only that, you need more than just the monitor and the game to support it. You also need your OS, Windows, and you need your graphics card. It's pretty bright in here so it's kinda hard to evaluate but, I can see some halo's around my mouse but it's really small. It's basically like three millimeters on either side of my cursor that has a little glow, not perfect, we have to wait for a micro LED or have an OLED monitor for that, but not bad. Darkest blacks compared to the brightest brights is quite a range. That neon sign looked totally life like. Look at the light hitting that balloon. That kid's firework over there. Yeah, I can still see different clothing in the shadows. That's awesome how it's kinda blowing out on that bird, and it's so small. It's just on the bird back, pretty sweet showing in games so let's check out some movies. That is max volume. 'Cause there are two, three watt speakers. Man, that light is so awesome. This movie really has awesome lighting, I love how there's just little bits of light just peeking through the shadows, little tiny glints off their armor and helmets, where the rest is in shadow and dark. It's amazing, it's great. It's really good. There's a lot more to say about this, but this is short circuit, so if you wanna learn a lot more about this, watch the LTT video that's gonna be forthcoming. It should be great, it's four thousand US dollars. This is a piece of equipment for professionals, it's not just for me to watch dragon movies in HDR. So, if you wanna see a deep dive, hit us up on our other channel. Thanks for watching Short Circuit today, I hope you like this video and if you did, go to subscribe, hit us up with a thumbs up and also, a comment 'cause we like to hear from you. See you later.",

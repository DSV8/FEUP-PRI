    "transcript": "(loud bang) - Ooh! (upbeat music) - [Justine] Hey you know what's in here? - [Emi] No, but I can read. - These are the brand new Throwboy Pillows. This is the 10th anniversary. Throwboy has been making Pillows for ten years! I've known Roberto for a really, really long time, I remember I got inside of his suitcase, that he had, he was giving Pillows away on the street in Austin, Texas, at South by Southwest and I said \"I bet I could fit in that suitcase.\" And guess what I did. - You fit in the suitcase. - I fit in the suitcase - That sounds like a very Justine thing to do. I remember that Subscribe Pillow from like - Forever - How many places ago that you used to live? - You guys remember the red Subscribe Pillow, the yellow Subscribe Pillow. - Yellow Subscribe. - All of the Pillows! - But today, we're unboxing the brand new ones that he has there is a Kickstarter for a few more days. He met his Kickstarter goal within like hours. Which is incredible. - Oh yeah, well be careful. - It's all very good, I'll not cut the Pillows. Oh my god, they're so cool! Oh wow! Oh I'm freaking out! - How can you even see, you're so short? - 'Cause I can see! - Oh, they look pretty cool. - Okay, take this first one out! - Oh my goodness! - The first iPod, let me go get the first iPod. - Because they're very sharp. - Emi, where's my first iPod? You took it. - Why would I take you're first iPod? What would I do with a first iPod? - First iPod, this isn't my first iPod. My original one is still at home at my parent's house and it is-- It's at home, so I clearly don't have it here. - [Emi] I don't think it works either. - [Justine] That looks really good. This one does though, look at that. - [Emi] Got any tunes on there? - There's a lot of Adele. - [Emi] Hey first iPod, play Adele. - It doesn't, it doesn't work that way. - Maybe in the next update. (laughing) - I wonder when they stopped supporting this? I'm not really sure, but-- - There's more things in here! - There's more things, okay, first iPod-- - Show them the back. - Oh! It's squishy! - Oh! - It's got his little logo-- - Yeah to match, like, how this has, like the - Apple logo. - Apple logo. - Oh my goodness, okay. - This has the logo. - Next! - Okay next up! - Close your eyes! Mysterious! - It's gonna be the 1984 Mac. (upbeat music) It is not the 1984 Mac, this is the 1977 Mac! That's a long time ago. - How, wait, when? - 1977. - You weren't here. - I wasn't here. - I wasn't here. - We weren't here. - Our parents were young. - They were little. - They were little. - Wow whee, that's crazy. - Wow whee-- Let's give it a test, how's it type? - Okay, text. Oh, maybe the next MacBook's keyboard will sound like this. - Oh jokes, she's got 'em. (laughs) - (mumbles) was here. - I always type Justine was here. I swear to you because I have a video where I even say what I was typing, and that was what I type. - Isn't it nice, silent! - Wow, these are so cool. - Put you're head on it. Rest and go seep. - Oh, I'm so tired. I'm a sandwich! I'm a Mac sandwich! Okay, next, what do we have, what do we have? - Oh! There's three more. - Oh, shook! (laughs) - Ah! (silence) - I'll get that. - This is the original iPhone. Let me go get that. - Where's my original iPhone? - [Justine] (mumbles) Justine. - I never had that because I was too young to have a phone. - [Justine] Do you remember when I got my first iPhone? - No, I don't think I talked to you. Hey Siri, when did the original iPhone come out? - [Justine] 2007. - [Siri] A visit to apple.com shows-- - Oh, wait, 2007. No I had a phone. I was like 17. - Original iPhone. - Here let's make it that same size. - Wait, I should hold it this way, there we go, okay. Perspective. - Oh, now let's make it-- Oh, look I'm a Pillow! - You are a Pillow! - I'm the original iPhone, hello! - Hello - Hey Siri. Yes? (laughs) How can I help you? - Next Pillow. - [Siri] I work with HomeKit by asking, \"Hey Siri\" (laughing) - Ow, something popped. - What if, Siri is saying \"Hey Siri\" why is she not triggering the other Siri? - [Siri] I can't say the answer to that. - Oh. Oh, this is the 1984 Mac. - Ooh. - The crazy thing is I sort of have all of this stuff in my house right now. I just did an unboxing of the Apple IIc, which is not quite this one. The Apple IIc came out around 1984, around the same time as this little guy. This is the original, original thing. This is it, 1984, baby. Still wasn't here. The year of my birth, I wasn't here, I wasn't here Of my birth, I wasn't here, And if you even say I wasn't even a thought that I'm as old as-- - Your mom. - Your mom. - Or your dad. - Dad. - Or your someone. - I'm gonna block you! I'm just kidding, I'm not. - You're gonna get thumbs up! - I'm not. - Say, \"Wow, you're as old as my grandma!\" Okay, next! - What? - Okay next, next, next! - Hut hut! - Oh my goodness! - I remember this one! - Yes we had-- So my grandmother she had a green iMac if you recall. - You had blue right? - I had the G4, it was the tower. We had the eMac, I think it was eMac. Do you remember that? It was the white-- - Yes, I do remember that one. - Yeah, and then we had also the iMac, one of the ones with the swivel screen, god that design was incredible. - I do remember swivel screens! - Yes, swivel screen. It's kind of crazy just to be sitting here and looking at some of the most incredible products that Apple has really ever created. And each one of these kind of defines the generation of Apple of where things sort of like took an incredible turn. I mean this is like, the first graphical user interface. We've got our first iPhone, which basically changed the way that we use our phones! - Yeah like smartphones, mobile phones. - The iPod, this completely revolutionized music, the way that we listen to it, the way that we bought it, the way we-- It changed everything! - It did, remember you had to buy individual songs, that got expensive. - Well that, well they just now recently, now you can't really purchase music on Apple, so that also is another thing that has changed. Now you can only stream it. This also changed everything because at this point this is where everything sort of pivoted for Apple. They sort of like were, I'm trying to think of a song. Oh it's upside down. (laughing) - Hello? (laughing) I don't answer the phone! - Do you remember-- - Not long ago, no. - No, the original, it was the Marimba. - Oh. - The phone ... - The Marimba. - The ring, the Marimba ring? - I, oh. - We did so many googles just for Marimba 'cause she didn't think that it was like basically the same thing as the xylophone. - When did we fight about this? This is a long time ago. - The Marimba! I think the Marimba is wooden. - Marimba. - I think that was the difference. Should we look it up again because now I don't remember. - Hey, what's a Marimba? - [Siri] The Marimba is a percussion instrument consisting of a set of wooden bars struck with mallets called knobs to produce musical tones. - I used to have the Rick Ross grunt-- - You did! as my alert, for like four years. - Weird. - No way! I'd get a text it's like (grunts) (grunting) I'm putting it back, Rick Ross grunt. I'm coming back for you. (loud Marimba ringtone) I'm shook to my core. - It gives me such a panicked feeling. There is something about talking on the phone that just makes me want to just puke. (loud Marimba ringtone) Its vomit-- - Stop playing it! - It's vomit inducing. - Vomit inducing. (laughs) (loud Marimba ringtone) - Stop! (vomiting noises) (loud digital ringtone) - Ow, it's so loud! (cricket ringtone) - That is terrible. (Marimba ringtone) And you thought Rick Ross grunt was bad? (old car horn ringtone) (old phone ringtone) - Alarm. (alarm ringtone) - Oh. (ascending ringtone) (bark ringtone) (bell tower ringtone) (blues ringtone) (harp ringtone) Oh it's beautiful. - (mumbles) looked at the doorbell. (sci-fi ringtone) (sonar ringtone) - Why is that not my ringtone? That's super spooky. (Timba ringtone) - Okay well we need to end this video. (trill ringtone) - We do we gotta go. - The xylophone! There's a xylophone and a Marimba! (xylophone ringtone) - I just want to hit you with this. - No you know I don't like Pillow fights. - Why would I know that? - I don't know! Thank you so much for watching! A huge thank you and congratulations to Roberto at Throwboy. You guys have seen these Pillows, even if you didn't know what they were. I love that he has created such an iconic thing for our generation. I mean it's kind of crazy to think because everybody has them. Like every YouTuber has one of these Pillows or has seen them or has heard of them. And you guys have seen them or heard of them and you didn't even know it, until now, unless you did know it. I'll put a link in the description if you guys want to check out the Kickstarter there's only a few more days left. I backed it the first day 'cause I was like, \"Yes sir!\" - It's so soft. - It's really soft. - It's like very velvety. - I'm so excited because I'm re-doing my office and stuff too, so this is gonna look so good. I also have a 1984 Mac, but I haven't unboxed it yet, I should have brought out the IIc, but it's in the box and I don't want to open it. - You can \"C\" it later. - \"C\", yourself out. - I'm just trying to. (laughing) - I'll see you guys later! A huge thank you to Roberto again, you're amazing, and thank you and congrats, and I'll see you guys in my next video! - She'll \"C\" you later! - \"C\" you later, bye-bye! - Bye! - These are so cool. - I gotta charge my phone. Plug it in. - Here you go. - [Emi] Actually no, that's the wrong cord! - It's the wrong cord. But we can get a dongle. - But you have a dongle? - Love jokes. Same brain. Well but I'm going this way. - Okay. (laughing) - [Emi] Okay. - [Justine] Okay. - [Emi] Okay. - [Justine] Okay. - You're not (mumbles) - You're not (mumbles) (upbeat guitar music)",

    "transcript": "- [Announcer] Previously on Krazy Ken's Tech Misadventures. And now, our feature presentation. - [Ken] It doesn't do anything, Maniac Mike. (laughs) It's just a placebo effect, it's not any faster. (laughs) - [Mike] There, there. - [Ken] And I'm guessing you can drag it around, yeah. Oh (beep), you can just drag this anywhere? (laughing) (slow beeping) (keyboard clicking) (upbeat electronic music) - [Mike] Well, I guess I should log into you. - [Ken] Yeah, let's log into Ken with my super secret password. (futuristic beeping) Oh, now it stars it out, of course. Yeah, it's actually a little more secure that way. Alright, let's click the little house button, little transition there. And, Workspace Manager, the Finder was not a thing of yet, or at least in OS X, and yeah, this was it, and it's kind of interesting to see the platinum-esque UI with opaque window movement. I've noticed that, that's really interesting, 'cause usually it's a wire frame. That was one thing NeXTSTEP was doing like, forever ago. Cool, okay, so yeah, no Finder, Workspace Manager, looking good. Let's take a look at our Apple menu here. So we have some apps, the About screen, User Preferences, Computer Settings, Server Administration, Recent Apps, Documents, and Mac OS, and Configure Menu. So Mac OS, is that-- - I believe that would, - Classic? - [Mike] that's probably Classic. - Blue box style, yeah. - Let's see what it is. - [Ken] Oh yeah, that's exactly what it's doing. - [Mike] That's Classic. - [Ken] Hopefully this isn't modal, good! So here's the Home folder, so we have Ken and Mike, and we have Applications, Library, Mailboxes, that's about it. On the system, we have Demos, demos are fun, so we have AppOpener, BoinkOut, oh my gosh, we have things. Calculator, let's have some fun with this. Or not. (laughs) - [Mike] It's loading, give it some time. (Ken exhales raspily) (Mike laughs) (Ken laughs) - [Ken] It was paying respec, oh (beep). Oh, okay! - And we're in Classic! - [Ken] Yeah, there we go. Can we, like, tab out of that? No, not yet, so, so essentially, we're running, like, two operating systems at once and, oh, it's got that wallpaper on it. - [Mike] I think it knows what kind of system it's running on. - [Ken] Oh, yeah, that makes sense. That does match the whole G3 look. - Yeah, Mac OS X. - Oh shit, yeah. - [Mike] And Mac OS Setup Assistant. - [Ken] Okay, and get QuickTime Pro, alright, they're already advertising. Firmly grasp it in your hand. (Mike laughs) Firmly grasp it! (sighs) Sorry about this calendar. So it looks like in the App Switcher here, we can switch between the apps in the Classic environment but we could also go back to Mac OS X. Oh, crap, that's awesome, I never really paid attention to that. So now we have the OS X apps. Hide Active App Name, what? Oh, in the corner there, okay, that's pretty sweet. And then Show Processes, like an activity viewer sort of thing? Oh, okay, it's running. - [Mike] It looks like it's a precursor to the Force Quit menu in OS X. - Yeah. Yeah, 'cause it gives us, like, a Force Quit option, so, well, that's cool. - Well then I, well, wonder what happens, Command + Option + Escape. - [Ken] Command + Option + Escape. - Or I guess they-- - Oh, yeah, must predate that. Okay, so we have the Hide Options like in Classic. Can you still pull this off? Yeah, you can, look at that! Now that I know you could do in Classic, like, I think even in System 7, that's one thing you could peel off, was the App Switcher there, and you can just kinda dock it. Oh, maybe you can't, maybe you gotta close it. Alright, there we go. So this is kinda like a, I don't know if it's technically a virtual machine, but it does feel a lot like a virtual machine, wouldn't you say? - [Mike] Yeah. I mean, it pretty much works similar to the Classic environment in OS X, all the way through Tiger. - [Ken] Yeah, but the interesting thing though, later, was you can just run the Classic apps, like, in the OS X desktop, you didn't actually have to switch between two desktops. So that was, like, the only really big difference. - So I guess you could say this is kinda like if you were running Parallels or VMware in full screen. - [Ken] Yeah, it kind of is like that. Shut Down, and it should just close out of this and bring us back to OS X, frickin' awesome. What do you say we just bounce around inside of here for a while? If I even know what I'm doing. A fun thing I like to do with older software is I like to see the About screens and see, like, who's in the credits and stuff like that, 'cause sometimes there's some history in there. So, let's see if we can find what the fricky frack I actually wanna do. (Ken laughs) - Well, we do wanna go to the About screen, so Apple menu, of course, probably, (Ken laughs) good place to start. (laughs) - Well yeah, I mean, thank you, I was actually looking for the Apps folder, but you just reminded me we can just get to the apps from here, so, genius thinking. Good thinking, 99. So the Workspace Manager, we have Grant, that gentleman we talked about earlier. Human Interface, yep, Visual Design. Oh, there's Bertrand, Bertrand Serlet, who worked at Apple and NeXT. Isn't he at like, Parallels now, speaking of virtual machines? - Yeah, I think he's, I think he's at Parallels now. - [Ken] I think he went to Parallels, unless that changed, but it's cool seeing some of those names, like way back then, actually be current still. So, yeah, let's see what else we got here. We got Terminal, who am I, I'm Ken. See, I told ya. (Mike laughs) Let's see, let's go to the User Preferences, go to Appearance, and-- - [Mike] What kinda fun, what kinda themes do we have? - I have a feeling. - I believe it's pretty much everything that's standard from like, OS 8, you would think. - [Ken] Well, I think so, but I think you could actually change, like, individual colors of items, kinda like you could in Windows 1.0. (laughs) You could, like, choose all these things. - You can still kinda do that if you select the Classic theme on Windows XP, for example. - Oh, yeah? - [Mike] And even Windows Vista, 'cause it still had Classic, and I guess 7 at the same time? - [Ken] So I don't know if then that applies to new things you gotta open up, and then everything's black, I don't know what I just did, I changed the window frame, so. - [Mike] I guess you have to apply first? - [Ken] I thought I hit Apply. Oh (beep). (Mike laughs) Oh, dude, dark mode, Mojave! This is just catchin' up, like, this already had it in there, (beep) you, Mojave. You can turn all this stuff black, it's like, okay, so Window Titlebar Text we can now make white, oh, so you gotta hit Apply there, and then apply here. - Yes. - Oh, nice, dude, this is like Mojave, shit. Oh, what? Apple NeXTish, (laughs) what? I never thought about, now, does that apply to everything? - [Mike] Yep. - [Ken] Oh, yeah. Alright, I wanna see what this looks like. Okay, oh, wow. Okay, so, Apple platinum Dark Gray. Okay, so that's kinda similar. Apple Desert, oh, nice. Apple platinum Emerald. - Oh! - Oh, green, here, we got some green. Apple Blue, bricks, okay. - [Mike] Oh, I see type of, no, wait. - [Ken] No, hmm. Alright, that's not working, let's try Crinkle. Okay, so maybe this feature hasn't been worked out yet. - [Mike] But wait, if you set it back to color. - [Ken] Yeah, and then change the colors, try this? - [Mike] Can you change the color of the desktop? No, you cannot. - [Ken] Oh my gosh, that part must not have been worked out yet. Well, enjoy the beautiful blue. (laughs) - [Mike] Purple. Blue purple-ish type of color. - Blue purple-ish thing. Fair enough, fonts, Helvetica's cool. Oh shit, we can use the stupid scroll bars or the smart scroll bars. Snap thumb to original position. Ooh, menu blinking, yeah, they still have the menu blinking. They got rid of that, though, it just blinks once now and goes away. Let's see, grabbing the edge of the window will move. Shit, that's another thing they got rid of in the final thing, and they didn't bring that back until Lion. Or you could resize, new settings will not be available to currently running applications until they have quit. Oh, okay, well, I think we all understand how that works. Wait a minute. (gasps) Wait, what, you probably gotta use a new app. - Yeah, you're gonna-- - Yeah, let's go to TextEdit. So if you minimize, this should go down to the bottom of the screen kinda like Windows. Oh no, that's actually more like NeXTSTEP, how it made those little tiles. - [Mike] Yeah. - [Ken] Yeah, okay, that's cool. - [Mike] I mean, I believe they did kind of have, like, a similar thing going for them even in Developer Preview 3 when they introduced Aqua and the Dock. - Yeah, it would like minimize over to the, actually, you could probably minimize down here by default but then you can just drag it and put it anywhere, I think. - [Mike] You wanna see if we can drag it around? - [Ken] Oh, in this version, I mean, yeah, let's, I need to turn up the mouse speed. Oh my gosh, this is like really slow. Mouse, alright, hang on a sec, let's crank this shit up. Zoom, is it even any faster? It doesn't do anything, Maniac Mike. (laughs) It's just a placebo effect, it's not any faster. (laughs) - [Mike] There, there. Okay, let's go back to - Things will get better with time. (Ken laughs) - [Ken] Yes, they will, won't they? Alright, so yeah, you should be able to minimize this, and I'm guessing you can drag it around. Yeah, oh (beep), you can just drag this anywhere. (laughing) You just, just put it right there, who cares, right? And then it goes right back there, look at that, alright. Cool, alright, lotta cool things we're discovering here, that's pretty awesome. The Services menu is a thing that did stick in the final version of OS X, we still have that today, but it's under the App menu which is up here in the corner. Not in this version, but in the final version. Okay, so, I gotta see where those other ap-pi-cations are hiding, I know they're in here. Hm, System Applications, there they are. Yeah, that's what I was lookin' for, and then Demos. Let's play BoinkOut. - [Mike] Oh, that icon doesn't look scary at all. Holy shit, we got an eyeball. (laughs) - [Ken] Okay, boink, boink, boink, boink, boink, boink, boink, (beep). Do we have like, sound, on this system at all? I didn't see any sound settings. - [Mike] I don't know if we do or not. - [Ken] Yeah, that's a good question. So, let's just take a look. Computer Settings, Disk Mounting, Monitor, Network, Date, Time, User, (mumbles) yeah, I see nothing for sound. Looks like you can change your, oh there's our icon view and our list view, and then here's, like, our column view, yeah, I always use icon view though. Oh, okay, the marquee selection has a little bit of a bug. Okay, so IconBuilder, I think that's still a thing in the Developer Tools, or maybe it's all grouped under Xcode now, but I remember that was a thing at one time. - [Mike] I'm not even gonna look it up, because I believe it's under Xcode. - [Ken] Yeah, it could be. - [Mike] Like, if it's any kind of developer tool that's by Apple, it's under Xcode now. - [Ken] (laughs) So, let's generate a mandelbrot. There we go, that's like, the mathematical favorite benchmark thing. The Valley of Fear. This is math, ladies and gentlemen, this is math visualized. - [Mike] I feel smarter already. - [Ken] (laughs) FreeSpace, this is a screensaver thing? - Run it. - [Ken] Beautiful. (laughs) I mean-- - Marvelous black screen. - [Ken] I mean, it kind of looks like it's a screensaver here. That part must not have been worked out yet. (laughs) Hm, the Black one might work. Hey, it worked! - It really does! - [Ken] (laughs) Hey, Yum, I had no idea that even, oh, hey, (laughs) (Mike laughs) look at this little, what? These little guys just spinnin' around. Look at that screensaver, yeah, I don't think that made it into the final (gasps) it's goin' the other way now. (Mike laughs) It's movin', shit. Oh, it's spreading out! - I guess you could-- - [Ken] They're gonna summon something, go ahead. - [Mike] I guess you could put this to the tune of that one iMac G3 commercial when they introduced new colors. - [Ken] Oh yeah, you could. Well good, I had a pentagram, like a summoning circle going through my head, and you had a computer commercial, I love how our brains are (laughs) how they, everybody's different. (laughs) - [Mike] Then again, that commercial is pretty much a pentagram. - [Ken] It is actually very pentagrammy. Okay, so that screensaver worked, Spotlight. Nice, and now-- - Well some of them work, some of it doesn't. - Yeah. I don't think they actually had multi-monitor support in this system. But yeah, Hot Corners, this must have been when they first did the Hot Corner stuff, 'cause now you have that with like, Mission Control and Expose and all that stuff, but maybe this is where it first came from. Ooh, a frame rate meter, shit, can you run that? Oh, oh, wait. (laughs) (Mike laughs) - [Mike] Let's choose a screensaver that'll actually do that. - Good point, good point. - [Mike] Put it back to Yum-- - [Ken] Yum, and then turn on the frame rate thing. - Turn on the frame rate. - [Ken] Yeah, okay, and then it will show it. Or, oh, hey! - There it is. - Oh, that's not very numerical, but, (laughs) - It's something. - (laughs) it's something. I can't tell if that's a good score or a bad score. Oh, whatever. Oh shit, I saw some lag there. - Oh, I can kinda see. - [Ken] I can see some laggy lag. - [Mike] I can kind of see how it's workin' there, because it's like, if it's all the way in the red, it's like, holy crap, the frames are so fast and then it's just going down, it's just like, ah, this is slow. - [Ken] Yeah, that makes sense. It's like, performing worse with the meter turned on. (laughs) (Mike laughs) We're skewing the experiment here, cool, okay. Well let's see what else is hiding inside of this bitch. - [Mike] Um, Chess? - [Ken] This now, we all, well, I shouldn't say we all know, 'cause that was a bad assumption, this made, was actually, made it into the final system. It's still there today. I want to see if there's, like, skill levels. Oh, 2 Dimensional. - Actually, speaking of Carbon, I-- - Oh (beep)! - Oh my. - I had no idea this was in here, anyway, go ahead, sorry. (laughs) Didn't mean to-- - I just realized, in the Applications folder, there is a folder for Carbon. - [Ken] So hypothetically, this would be an application that could run in OS 8, 6, and OS X at the same time. Oh yeah, you can kinda tell, this has, oh yeah, it's even wireframed. Well that's, yeah, that must be very-- - [Mike] 'Cause even then, Carbonized apps in OS X, like, for example, AppleWorks 6, is wireframed. - [Ken] Oh, they were, okay. Yeah, I haven't experimented with that too much because when I was a, like, the Mac, when it became my daily driver, was in the Tiger days, so it was like, way after the whole Carbon thing. - [Mike] Oh, I still played around with that even in elementary school when we had eMacs. - [Ken] Oh, I regret recycling my eMac. - There, there. (Ken laughs) Like, every fun stuff I bring up, he recycled. - [Ken] (laughs) I know, what is wrong with me? Fetch, oh (beep), (laughs) oh, Fetch Shortcuts. Oh, okay, so that's a thing, it looks like it's for connecting, though. - [Mike] It looks like it's some kind of FTP connection. - [Ken] Yeah, and it's New Connec-ti-on-nah, it's got an umlaut in there, - Yeah, 'cause you could go host, you could type in a host name and then your username and password that's on that server. - [Ken] Mm, that makes sense. Back to Chess, 'cause I actually understand what that is. (laughs) Hey, we have the GNU Chess license, an Apple front-end for GNU Chess, is it still, like, a GNU program just with, I'll have to look that up later, that's interesting. He's got a newer MacBook Pro which will have, like, the latest version of Chess on it, I just wonder if there's like a GNU license in there. I really suck at Chess, but let's do it. Ah, people are going to be like, oh (beep), that doesn't make this easy. (laughs) Little bit of a graphical problem. Okay, so he moved his knight, again, I really suck at this game, so, don't really know what I'm doing. - [Mike] You havin' fun there? - No. (Mike laughs) Oh, (beep), I didn't even pay attention to his bishop, well, now I got your bishop, you (beep)er. - [Mike] I don't see anything for GNU Chess-- - [Ken] It says GNU general public license right there. - [Mike] Well it is a GNU license and there's a button for the source code. - [Ken] Oh yeah, shit! - [Mike] Although I can't do anything now because I'm not on Wi-Fi at the moment. - [Ken] That's okay, man, that's a beautiful screen, I'm just like, looking at his MacBook Pro screen now after looking at this HP thing, and it's like, damn! (laughs) - [Mike] Actually, side by side comparison with-- - [Ken] Oh yeah, do it. - Here you go. - Oh, thanks. Shit, this is light. (Mike laughs) This is it on Mojave, and there it is on OS X Developer Preview 1. Alright, so I opened up an app called Sketch, let's see what's behind this bad boy. About Sketch, Sketch, this is the Java version of Sketch. Well, that makes sense, so let's see. We got a line, that's a good start, we got two Xs here, can I do a curve, probably not, let's see, I need a, that's a mouse selection, I have no idea what I'm doing, that's a text tool, - That's a text box. - [Ken] I figured as much, how do I do a curve? - [Mike] Like I know the answer to that. (Ken laughs) Unless it's like, you can somehow get it to, to where you can create anchors? - [Ken] Yeah, we'll just, there you go, we cheated. (Mike laughs) Let's see. (laughs) - [Mike] It's just like, very, very Java-y version of Illustrator. - [Ken] (laughs) Yeah, yeah, I don't see, like, a way to add bezier handles or anything, but we can, however, change the line width, but not anymore, it's grayed out. Okay, screw that, yeah, there we go. Worked like a charm. There's our, before we had sheets, that was our close panel, our save panel, more rather. Man, that is still like, the freakiest icon, like, ever, holy cow. - [Mike] There was one app that came to mind with that eyeball, Grab. - [Ken] Oh shit, yeah, let's do that. - [Mike] I know I saw Grab in there, there it is. - [Ken] So we must have a moment of silence for Grab officially not being continued anymore, in Mojave, they got rid of it. It's just called Screenshot now. It has a lot more features, but, yeah, it's not called Grab anymore. However, fun fact, if you type Grab into Spotlight, it still directs you to the Screenshot app for those who are using the more nostalgic name. So yeah, let's do-- - Let's do Selection. - Yeah, Timed, oh, okay, we can do Selection. - Oh, yep, there's the camera. - [Ken] Yeah, there's the old camera which lasted for a long time, like in newer versions of Mac OS they'd have that old-ass icon in there, holy shit. Oh, that eyeball, yeah, that's what you were talking about. (laughs) - [Mike] Yeah, didn't they carry that over from NeXTSTEP into-- - I think they did. - Mac OS X. - I think they did. - [Mike] I think you mentioned that in some kind of video. - [Ken] I, yes, and if you guys want to check it out, look right there. So let's do a screenshot, there it is. That doesn't look like, is that the part I actually grabbed, what? - Let's try that again. - Let's try that again, I feel like something didn't work there. Alright, let's do Selection, and I'm gonna drag this upper portion. - [Mike] And it got the lower portion. - Yeah, it. (laughs) - [Mike] 'Cause I saw, 'cause like, you went from here to here and then it captured down here. - [Ken] (laughs) Yeah, I don't know what's happening. - [Mike] Well, that's another bug. - [Ken] Yeah, couple bugs, let's do Timed Screen. Start Timer. Well that looked like it worked, yeah, there we go. - [Mike] If we full-screen it, or maximize it, I should say, yeah, looks like it worked. - [Ken] Or zoom it. (laughs) Yeah, cool. So in the Developer folder, I came across, Applications, that's what I meant, Developer, Applications, this is InterfaceBuilder, which was introduced with NeXTSTEP where you could just build object-oriented programming and interfaces with dragging controls out and stuff, it was, like, super intuitive, and there's also ProjectBuilder, which, I believe, this became Xcode, - Yeah, both, - eventually. - [Mike] both became Xcode, InterfaceBuilder was a separate app that was in Xcode, but then it's just all in one. - [Ken] Yeah, they merged it. Oh, and here's, I was talkin' about this earlier, the Yellow Box, which got named Cocoa, this was the documentation for that. So yeah, this was ProjectBuilder, let's have a look. Oh, I just made a new thing, I meant to go to, yeah, let's abort that for a sec. About ProjectBuilder, yep, and huh. - Look at all of this fine people (Ken laughs) who have made-- - They made good shit. - Yeah. - New, name. (Ken laughs) - App. - [Ken] My, the M key's not workin' again! Mike, press it. (key clicks) You, what the (beep), how come when he presses the M key it works-- - [Mike] Here's the thing, you have to jam it first. (key clicking) - Oh, okay. (Mike laughs) My great app. (laughs) (Mike laughs) Okay, so we can make an application, oh, Carbon Application, Aggregate, that's probably a dev thing, I know-- - Wait, how do we, okay, yeah-- - Oh, sorry, what? (laughs) - [Mike] Well, thankfully, ya screwed up on that, so hopefully it'll take us back, no? Okay. - Nope, we gotta go back to the New-- - Go New-- - [Ken] Go ahead, what were you going to say? - [Mike] So, for our project types, we have many different project types that we have here, so, god knows what Aggregate is, but we have Application, which I'm guessing is a Cocoa application, - Or Yellow Box, yeah. - and we have Carbon. - [Ken] Now, click on Aggregate, 'cause it'll tell us what it is. A collection of loosely-related subprojects whose build is under the control of a common project. Alright, mystery solved, go back to Application. (Mike laughs) (key clicks) - My (laughs) (Ken laughs) great application, and we'll save that into-- - [Mike] Apple-ca-tin. - [Ken] Apple, my great app. (Mike laughs) We'll save it to Applications, hit OK, is inval, what the-- - So I guess you, - Oh, wait, it contains-- - A space? - [Ken] It contains an in, oh. Okay, hang on, I see what it's doin', my_great_app. - Gret app, there we, - (beep), why can't I type (Mike laughs) on this keyboard? (laughs) Okay, there's going to be a typo, whatever. So here's my great application, this is how I build stuff. Do I know how to use this, no I don't. Interfaces, English, my_gret_app.nib. If I open this up, it'll likely open InterfaceBuilder, and I can design my application's interface. So I have all these controls, let's hide these other apps, and I can use this to build somethin', so I can say like, drag in a slider, drag in a text box, Control + Click and wire this shit together and be like, hey, what do I want it to do? I want it to do a thing. I didn't really think about this part. (Ken laughs) - Oh, wait, I just realized somethin', we're so far into this, but now I realize the codename. - Codename? - Yeah. - [Ken] For what? - [Mike] Well, if you'll look down here, it's Rhapsody. - [Ken] Holy (beep), I didn't even notice that. It still says Rhapsody, that's interesting. I want to see if I can actually get this to work, so let's wire these things together, Control + Click and drag, and do Attributes, so we'd say, and this is like an integer, zero to 100, start at 10, I don't know how we, like, hit Apply, but maybe it just does it. So let's see, now we just gotta, how do we compile this. - [Mike] You would have to go back-- - [Ken] Back to the, oh, okay, yeah. - [Mike] So you would have to save whatever you have in there, and then go back into-- - Project Manager. - Project Manager, or Builder, I should say. - Oh, Builder, sorry, Project Manager is-- - [Mike] And then from there, you can click the hammer, which I believe is Build, which compiles and runs. And I believe you hit it again, I think, yes. - [Ken] If this works, I will do nothing, I'm just going to be happy that it works. - [Mike] Build succeeded. - [Ken] Okay, so then I do what? - So, do we just run it? - Is it, is it like, in the folder, oh yeah. Where does it output the builds to, here? Oh shit, hang on, wait! Aw, damn, I was so excited. - [Mike] Well, I mean, we could, we got something, - Yeah. - it's just like, we didn't do anything to the text box to make it change values. - [Ken] Yeah, but basically it's like, hey, we got controls in there. - But hey, we made, we made a gret app. - (laughs) We made a gret app. This is my first Yellow Box application, that's pretty fun, yeah. I totally effed that up, I wish I would've figured that out a little bit better. Ah, let's see, just for shits and giggles, I want to see if I can figure this out quick, I'll give it one more try. If it doesn't work, we'll quit. - [Mike] Yeah, just playin' around here, okay, that does nothing for us, but if I go Message Text, let's drag that into there, I know we can change that to somethin', but I wonder-- - [Ken] What are you thinkin' of doin'? - [Mike] Why, 'cause it's something in the properties of something, of like a text box, or even message text, to change, - [Ken] Hmm. - [Mike] 'cause just typing in there, 'cause if I were to just type in there, and then I could just do, (key clicks) (Ken laughs) - Aggressive M, yeah. (Mike laughs) - [Mike] the most aggressive M ever, but I wonder, formats, fonts, text, it's gotta be something within the code to change that. So if I wire that to message text-- - [Ken] Oh, wait, takeIntValueFrom, maybe. Or wait, no, it's coming from something, not giving it to it. No, no, that's not gonna work. - [Mike] Print to NS text field, if we go ahead and build this-- - [Ken] I don't think it's gonna do anything, don't call me a no-fun Freddy. - [Mike] I don't think it's gonna do anything, but the thing is, is that we tried. - [Ken] And yeah, it'll be in the Workspace Manager. There's a Build thing and that thing, so. Alright, yeah. - Yep, so Message Text will do absolute, okay. - Oh, it's a print dialogue panel, maybe, not-- - I just did a print dialogue! (laughs) (Ken laughs) - [Ken] Good job! - [Mike] We did something! - [Ken] We did something, cool. - [Mike] What is, did we do AppOpener? - [Ken] Oh, no, it's got like a genie lamp on it, let's find out. - [Mike] I'm guessing that's just something. - [Ken] It has something in the menu bar over there. - About. - Scott Forstall, hey-hey! He's not there anymore. (laughs) - [Mike] Shoutout to the two Steves. - [Ken] Two Steves, woo. Go to the File menu, maybe? - [Mike] Hosts. - [Ken] Hm, alrighty then. (laughs) Maniac Mike, thank you for joining me. - [Mike] Yup, it's been a pleasure. - [Ken] Absolutely, it's always a pleasure, and now I just need to find out how to shut this down. - Oh boy. - (laughs) Oh shit, I don't-- (Mike laughs) - I wonder. - Uh-- - [Mike] I saw it somewhere, maybe if we, I wonder-- - [Ken] Quit? Yeah, you quit, - Yeah. - [Ken] you quit, so it must be under File, then, Log Out, yeah. - Log Out. - [Ken] So you do Command + Q, and then you gonna say Power Off, goodbye. Alright, awesome, well thanks for taggin' along with us, everyone, catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat electronic music)",

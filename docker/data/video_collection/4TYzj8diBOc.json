    "transcript": "I don't know about you guys but Razer is quickly becoming my favorite gaming brand of 2019 it seems like they're listening releasing products that are actually innovative at competitive price points to it really started with the lightweight Razer viper mouse that pretty much everyone in the FPS base loved then came the huntsman te a TKL keyboard with insanely fast Razer zone optical switches pbt keycaps a standard bottom row in the type-c connection literally a perfect gaming keyboard I've also received the siren emote microphone and this one isn't for everyone but the built-in a bit screen is actually very cool and complements the whole streaming interaction if you're into that and then came the Razer Viper ultimate a wireless Viper mouse with a charging dock awesome battery life still a lightweight design and excellent sensor performance I've been using it since its arrival and finally we have something to compete against G Pro wireless the Viper ultimate is a strong contender in the wireless space and now we have this an update to their gamepad products this is a Tartarus pro it's got the exact same shape as a Tartarus v2 but with new analog optical switches with adjustable actuation points and this new awesome looking mercury white color to the be quiet pure bass 500 is a perfectly sized handsome mid tower with the usual silent properties on the front panel and foam on the interior with to quality fans included plus a modular top section to expand the cooling potential give you Hardware a new home with a pure bass 500 alright so let's get the basics out of the way as the shape and the design really hasn't changed from the previous v2 unfortunately the price has gone up to $129 vs. $79 for the Tartarus v2 so you have twenty main analog optical switches a scroll wheel that still doesn't have good scroll steps and kind of awkward to reach with your point finger this space part though is perfectly placed under the thumb and now with better switches it makes a huge difference we still have the same d-pad joystick with the removable tip this way you are less likely to accidentally press it and finally a profile switcher with three LEDs and up to eight profiles none of which are unfortunately saved on a gamepad itself and will not run outside of your default traditional layout unless synapse 3 is installed and running and this is recognized through the software so that is one unfortunate thing there is no built-in memory the rest rest is the same rubberized material with some padding in the bottom with dual positions for extra ergonomics so when it's extended your hand is flatter and it's easier to reach the spacebar so it's good for large hands or if you prefer a more claw type shape for smaller hands the default position is good for that as I mentioned in my original v2 video these game pads are fantastic space savers and much more comfortable versus your regular keyboards because you can place the probe closer to the body at a comfortable angle it also complements nobu gamers so you're not suffering through two millimeters or less of travel distance on a notebook and of course these are incredible for macros both in gaming and productivity and what makes the pro so special are the new analog optical switches so they're linear and very smooth and have four millimeters of travel distance and dual actuation points primary and secondary and you can adjust either to register between 1.5 millimeters and 3.6 and this is pretty unique for two reasons first the second actuation point can have a secondary function or a macro but it is only activated when you pass that actuation point for example the primary function can be W while the second function at three point six millimeters can be shift plus W allowing you to walk and csgo by using the same key if you set the secondary function to be the same as primary you get fast double taps and there are plenty of options to choose from although you cannot record mouse clicks to be your secondary function the difficulty here would be training your finger tips and how much pressure you apply to either hit the primary actuation point or the secondary actuation point and to be honest the two millimeter difference is not that significant to notice or to feel in the heat of the battle and you have to focus on your finger tips and how much pressure you apply and that is one of those elements that you have to train for and be prepared for in order to use this functionality properly it also feels like the secondary actuation point happens earlier than three point six millimeters as you can see I've marked three point six millimeters on the key cap and the shift and W is registered before I past that point I feel like that would have been much better to have the secondary actuation point happen you fully bottomed out this way you have a bit more control on when the primary happens depending on when the actuation set but then the secondary to always happen when you fully bottomed out I feel like this way you'd have more control or even expand that secondary actuation range to be even lower to the bottoming out because a three point six I feel like there's quite a bit more travel distance before the switch bottoms out while it's already activated at three point six and the second unique function behind these switches is analog input so basically treating all of these switches as joystick movements so depending on how far down you press the faster or slower your character moves and you can adjust analog sensitivity I do like the slow preset to give me finer control at the very top of key travel but this again requires quite a bit of finger training to get right and after all that I feel like the Tartarus pro is just like an overkill macro station because not only do we have eight profiles and even the Razer hyper shift that adds one more layer of macros on top of that we also have those secondary functionality via the actuation distance even if you are not interested in using all these macro tools at least I'm happy we have better switches let a linear and in my opinion better suited for gaming than the mecca membrane switches found on the b2 but why did they have to pull a Razer because at $129 that price is expensive it's competing directly against their latest tkl keyboard the Huntsman te which is fantastic and sure doesn't have analog switches or that much macro customization like this thing does it's almost like if you're not utilizing all these macro commands and analog switches and dual actuation points then this thing is going to be left underutilized and perhaps not as popular as it should be it brings great promise to the macro lens but it's terrible value at $129 and if you're not using it it's hard to recommend at this price alright guys thanks much for watching make sure to check out other relevant content were here make sure to check out all the links in the description below for awesome products and yeah I'll talk to you in next video you",

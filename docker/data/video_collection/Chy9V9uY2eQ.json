    "transcript": "- [Anthony] Nintendo Switch. Oh man, I've been waiting for this for a long time. I had, one of these guys, a regular Nintendo Switch, but I ended up giving it away to a friend who lost theirs. So long story short I'm Switchless right now. And I've been kind of waiting for one of these to come out in order to, well, get a new Switch. Unfortunately it doesn't have quite the upgrades that I was hoping for, but it does report to be, OLED, check out this bezel. It's like, hang on, press the home button three times. Yep, that's oh, you can't, yeah, yeah. Well, you can kind of see it there that's a thick bezel like that reminds me of the Blackberry Playbook. In fact, that's kind of what I felt with the Nintendo Switch when it first launched, like, it looks like a really low end Android tablet or like knock-off tablet, but obviously the switch has a bunch of party tricks. Like it's kickstand here and your Joy-Cons here. So you can basically take it anywhere you wanna go and play whatever you wanna play. I mean, personally, aside from Nintendo's first party titles, there's not a whole lot that I would play on Switch versus any other console or platform for that matter, like PC, but it being portable is a huge bonus. And we have the Switch Lite here as well. That's something that I've kind of, sort of wanted to look into getting, cause they're a little bit cheaper, but I mean, I don't really like that you can't put it into like kickstand mode, you can't take the Joy-Cons off, it's all integrated. Well, let's get into the box and see if there's anything immediately obvious that makes this more of a cohesive experience. Oh, these are not white. Well, they are, but they are rather special. Oh man I love that aesthetic, this is my favorite dbrand skin. Like hands down. The only reason I didn't for my phone here is because I just wanted something that would immediately identify it as mine, because there are other people in the office with such cases. Yeah and even on the back here, they have the, where the battery goes, nice. So I take it, this is sponsored by dbrand, we'll get into that later. I'm not entirely sure what's involved with that, but okay. Here's the Joy-Cons, here's the Nintendo Switch OLED. Oh, I'm disappointed. There's nothing on the back of the Switch. I guess the robots have failed us. We'll get into the Switch itself in a moment. I was going to say that I was really happy about all the cardboard, but, everything's individually wrapped. Okay, oh, oh, that's interesting. The back of the Nintendo Switch dock is significantly changed. Now we have this little cutout here, which I'm pretty sure didn't exist in the previous model. Open this up, it's not on a straight hinge. It just comes off, and we've got AC adapter, HDMI out and LAN, built in LAN. That is an excellent addition. Before you had to go out and buy a USB network adapter and just kind of hope that it was compatible with the Switch. It wasn't a great experience and WiFi isn't a great experience for online play. All right, so to compare, this is the new one, and okay so there was a little cutout here, but it was very angular and not nearly as, as wide as the new one. And again, this just kind of hinges and yeah. So we've got AC adapter, a USB port, and HDMI out. Oh, that is a nice looking screen. Even when it's blank, check this out. It's like, is that a little, yeah, it's a little blacker 'cause you can see the, where the LCD is versus the bezels on the standard Switch. But it's much tougher to see that on the Switch OLED. It's very similar in thickness. However, one thing that is not similar is this beefy boy kickstand, you can actually put this at multiple different angles, they actually got a very good kickstand going here. This is like next level, I like it, it's thin, but it does feel like it's like got purpose, you know, whereas this kickstand it's plastic and is it? Yeah, it is definitely plastic. And every time I opened this kickstand, I feel like something is going to break. What I can do with this new stand is angle it such that not only can you see, oh, hi, not only can you see, but I can see too. That is something that you just cannot do with this old kickstand. Like we're just right there, yep. That's the best you get. I'm honestly surprised that we put up with the old design. But it was such a novel concept. The Switch console itself that I guess we just didn't care. I wanna see what the screen looks like. Do you want to see what the screen looks like? - [Man] Hell Yeah. - Yeah, let's see what the screen looks like after I talk to you about our sponsor dbrand, dbrand has something special for us. It appears that dbrand has a glass screen protector for the brand new Switch OLED. And they have requested that not only I install this, but that I test it. (drill motor revving) I am gonna be so happy if I break this, let's see if I can align this. Oh, this is not good at all. Am I doing this right. - [Andy] Probably not. - [Phone Speaking] Note that your tempered glass comes with two pieces, just in case you (beep) on your first try. (multiple people laughing) - [Anthony] All right, it's not perfect. It's got some stuff under it. Oh, I don't like this. (drill motor revving) So there's some kind of something on there, but, it just swiped off, interesting. All right, let's try more pressure. (drill motor revving) All right, I'm putting decent pressure on it right now. I should be going through the table if I was drilling into the wood. Yeah, there's nothing, more pressure. (drill motor revving) Honestly I like with the pressure I was putting on it. I was more worried that I would like start to put more pressure on the OLED than the OLED could take. But like, not only did it not go through, like, don't worry too much about the bubbles, but there's no scratches, dbrand glass works. Get yours at the link below. We should talk about what the screen is covered with. So the screen is actually made of glass this time around and there's this nice. I'm not sure if the bezel itself has glass too, but it kind of wraps around, it's more gentle curve than the Switch, or at least that's what it feels like to my fingers. Maybe it's just that it's smoother. But there is a screen protector on this, which you do not want to take off. It's there so that when the screen breaks, if the screen breaks, it doesn't just go everywhere. It is not shatter resistant glass. So that's there to catch it. You don't want to take that off if you drop your Switch and you don't have that on it, that glass is gonna go everywhere. So keep it on there, just enjoy, enjoy it, it doesn't feel like actually there's anything on there. So they did a pretty good job with that. Switch, that's bright. Ooh, whoa, wow, the colors are popping. Wow, check out the, I don't know if you can see, the brightness is super high and the saturation of the colors. It may be oversaturated, actually, it's not even really a contest actually, let me quickly put this in or put this in dark mode, cause that's more appropriate for an OLED anyway. That is pretty good. And also the screen is bigger because despite the fact that the consoles are the same size, the bezels have been trunk dramatically. This is without a doubt, the way that I would want to experience the switch like, this console, I was never really happy with, and there was a reason why I was okay with giving it away. This I would not give away. Like if I were to launch, let's just launch Breath of the Wild on both of these real quick. The blacks here don't really look all that black, they look gray. Here the dynamic range is so much nicer. So like, yeah, it's not showing the same screen, which is kind of frustrating, but like you can see just how more, how much more vibrant this is like that energy arrow, that Lincoln shooting there. I haven't actually played Breath of the Wild. I'm ashamed to admit, it looks like it's glowing. Whereas here this little impact here doesn't really look like much is happening. It doesn't show up on the camera. I can see what the camera is seeing. The vibrancy of the colors is not showing up nearly as well as I can see in person, that is staggering. But yeah, even just like the Switch online logo, you can see it, it's red, the Metroid Dread logo, it's red. This looks muted by comparison, all the colors. Well, it looks kind of like the difference between vibrant and SRGB for a monitor or TV, which might strike you as, not necessarily what you want. You can see so much more of the screen, like it's a seven 720p screen, yes. So you're gonna see pixels, but honestly, not really like this screen, it looks fine. This screen, yeah. Small, medium, large, except not actually larger, just the screen is larger. So this is 0.881 pounds, which is 14.1 ounces or 400 grams exactly, 424 grams. So yeah, it's not that much heavier. Now, it is disappointing that Nintendo didn't upgrade the SOC or, give us DLSS when we're docked or anything like that. But at this point, that's the kind of thing that'll happen with a new console, I think. This is actually a game that I would buy a Switch for. (dramatic music) Okay, that sounds pretty good. The stereo engine is pretty good. Not a whole lot of bass to it. I don't have a whole lot of reference for how the original Switch sounded. - [Phone Speaking] Cling to certain walls and ceilings, its automated (dramatic music) - It is richer, it's also a little bit louder I think. Hey, Linus is here. You wanna take a look at these? Yeah. You wanna take, you want to take a look? - Yeah, I want to see I'm a mostly handheld guy. Can I just throw these on? I just forgot to, wanna experience it here. I actually bought one already, I pre-ordered. I know, I know, I say don't pre-order and then I pre-ordered, but literally the only real complaint that I had about the Switch, because I don't care about the performance from a performance side game on a PC. Literally the only thing I cared about, they fixed it, man. The bigger size freaking awesome. - [Anthony] Yeah its amazing, the bezels on the old one look like a Blackberry playbook. This is amazing. - Okay, all right. I am still okay with my pre-order. Hey, I love that the best game for this console is still the one that launched, goodbye air gap. An air gap is a big deal, you might feel like, oh, Linus your just like fussing about a stupid little thing that doesn't matter, but it does multiple things. One, is it makes it so that your off-axis viewing experience is not nearly as good, which, okay, sure, yeah, fine, most of the time, it doesn't matter. But when you're say, sitting on a plane playing Mario Party or something like that, it actually matters quite a lot. And the other thing is that it reduces clarity. So this is just better. Okay, no, I'm done, I'm getting out of the way. Sorry, carry on, have fun - [Anthony] See you a letter. So yeah, you can definitely make out the pixels, especially here with the kind of haloing around link in the shadow of the clouds. It is very much more noticeable, but that doesn't mean it doesn't look good. (tab scraping) Oh yeah, every time. In this, you can feel it scraping, here, it's way less of a concern. My goal isn't to review any games, so I guess I don't really need to play any more games to get across the differences that we've seen here. The dock is significantly upgraded actually when you think about it, you don't have to go out and buy a new LAN adapter, the Switch itself, beautiful display, better speakers, way, way better kickstand, that can go to any angle. It's just, it's just better. Now this screen might not be as long lived as an LCD, particularly if you're able to replace the backlight and the LCD that's failing. But I mean, how long are you gonna think, that's really far out. All right, Switch OLED model $ 349 US. Okay, and I think these regular switches $299. Am I not, am I correct? Actually, yeah. For 50 bucks in the difference, I would totally do it. If you don't have a Switch already, if you do have a Switch, now, it really depends on your priorities. If you just wanna play the games, then there's no reason to pick up the Switch OLED. Especially if you play mostly in docked mode, but if you play in portable mode a lot, this I think is the definitive experience. And I think it's worth paying the extra 50 bucks for. So yeah, if you wanna see more unboxings and first impressions like this one, get subscribed because there's plenty more where this came from. (glass breaks) Oh yeah, that's tempered glass.",

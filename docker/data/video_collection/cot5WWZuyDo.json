    "transcript": "(buzzing) - No explanation just-- - [Man] What? - (buzzing) - [Man] What's? - AMD launched new RYZEN 3 CPUS last week, the 3100 and 3300 X. And while they were both well received, the 3100 has been getting some extra attention. Taiwanese Overclocker (tinkling), this name, was able to push his RYZEN 3 3100 up to 5.92 Gigahertz, using liquid nitrogen and he wasn't the only one making an attempt. Steve from Gamers Nexus, Tech Jesus as we call him, got his unit running at up to more than 5 Gigahertz as well. - [Man] It's a miracle. - But it turns out the chip is a decent overclocking candidate, without LN2 as well. PC Gamer magazine, the publication, they got their CPUs performance to within a sliver of the 3300X's, Stock performance that is, just using the included Wraith stock cooler. Maybe the fact that these chips are so great will make us forget that AMD is screwing up their promise of backwards compatibility right now, except that I just reminded you so, so, sorry AMD. - [Man] You got the pitchforks I guess. (grunts) - They took our compatibility (laughs). Microsoft and Intel are working together to classify and attack malware by rendering it as an image. Gobbly Gook (claps), because you can't hit what you can't see, okay? The collaboration is called, STAtic Malware-as-Image Network Analysis, or STAMINA, and it involves converting binary file code into pixels, which are then used to compose an image, which is then scanned by a neuro-network for traces of malware infection, which is then reported to your wife, because you've been a bad boy. - [Man] Oh, oh - You can get it from a toilet sit. If that sounds wacky, you are right, it is, but sometimes wacky works because STAMINA has demonstrated over 99% accuracy in classifying malware with a false positive rate of just 2.6%, although it does better with smaller files than larger ones. It really gives a new meaning to the power of visualization, just imagine what a virus looks like, and then you can defeat it. Try it with me now. (lighthearted music) Urgh. - [Man] Urgh. - Gross. - And the vulnerability has been discovered in Thunderbolt, that could allow evil maids, maids? - [Man] Yep. - To hack your PC in five minutes, (claps). Let me explain, the flaw has been named Thunderspy by the researchers that discovered it, because hackers could use it to rewrite your PC's Thunderbolt firmware, and steal your data even if it has an encrypted hard drive. A hypothetical evil maid attack, could involve someone gaining access to your laptop in your hotel room, removing the back plate, using a pre-made device to inject new firmware, and closing your laptop back up, with you being none the wiser. And then that maid just goes and gets a better job, because clearly they are very adapt at IT. - [Man] Oh, man. - No offense to maids, huh. Well, it's been said because the attack requires prolonged physical access to a PC, some ready users are pointing out that it's not that dangerous, but if you're more scared of evil maids now than you were already, you can use the spy check tool, to see if your machine is vulnerable. - [Man] My nightmare. - I am not tipping. Now is time for the slick beats, brought to you by this hair do, and Manscape, makers of the worlds first all in one Manscaping kit, that makes grooming yourself safe and easy. That's because this kit includes the Lawn Mower 3.0 waterproof body trimmer. Your whole body including your head if you're like me, (laughs) featuring an ergonomic design and quality ceramic blades built with their advanced skin safe technology. Its also got new compact anti-tug adjustment (murmurs) and a built in LED light so you can see what the heck you're doing down there. Get 20% off and free shipping for your perfect packaged 3.0 purchase, when you use code LTT at the link below or on manscapped.com. - Quick bits? Oh, never. (laughs) - Hackers man, they're crazy (groans). And the latest evidence of this is the hacking group, ShinyHunters who has published a database of over 72 Million compromised user accounts, I'm probably in there. The accounts are from some lesser known sources, like dating site Zoosk, photo book maker, Chatbooks, and various smaller newspaper, and E-commerce websites. I'm definitely on there. Its unfortunate but sure, Zoosk, they're kind of asking for it. - [Man] What's Tinder? (laughs) I want Zoosk. (laughs) - Hey, swipe up on me (laughs). What a meat market, this is a real Zoosk. Microsoft has announced they will be repairing Surface Laptop 3 displays after numerous reports sprung up, claiming the laptop screen will spontaneously develop hairline cracks. I know the feeling. The company says its determined that, in a small percentage of display, okay, a hard foreign particle can cause a fracture. Did Microsoft just make a dick joke? That's what she said? I don't know or they are just talking about like, getting a rock on your laptop can make it crack cause its kind of dark. - [Man] Any hard foreign particle. - This laptop is really asking for it. Like many developers, EA is offering to give gamers, the next-gen version of certain games if the current gen version is purchased, but EA's offer comes with a cache. In the case of Madden NFL 21, you have to buy the game by December 31st, and upgrade to the new XBOX by March 31st 2021. Okay, that actually seems reasonable, but in a time when every other developer is leaving things just a bit more open, its just kind of funny that EA is still gonna be EA. - [Man] You know, it depend on. - A university of Toronto study has found that the popular messaging App, WeChat, never heard of it, owned by a Chinese mega company Tencent, who are they? Monitors messages sent between recipients, even those based outside of China. Excuse me, while I express the opposite of surprise. Oh really? (laughs) Tencent says they are taking the results of the study seriously. Oh good, you should probably just keep using the App then, you know. - [Man] Of a company you haven't heard of. - They're super serial you guys. And Intel announced a collaboration with Bluetooth tracking company Tile, to integrate the latter's tech into laptops with Intel chips sets. Finally, I will never lose my laptop down in the space between my seats again. And when I pull out my App to locate it, it'll will tell me, Tile cannot be located, last seen 21 hours ago. It's useless. (fire blows up) - [Man] Oh no! - Its stupid. All right, that's it for this one guys, come back on Wednesday for more tech news, but fewer stupid hair cuts. And if you think you can dress like Linus, then try it. You've never won jeans this simultaneously stretchy and coarse before, have you? - [Man] Well, give us a peek. (groans) (screams) Wow. (groans) There he is!",

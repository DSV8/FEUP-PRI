    "transcript": "(mouse clicks) - This is the NeXTcube. There's not a ton of them around, so they're rather rare and valuable. And back in the day, they cost $10,000, give or take. But because the computer is about 30 years old, that means the hard drive is about 30 years old, and we all know how these things can just die. So, how do we fix a dying hard drive with something like this? Well, that's what we're gonna try today. And you're coming along with me, let's go. (upbeat music) (computer beeping) Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken. - And I'm Steve from Mac84. - Who the (duck quacks) are you? - We've known each other for years, Ken. - Oh, of course. So, today we're gonna be taking a look at this NeXTcube. Now, these are pretty rare I'd say, pretty valuable. There's not a lot of them around. And these were made by, well NeXT, Steve Jobs company after he, let's just say left Apple in the mid-80s. Before he came back to Apple, he had this company called NeXT and Pixar, you know that little one. Now, Steve, what are we gonna be doing today to this old thing? - Well, it has sort of a noisy, SCSI hard drive, would you say? - A very noisy hard drive in it, yes. - Maybe a ticking time bomb, SCSI hard drive? - Right, this thing is 31 years old, I think. - Yeah, it's pretty old. - So, the hard drive could probably go at any moment and it is loud as hell, so. (computer whirring) How are we gonna remedy that? - Well, there are some flash storage solutions that you do have for SCSI devices these days. - Is that what this thing is? 'Cause it's been sitting here for like three years and I just don't know what it is. - Yeah, that's exactly what that is. - Cool, so basically we're gonna take the hard drive out and this is going to be the new hard drive. It's really just gonna be an SD card, which will not give me as much anxiety if it's gonna break or not. It's also gonna be a lot quieter. - Yeah, just a bit. - This doesn't really make much noise. And speed? You think it's gonna be faster too? - Yeah, we can run some tests. - And of course, to open this thing, we're gonna use our handy dandy iFixit Toolkit thing. So, thank you iFixit for... No, wait I can't really thank you, you didn't give this to me. Greg Hrutkay from Hrutkay Mods So, thank you, Greg. (laughs) - Thanks, Greg. - Yes, Steve, are you ready to do this? - I am ready and willing. - All right. Well then, I'm getting the hell out of here. It's all you. - All right, where's my hammer? - [Ken] Eh voila, here is the back of the NeXTcube. So, they don't actually come out, they just kind of stay in. So, then the fan is on like one of those like springy cords, so we'll just take that apart. So, we got the springy thing and we'll just go ahead and hold that there. And we'll just disconnect the power for the fan. So, there's the power cord for the fan and we'll flip this around here. There's the fan, just one fan. - [Steve] It's beautiful inside. - [Ken] Yeah, it's cool. So, I'll give you that. The board is also really pretty like they spent a lot of time on that. - [Steve] Oh, of course. - [Ken] So, then the hard drive is up here. There's the SCSI with a little handle on it, and that's what we're gonna be replacing with this guy. All right, so next, see what I did there? We gotta remove these little guys and then I will pass the torch to Steve who... Oh, son of a... Oh my gosh, oh geez. - [Steve] Thanks, I'll fix it. - [Ken] There you go. - [Ken] And those screws are probably not been undone for like 30 years. - [Steve] Yeah, I would say so. - [Ken] All right, so this is basically like a whole cage we can pull out, but first we gotta remove your mother board as Adiblasi might say. So yeah, just pull that guy out. I'll get the cables. There we go. Yeah, just need a little more room. There we go. And remove that beautiful. - [Steve] Oh, that is lovely. - [Ken] Beautiful piece of engineering there. Isn't that sweet? - [Steve] Look at those memory slots, my goodness. - Yeah, tons of slots for memory, lots of miniaturization, there's the 68040 processor there. I've never actually gone this far in the NeXT process, but from what the genius Steve has showed me, I guess we can just do some tag team action. - [Steve] You want to do some forceful pulling with each hand under these. And I will guide- - [Ken] There we go. And then this baby just slides right out. - [Steve] Here we go. - [Ken] Oh, hey, there's a logo on way on the inside there. - [Steve] Oh, wow, didn't even notice that. - [Ken] Like we only have one board in here, but we can put three more of who knows what else. - [Steve] Wow. - [Ken] Inside this thing, yeah. The extraction process is complete. Go ahead, Steve, and do your side. - [Steve] Of course. - [Ken] And then I will unscrew... I guess I could unscrew it if I get another screwdriver. - [Steve] Nah, we have to share. (laughs) - [Ken] Rules. This is team building. You use one tool. - [Steve] Go, Maestro. - [Ken] All right. All right, I heard ka-trunk, so it's probably a good start. - [Steve] It is free. - [Ken] All right. - [Steve] And this says NeXTstep 3.3 with patch 2. So, we have a slight problem. - [Ken] Steve, don't do this to me, man. - [Steve] It's relatively minors. - [Ken] Okay, good. - [Steve] The hard drive has a bracket on it, which helps keep things inside of the system and the hard drive from wobbling around in there. And unfortunately our SCSI2SD, well, the holes here don't exactly line up. So, there are 3D printed solutions and stuff like that, but I have a cheapo option. You just take this anti-static bag and this will just make sure that none of the pin-outs or the metal components touch anything of the metal inside of the NeXT case. We're just gonna secure it with a little rubber band and look at that. - [Ken] We wanna pop this bad boy in here. This should be NeXTstep 3.3, I think is on there and it's formatted. - [Steve] Great. So, we're gonna get our SCSI cable here. This chunky boy. Gotta make sure we plug this in. That's a tight fit. - [Ken] Sweet. - [Steve] And we'll place that as best we can here. - [Ken] What do you think next here? I mean, just put it back together, right? - [Steve] Yeah, and hope for the best. - [Ken] All right, let's do it. All right, it's all back together. So, Steve, if you'd like to do the honors, you can push the power button right up there. Go ahead and get that- - [Steve] I feel blessed. - [Ken] It's already much quieter. Oh, okay, testing system. Okay, boot from the SCSI disc, I'm assuming. So, B for boot, SD, SCSI disc. And let's see if it reads anything it kind... - [Steve] Oh, booting from SCSI, target one. - [Ken] There it is. So, it could be root with no password. All right, well that was easy. (Steve laughs) Okay, so we're loading up here. We've got the old black and white beach ball. The dock is full, like more full than my last system. Now, the question is, well, hey, this thing is working. What do we do now? Just to see if it's... Is this Mathematica? It looks like the bit from Tron. - [Steve] Totally, it totally does. - Yeah. Oh, that's Mathematica, okay. I have no idea what I'm doing. (Steve laughs) - [Steve] That makes the both of us. - [Ken] That noise is kind of like the new macOS Big Sur default boop. - [Steve] It is, it is. - [Ken] Have you ever seen the funk sound in here? - [Steve] No, I have not. - [Ken] Yeah, let's just take a look at that actually fun. So, we'll go over to the dock, open up the preferences... - [Steve] We woke up at 5:25 AM. - [Ken] And this is 5 in the morning and we're doing this. Anyway, we'll just play around with the sounds for a little bit. (inaudible chatter) (both laughs) - Hey man. (duck quacks) (Ken laughs) - [Ken] What? They put some funny stuff on this card. Ahh. - [Computer] Ahh. - [Ken] Ohhh, whoa. Oh, eep, eep, they all like that, Steve. (computer sound) - [Ken] There you go. - [Steve] Oh, that's sorta clipped there. - [Ken] Yeah, hang on, let's try that again. - [Steve] Eep. (Ken laughs) (man sings) (both laughs) - [Steve] These are great. - [Ken] Oh, man, I think what I wanted, here we go. So, that was a built-in sound that was not added in. So, that was one iconic thing that came over to Mac, yeah. - [Steve] Sweet. - [Ken] Speed-wise just from my experience, it feels about the same as the hard drive. - [Steve] Okay. - [Ken] But it's way less (crunch sound) noisy. (Steve laughs) Anyway, so we're poking around the system here just to run some apps for fun to see how it performs. I did also notice there was a games folder on here. - [Steve] Yeah, I think I saw Tetris. - [Ken] Was Tetris in there? - [Steve] Yeah, I think it was in the main directory. - [Ken] Yeah, we got Tetris. Asteroids... Reversi! - [Steve] Oh, there we go. - [Ken] All these features and Reversi for just how much did you guess? 500? Oh, Risk, that's fun. - [Steve] Yeah, let's play a 20-hour game of Risk. (Ken laughs) - [Ken] Let's just play a quick game of Tetris here. No, this is too fast for me. - [Steve] Just crank it up to 11. - [Ken] Does it go to 11? No, it goes to nine. There's a lot of other stuff on here. I also noticed there is Concurrence, which was like, you know, the Apple Keynote software. This was like the grandfather to that. - [Steve] Ah, yes. - [Ken] So that would be cool to look into quickly. They also have like a Lotus program, Lotus presentation builder. There's a lot of stuff on here. I may have to do another episode later just tinkering with NeXT software, 'cause I haven't used that much of it. Well, let's see if we can build like a business presentation. Are there like themes or something I can kind of get started with here. There's the inspector. New from templates, yes. Oh gosh, seriously, dude. It doesn't just give me a pretty little gallery like we get now, I have to browse the file system from the RIT directory and go wherever the hell this thing is. - [Steve] Yeah, we have no idea. - [Ken] I've no clue. We'll just make this, \"Why you need the information super highway.\" Oh great. (Steve laughs) Let's make it smaller. There we go and we'll say play. Hey, hey, now we got a nice presentation. - [Steve] You should put like I don't know, silly things. - [Ken] Bullet points. - [Steve] Bullets like. - [Ken] There we go. I think command six. - [Steve] Or there you go. - [Ken] And play, and here we go. This is my business presentation. - [Steve] I love it. - [Ken] Samples. - [Steve] Oh. - [Ken] Oh, okay. - [Steve] Oh, nice. - [Ken] Sexy graphics going on here, play that. - [Steve] That is awesome. - [Ken] Nice, \"Radio: Past, Present, and Future.\" Next slide, \"The History of Radio.\" Oh, this is kind of cool. - [Steve] This is really neat. - [Steve] Like old slideshow software. Oh my gosh. - [Steve] I think the display just makes it even better. - [Ken] Oh yeah, and let's take a look at the credits here. Oh, little animated graphic. - [Steve] Nice. - [Ken] Western Avenue, Chevy chase, Maryland? Is that a real place? Like the actor? - [Steve] It is, it is. - [Ken] Oh my gosh, what? - [Steve] As you can see here, our company is doing well. - [Ken] This would be perfect for like PowerPoint karaoke, where you have to like improvise what these things actually mean. This is when the giant robot alligators invaded the planet earth and ate the Empire State building. That's what that is right there. Moon.app. - [Steve] Will it get us to the moon? - [Steve] You know, I really wish. - [Ken] Okay, so it's like a phase calculator. I thought it was interesting because like, you know, the Apple watch has that Moon phase things. So, today is Sunday the 15th and this is 2021. This is August. So, let's type in August 15th, 2021, and see if the calculation is actually... Not the breathe app. There we go and go ahead and hit time travel. Bam! - [Steve] Wow. - [Ken] There you go, Math is cool. - [Steve] The moon doesn't change. - [Ken] Moon doesn't change. Or probably would, somehow. It probably like orbit slower overtime. I don't know planets. (Steve laughs) Is anybody a moon scientist? (both laughs) So, if you guys wanna try this, I put a link in the description where you can get your own kit. Hopefully, there's still some available. If they're not, I'll try to keep the link up-to-date as much as I can. Thanks again for helping, Steve. - Of course, anytime. - Where can the kind people find you? - Well, they could find me on YouTube by searching for Mac84, or you could find me on Instagram and Twitter. My handle is @mac84tv. - Fantastic, and if you guys wanna see more tech episodes, I release them all the time on the computer clan here. Feel free to subscribe.

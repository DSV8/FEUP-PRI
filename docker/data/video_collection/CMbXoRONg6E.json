    "transcript": "- This episode of Krazy Ken's Tech Talk is sponsored by Artlist. So Lit Mobile just sent me this solar wireless battery pack. I'm excited. Let's see what's inside. I really like the build. It's got hand grips. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. (chuckles) I cannot fake my enthusiasm for a product like this. Let's just start the episode. (upbeat music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? Really, that's just great. You know, I'm doing pretty great today too, because JUDINGTECH. That's right, not Lit Mobile. But JUDINGTECH sent me their solar battery bank thing. And they're supposedly the OEM/ODM that Lit Mobile uses for their products. I mean, it looks pretty much identical except there's no Lit Mobile branding. So it makes sense. So why am I going this route? Well, Lit Mobile is still doing nothing. They took my money and have not shipped the product. They haven't even given me a tracking number. They took the money from a bunch of other customers and they have not shipped them their products either. So, foreseeing this possibility. I pretty much knew it was gonna happen. I decided to go the alternate route and go right to JUDINGTECH themselves. If you have not seen my previous episodes about this Lit Mobile debacle I highly recommend you do. As a quick summary of what happened last time. I reached out to JUDINGTECH via Alibaba. JUDINGTECH offers this solar charger product with branding options. This looks like the route that Lit Mobile chose for their product, it looks the same. Heck, I could even go this route if I wanted to sell my own computer clean branded solar charger. That aside, I ordered one non branded unit for review. Unfortunately, it was held up in the shipping process for a while, probably due to COVID-19. But it is here now in my lair. So since this is the original non branded unit that mobile uses, I think it's fair to say that whatever we test with this will be very, very similar to the actual Lit Mobile product itself. So now the fun part. Does the product actually work? And are any of the claims that Lit Mobile made actually for real? Let's take a look. Here's a quick rundown of the specs. The power bank features a 20,000 milliamp hour battery which can charge via USB or via solar. There's three USB ports for charging other devices. Two 10 watt ports and one five watt port. The bank also has an LED built in which can shine at 800, 550 and 250 lumens. On top of the LED surface is a Qi charger for wireless charging. So how well does it work in real life? Well, I looked around the layer and just found a couple of random devices and plugged them in to stress test it. And while doing so I just decided to have this little fire extinguisher. This little cute fire extinguisher on standby. You know, just in case. I connected a first gen iPad and an iPhone seven to start. The iPad's battery was at 55% and the iPhone's battery was at approximately zero percent. I mean it wouldn't turn on so I'm guessing it was dead. The power bank itself was fully charged. It took the iPad two and a half hours to charge from 55% to 100%. Simultaneously while I was charging the iPhone seven and the iPhone seven went from nothing to 100% in about two and a half hours as well. After that the bank was at approximately 75% battery life. Unfortunately, we only see 25% increments for the battery life so I can't tell what it was at exactly, but this is as close as we can get. Next, I busted out my iPhone 11 Pro. I asked the Twitter community for suggestions on how I could quickly drain the battery for this test. In the end I recorded video at 4K with 60 FPS constantly while screen recording as well simultaneously that killed the battery fast. Once empty, I placed it on the Qi charger. It took three hours and 50 minutes to reach 97% but I couldn't get it to go any higher. Not sure if that's a power bank limitation or if the iPhone is doing that on purpose. Honestly the results weren't that bad. Especially considering this thing minus shipping is only 11 bucks, so not too bad right? When it comes to recharging the device with the USB port here. I connected it to my 10 watts power brick that I got with my iPad. And the input is only 10 watts. So that's as far as it'll go. (beep) How the... it's got hand grips, but I can't hold on to the (beep) the thing, son of a (beep). It's slippery. Is it the lotion on my hands? I don't know. (laughs) Oh my gosh that was stupid. All right, let's try that one more time. (beep) Now when it comes to charging the device via the USB input, I tested it with my 10 watt power brick that I got with my iPad, and the bank fully charged in approximately 10 and a half hours. Now I understand that results may vary, but I was using the maximum wattage the power bank can take. And my charge time was way over the advertised 60 minutes. But hello, this is a solar charger. We're supposed to really charge this thing with the big fiery ball in the sky. So we're gonna take a look at those test results next, but first I wanted to talk about the music that I use in this show in Krazy Ken's Tech Talk. I get a lot of compliments about it but I can't take the credit. All of that awesome music is from Artlist. Artlist is a powerful music licensing platform created by filmmakers for filmmakers and it's perfect for your YouTube videos or anything else you publish podcasts, games, commercial videos and more. Look, I understand music licensing is often complicated and expensive, but Artlist makes it easy. I'm an idiot who can't even hold on to tech products without dropping them right. And if Artlist is easy enough for me to use, it'll be easy enough for you to use, you'll want it. A single annual subscription gives you access to thousands of songs, and you could download anything you want throughout the whole year, no limits, and you can keep the song licenses forever. And when you download the songs, you'll also be supporting in the artists so everyone wins. Oh, yeah. And there's even a sound effects subscription too. So when you start working on that next video, be sure to add some awesome Artlist music into it. And if you sign up through my link, you'll get two extra months free added to your subscription. Alright, ladies and gentlemen, and everything in between it is now the moment you have all been waiting for. The solar charging test. I think it's fair to say that Lit Mobile's claim of a 60 minute charge via solar is completely Bull. I'm not an electrical engineer, but a solar panel, the size of a Pop-Tart with today's technology would never be able to charge a 20,000 milliamp hour battery in 60 minutes. Brad from Birdemic is even smart enough to tell you that. - Solar power will be available and affordable for everyone. - [Ken] In another Lit Mobile, ad they changed this spec. - [Woman] ...wall, in six to eight hours via solar. - Maybe they were fixing an honest mistake. Who knows? I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, although I've been giving them a lot of benefits of the doubt. So maybe the six to eight hour thing is more accurate. But my hypothesis before I started any testing was that it wasn't even going to get halfway because I received a lot of comments from you guys saying \"I put it out in the sun for like a week \"and I only got 25% on the LED indicator here.\" Yeah, well a lot of people said that so I thought maybe it's gonna be the same thing for me. So I drained the battery overnight. Then I escaped my layer and laid the power bank out in the beautiful sunlight. After four and a half hours of charging, I only saw the 25% LED on. Which means we could have theoretically or approximately between 25% and 49% of a charge. Now, that's not terrible, I guess, because you could still charge your phone probably once or twice, maybe even three times with that amount of juice. So if you're stranded in the desert, and you really need to listen to your tunes, you'll be able to. But I didn't wanna give up yet. I wanted to keep testing it. So I left it out in the sun for many more hours, I kept checking it like every 90 minutes to see if anything changed. Nothing changed. The solar light was on the 25% light would turn on when I press the button on the side, and nothing else. So I didn't wanna give up yet. I wanted to give it one more 90 minute break, and just see if it will work. So I let it go for another like 90 minutes, two hours, whatever. And I came back and it was gone. Like it was gone! Somebody took the power bank. So I'm freaking out just a little bit here. I reached out to my friend that let me borrow his backyard. I was using that as the testing site. Turns out that backyard is actually shared by a couple of neighbors. So I went to go ring some doorbells. Luckily, the first doorbell I rang gave me some answers. A gentleman came out and he explained that he was just being the Good Samaritan and he thought someone dropped it. So he sent it to the nearest neighbors house he could find. And I don't know what the plan was after that, but I went to that neighbor's house. And sure enough, they did have it. So Crisis averted, we're able to continue testing. So I got it back and I checked the percentage and nope, still at 25%. Calling it it will not get above, I guess, technically 49%. It could be at 49%. It's just not telling us but yeah, it just can't even get halfway it's straight up. It's just it sucks at solar charging. I'm not surprised at all. I mean, if these were sold for like $10 to the public, (laughs) I would expect it to suck but they're on Lit Mobile website for like 100 bucks with the discount, they're 40 bucks, and that's still 40 bucks. And the main feature you advertise Lit Mobile, like can't even get halfway there. So that, that's just a shame. So if you do end up getting one of these don't count on the solar charging getting that far. It could work for a little bit if you're in a desperate situation and you have no other way to get electricity, that could work a little bit. But honestly, you're gonna have better luck just charging through the USB port. I'll reach out to Lit Mobile again, but if I don't hear back soon, I'm just going to contest the charge and get my money back. Honestly, I knew it wasn't gonna show up. I knew it wasn't gonna show up before I even hit the buy button. I just did it to prove a point. But really, all that stuff brushed aside, this whole debacle is just a nice lesson a nice reminder at how powerful marketing can be and how deceitful it can be. Fancy advertisements, generous discounts, and five star reviews can make a company and a product look pretty good, but really all they're doing is they're covering up shady business practices and potentially crappy products. Even if the product isn't crappy, if the business is still shady, it's not gonna matter, you're not gonna see your product anyway. And you're never gonna get an email back. And Lit Mobile, unfortunately, that's the route you chose. I'm still giving you a chance for redemption. But you have not replied to me and you have not replied to many other customers and you're just taking their money. That is not right, you are a shady business. But again, as for the product itself, I mean, for 10 bucks, whatever, it's okay, if you ignore the other 50% of the charging capabilities. Maybe something else will develop later. But for now, I think we're good. And hey, in the end, we got a low cost power bank out of this whole conundrum. So not all is lost, right? But more importantly, the Computer Clan channel grew significantly during this saga. So to all of the new subscribers and all of the new viewers that came by during this time, thank you so freakin' much. It means the world to me.

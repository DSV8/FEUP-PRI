    "transcript": "this slightly Dusty PC that features on the channel semi-regularly oh I mean it's not that bad is my personal gaming system and in today's video I'm gonna use it as a guinea pig for a fancy new case transplant but first today's video is sponsored by the node which is slowly being absorbed by Akamai to form the most powerful Linux based cloud computing service the world has ever seen kinda like it already is just look at this long list of Linux based Cloud Computing Services they offer I can tell you're impressed and this combined with their competitive pricing and award-winning customer support makes lenod a no-brainer Choice sign up using the link in the video description to get a 60-day hundred dollar free credit thank you [Music] first things first for those of you that haven't seen it let's have a quick look at the specs of this system now aside from my personal dust collection in the system we have an RTX 3080 that I MacGyver the liquid cooler onto an 11 900k and a bunch of motherboard stuff but actually with that let's de-case the system so we can get a closer look at the other components foreign [Music] boy in a second but first I want to get the whole motherboard out because it's kind of relevant to the story oh this front dust filter actually isn't quite as Dusty as I was expecting it to be although it's only been like three or four months so it makes sense that it's not that bad [Music] again the front fans aren't that bad either I was kind of expecting the Govi desert to have thrown up on them yeah you see it's one of the problems with modern motherboards and this armor that they all have on them it makes it really difficult for you to get the clips and things [Music] now we must face the nightmare of air cooler CPU power cable undoing in the Midtown [Music] yeah I'm gonna have to undo the fan foreign [Music] I guess the top air filter received the brunt of the Dust punishment and in the final thing before we take a look at the motherboard is to just remove the power supply and then I think we've got everything we need from this case [Music] power supply wise I'm sure some of you are outraged to see me using this rm750x to power an RTX 3080 but it's been more than enough and after removing a cross thread standoff I decided to give my motherboard a quick blow oh okay my office is now 70 last year may not have been a great idea probably could have removed the fans first I'm gonna replace them anyway so I didn't need to blow their dust all over my office but other than you learn now the motherboard in question is this amazing looking gigabyte z590 aorus Master which despite being one of the top dog z590 gigabyte boards I bought new for like 200 US dollars six or seven months after launch because I guess no one bought this generation of Intel CPU and they just needed to get rid of the stock now some of you may quite rightly Be Wondering David why do you use a cheap gigabit Ethernet card with a motherboard that has the rear i o equivalent of Brad Pitt not young Brad Pitt but Brad Pitt nonetheless which is a reasonable question considering that we have 10 gigabit Ethernet on this motherboard the problem is the 10 gigabit Ethernet with a lot of these fancier motherboards they add this feature using an acquaintia 10 gigabit Ethernet chip which in my experience on all the motherboards I've interacted with it on this chip is complete ass and after months of trying different drivers and still getting several Network dropouts mid online gaming session a day I just decided screw it I'm gonna buy a cheap gigabit Ethernet card off of Amazon and I haven't had a single problem since some motherboard manufacturers if you're going to insist on using this chip to brag about 10 gigabit Ethernet on your motherboards at this price point at least give me redundant ethernet using a chip that we know Works aquentia more like a quent ass am I right anyway ran over let's check out the new case [Music] look at that so exciting [Music] that is some Primo soft foam packaging very nice [Music] and in case you've been living under a rock for the last three months this is the fractal design North a bit of a weird name I probably would have called it the wood myself but you know this is just me the standout feature of course being the the wooden slats on the front uh now having seen it in person I will say that I I actually think the black one with the front Oak would look better but I bought the white one because I haven't done the whole white case thing in a while and it still looks really nice I just feel like the black and the dark wood would match a bit better but that's just my opinion it's got a solid front i o of course the most important thing is we need to test the power button which oh it's got some real resistance to it there's a teeny bit of springiness to it but I like the resistance the wood slats do seem quite porous in the front here for airflow which is very good and then the inside of the case next to this this little pleather pool is actually painted this gunmetal color which I quite like I think it looks good oh it does kind of sit in like that and then you you take it off okay that's a decent side panel Mount the insides of the case just looks like a good modern case interior it comes with 240 millimeter fans out of the box mounted to this front 360 mil radiator Mount and then on the top we've got a 280 mil radiator mount with a dust filter so lots of fan mounting to go around but for my system we're just gonna have the 240 mil GPU Radiator in the front which I'm thinking of using push pull on that just to increase the amount of air being pulled into the case but I'll see how clearance works for that but with that let's start building in it [Music] in the basement we get a couple of hard drive cages which are actually very low in here which kind of makes sense for cable management but I think it would be nice for them to add an accessory where you can have a double stack of hard drives as opposed to just the ones flat on the floor so that you can have like two further up or up to four hard drives depending on what you want oh [Music] oh I actually do quickly want to replace the fans on the cooler here with these silent Wing Pro 4S considering that I have nine million of them lying around Queen it doesn't look quite as Sleek as it did with the fans that come stock with this deep cool cooler but I think a little bit quieter [Music] that fits real nice look at that they give you a nice guide of what all the screws are on the box that's useful now comes the most feared test in all of custom the David hand big air cooler CPU power plug-in difficulty test look at that it was real easy even with this big air cooler good job fractal design after which I started the cable management in the case which is very easy aside from a weird small shortcoming it comes with just four zip ties that's a bit stingy don't you think oh like that okay pull it out it actually comes out real easy and now the next step is to see what kind of clearance we're gonna have if you drop this in here and this goes I mean we can do push pull if we want so I decided to very professionally test how much of a difference it would make starting off with a pool configuration adding a second set of fans later on to see how much it helps the temperatures [Music] [Music] ha hmm heavy [Music] thank you [Music] no I'm not going to spend too much time talking about the way that it looks because I feel like it's up to you to decide how you feel about it but in person I'm not nearly as painfully aroused by it as I was expecting to be aside from the awesome wooden front I feel like maybe the side panel is a little bit too small slightly obscuring your view of the system and then what you get in return is this just blank bit of white space I don't know it's definitely not ugly it just doesn't really get my juices flowing you know and I'm pretty disappointed that I didn't buy the black one but you live and you learn and that's besides the point let's do some gaming on it to see how the temperatures stack up and then we'll add another set of fans in the front to see if that helps okay so it's been a while and uh we've been hovering around 54.80 for a while now 80 has been kind of the average let's see what happens when we add a couple more fans to that front radiator [Music] wow it made a surprisingly big difference especially when it comes to the CPU where we lost about 10 degrees Celsius on average my theory as to why that's happening is that the two fans couldn't quite pull enough air through the radiator into the case and adding the extra two fans just gave that additional bit of airflow that the system needed to stay cool I really am surprised at how big a difference that made so at the end of the day in person visually the fractal design North doesn't quite ignite the fire in my loins I was expecting it to but it's a well thought out case and it's nice to see fractal using some interesting materials in the build with that thank you for watching and until the next video bye-bye [Music] thank you",

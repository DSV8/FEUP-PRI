    "transcript": "So it wouldn't be an iPhone 7 launch without a teeny little bit of controversy. What's the latest? I've been getting hit up on twitter by a bunch of people asking me Lew, what's happening with these hiss gate? And I was like, 'Hiss gate? What do you- I have no idea what you're even talking about.' So, sure, I recently unboxed all the different iPhone 7's and 7 Pluses And I didn't notice anything myself but then people were showing me evidence of these phones making weird noises And I was like, 'What? That can't be right, that can't be possible, I got to run a test I got to show the people what's actually happening.' I got an iPhone 7 Plus, an iPhone 7, and even iPhone 6s for comparison. So, what is this hiss? It's this kind of little clickity-clackity static-y sound out of the back of the new iPhone, at least allegedly. If you hold it up to your ear, with the Apple logo sort of right infront of your ear, *Lew making static noises* When your device is under load, watching a video, playing a game, there's some sound involved You're playing sounds, so you really gotta go looking for this hiss, but then what if you're holding up your video camera, your phone is your video camera and that internal hissing gets picked up by the microphone which is located right beside that location? And then I was like, 'Oh, that might be an issue' Without further ado, you're gonna hear for yourself how this hissing sounds on the various devices and you can then determine whether you think it's a major issue or not. So let's kick it off, with the iPhone 7 Plus. *hissing sounds* So there you have it, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus tested here for hiss gate. So I had a very elaborate microphone setup. I wanted to make sure that the test was identical for each of the devices, cranked up the gain in order to find it. I don't know, you guys tell me what you think. If you didn't quite hear it, go back, turn up your headphones- put headphones on in the first place and listen back to it. You're gonna identify the unusual sound coming out of the iPhone 7. Is it overwhelming? Does it matter? I guess it's gonna be up to you. That's what this video was for, so you can make the judgement Let me know down in the comments what you think. Is this gonna affect your purchase? Maybe you're gonna avoid an iPhone 7 because of this? I'm not sure. That's why I want to hear what you have to say down below. Thank you very much for watching. If you missed my unboxing video, I showed to you every single of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. That's every one, even those jet black versions. So go watch that video. I maybe even be giving a couple away, so you can have your very own hiss fest. *laughs* Thanks for watching!",

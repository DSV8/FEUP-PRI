    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin'? I have a ton of double A rechargeable batteries, but they've always been a pain to keep organized. Stick around and I'll show you what I came up with, but it might not be what you expect. [ Music - Intro ] So this one should be pretty quick. I'm a big fan of Eneloop rechargeable batteries, and I've been looking for a decent way to store 'em. After doing a bit of research, I came with a pretty slick solution. It's a plastic case with individual spaces for each battery, and can hold 50 of 'em in total. The lid latches securely and even if you flip the case over, the batteries stay in place. But if you search online for double A battery cases, this one won't come up. That's because this isn't actually a battery case. Its intended purpose... is to store bullets. Specifically, a few varieties of rifle rounds. Apparently, double A batteries just happen to be about the same size. It's made by a company called MTM Case Guard, and the specific model is RSLD50-24. The only downside is that it can be a bit hard to find. It's available on Amazon, but only from third-party sellers, and not all the time. But it's downright cheap; about $4 US on average. And it's probably worth the effort to find one, if it keeps your desk drawer from looking... like this. If you like the video, I'd appreciate a thumbs-up, and be sure to subscribe if you haven't already.

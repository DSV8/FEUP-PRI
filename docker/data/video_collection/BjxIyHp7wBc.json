    "transcript": "(upbeat rock music) - [Elon] Welcome to the Cybertruck delivery event. So I'm gonna do it from the back of the truck here. So what, what we're aiming for here is something that has, that's more truck than truck, while also being a better sports car than a sports car. You know, trucks are tough. That's one of the defining characteristics of a truck. So we actually had to come up with a special ultra strong Tesla designed Steel Alloy. And part of the reason that it has this angular shape is you can't actually stamp these body panels. The body panels would break the stamping machine because of the steel exoskeleton. It actually has more torsional rigidity than a sports car. It has more torsional stiffness than a McLaren P1. In movies, you sometimes see the hero or heroine hiding behind the car door while being shot with bullets. That doesn't actually work, unless you're driving a Cybertruck. You know, and so people say like, \"Well, you know, why'd you make it bulletproof?\" I'm like, why not? (audience laughs) Now, you may remember an incident four years ago, (audience laughs) it didn't quite go as planned. And Franz, maybe we should try it again. (audience cheers) Yeah, great, I mean, I think you could, we could probably have a pro pitcher lob it at it and still work. You don't have to worry about like rocks hitting the glass and cracking the glass. This glass, this glass is, is basically rock proof. It's also makes the car very quiet. Because the center of gravity is so low it doesn't roll over. (audience cheers) And if you're ever in an argument with another car, you will win. (audience laughing) How tough is your truck? Because the, the, other trucks, the bullets go through both sides. So you shoot a bullet goes through both sides of the car. Now what about utility? Well, here we have the future towing the future. So it's got over a ton of payload capability, but you could really put more than that in it. You can tow over 11,000 pounds and it's got a super tough composite bed, no liner needed. The bed is six foot long, four foot wide, and you can fit four by eight feet, Four four by eight pieces of plywood in with the, with the, with the back down. Now what about performance? So this, I should say it's, it has an adaptive S suspension. So no matter what the load is, you, it will, you can always have the, it can set the, the right height at any, at at low height, anything. It'll automatically adjust the damping according to how much load it's carrying, and the road conditions. Has a 17 inch ground clearance. It has locking differentials, Rear Torque Vectoring. And the crazy thing is they'll do this all in comfort. It has steer by wire. It, it dynamically adjusts how, how much the wheels turn according to what your speed is. It's the first time that a car is moving to a 48 volt low voltage architecture from 12 volts, which has been around for a hundred years. And deliveries begin now. Thank you. (audience cheers) (upbeat techno music) So we're just, these are the actual owners. We're handing over Production Cybertrucks to their actual owners. Thank you for buying Cybertruck. Sometimes you get these like late civilization vibes, (audience laughing) you know, you never know when the, the apocalypse could come, come along at any moment. And at here at Tesla, we have the finest in apocalypse technology. (audience laughs)",

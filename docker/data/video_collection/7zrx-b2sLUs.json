    "transcript": "Now that we know what heat pumps are and how they work, its time to talk a little more about their future. If youve not seen the first video, well you definitely should fix that before watching this one as there will be a lot of stuff we talk about here that assumes prior knowledge. Ill summon a card. Bippity Boppity Card! Great! A link is below, and probably in a pinned comment, too. You ever heard about those? Theyre neat. I want to start with a clarification of sorts. Heat pumps definitely are the future of home heating, at least if I can help it, but theyrealso not new. And some people hate them! It seems for every person who thinks heat pumps are wickedneat-o closest-thing-to-free-energy-out-there devices (thats me) theres anotherwho hates theirs with a passion. Allow me to submit that you dont hate your heat pump, you hate your thermostat. See, as we learned, as the outdoor temperature approaches freezing it gets harder for air source heat pumps to work. A smaller temperature difference between the source of heat and the evaporator absorbing it causes the efficiency of heat pumpsto drop and eventually their output as well. Unfortunately, it is under these precise conditions that demand for heat goes up. Its kind of a bummer. So, most systems with heatpumps have some sort of backup heat source, be it electric resistive heat (often thisis called the heat strips, though I prefer to think of it as a giant hair dryer) ora fuel-fired furnace might be utilized. The trouble is, until quite recently the thermostats controlling these systems would just run the heat pump as hard it could until the output wasnt enough to maintain the set point. Only then would they switch to the auxiliary heat. That meant that air coming out of your heat vents would get milder to the point it was barely heat at all before the thermostat gave up and switched heat sources. That is undoubtedly annoying, and if youve lived with a heating system that behaves like this I can see why you wouldnt like it. But it doesnt have to be that way, and its not the fault of the heat pump. Instead of trying to run the heat pump until it just isnt enough anymore, a more thoughtful thermostat could handle things more thoughtfully. If the heatingsystem can determine its current coefficient of performance, it can determine whether it makes sense to run the heat pump in the first place. You could even program at which COP it should switch to auxiliary heat. That would allow you to prioritize comfort, energy costs, or emissions. Now, if your backup heat is electric, any COP greater than 1 will benefit you from a cost and emissions perspective and thatslargely why these systems will use the heat pump as long as they possibly can. Its saving youmoney! You ungr.... But you could still use this to force the backup heat on before you noticethe output falling if thats what you really wanted. If you have natural gas or some other fuel as your backup heat, you could choose to input the COP that is your break-even point on cost. Now, here inthe Chicago area, we have pretty cheap electricity and pretty cheap gas. By my calculations youneed a COP of about 4 in order for a heat pump to beat the cost of gas here. Thats certainlyachievable on many winter days with a heat pump, and certainly in the fall and early spring. But many times it isnt, and if you had a thermostat which was aware of the current COP and could switch to auxiliary heat based on it, well, youd be able to optimize for heating cost. Just compare your costs of energy sources, figure out what the COP break-evenpoint is, and set your system up accordingly. This is actually a legitimateuse for smart thermostats. Even if the heating system cant determine its own COP (which many simpler systems cant), that can be reasonably predicted based upon outdoor temperatures and system specs. A thermostat that can determine outdoor conditions can use this to its advantage, and knowing the outdoor humidity can even help it determine how often it needs to defrost the outside unit. Of course, this can be done locally with a temperature and humidity sensor, but if your thermostat were aware of the current energy mix on the grid in your area, it could also help reduce emissions by bending the COP changeover depending on whats advantageous. Ideally wed have some sort of pricingstructure where the cost of each energy source was related to its emissions, but thatsgetting deeper than this video needs to go. Oh, and speaking of defrosts. If you havea simpler heat pump system, you might be very aware of when that happens becausethe outdoor unit makes a tremendous racket. If thats a reason you dont like heat pumps, you should know that this is also not a necessary thing by any means. A lotof domestic HVAC stuff is controlled with little to no brains, if you will. Oftenthe thermostat is literally the only thing in control of the outside unit, and simplersystems will just slam the reversing valve while the compressor is still running. And thats whatscausing that racket. If instead the compressor were stopped before it reversed, allowingpressures to equalize, it would be much less noticeable. Thats how this mini-split heat pumpdoes it, and to my mind thats obviously better. I also cant see how changing the direction while the compressor runs isnt somewhat rough on it, but apparently its not so bad because lots of systems do this very thing. Anyway, the point here is the little annoyances you may have with your heat pump system are probably nothing to do with it being a heat pump. Instead its simply bad design. Or a case of misalignedpriorities. In my opinion, air conditioning systems like the one I just installed that haveno reversing capabilities should not exist. There is no reason this device cannot provide low-emissions heating other than a few components are missing from it which made it slightly cheaperto build. This is a case of but sometimes! thinking leading to the embrace of less flexible systems for virtually no reason. And its dumb. Yes, in my climate there are many days where an air-source heat pump would leave me in the cold. And thats a terrifying prospect - I completelyget it! Nearly everyone around me has natural gas or occasionally propane heating because in the deepestdepths of the winter you frankly need it. But since nearly everyone around me also has central air conditioning for our sweltering hot summers, they already have a heat pump, but it can only goone way because as of now few people see the point of redundant heating systems when you have cheapnatural gas anyway. But since whenever the COP of a heat pump exceeds 2.5 we can heat our homes with less fuel burned and ultimately lower emissions, why would we not want to make the air conditioner reversible for the many days of the year when thats absolutely possible? Well, frankly, the biggest barrier right now is direct cost to the consumer. As I said, in my area unless you can get to a COP of 4 itsjust not cost effective to run a heat pump over burning natural gas. And since there are many, many days in the winter where that COP is a lofty goal, even if running the heat pump is more climate friendly it may not be more wallet friendly. The added cost of a heat pump may never make financial sense inmy area, no matter how small the added cost might be. At least, so long as externalities remain free to energy providers. [various alarm sounds] Ope, too deep alert! And that is why theyre not standard equipmentaround here. Yet. But it should be noted that the financial practicality of a heatpump will depend entirely on your cost of heating fuel. If its not natural gas, oreven if it is but its more expensive for you, that math will be different. Now, if I were king,Id proclaim that every central air conditioning system sold must be reversible. Its equipmentwith a 10 to 20 year service life, and who knows what the availability and cost of heating fuel will be in 2041? Plus, we keep making strides in system efficiency and air-source heat pumpsare becoming viable in colder and colder climates. In fact, I just read a piece on their use in Alaska! It can absolutely be done even up there. But if you really want a heat pump to work in the coldest of the cold using the least amount ofenergy, you gotta go underground. Look down. See that? Its the ground! Turn around. Theres a human sku - sorry. Thinking of something else. You know how we havewater pipes going every which way underground and even in the dead of winter they dont freeze (usually)? Well, thats because the Earth is warm. Dig just a few feet below the surface and youll find the frost line. Below this imaginary line the ground doesnt freeze. Where that line is changesdepending on where you are, but its there! Management was just really bad about marking it when they built the place. Since heat pumps are great at extracting and concentrating heat energy from relatively cool places, and since theres a place right below our feet that doesnt get cold enough to freeze water no matter how cold it is outside, if wecould just get the heat energy from that place to the evaporator of a heat pump, we couldget more than enough heat to warm our homes no matter what time of year it is. And wouldnt ya know it, thisis a thing we know how to do! Ground-source or geothermal heat pumps scavengeheat from the ground below the frost line. There are two main ways to do this, andboth involve using an intermediary fluid to transfer heat energy. And yes, some newerideas dont use an intermediary fluid but were not talking about them today. Instead of anoutside unit like this with a large fan-driven, refrigerant-to-air heat exchanger, these systemswill have a refrigerant-to-liquid heat exchanger. Theres no law saying evaporatorshave to look like this, after all. Inside your home the equipment doesnt look too much different from a normal furnace or air handler, but the compressor (andsometimes theres more than one) as well as both heat exchangers are all right here. And to thoseworried about noise from the compressors, dont worry - theres plenty ofsound deadening. Engineers are smart! Whats special about these system is where they're getting their heat from. A long, closed loop of piping filled with a mixture of water and antifreeze is pumped in a circuit out of the home and underground where the liquid will absorb heat from the earth before being brought back inside. This now warmed liquid is fed to the heat exchanger which will absorb and concentrate that heat with the help of our friend therefrigeration cycle. The refrigerant is then squeezed into the condenser and that heat is released into the air and ultimately the living space. The benefit of doing this is that no matter what the air temperature is outside, the temperature of the fluid returning from the ground loop willbe a near-constant 50 degrees Fahrenheit or about 10 Celsius. That temperature allows a heat pump to run at peak performance and efficiency, delivering a nearly constant, near-maximum COP at full output no matter what. Right now you can expect it to always meet or exceed a COP of 4, and thatwill undoubtedly improve as technology advances. And thats obviously a huge deal! A home witha geothermal heat pump needs significantly less energy to heat than any other heating technology available today (unless you count home design itself and want to bring up the passivehouse but thats a topic for another time). Even with an entirely fossil-fuel powered electrical infrastructure, emissions are drastically reduced when using a ground-source heat pump. Remember, exceed 2.5 and youre getting more energy out of burning naturalgas in a power plant and sending its energy the zippy-zappy way than natural gas itself contains. Thats astonishing and yet completely possible. Also important is that methane, the main component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas, and the infrastructure we use to transport it to homes across the country is notoriously leaky. Not requiring that infrastructure in the first place provides its own emissions reduction. Whats more, the much lower energy requirement of homes with geothermal heat pumps opens up many more opportunities, particularly when it comes to renewable and locally-generated sources of power. Oh, and of course, these systems are entirely reversible. In the summer months, well below the frost line the Earth stays colder than the air outside! So in cooling mode, the system simply puts heat back into the Earth. Its actually almost poetic. That heat ends up simply being borrowed in the winter monts and returned in the summer. And being able to transfer it into a cool liquid means no matter how hot it is outside, thesystem will run at peak performance. Neat. So whats the catch? Eleven words. The upfrontcost and disruptive nature of the ground loop installation. That second parts getting better, but unless you happen to be lucky and have access to some natural body of water like a pond thatsdeep and large enough to use as your heat source (which is another way to go about it,by the way) there will have to be a network of piping installed under the ground to collectand transport its energy. For a long time, this meant excavating a large area around a home down to several feet (think about a meter-ish) below the frost line. Then youd go all loopy with a bunch of piping, and cover it back up. Hopefully you remembered to put the ends of that pipe somewhere useful. But thats really disruptive and requires a large area of lawn or similar open space. I mean, if youre building a new house somewhere and have room please just do it. Its the perfect time. Oh, and one interesting idea thats taking hold is community ground loops. A bunch of homes in a new development can be hooked up to a large, shared ground loop thats piped into each home. They each have their own heat pumps extracting energy from the fluid, but the geothermal equipment is shared, maximizingits potential and lowering the cost-per-user. But if you want to add a ground loop to an existing homesite it kinda sucks and sometimes isn't possible. However, a more recentand exciting development is the use of vertical drilling to go deeper rather than broader. Usingequipment similar to that which is used to dig a well for drinking water, a borehole can be dughundreds of feet below the soil, and a rather simple bit of piping down and then back up can be run to extract that earthy warmth. This is much less disruptive and easier to accomplish in areas with denser housing and little greenspace. Dandelion energy is one company installing such systems. Now, these arent cheap. Their own website admitsthat this is gonna cost about as much as a small car, and depending on how your energy is priced you may never recoup that investment. But regardless of where you are it will reduce greenhouse emissions, and hopefully energy starts getting priced to reflect that [alarm sounds return] oh sorry goin too deep again What Dandelion and companies like it are doing is really important for making geothermal heat pumps more approachable. Simply negatingthe need to tear up an entire yard is a huge step in the right direction for getting the reluctant onboard. But its by no means a one-size-fits-all solution. Unless you have the rights to dig that far down and theres nothing below you that could be a problem like abandoned mines, subway tunnels, etc well you cant do it. And what aboutin like, ya know, cities? Hows a large apartment building gonna get all the heat it needs from a borehole? Well, it cant. District heating, though, may be an indirect way to provide geothermally derived heat to large urban spaces. District heating isunfortunately not that common in the US which is a giant shame. Basically its anetwork of underground insulated pipes bringing really hot water into buildings that is then fed through radiators to heat them. One of the more clever ways to heat that water is with the waste heat of conventional power stations, and many countries have beendoing this for decades. It annoys me greatly that this hasnt been normal practice everywhere since power plants have been a thing, especially since water-loop systems for heating buildings are by no means a recent development. But anyway, that practice can be used to provide heat to urban centers without requiring combustion of fuels onsite or the immense electrical supplywhich would be needed with resistive heating alone. What you use to heat the water, then, is arbitrary. It could be a large geothermal station running massive heat pumps. Or you could evendrill deep enough to get heat directly from the magma kilometers below us, if youre feelingadventurous. This is all stuff thats being researched right now, and as usual theres pros and cons to every one of these. What gives? Well Ellen, there are no easy answers. But thisvideo was about heat pumps. While geothermal heat pumps may not exactly work in the concretejungles of New York City, air-source heat pumps certainly can. And maybe they wont make sense to use on really cold days, but really cold days are only some of the days of winter. We reallygotta stop this whole Only Solutions Which Cover Every Single Possible Contingency are Feasiblenonsense and start using what we can when we can. Thats kind of my whole point with the everyair conditioner should be reversible thing. Its unreasonable to me to limit their potential just because some days heat pumps cant work. We have the technology, so... so use it when possible! Oh yeah. Heres a really dumb thing. Electriccars, which nearly universally have air conditioning, are only justnow starting to make that reversible. Cabin heat is by far the largest non-locomotive energy use in an EV, and is a large part of why range drops in the winter. It has always been the case that a heat pump would help a lot with that, at least on milder days, and yet even some brand new EV models on sale do not offer them. Instead, resistive heat is your only option. I dont know if theres some trick to ruggedizing reversing valves for road use, or maybe theres something else that makes it harder for cars, but cmon! Heat pumps need to be standard in EVs. Figure it out! And if you can get a COP of 2 when its zero degrees out, fantastic. But ya know whats real neat? Were beginningto put heat pumps in more places to do more things besides just heat and cool our living spaces! Fundamentally, heat pumps are just heat energy relocators and concentrators. Iftheres a place where we need a lot of heat, we can sometimes take it from another and often with side-benefits as well. One real-world application of heat pumps not-for-heating is the hybrid water heater. OK, well I suppose that is still heating butconsider a typical North American water heater with a 50 gallon tank. Until recently, you hadtwo choices: electric or gas. Gas is cheaper to operate, but requires venting and also gas. Electric is more expensive to operate, but the device itself is little more than an oversized kettle. Now, the benefit of storing hot water in an insulated tank like this is that youve createda thermal battery. Hybrid water heaters use a heat pump to maintain the water temperaturein the tank, or you could say to keep the battery charged, and its ultimately getting thatenergy from the air of the room its sitting in. This not only uses a fraction of the energy that heating the water with electric heating elements does, but provides the additional benefit of free air conditioning and dehumidification in the area around the water heater! To collectthe energy it moves into the water it has an evaporator just like any air conditioner, and itgets cold and wet. This means hybrid water heaters need a drain line to deal with that condensate, butId sure like a dehumidifier in my basement that effectively costs less than nothing to run. Itsheating my water, and more cheaply than before! Of course, in the winter this is perhaps a bummer, but if you have gas heat like I do, well now your water heater runs on gas! Just, indirectly. Andif you had a geothermal heat pump, well it would get its heat from the ground after your mainheat pump first brought it to your home for you. Anyway, its a hybrid water heater because these also have traditional heating elements to deal with periods of high demand. The heatpump is slower than good ol fashioned hot sticks. But, assuming you dont have a showerthon going on in your house, it can take its time reheating the water in the tank between uses using aslittle as a quarter the energy of an ordinary electric heater. The potential for heatpumps to be used in water heaters, by the way, has made me fairly anti-tankless water heater. Its amyth that tankless water heaters provide you with instant hot water - it still has to get throughyour pipes, and if you want instant hot water what you really need is a hot water recirculation system and your plumbing to be completely redone, or maybe you can get away with point-of-use booster heaters. But anyway, now that I know that heat pump water heaters are a thing I haveno desire to go tankless. Save that energy, baby! Another really neat development, andperhaps even more so is the heat pump clothes dryer. Tumble dryers are a sort ofguilty pleasure to me. Oh sure, they save tons of time and space but they also use a lotof energy and are typically vented outside, which not only means there needs to be a vent in the first place but also creates significant negative pressure when theyrun. But what do dryers really do? Well, they basically just tumble clothes around a drum with hot air blowing through it which makes the clothes dry faster. Making the air hot is the energy intensive part, buuuuuut Thats right. Heat pump it! Heat pump clothesdryers are frankly amazing because its about the perfect application for the technology. You justneed to get the inside of the dryer hotter than the outside. Yeah, you could do that withheater coils or even with a lil gas furnace, but theres plenty of energy from the room its sitting in for a heat pump to take and concentrate. And none of it gets lost -it just gets concentrated inside. Best of all, you can then exhaust the hot, damp air that exits the drum over the cold evaporator and not only re-collect that energy to be pumped backin but also the moisture from the clothes. You end up with a clothes dryer that needs much less energy to run, doesnt need venting, and can be placed anywhere. Some of them can evenbe plugged into a standard 120V electrical outlet! Heat pump clothes dryers are slower than traditional vented solutions, but they offer great flexibility and a much lower energy cost. Even ifyou have a gas dryer, eliminating the need for a vent will lower your heating and cooling demandwhen it runs thanks to there no longer being a machine blowing the air you paid to heat or cooloutside. Its really kind of a no-brainer to me. Using a heat pump not only makes it cheaperto run but solves real problems. That is, if youre willing to have your laundry take longer, which I recognize is not feasible for everyone. Now, there is one real downside to the proliferation of heat pumps. To make them, we need refrigerants. And refrigerants have createda Whack-A-Mole of engineering challenges. When we first ventured down the path of refrigeration, we were using gaseous ammonia as a refrigerant. It was actually a fantastic refrigerant, but itwas very toxic and leaks were very dangerous to human life. That was the problem that ThomasMidgely Junior solved with the creation of Freon. Freon was the first non-toxic non-flammablerefrigerant, and we were thrilled to have it! Of course, decades later we realized the ozone layer was disappearing and we figured out that CFCs like Freon were the culprit. So, replacementrefrigerants were developed like our friend R-134a. These HFCs dont harm the ozone layer, but they are ridiculously potent greenhouse gases. This here is over 1,400 times better at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Great! Even though in an ideal world it will never leave the refrigerant loop, eventually refrigeration systems develop leaks. If you ever bought one of these to recharge your A/C, thats why. So these HFCs are being phased out for newer refrigerants like 2,3,3,3-Tetrafluoropropene also known as R-1234yf. This refrigerant has a global warming potential of less than 1, so as far as we can tell its harmless. Currently, these new refrigerants are rather expensive. And the reason is patently obvious. Its patents. These next-gen refrigerantsare protected by patents and their owners are absodidily OK with exploiting that and hard. Now,that was once the case for this fella. But those patents have expired and thats why Walmart can sell it in these cans for less than $5. In some states, anyway. Perhaps my most radicalthought Ill put forth here is that patents on things like, oh I dont know, climate-friendlyrefrigerants that we really need to make a lot more of and fast should be invalidated. Maybewe ought to consider some classes of things unpatentable and instead encourage theirdevelopment through some sort of prize system or just develop them publicly from the start I dontknow just spitballin here. I just think its not great that R-1234yf costs 10 times as much asthe chemical its replacing because we need that! Then again, there is another option. Carbondioxide can actually be used as a refrigerant, although when you do that it prefers you call it R-744. Its more polite. Now if youre wondering, Well if thats possible why havent we just been doing that from the start? Ill tell ya! The working pressures you need to make carbon dioxide a refrigerant are... quite high. Think 1,000+ PSI. That means the refrigeration equipment needs to be much morerobust in order to handle it, making it more expensive. More traditional synthetic refrigerants... thatsounds wrong but, yes dont need such high pressures and so refrigeration systems using themare just easier to build. So right now its pick your poison. Cheap system, expensivegas or cheap gas but expensive system. But anyway, weve talked about all I wanted to talk about heat pumps. For now, anyway. I fully expect them tofind their way into more and more places, and Im sure well address many of their flaws as time goes on. And if we can make an air-source heat pump operate with a COP of 4 in arctictemps, well golly gee thatd just be neat-o! I hope we can do it. But one thing is forsure about the future. Im pumped for it. geothermally smooth jazz I wanna - [incessant coughing] And if you had a thermostat which was aware of its current ... bleugh. Hoo hoo hoo hoo I skipped a word! What was that in the script? Aware of the current COP yeah that wasjust an error and I f.. I s.. I.. I made it! Turn around. Theres a humansk .. sorry. [evil laughter] Even with an entirely fossil-fuel powered electrical infrastru thats a lot of big words in this one. Now the benefits of storing hot water in an insulated tank like this is that the benefit! Aehehehe! A bore hole can be dug hundreds of feet below the soil, and rather than [rude raspberry] So, are we pumped? Are we pumping up the jam? You know, somebody probably has that job at the Smuckers factory. And then when the jars get put on pallets? Those folks always end with jam-packed days.",

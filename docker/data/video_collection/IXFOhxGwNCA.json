    "transcript": "(paper ruffling) - dbrand is obviously best known for making colorful stickers for your electronics. But the problem with stickers, is that it's hard to get them to stick to irregularly shaped objects, like the PlayStation 5, and, well eventually, no matter how precision cut they are, they can tend to have problems. Ah, here's my, oops, you got a little flappy doodle on my iPhone 12 Pro here. So, new idea. Inside this box is two things. One, is what they're calling Dark Plates. Replacements for the ugly PlayStation 5 side panels. And number two, is I'm expecting a bag of money. Because dbrand sponsored this video, and I did not say how much to pay for the video. I just said, surprise me. So, I promised that I would unbox however much they paid for this sponsorship, live. Live in front of all of you. So far, there's no bag of money. We've got some dbrand skins. I don't know what they're for. Oh, so it's just plates for the sides and they still have skins. All right, cool. And then inside here, we have allegedly, Dark Plates. I don't hear any bags of money. Okay. Purchased, delivered, you're welcome. install. There was only one correct way, dbrand.com/how Okay, we've got some packing materials. We've got a piece of plastic. How fun is that? It looks like they don't wanna get sued quite so bad after all. So the original PlayStation 5 cover, has little Xs and circles and triangles, like little tiny ones. And they've gone and they've put a more dbrand spin on that. So they've got little radioactive signs and skull and crossbones and, little robot heads. Actually, they did a shockingly good job of the detail of this. No offense, dbrand, you guys always do a shockingly good job. It's just never ceases to shock me, that's all. I would say that's pretty mad. The one disappointment I have so far is that I have yet to locate a bag of money. dbrand, you know how this influencer thing works? Okay, so I have the influence, and you have the bags of money. Maybe it's like one of those drug cars, David. You gotta, slice it open. Gold embedded in these, side panels. (rock music) I mean, they're clear, but you never know. It could be diamonds inside. (phone dial tone ringing) - [Voicemail] Your call has been forwarded to a voicemail. Your call has been forwarded to a voice. - Oh, you don't dodge my call so easy. - [Voicemail] Your call has been forwarded to a voicemail service, that has not been initialized by the customer you are calling. - Wow! Isn't that amazing? In the time between them sending this package and me opening it, dbrand went out of business. (laughter) The robot's voicemail is not even connected. Well, that's unfortunate. You know what? We're gonna continue the rest of this unboxing, but, I'm a lot less angry now that I know that they're going through such hard times. Unfortunately, I guess this also means that you won't actually be able to buy this product. But, that's okay 'cause at least my PlayStation 5 won't be an ugly white mess. All right, let's pop this thing off. To remove the stock panels, all you do is pull up, and, pull up and slide. Man, this thing is so ugly I think it actually looks better raw dog. Now, let's go ahead and put on the, what do they call it? Dark Plate? Put on the Dark Plate. When I first heard about this project, I had kinda thought they were gonna go a different route and like do a thick plate that actually fills in kind of the weird shape of the PlayStation 5 and makes it more, square. But, with that said, I mean, I don't know how you would do a mold for something that thick. So I guess it sort of makes sense that they'd just gone with making it a more unassuming color. Not bad and kudos. Kudos on the fitment job. This is like, some OEM grade plastic here. And I mean that in like a good way. Like, I wouldn't know, unless I looked real close and saw that these were like you know, the wrong little texture things here. That this isn't just an official PlayStation 5, ugly, you know, color thing. Okay, so I'm just gonna, I'm going full yellow up in this place. I believe that is a, \"Nailed it\" moment. Look how perfectly that lines up at the back. So that's it. That's a dbranded PlayStation 5. I think I was supposed to be the first one to show one. But based on that they break all their other promises and don't exist anymore as a company, it's possible that other people have uploaded videos with it already. But hey, we tried, Thanks to dbrand for sponsoring this video, you worthless liars. And thanks to you guys for watching. Don't forget to subscribe to Short Circuit. I mean, okay, they didn't lie. They did surprise me. I was, expecting to actually be paid for a sponsored video. This is, quite unusual.",

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video, and today I've got something for you that from the outside looks pretty standard, but it's got a special feature that might just surprise you, but before we get completely inside let's take a look around. It's got a nylon construction, very slim. Very slim profile, zipper on the outside... Put your stuff in there, that's kind of the point. Backside padded back, padded shoulder straps. Relatively standard compartment here as well, for a laptop - that is very soft... I'm enjoying them... \"All right Lew, I get it, what's the big deal here?\" It's a backpack! No no no... no! From a company called Cocoon... Excuse me?! What am I looking at? This GRID-IT organizer is what makes this Cocoon company famous. Now, you could buy a standalone GRID-IT to slide into your bag, or you can buy one of their products that has it built-in. You've got this series of elastic bands in this weave formation. And what that allows you to do is set everything up, and for each object you decide to take with you a home, a little nook, a little cranny, a place to relax. Could be up here, could be this little corner, could be somewhere else. Let's load this baby up! Ok, so i've got a bunch of stuff, now stuff that I normally travel with... These are the objects that get dumped just into the main compartment of the bag and are essentially disorganized most of the time. Let's go ahead and see what happens when I try to fit them all into the GRID-IT system. Whoo-hoo-hoo... Ok, so here you can see the setup, a rough idea of what I might be traveling with... There's a dedicated spot for everything. Now, in the first place when you're mapping it out it might be a little bit confusing as you wonder what to put, where I actually found it useful to kind of like mentally place them out... What do I have here, okay, so I have my Nexus 6P, a power brick for my Macbook Pro, portable little battery to which i will carry then this tiny little USBC cable... I've got some toothpicks, I'm a big fan of toothpicks in general... These are my little earplanes, earplugs - earplane's earplugs. That's one of my most prized possessions, I know that sounds crazy, but these things have saved my brain so many times... I have a space pen which is a new addition, it will write upside down, these are cool little portable pens, got some gum... Of course the secret wallet, you guys know this from that previous video. This, my favorite cable on the planet which has every connector in the world, an extra power brick. That's pretty much it, you could use this for anything, it doesn't even need to be tech or gadgets. Whatever it is that you're trying to organize then this guy flips up on top, zips down and when you hop that back open, it's where you left it and where you expect it to be. You want to remove something real quick - you got it. It could be tools, it could be survival stuff, it could be tech stuff... It's up to you, that's the beauty of it. What will you put inside of your cocoon?",

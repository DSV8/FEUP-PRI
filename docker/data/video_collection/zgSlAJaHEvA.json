    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to this is Austin. Do you think that Sony needs to expand the back catalog of PS3? - I think they should buy Nintendo. - Look I'm still reeling over. You told me that the acquisition between Microsoft and Activision was roughly the same market cap as Nintendo. And I can't stop thinking about that. - It is wild, but today we're talking about a slightly different thing. That's actually a little bit more relevant to us. Non-billionaire gamers, which is the rumors are starting to heat up. The PS5 might, might, might be getting PS3 back compatibility, maybe. - So it's, I mean, we are basing this off of very small facts, but-- - It could be you can see PS3 games on your PS5. - Correct. - Which you shouldn't be doing it backwards compatibility is not a thing, but they say it's a bug. Oh no, I accidentally coded in all these games and prices and download sizes. And we've kind of been talking about this for a long time. That really the thing that PlayStation is lacking right now is any type of backward compatibility. That is the one thing that like X-Box is absolutely dominating in this comparison of just bringing the back catalog. There are so many, X-Box 360 games. - A Serious Astro series as can basically play every X-Box with some exceptions. Generally speaking, almost every X-Box game that's ever been made. - Which is excellent. - With the exceptions of games that X-Box can't play, it's almost like, well, there's some exceptions that the PlayStation can play. We're not just talking about like AAA titles that were available on PS3 that are not available on PS4 or PS5. These are exclusives almost the entire metal gear solid collection, little big planet, the one and two of those ratchet and clank, the HD remastered splinter cell remastered. It's twisted metal. These are big franchises that you cannot play on PS5 or even PS4. And that's a big deal. - It is. And I think there are a lot of questions here. One of the big ones was the PS4 famously never had any backwards compatibility because it was such a different architecture. Now Microsoft kind of thought ahead a little bit. They're actually able to customize the chip on the Xbox One and all the subsequent chips to be able to have a little bit of extra spice to help with backwards compatibility. Now on the Sony side, the PS3 was infamously difficult to develop for it because it had a very complicated cell architecture with all the SPU's. It had this proprietary NVIDIA GPU. It was a weird device. Now the PS3 was incredibly powerful for its day, but it took basically the entire console generation before developers are really able to get their hands around it. And because of that complexity, when it came time for the PS4 to come out, Sony was like, nah, no backwards compatibility whatsoever. And while yes, we can play PS4 games on a PS5 that's very, very much closer. And then one thing to talk about here is the potential of the PS5 to actually emulate PS3 games because the PS4 did not have the power for it. I completely believe that no matter how much sort of Sony magic you put on it. But I do believe the PS5 could run PS3 games, mostly because, well, you can do it on a PC. So there's an emulator called RPCS3. It is a very high compatibility PS3 emulator. Now this is only a few years old, but it has gotten better very quickly. This is an incredibly complicated system to emulate. You've got that weird NVIDIA GPU that there's next to no documentation on. You have to emulate all these sort of weird, like SPU core things. As of right now, I'm looking at the site right now. Out of 3,250 games available for the PS3, 63% of them are playable on PC, 0% of them don't work at all, which is an incredibly impressive feat 'cause really this is the open source community who's putting this together. The thing is to run this, obviously you need a very powerful computer. Now it can technically run on most systems, but if you wanna get any decent level of compatibility, you're gonna want at least six cores of a Zen to AMD architecture, AKA the exact same CPU that's inside a PS5 in a series X. And you also want an AMD Vulkan GPU that's 4,000 series or newer, again the exact same kind of GPU that you'll find inside of PS5. There's no reason for the PS5, not to technically be able to play PS3 games. Now I am not gonna sit here and tell you that that is a simple thing to enable. Obviously the developers and the community behind RPCS3, such a hard name to say. They've spent years putting this together. I remember those first proof of concepts were incredibly basic and people were just blown away that like a simple 2D game would work. - Yeah, I remember it used to be like, what? Something like eight times the performance of the original system is what you need to emulate it. - It's very very difficult. But I think technically the PS5 can run PS3 games. The question is, is Sony going to do it? Because we've seen for months and months now, rumors swirling that Sony is working on their Game Pass competitor. What a great selling point for that. If they're able to bring PS3 games back to the PS5 you get once monthly Sony subscription, boom, you got your ratchet and clank, your grantors mow, your PS 1, 2, 3, 4 classes. - That's really the question I have is, do you think that they will end up doing this for free? Or?-- - Oh, okay. - One thing that a lot of people have been saying, is like, I wanna weigh the play my collection of games. I have all these games. I have a big collection of PS3 games. I cannot play the moment PS5. Do you think that when they open this up, if people will be able to play that? I don't think they will. I think you're gonna have to pay for it. - Well, actually it was really interesting the way that the Microsoft side of the house handled backwards compatibility. Because if I own a X-Box 360 game and it is compatible with the Xbox one of the Xbox series X, I put it into my console. It actually doesn't do anything besides check the license, because it actually downloads a copy of that game. That's been slightly modified, basically all the backers compatible titles are like 99% the same, but they have to add a little spice on them to actually make them work, right? But basically the disc serves as the authentication say, hey, look, I own this game. I'm gonna download it. It downloads it like as a patch. I don't think Sony is gonna do the same thing. My bet-- - I don't think there's any reason that they couldn't do the same thing. But we, we see all these rumors of them doing like a tiered version of Game Pass. From a business side of things I say like the only way to play these games is to use a subscription service. - Pay? - Pay to play. - [Guy In Blue] And it has to be better than PS now, by the way. - [Austin] Of course, I mean-- - PS now is such a poor experience. If you think about it, the reason the backwards compatibility is so strong on Xbox, is because in the dark days of the Xbox one generation, that was one of the only things they had going for them. That was like a major selling point. And they were trying to get all the goodwill with cameras that they possibly could. Sony is not really in that position right now. Sure, could they enable this where you can use your own disks? Absolutely. Should they probably... But I don't think they're in the position where they need to and if they can charge, I mean, same thing with Nintendo, right? Nintendo, how many times are they gonna charge you for Nintendo online and then the eShop and all these different ways to purchase a game. - How many times did you bought a version of Super Mario, brothers? They resell without doing anything to them, by the way. Which is exactly like what I think that Sony is gonna do. I don't think there's gonna be any type of like remastering purposes, whereas like X-Box they went through and did the FPS boost on as many games as they could. (indistinct) - Yeah. I don't see Sony doing anything like that. I think they're gonna put them up on the streaming service as is and call it a day. - There have been some patents that do suggest that Sony could give a little bit of juice to these older games, but even if they do, I just, I'm not entirely convinced that this is going to be to the same level that Microsoft has spent eight years doing. - And it's like, it's easy to say, \"look, we're beating a dead horse here.\" We're constantly talking about Microsoft, Microsoft, Microsoft, but they have 100% led the way with backwards compatibility. Sony has not done anything. I mean, they used to be great. Remember the PS2 had a full PS1 chip built inside, the PS3, the launch versions. Sony used to be like, they're basically the first company to really do backwards compatibility. You know, like you could play N64 game on your GameCube or whatever. After the PS3 generation, where they realized how much money they were losing and they gave up on backwards compatibility with PS3 and with PS4, they have a long road ahead to make this really worth it. And if it's part of a 10, 15, $20 month subscription, there are some games that I would love to play again on a PS5, especially if there's any kind of advantages. But, man, it's tough to see how they're gonna do this in a way that's actually gonna make sense as a gamer. - Me as first party game back in the day was spiral. Was Crash Bandicoot. These are all titles that are now owned by Microsoft. It almost feels like, and I don't actually think this is necessarily a bad thing, but I feel like that Sony is kind of shedding their PS1, PS2 skin. And just focusing on the era of PS3 art. Like if you look at their identity of what are their mascots for their games, what are their big titles? God of war. Infamous was big in the-- - Uncharted. - Uncharted. - Last of us. - Yeah. So like all of these things happen pass PS3 on. If we do see some of this backwards compatibility, I would be shocked, if the backwards compatibility with anything more than a handful of games for one and two, where it's mostly focusing on the PS3 era. - It's reasonable, I mean, look, there is an enormous amount of money to be made with a subscription PS plus, whatever they wanna call it, right? But like a Game Pass style subscription that can include PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PS5 games, people will pay a lot of money for that. I feel very confident, but there's so many ways that this could go, right? And you look at like Ubisoft, they have their own subscriptions. - Every company in the world is trying to find a way to do a subscription services. It's proven that's the only way to make sustainable money on products because someone can buy like one version of a game and play it forever. And then they made nothing on that console. - We are a 100% in the gold rush right now, there's so much money floating around the gaming industry right now. There's so many acquisitions happening. I feel like we're gonna look back on this early 2020 era of when things have changed in a huge way. And I think the next big step really is so much, not only try to bring some of that backwards compatibility, but really figure out whatever their Game Pass competitor is. If they nail it, I think they're gonna be a good shape, but if they get too greedy or they don't have enough or whatever the case is, I think it's gonna be an uphill battle. But I'm very curious. What do you think about this PS3 backwards compatibility and what Sony's real answer to Game Pass is gonna be? Let us know in the comments below. Make sure to subscribe to this is for other hot takes like Sony good, X-Box bad, or I don't know, whatever, whatever. - The 10 cent by Sony.",

    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is. We have in front of us, the holy grail of smartphone technology. Not the iPhone, not the Samsung, not the Galaxy, not the Huawei. This, did I pause for dramatic effect. - Dun dun dun. - [Austin] Is the Yahoo phone. Yes, my friends, 2003 called and they want back. - For those of you who are unaware, Yahoo is owned by Verizon, and they are taking advantage of their wireless, to create, Yahoo mobile. Again, this is, technically their flagship phone. Oh. - Oh, hit me with it, I see. - I like this already, I like it. (cheering and jeering) So it comes off, I'm looking at like our camera. It comes off so much more blue. I don't know how well, how purple it comes off on this camera. This is-- - [Austin] Is Yahoo purple. - This is purple a.f. So, there's an interesting thing. Someone correct me, because, I feel like this can't be the first one, But in the box comes a USB-C cable. - Wait, what? - But also a removable battery. - [Austin] Yo, I have not seen a phone that has-- - [Matt] Yeah, has that ever has, I don't know, has there ever been another phone? I don't know. - As you might have guessed from the $50 price, this is a budget boy, as the kids say. (Matt laughs) - So the specs on this guy, 32 gigs of storage with two gigs of RAM. So you can expand it. It is running Android 10. It is, the MTK, which that-- - Mediatek? - Mediatek. 6761 quad core two gigahertz CPU. - I mean, that's about as cheap as it gets. - Yep But I guess it has LTE, so you can't complain too much. - It has a five megapixel front facing camera. It has an eight megapixel rear facing camera. It has a built-in fingerprint scanner. That screen is a 5.45 inch, 18 by nine display and is 1440 by 720. - Okay. - So. - I mean, look, to be fair, we're talking 50 bucks here. - $50. - Now the thing is, a lot of times you can get good deals on much better phones for that kind of price, right? A lot of the sort of mainline carriers will give you several hundred dollars off, or like gift cards or whatever when you buy a new phone. But this is a completely pre-paid carrier, right? So you don't get any kind of like real subsidies. - Right. - Although we'll talk about that there should you have some deals on some other things. - They have some deals. - But, look, you're talking about a $50 phone, that the service is relatively cheap on too. Like this is like a budget-budget device. But, 50 bucks, you got like, look, we gotta check our privilege for half a second here and think about it. No, think about it for a second, right? If you need a device that will function as a phone and get things done, there's no reason why the Blade A3Y Yahoo phone couldn't Google map you around, take blurry photos, watch some YouTube videos at potato quality. It'll at least get the job done with your removable battery. - One of the real benefits to Yahoo mobile is it's one of the app-based and more importantly, no credit check, type of cell phone carriers. They often require deposits on phones and-- - They get mad at you when you don't pay your bill. - Yeah, who's got money for that? So this year, I was able to sign up for this service on Austin's credit card, - What? - [Matt] within about three minutes. So, and the real beautiful thing is, they overnight it this to us. The overnight shipping probably cost more than the phone. - Wait. Oh, look at that. Couldn't connect. It would not use our Wi-Fi. - So about that. Is it, will it not use our Wi-Fi because we have Spectrum and not Verizon? - It can detect. - It can detect our Wi-Fi (laughing). Yeah, this is a, about as budget phone as it gets. - Well, - Like-- - It has a fingerprint sensor. That's not nothing. It's got, well I'll say, an okay display. Like it's usable. It's certainly not the sharpest thing in the world but it's fast. - I will say that the viewing angle is actually pretty decent. Just me being off angle. And I can read this better than some, you know, like it's checking for updates right now. - Yeah, I don't know if we're ever gonna get past that screen. The hardware doesn't feel terrible. I mean, it's obviously plastic city. But it's fine. - So I don't, I hate it already. - Okay, go ahead. - And, what I hate about it is that the back sides here, I don't know how well this is gonna come off on camera, are actual, like, this is more, it like bezels out. This three different materials here. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] So it's plastic. This feels like it might actually be metal, like a metal frame. - 1000%, it's just different kind of plastic. - I don't know, like feel that. - Lemme see that. - It's right here? - Yeah. - 100% plastic. I guess my thought, if you're tryna to put this in perspective, - Yeah. - $50 is like, I don't know, 20 Coffees. A couple of tier-three subs, or you can get an entire smartphone. You know, like an iPod Touch costs 200 bucks. Right, like, I'm just saying 50 bucks, five-zero. That's not a lot of money. - I know. But like, if you hate holding the product, is it, Is like if that deters you from actually using it. - Fingerprint, you know what I don't hate? Something to read my fingerprint and I wish the iPhone wouldn't do. Shameless call out to get people to comment. - [Austin] Yeah - When you actually put your finger on it, like you're sinking your finger in there. It doesn't like naturally rest. - It's not a button that you're pressing. It feels like it is 'cause you, so this is like a weird but interesting thing. - Hey, but if you know what I do wanna know about. Tell me about Yahoo Mobile. Why am I using Yahoo Mobile? 'Cause I know it's based on the Verizon network, - [Matt] Yes. - Here in the US. What do I get with Verizon Mobile? - So for $40 a month, you get unlimited everything. - 40, four zero? - Yes, four zero. - Okay, okay. - So it's, and it's one of the, you know, no contract cancel any time type of thing, but it's unlimited tax, unlimited-- - And you bought this phone outright, right? So like, - Yes. - $50 I own, well, actually I guess-- - Well, so you can own-- - You bought it. - You can't buy it, without the service. So there was no option just to buy the phone. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. So like we had to sign up for service to get this phone. So it's unlimited talk, text, data. It is limited to 4G, but I mean-- - Totally, - Totally fine. So, but here's the thing. I still don't know why people would go to Yahoo versus, say, Mint Mobile. - Okay, so that's a great comparison. So, just as a disclaimer, Mint Mobile sponsored as in the past, and they currently sponsored my podcast, \"The Test Drivers,\" shameless plug, you should be listening to the podcast, \"The Test Drivers,\" available at relay.fm/testdrive is available within the description. All right, well that was a perfect segue. Mint Mobile, I think is generally a better deal because it's 30 bucks a month for unlimited, and it includes 5G. - Correct, the other downside to this versus say something like Mint or Google Fi, there's only the one plan, it's 40 bucks period. Where-- - Wait, that's it? - That's it, that's the only plan. So where if you're not a power user, on Mint, you can be as low as like $15 a month. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] You know. - [Austin] Same thing with Fi. Fi is actually pretty cheap as well. - So, you know, I don't know. Like, I guess really the only scenario where I can see where someone picks this over Mint or Google Fi, is if you live in an area where you don't get T-Mobile coverage, which is what those two use. - While we set the phone into Yahoo Mobile again, so I could try to figure out what the actual deal is with service, a couple of observations about this. - Yeah - The plastic screen feels terrible. It's so sticky. It feels like you've got like a really cheap screen protector on. Oh, I just crashed again. I'm trying to open up the Yahoo Mobile app on the Yahoo phone. - To activate our service. It's not even (laughs) It's not even like, oh, it's crashing and we're trying to cancel it. We're trying to give them money. While this fails to activate, the thing were Yahoo Mobile is actually been really good is, right now it's the cheapest place to get a lot of flagship phones. So, using the iPhone 12, for example, if it's $840 from them, which is actually maybe what, 10 bucks, more than anyone else? - It is, actually. - [Matt] But-- - I think it's 830 without the subsidy. - But, you get a $200, was it MasterCard Virtual Account, which is basically just a virtual debit card. So-- - 200 bucks, not bad. - So suddenly, yeah. $640, that's great. - But what's the cheapest phone I can get that on? - iPhone 11, you get a $200 card off. And so that is, right now, it's 576. So you're essentially paying 376 for an iPhone 11. - Okay, yeah. I can pay sub $400 for an iPhone 11. That is absolutely worth it. - Yeah, I mean like, you, so you get the $100 with the A51. But like the Pixel 4, you get $200 off. So you can get the Pixel 4 for 400 bucks. - Samsung Galaxy A11. So it's 179 with $100 gift card. So there are some good deals to be found here. - Yes. - Generally good deals. But it requires you to sign up. Okay, so let's see details. I bet there's some bull that they're gonna catch us on. \"Get a $200 prepaid virtual account when you join our plan and buy a phone. Order an eligible device,\" - [Matt] Yep. - [Austin] \"We'll send you the phone and the SIM. Download and sign in. You have to pay for two months and then you'll get an email to get it.\" There are two ways of looking at this. First of all, there's the Yahoo phone itself. This is a purple ZTE phone that costs you 49.99. And it performs like a phone that costs you 49.99. - So let me ask you, 'cause you, every complaint I made you just like $50. Now you, have you succeeded in setting that up. - I did. - Did you? How long did that take, this entire video? - Yes. - Now if I, if I was to say again, Oh, for $180 for that OnePlus, the Nord N100, what, now are you gonna say, \"Oh, $50?\" - I will say, while $50 is still a reasonable price if you just wanna get into it. If you look at something like that Galaxy A11, which is like 180 bucks and you get $100 gift card back, I would say that is well worth the $30 if you actually plan on using it, 'cause obviously that's not gonna be. It's that purple though, to be fair. So, okay. Look, Yahoo phone, bad, don't buy. Thank you for clicking on my clickbait title, but, don't buy this phone. The Yahoo service is a weird one because, first of all, why are they using the Yahoo brand? But if you get rid of that for a second, - But like what you get here is not crazy, but I still think I like Mint more. - Yeah, I agree. - You're just like relying on like a one time deal when you buy a new phone, which is nice. But especially if you already have a phone, or even if you wanna like average it out long-term, 30 bucks for unlimited, in my opinion, or not even in my opinion, 30 is better than 40. - Yeah. - So, - The only scenario I can think of, that you'd go with Yahoo Mobile over any of the other budget ones. - Yeah. - Is if in your particular area T-Mobile doesn't work. So like, I know we're, I mean, it's been a while since I've tried T-Mobile in Rochester where I'm from. I know for years T-Mobile was garbage there. - Sure. - Granted, again, this is 10 years ago. So like, I would say go with this one over that. But, it's just, it's a really hard sell. - Agreed. You know what also is a hard sell? - Anyone trying to buy Yahoo, because (laughing). - [Ken] This is. - Thank you very much, Ken, a hard sell is subscribing to This Is.

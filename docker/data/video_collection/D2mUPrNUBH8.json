    "transcript": "- Today, I wanna show you guys some new cases that I just got from Razer. And you guys might know Razer as the gaming company that has all kinds of crazy accessories, and computers, and microphones, and headphones. They even have their own phone, the Razer phone, which is mostly geared towards mobile gaming. But this is kinda exciting 'cause they now have iPhone cases. And what's great about these, is they have these little perforations for cooling. They have like a really soft little inner lining to protect your phone from scratching. This is not sponsored, by the way. But they did send me these to check out, and I wanted to make this video because I'm a huge fan of Razer. So, trying these cases out has been something that I was really excited about when I first saw that they launched these. So, thank you Razer. I can't wait to try these out. I also love the look of it, and I love that they have a pink version. Obviously. So, I have three different cases here. They have a slim version and then a pro version. The thin one is obviously thinner, so it's not rated for a three meter drop like the thicker pro version is. Okay, so this one is made for iPhone 11 Pro, and the pink one, I have for the iPhone ProMax. And the white one for the iPhone 11. But they sent three different versions in the three different colors. So this is the one that has the certified drop protection, and as you guys know, I had my phone for not even an hour, and I dropped it. And everyone thought that that video was faked. Oh God! Oh no! So yeah, that video was real. I don't do drop tests and I never really plan on doing them. So, that was something that was not planned and it just so happened and honestly, I was in shock. So this case, you can tell that it has protection all around it. Where as a lot of these cases, the bottom is open to allow a lot more access to the speakers. This is not a knife. Just gonna use this HDMI cable then to open this. Get in there. I need a knife. How come I don't have a knife. Ah, here we go! Here it is! Look at this, you've got the lovely green Razer accent. This will actually look pretty good, I think, around the green iPhone. Look at that, so the green kind of peaks through the little perforations. This is a nice little soft cloth, which is good, 'cause it'll protect your phone from getting scratched. So what's what the first case looks like. This is the Arctech Pro. (thumping) To see what it would feel like if it fell. Again this is a little thicker, the case as opposed to the slim ones that we're gonna check out now. I'm not gonna test it. This is the pink one, so this is the Arctech Slim. And this is for the pro version. Oh my gosh! This is everything. I think I like the look on the cover but oh my gosh, I'm just so excited. I don't like being a stereotypical girl who likes pink but I'm so sorry. No, I'm not gonna apologize for what I like. I like what I like and if you don't like it, I don't think I have to apologize. This is what I like and we're gonna try it out. So this also has the open bottom but I get it because you are trying to have a slimmer case. That makes it so much easier to put your phone into. This probably would also look really good with the white case, but because this has this little gray around there, it kinda pulls in the white from the white phone. Okay, so I might have found my new case for the time being. It matches my whole outfit and my fingernails, which I need to get this pink off because I'm kinda sick of it at this point. Here's pink with the perforations. The box is even all pink. So in the back here it says it has a thermo phene layer, so that improves performance and battery life for smartphones which makes sense, because if your phone is getting really hot of overheating. If you're doing a lot of processor intensive things, that also tends to suck the battery life out of your phones. So having something that will help with cooling, definitely makes sense. Vented channels for increased air flow, wireless charging compatibility. Now we're on to the white, this is also the slim version. This is for the iPhone 11. I kinda might wanna do a white though, with my white phone. So this is the purple. That looks good too but my gosh I think this white would look so good on the white phone. The purple actually looks pretty good with the gray. I like that the access to the buttons is easy, because sometimes when you have a case, the covers with the buttons, it sometimes is harder to push and it's usually not that much more difficult, but if you're taking a photo where you're using this top volume button to take photos, that little bit more of difficulty to press will give you a little bit more shake when you're taking the photo. So this one obviously has the buttons covered because this one is certified for drop protection. But what I do like about this is when you push the buttons, they're very responsive. So these are some really cool case options. I'm excited to try this out. I think this is gonna be my new case for the time being. Honestly I'll probably be waiting for Apple to release their battery charging case because even though this battery life is extended, the amount that I use my phone and what I put it through, I really love having extra battery case because even though I know my phone can make it throughout the whole day, I love having that extra, just, reassurance, of knowing that I don't have to bring in extra battery charger with me 'cause I have one already built into my phone. So guys, those are the new cases from Razer. Let me know what you think. I think they're pretty cool looking. I'm working on an iPhone 11 accessory round up so look for that soon. There's just so many things out already. There are a lot of things, that are like some knock off things that I've ordered, I was like, this is garbage, I can't even show those to you. If I do show it to you, I'm gonna feel bad, 'cause I'm gonna basically say don't buy this. But maybe that's the information that you need. Well I'll see you guys in my next video. Let me know if there's anything else you would like to see me cover her on my channel whether it'd be iPhone related, tech related, food related, doesn't matter. I'm here for you guys. And I look forward to seeing you on my next video, bye! Seeing you, but you're also seeing me. That's okay. (upbeat music)",

    "description": "Apples ominous warning about the Jet Black iPhone 7 needing a case, left me very curious.  Its time to test the new iPhone 7 color: Jet Black. What happens when the Super Glossy Jet black iPhone 7 comes up against every day objects like toothpicks, pennies, keys, and ... obviously... razor blades.   Here is the exact warning left by Apple on their website: \"The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone.\"  Are you going to use a case with your iPhone?

    "transcript": "The Elusive Jet Black iPhone 7. This particular iPhone color variant intrigued me the most out of Apples line up. Mostly because it is the only one that came with its own warning. Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products, however its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use and then, get this... Apple actually suggests using a case to cover it... something I never thought I'd see. So... How scratchable is the Jet Black iPhone 7? Lets find out. [Intro] The phone is incredibly shiny, and smooth. It feels way more like glass than it does metal. The super high gloss is an incredible fingerprint magnet, leaving behind almost perfect replicas of my finger. This is a brand new phone, its never left my desk or been in my pocket yet, but I did subconsciously wipe the back of the phone off on my shirt as I often do with my glass Samsung phones. And I noticed this little mark on the back. It must be from a particle of something left on my shirt. It is incredibly minor... But it is there. So now ill take some every day objects, and see how the phone finish holds up. Lets say you go out to dinner, and after leaving the restaurant, you slip your toothpick into your pocket... Even with heavy pressure, this toothpick doesn't leave a mark. So we are off to a good start. Now, lets say that your girlfriend made you take her to a fancy restaurant, and now all you have left to your name is a single solitary penny.... and your iPhone 7... Cuddled together in your hipster skinny jeans. Here is where we start to run into multiple problems. The copper penny left little circles of permanent love all over your iPhone 7. So you throw the penny away, and get to your moped, only to find out you are out of gas, and now penniless... Your date starts to walk home alone. Unfortunately your keys and phone end up in the same pocket as you chase her. Leaving physical scars on your phone, almost as deep as the emotional scars on your ego. Now penniless, moped-less, and girl-friendless, you decide to turn your life around and get a job as a construction worker. On your first day of work, the iPhone 7 ends up in your tool bag, and gets royally screwed... in more ways than one. So now, your phone has been pennied, keyed, screwed, and shirt specked. And to make it all worse, you accidentally slip your jet black phone 7 into a purse full of razors! Ok, so maybe that last part was a bit of a stretch.... BUT at least we learned that the Jet Black iPhone 7 can indeed easily be scratched by every day objects.... And now you can decide for yourself whether or not to heed Apples advice and get a protective case for your super shiny phone. My Instagram and twitter are full of behind the scenes stuff on my channel, so head over there if you want to see more constructive carnage. And if you havent subscribed yet... better do it quick, before you end up like the guy in today's story. Thanks for watching! Hope to see you around.",

    "transcript": "- Oh, my goodness, can you believe that a package this small has an iPad in it? You probably can, yeah, you probably don't have a problem believing that because the iPad mini was a thing long before the most recent apple event, during which apple announced the iPhone 13, the iPhone 13 Pros, another little iPad, $329, whatever. It's ninth gen of the vanilla, original iPad. But the most important thing was the iPad mini. And that is a subjective judgment. I'm saying that this was the most important thing, but I will back it up. But first off, this is a fun, little writing doohickey, right? Like at first I thought it spelled the same thing if you flip it upside down, it kind of has that look. But it does not. Real quick, the reason why this was the most exciting announcement during the event was because it's got USB freakin' C on it. An apple for whatever reason is holding on to this lightening port, this USB 2.0 speeds, capable lightning port. But for some reason, they put the USBC port on the iPads, they put it on the Mac books and they just did not, they're refusing to put it on the iPhones, which is why this is exciting because look at it, it's basically a big phone. First of all, it's got a fun dbrand skin on it, thanks dbrand. Whoa, what do we got here? These little guys, they're like ghosts. This looks like a black and white Dante's version of hell. But for transformers. the really cool thing about this iPad is that they've done the same thing to it that they did to the iPad Air. So like, you know, Apple announced the iPad Pro many years ago, I forget what year they first did it. But it looked like a regular iPad. And then at some point, they did this squared off design thing for the iPad Pros. And then did that same thing to the iPad Air and the most recent, I think it's the fourth gen iPad Air now it looks like this, except bigger. And they haven't updated the iPad mini. I think they did a processor refresh, but they didn't do anything to the design for like five years. I might be wrong on that, Google it. But now this is why I actually am a big fan. As much as I make fun of Apple, I'm actually a pretty big fan of what they're doing with their iPads. Kind of taking what was essentially just like a mobile only device and giving it the capabilities of a, you know, more advanced device. More like a desktop operating system with iPadOS and all that stuff. Okay, so to give a little bit more context, one of the other reasons why I'm really excited for this iPad mini is because unlike other iPads, minis or the vanilla iPads, the base level iPads, that have gotten like the much weaker processor, this one comes with the same A15 Bionic chip that is in the iPhone 13's and 13 Pros and it actually has the same 5-Core GPU as the iPhone 13 Pros, instead of the 4-Core GPU that is in the iPhone 13. However, some people have done some testing since they got their hands on the iPad minis and they've discovered that the clock speed of, I believe the GPU is a little bit lower than the iPhone 13 Pros. So you're not gonna get the exact same performance as an iPhone 13 Pro, but it's going to be pretty close, okay? Maybe I'll just use this as a phone, hello? The downside of trying to use this thing as a phone is that it does have a 5G version, so it starts at $499 for the Wi-Fi six only version. You can get a 5G version, which means you have internet access wherever you are just like a phone, except you can't do phone calls. And this has been a thing with iPads since they started adding 5G connectivity to it. However, you could just use internet calls, just use WhatsApp, FaceTime, all of these things, you know. Also I didn't even look what's in the box. We got a USB, that beautiful, beautiful USBC cord. And a USBC, you know, charging brick. 9 volt at 2.22 amps, yeah that's about 20 Watts. Andy was saying that, if you're not using a larger iPad for drawing, it's kind of annoying to watch videos on. Speaking of drawing, that's another thing that this iPad is capable of doing that the previous one was not, or the previous iPad mini was not, is working with the second gen Apple Pencil that charges with this magnetic connector. It's the same thing. It's almost the length of the iPad itself. Welcome to Apple Pencil. Should try out like the cameras and stuff, probably, eh, Brandon? - Yeah. - But before we do that, I gotta tell you about our sponsor. Big thanks to dbrand, obviously, for sponsoring this video. That's why there's a dbrand skin on here. Did you put the pieces together? Get some dbrands. Eh, what's-a matter you, eh? Put the skin on. Dbrand, they make some sick looking skins, buddy and if you wanna get the best scores in Fortnite, then you're gonna put this stuff on your devices. Or else you're out of the App Store. Dbrand's got skins for phones, they got some skins for tablets, laptops. I think they're working on cars. Maybe even people. So check out dbrand at the link below. Okay, yeah, so I've barely talked about the actual specs of this thing. So this is an 8.3 inch display. Which as I said, is a little larger than most phones. But like, as you can see, well, with the pencil there, it's kinda annoying to grip, 'cause then it just kind of, does that. Without the pencil there, it's like, you know, it's like a phone, can it fit in my pocket? Oh, oh my gosh, it actually does. I did not expect that to work. 8.3 inch display, it's got a P3 wide color gamut. Look at that P3 wide color gamut, I see so many colors. It's also got a true tone display, as is like, that's the kind of standard procedure for these iPads. 500 peak nits of brightness. (whistles) It's very bright on the top-down camera, but like in person, I would want it just this bright, normally, indoors. I feel like if I was outside, I'd be like. That's not so great for its phone use case, you wanna phone to have like decent brightness so you can use it outdoors. And that's, I mean, okay, so that's, I'm discovering some things that are gonna make it a little more difficult to use as a phone, that's fine. That's to be expected. Okay, one thing that I glossed over on the exterior design, I mean, it's got those flat edges I was talking about, but it also has stereo speakers in landscape. And the touch ID. So, you know, on their cheaper iPads, the non-iPad Pros, those ones have face ID. And on the iPad Air, this really is kind of like a mini iPad Air. 'Cause that also has the touch ID and the power button there. (upbeat music) That's pretty good sound for a tiny little iPad. (upbeat music) What the heck? However, it's ruined by the fact that I just discovered that the volume rockers are on the top of the device, like this, what is that? Here's the iPad, the front camera's right here, 'kay? Power button on the top, volume rocker on the other side of the top of the device. And nothing on the sides here. That's so weird. Apple is making some weird design decisions. Okay, some of the specs I haven't really gotten to yet are the both cameras, so, this camera on the front here is an ultra wide now, which it wasn't before. Boom, I got the whole room and the neighbors. We got the 12 megapixel ultra wide on this tablet now. And on the rear as well, it's also a upgraded 12 megapixel camera with true tone flash or maybe that is the front. Okay, one of the cameras can do true tone flash, it's probably this one. And focus pixels, okay, Center Stage. here we go. This is one of the new things in iOS 15, this create link or actually, could you do that before? I don't use iOS normally, but I know that you will now be able to create links to send to Android users, so they can join your FaceTime call as well. So that's pretty cool, I'm not sure if that's rolled out yet, but you can create links apparently and have people join them that way, FaceTime. - Hey. - Hey, Horst. I'm using my iPad mini as a phone. - I was just hanging outside and- - This doesn't have the speakers, this doesn't have like an ear piece, so you can't use it like this. You're just getting a good shot of my ear right now. - But like, everyone has Airpods now, right? - Although, I'm holding it here, I can hear you way better because it's got stereo speakers. - [Johnathon] I mean, it's not a very nice to look at someone's ear in a phone. - Wow and I guess that proves once and for all that you can use the iPad mini as a phone. You probably can't. Realistically, you might be able to. But you're gonna depend on services like FaceTime and WhatsApp or whatever, alternative calling apps. So if you don't wanna use this thing as a phone, it starts at $499 US. Which is not so bad for like a brand new tablet with a cutting-edge chip. 50% faster than any other mobile device ever or something. According to Apple's made up numbers that they don't tell anybody what they're actually referring to. But, it's $499 for the Wi-Fi only version. $649 for the 5G version. That's only what the 64 gigs of storage though. And then, you know, the other thing is that, most phones these days, people are getting more than 64 gigs of storage, so then that means that Wi-Fi only starts at $649 and the 5G, 256 version is $800. So, that's still cheaper than an iPhone 13 Pro. But you know, there's gonna be some trade offs. All in all, I feel like I am still excited by this thing, even though, you know, I found out some deeply, deeply disappointing facts, like the position of the volume rocker. I will be recovering from that for some time. It's a supplementary device, but I mean, like, to be completely honest, I've always been kind of confused by the existence of the iPad mini. It seems like something that rich people would buy when they don't have enough, you know, things to spend money on. Or they think they don't have enough stuff, so they're just like, you know, \"Might as well get the baby iPad.\" But this one, because it comes with the A15 Bionic and because it has 5G, I think LTT's doing a video about it or Mac Address, or someone's doing videos about trying to use this thing as a phone. 'Cause like, that's why it's exciting to me. If it's not a phone, then it's just a tiny iPad. Anyways, that was a short circuit about the iPad mini. Guess what? There's gonna be lots more. About products that aren't the iPad mini and you know what, I think you should subscribe for those. I feel like they're gonna be good.",

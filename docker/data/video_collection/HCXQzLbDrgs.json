    "transcript": "(bright upbeat music) (thuds) - Building a YouTube channel, 14 million subscribers, it's not easy. Takes hard work, intelligence and most importantly, a little help. Here, catch. (thuds) Or a lot of help. Sometimes the help needs help, which is why a YouTuber, mainly this one, needs 80 people on staff. 80. - Build Redux. Build Redux makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help along the way. They also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a PC completely on your own. So head to buildredux.com/linus and start your new build today. (bright upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Everyone had ample warning that we were doing this today. So you're gonna see two things, why a YouTuber could possibly need nearly 100 people on staff and some Oscar worthy performances in the category of looking busy while my boss is standing over me watching. Why don't we start with James? - What's up, boss? - Wow, you're doing a great job entering that pin. You almost found the number pad. James, what would you say you do here? - Enable the other writers to do their best. - Wow. And that, after all the rehearsal you obviously did? - We see how concise that is? - Pretty good. That was good writing. - It's good writing. In all seriousness, though, I'm gonna need you to explain what you do, because I can't even remember it anymore. I know you manage the writing team, which is like a dozen people now. - I help unblock them. I review some scripts 'cause remember, it's not just LTT, it's also Mac Address, and Channel Super Fun. I make sure their shoots happen on time. And when they do, I get ice-cream sandwiches for everyone. - And when they don't? - Uh. - Man, is everyone else here on, are you on probation still? - No. - No, you're not. - What do you mean? - [Plouffe] Been here 6 months. - Yeah, it's really. - [Plouffe] Since November. - You've been here that long? - Yeah, like 10 months ago. - Okay. What would you say you do, Adam? - I'm a writer and I make videos. - Wow, that's fantastic. (laughs) Computer. - This one's coming along great. You just wait. - He's actually the one organizing this very video. So he had to leap over here in his LTT shorts. Nice, by the way. Love them. - Oh yeah. - And pretend to write. Where the hell is everybody? We've got a probationary employee. Alex isn't at his desk. Anthony's not at his desk. Jake's not even here. We're gonna have to find some of these guys at some point. But in total, we have eight writers for LTT, 12 writers total, and we do a total of how many videos a week? - [Adam] 15. - 15, I don't think that's right. We do six LTTs, one WAN Show, that's seven. Two Techquickies, that's nine. Three ShortCircuits, that's 12. A Mac Address, theoretically. A Channel Super Fun, theoretically. And don't forget about TechLinked, that's another three a week. - And don't forget about They're Just Movies. - [Adam] And yeah, They're Just Movies podcast. Plouffe, what do you focus on? - I write things. - Oh my God, but what? - Display stuff and other things that we cover. I do all the random stuff. - Would you believe he hosts too? - Oh yeah, sometimes. - He's really good. - Yeah, do the SC is fun. - You're writing about a water block right now, I can see. - Yeah, I was gonna do other things on screen for a joke, but I thought- - Yeah, maybe something you actually did. 'Cause I wrote most of that. Keep up the good work. - I thought you were gonna walk right past me. - Okay, where are we going now? This is completely off the rails at this point. - [David] Go talk to Horst or something. - Fine. - [Adam] No. That's not the flow - [David] No, that's not the flow? - [Adam] No. Alex is in 105. (bleep) - The flow. - [Adam] Okay. Well I... All my work. - Oh my God, Dennis, don't leave, what are you... - I want to lick my face. - What are you doing? Okay. We've got our channel managers for Mac Address, as well as channel Super Fun. Dennis used to be an editor, but now he's like. - Why are you always so close to me? (laughs) (indistinct) Okay, I can hold it. - He doesn't like being put on the spot. - Yeah. - That's closer than I was holding it. I'll hold it. (laughs) Why are you moving away? - Why are you so close to me? - Just, you can push it. - Okay, Jonathan, yeah. So you do Mac address. - I do Mac address. Hello, yes. - I can do this if you prefer? - I like to think of myself as someone who tries to show everyone here, why Apple does the things they do. - Right. Now, I haven't actually watched it yet, but I love the title of the most recent video. I am gonna watch it soon. Am I becoming a hater? Do you think that being around all of us has made you see Apple in a different light? - I've always been a hater. (laughs) I've always been cynical. - All right, that's fair enough. Now, Dennis. - Okay. - You used to be an editor here and now what on earth do you do? - I mostly, I spend my time... (laughs) I spend a lot of time in your house and watch you naked, three times total. (laughs) - I wouldn't describe it as super fun, but isn't at least a little fun. - Its not fun. - [David] A little fun, yeah. - It's not fun. - So Arthur, what do you do here? - I make memes. - I mean that is an actual position that we actually have, but it's all seriousness. These guys have been absolutely crushing it. We've got floatplane exclusives that have been just off the freaking rails. Awesome, lately. Whether it's cutting room floor or original content, these guys have been doing a great job of, I mean, yeah, making memes. I guess that really is a big part of it. - Among Us. - If you wanna learn more about some of the people that we have here, you can check out the, meet the team series over... - [David] Where are you going? - I'm going downstairs. (laughs) If you wanna learn more about some of the people here, the meet the team series over on Floatplane is awesome. They're exclusive kind of behind the scenes content that Arthur and his helper put together. Where am I supposed to go next? - [Adam] You're not even supposed to be up in labs yet. - [David] You're supposed to go to business I think. - [Adam] You're supposed to go business. - I'm informed that I'm supposed to talk to the business team next. We'll start with the one and only Colton Potter, who surprisingly has not actually been fired yet. - Yeah. I'm head of business development. I do business stuff. - Why are you doing this. Why are you you holding it like that? - Hey. (laughs) - I'm gonna let you finish, but just... - I do business stuff. Marketing, sales, events. We're doing an event right now. - Yeah. LAN party. It's gonna be awesome by the time you see this it'll be over. So don't try and sign up. - Yeah. Cool, that's it. - That's it. Well, you said you were gonna ask me something. - Yeah. I don't wanna ask this on camera. (bleep) - Now for the rest of the business team, where the hell is everyone. - Vacation, helping, blurred. - Okay. Well fine, go. - All right. Hey, Sean, sales supervisor here, oversee our accounts team. Essentially we work with all of our different partners from like the Intel's, the AMD's, the Samsung's. - Now how many customers would you say that each of our sales people works with? - Oh, I'd say at any given time, probably 30 to 40. - Wow. We're not gonna get- - [Colton] That's correct. - We're not gonna get any applications anymore ever because that's a lot of clients we have to work with. The business team also handles procurement, but neither of those guys appear to be here either. (indistinct) Oh, they'd moved. We used to manage the relationship with all the brands ourselves. But now we have Matt and his helper who is on probation. And what is it that you would say you do? - I would say that we talk to all the brands ahead of time so that we know what's coming out next. When it's coming out. Whether or not he can get his hands on it and whether or not it's drop proof. That's always pretty critical. - Oh (laughs) my God, enough. Thanks Matt. Over here, we've got the accounting department. Some of which is still on probation. It used to be just my wife and now it's, my wife is gone. Okay. She's gone. And Jake's gone. What is going on here? Oh, this is... This office is probably full of confidential stuff. Blur everything. Also in this office is other Yvonne and then another probationary employee. Wow. Other Yvonne has some really cool Lego flowers. Are these cool or what? - [David] Those are rad. - Once we've procured the stuff. - Yeah. - Where does it go? - It goes to your mama. (horn blows) - Nope. - Okay. Logistics, logistics. Let's go. Welcome to the hold. This is the logistics department where Sergiy, Jamie, Nicholas, Dan, Alex Dick all do their... Oh my God. It is a mess in here, Dan. - No it's not. - [David] Give Dan the mic. - Are you kidding me right now? - No. Hi. - These guys do everything from inventorying and stickering things that come in to rearranging sets to right now, building up the computers for our Whale ticket holders at the Whale LAN. - That's right. - How does it feel to be working on something so pointless, given that four out of the five Whale ticket holders, told us they already have better computers anyway? - Eh, it's a good use of my time. Better than sweeping up HQ two in this heat. - Yeah. That's fair. Is that where everyone else is? - Yeah. - Oh, you should show the other cool thing you did recently with the mockup, with the thing with the panels. - Oh yeah, sure. Here is your mockup. - Check this out. That's the theater room at my house. And those are the exact dimensions of our LTT acoustic panel frames that we're working on. So we are going to absolutely deck this room out with them. How many did you say I would need of the little modular connectors. - So yeah, it looks like we need 1700. (indistinct) - Cool. - Yeah. (laughs) - All right. Let me tell you something I know about Sergiy. - All right, fire away. (chuckles) - When something needs to be picked up at my house, Sergiy is the guy. (laughs) - Oh, is that all you think I do around here? (laughs) - No, but darn it, you are so fast at it. - Well, if you're wondering what else I do, I also handle your trust border stuff that comes across. So Camino server, you name it, like the EMC thing. Testing chamber, I was dealing with that as well. - Little import things, yep. - Things, I also deal with customers in brokerage and I read all the trade laws, so you don't have to. - That's actually pretty critical. Nicholas, I would say is our specialist when it comes to cooling, component repair, stuff like that, like super geeky stuff. 3D printing, that kind of thing. Alex D is the manager of the team here. So he coordinates, I mean really the higher level things that logistics does. So kitting out a new building for example is gonna fall on mostly Alex and Dan, and then the rest of them are gonna make sure that it actually happens. And then they do a lot of the making sure it actually happens. We have five people in logistics now. I mean, if you look around though, there is a lot to keep organized. So here's incoming items to be inventoried. Here's things to be returned to inventory. I brought this back from my house, by the way. So that, yeah, that was me. I just dropped it there this morning. (laughs) Picking up after me is a lot of work and not everything they do is logistic stuff. The set design, and actually the production setup over here, particularly the audio was handled by the logistics department, everything from design to fabrication, to building out the set, to actually running all of these cables and making sure that the WAN show and They're Just Movies podcast sound and look awesome. Where is everybody? - Hey, I'm right here. - I know you're there, but Andy's not here and David's not here. (speaking faintly) - I'm kidding, David. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Brandon, I think many of our viewers probably aren't familiar with you. - I haven't worked here for very long. - Yeah. Not very long. - Definitely fresh meat. What do I do here? - Yeah. - Well, if it has anything to do with lighting or pointing a camera at something and it's on one of our channels, I'm one of the shooters. So one of the people who is doing exactly what's happening to me right now. - Very good. In all seriousness though, massive shout out to those of you who actually notice and care about what these guys do. I actually forwarded you guys some comments and some emails that I got recently, where people were just like, yeah, I don't really notice the production values on LTT until I go to other channels. Honestly speaking, I'd say that is the highest praise that you can give to a team like this, where they just, just make it look effortless. Really, yeah. - I promise you, it's not effortless. (laughs) - It's very high- - The stuff is actually heavy. That's something all of our camera guys have in common is they're not stick things. They actually have to move stuff a lot. Andy here is our supervisor for the camera department. So what do you do that's different from just operating a camera. - Merch photo. And I sometimes help operating feedback for new shooters. I do a little bit Chinese thing procurement. - Oh, that's right. Yeah. Andy's our guy. If there's some super weird thing we need from China, this guy has connections. - Yeah. - Yeah, it's weird actually. Naturally once we shoot the videos, somebody's gotta edit them. Let's see if my production manager is here. Ah, yes, one of the original gangsters, Edzel Yago. - Does this actually work? Is that... (indistinct) Crap. - Ed manages our editing team, which is now a total of, holy crap, do you have like 15 people? Did you count yourself? - Well 13. - Did you count the camera guys? - 15. - You oversee? - Who said 15? - Me. - Okay. Yeah, you're right. (laughs) - Are you gonna tell them what you do or do you want me to tell them what you do? Ed's camera shy. You should see his first video that he hosted way back in the day. We tried him out as an on-camera host and he was so sweaty. You could- - I had to run back and forth between the camera and prompter. (laughs) What do I do here? That's really good question. Really good question. I am going to pack my things, because I knew this was gonna come. - Ed does scheduling. He also does hiring for the editing department and lately he's actually been doing a ton of R and D, including coordinating with YouTube as well as Adobe on HDR content. Name deleted here is finally a dedicated thumbnail artist. We should have had one freaking ages ago. They are YouTube channels, literally a 10th our size that have a dedicated thumbnail artist. She also does a ton of the merch photos now, including both the photography and the photo shopping of them, the delightful one with the dog pulling down my pants that was her work. And then we've also got Scott. What a Dick. That's Scott, sorry. What would you say you do here? - I document Linus drop tips. Everything you drop. I go show the public. - Thank you. That was bound to happen. All right. We've also got Emily who is an editor plus. - Plus, yes. I help out a little bit. Yeah. When Ed and Nicole are not here, then I make sure that these guys do their job. - Good job, Emily. And she even knows that she does it, which is excellent. Also in here, we've got the one and only, the meme kingiest, Alex Potvin. - Hi. - You're gonna give me nothing. - No, I mean... - When he edits this video, he's gonna make it so that his segment is like the bombest segment out of the whole video. (explosives booming) And he's gonna do it purely in editing. That's really his superpower. (laughs) Oh, wow. The whole microphone was a lie. This is just a road wireless go-to. - [David] Oh, yeah. (laughs) - What's up? What's- - You're relatively new, I forget your name, I'm sorry. - Andrew. - See, you don't have a name like Scott, where I can just be like, \"That's Scott, what a dick.\" (laughs) - Yeah, well I'm happy about that. - Fuck Yeah, it worked out great. - Yeah. What do I do? I edit and I shoot some stuff as well. - All right, fantastic. We have a lot to shoot and a lot to edit, Robert. - Hello? I'm Robert. I'm one of the editors and- - We know you're Robert. You're standing in the editing den. We know you're an editor. Come on, man, help me out here. - Basically, my job is I make him look good. - That's a tough job. Hi Nicole. - Hi. Hi. (laughs) - Everybody knew I was coming. Come on people. - I help schedule videos. I help Ed with a lot of other things as well. I assign people to videos and I heard that Alex is now assigned to this video. - Oh, hi Mark. - Hi. How are you? I mean, I did not hit her. That's the line. - Okay, Mark's one of our editors, resident Hoarder, resident Mac user. Why is this still here? Do you know how many times I've tried to give this thing away? This weird NZXT helmet. - I took it. It was great. - I can see that, but you know the problem that you have is not gonna get any better by taking more random crap. - It's not data. - What? - Oh, no. You've seen... Oh, you're talking about my courtesy. - Yeah. I'm talking about your other hoarding problem. - Yeah, yeah, I have... Okay, yeah, fair enough. - Throw it away. - But it's at work. - It's not supposed to be at work. - I'll throw it away. (bell chimes) - Thank you. Hi Marcus. What are you working on? - I'm working on Techquickie. So I just stare at whoever is hosting, eight hours a day. (laughs) - Okay. Cool. James knows he has a little something right in the crotch area there, right? - Yeah, I should crop it out there. - Thanks. That's a lot better. - Yeah. - That's everyone down here. - Yep, David. - That's good, probably. - Yeah. Except your C.O.C, chief officer of cool. - I think we all know what David does. David operates the camera and also is on the, They're Just Movies podcast and also contributes to some of our retro gaming content, because he is turned into something of enthusiast lately. This is the thing. This whole work from home trend. You wanna make a video? You wanna take a group picture of something, everybody's freaking at home. Man I was talking to another YouTuber who was commiserating with me about business overhead. (bell chimes) And they gave me the number for their monthly payroll and they were like, yeah, man, it's like... And I was like, let me tell you. We have customer care agents like Adam and Nolan who take care of all of the incoming tickets for our... Oh. (thuds) - [David] You alright there bud? - Dang it. Merch sales. We've got everything from pillows to t-shirts to plushies, to the upcoming backpack. We did a video recently showing off a lot of the stuff that's coming down the line. At that time, hmm, this is unfortunate. At least some of these guys were in office, but today I don't see Bridget, I don't see Matthew. I don't see Olamide, but the engineering department is here. (indistinct) - You're not live, right? - No, no. We're not live. (laughs) Act like we are though. - No. - So be nice. (laughs) - Am I not nice? - [Tynan] No. - No. Otherwise why would I say that? - That hurts? - Kyle's the engineering manager here. He's been tasked with a multitude of projects. Most importantly, our (indistinct) LTT screwdriver, but he's also worked on a battery bank, like RGB accessory of some sort. He helps the other guys out when they run into roadblocks and has actually helped us out a lot when it comes to just general procurement best practices, because he actually has experience in it, unlike us. (laughs) - I also did some of the initial hiring for the labs and kicking that off the ground before Gary came along. - And he has great taste in cars. Honestly, it was so validating for me when our first actual engineering hire came on staff and drove the exact same car as me. I was like, now that is a practical car. What's up Tynan. - Oh, hi. How it goes. - Is there anything you can actually talk about or is everything top secret? I mean, I guess I kind of- - I'm in unique... Almost everything. So yeah, no, I don't have anything new. - Tynan is our resident physical therapy guru. You can see that he's the king when it comes to balance boards and... That's not all of the things, that's two of the many things. Look how many things there are. - I actually designed this thing and own a patent on it. - Really? - Really, really? - So this is a patent and balance board? - Yes it is. - And I won't die if I try to use it. - Uh, I would not say that. - Hold on. No, no. I'm good, I'm good. I got this, I got this. Ah. All right, Jacob, what's up? - Hello? How's it going? - This is exciting. Jacob, can we show the power bar holder. - I gave all of my prototypes- - Are you freaking kidding me? - He's filming a video, it is coming, spoiler. - How about the power brick one? Wait, no, I showed that one in the last one. The power bar one. You don't have a single power bar holder. How about an early prototype? Show me a crappy power bar holder. - [Adam] So what does he do here? - I'm doing product design with these guys. I'm working on some stuff that involves magnetism and also high volume production. So I'll work on quality control and validating suppliers, and things like that, yeah. So I went ahead and ran off with every single common power bar I could find and ordered more online, and stuff. The goal here was I wanted to have something that interfaces with as many of these keyhole slots as we could, and then make it as, I suppose, easy to use as possible and not finicky. This is an older prototype. - Yeah. So it's a little finicky. - Ease. - See, just put it on there. And once that's on there, if you have a metal strip on the bottom of your desk or a metal surface (metal clanks) (indistinct), there goes your power bar. And most of them are gonna have two of them on them, obviously, so it'll totally hold it in place. And this is also much weaker compared to the final one. We have final ones that are so strong, due to magnetic simulation stuff that you can actually unplug things without it pulling off the power bar. And you can see, even this one, the early one holds as long as it's right above the magnet. Lloyd designs delightful t-shirts like this one, got some new plushies coming, all that kind of good stuff. How you have no idea what these are, but they're cute. Sarah does more graphic design as well as product design for things like our notebooks, which you can find on LT... Oh wait, this isn't ours. Our notebooks that we sell on lttstore.com as well as our toque or beanies. And in here, we've got the business folks from creator warehouse. So Bridget and Kyle managed their respective departments. And then Nick is in charge of the whole shebang. He used to be our business development manager for LTT, but then moved on to bigger and better things to be replaced temporarily by Colton, until we find a suitable long term fit for the job. And this is Natalie, she works on just logistics, basically, but not like what our logistics department does. The logistics of containers of things coming in. Crap. (upbeat music) Serge, you were saying you drive things? - I do, yes. - Okay. Can you drive us? - To where? (speaking faintly) - Yeah, we need to go to lab two. - Sure. Let's go. - Okay. After a short ride, we've arrived at lab two. I mean, most of you only see the videos, but if it wasn't for the large team that we have behind the scenes, there would be no way for me to lose money on a scale like this. - Whoa, whoa. Blur his face, blur his face, marketing. Blur his face. - New marketing guy. What does the marketing guy do? We've hired a lot of people lately. Everyone we've blurred or covered up started in the last three months. - It's been insane. The marketing guy does marketing for Floatplane, LMG's channels, LTX and that's it. LTT store? - You probably haven't- - LTT store. - Noticed it yet because he just started and also Colton's been guiding him. - Can't really expect so much. - Yeah, he's gotta be a self-starter. You know what I'm saying. What's up, Jake. Okay. Hi. - Hi, this is the Jake show. Hello, what's going on? - What are you taking us way over to the probationary employee again? - Hey probation, come on. - You can't do... Your making extra work for the editor. - So Linus, what do you do here? - Well, I roll in anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes late. - I wish I could say- - I get dragged around by James to wherever it is that I'm supposed to be. Or Jake, Jake's actually been doing more of a supervisory role for the writing department. James was on for pat leave for a bit. - Screw that guy. - Jake had to cover for him. - I mean Jake. - I look pretty (upbeat music) for the camera. - Is that a Dennis Liao exclusive. - Yeah, thank you. This has been wonderful. The cooling alone for this 150 attendee land party is apparently costing $13,000. Chase, get over here and explain yourself. You can't point there. Did Colton approve this? $13,000 for cooling. - Yeah, but you also approved a LAN party in the summer. (laughs) - Oh, so it's my fault. - Yeah. - Chase is our event coordinator. He does lounge night. He does this. He does- - LTX- - kind of large weird sponsored shoots like that. PC or no PC thing. Yeah, he was hired to run LTX and then boom, pandemic, lol jokes. Thanks for that. Great job on LTX. We found 'em folks, Alex D, manager of the logistics department who takes my dreams and makes them close to reality. - Yeah, sometimes they don't turn out the right color. - Yeah. - Unfortunately. - The walls in there are supposed to be gray. Can you explain the dusty brown aesthetic? - Yeah's kinda like, Jamie put it the right way. It's like a beverage holder. - Well, anyway, this was coordinated at the last minute. So this was a collaborative effort between logistics and event planning. This is the $13,000 air conditioner that, because it was so last minute we couldn't just buy our own air conditioner and put it up on the roof, we're just blowing away money. See you later money. - Yeah. - So that's pretty cool. Good work. - Yeah, well, I mean, if you wanna put AC on there, it's at least $150,000. - Are you serious? - Yeah, that's the lowest quote I got. - You know we're doing that though, right? - Oh, yeah, I know. It won't happen until next year though, unfortunately. - Holy (bleep). - Yeah. - Oh yeah, Floatplanes. We're the hell's Floatplane.

Oh yeah, they do a ton of the dev work for lttstore.com. Did we miss anyone? - Huh? - God, there's so many people who work for- - Jon Martin. - Oh, yeah, Jon, one of our writers, he's based in North Carolina. - And I think that's everybody from my checklist. - Okay. - That's a lot of people Linus. - Yeah. - And aren't we hiring more. - linusmediagroup.com/jobs I think or something like that is where you can find the latest listings.

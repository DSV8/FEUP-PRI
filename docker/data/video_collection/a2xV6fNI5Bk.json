    "transcript": "- Oh, my sweet, sweet iPads. I've missed you. (laughs) - [Jono] Is it a computer yet? - It's definitely a computer, yeah. I mean, like it's been a while since I did an iPad thing. This is nice. I, I used to do all the iPad reviews. Jono did you know every time you watched an LTT iPad review or iPad video even on short circuit? I think I did most of them from like 2019 onwards. That's me baby. - [Jono] You did the Air last time. - The last iPad air, the fourth gen came out in 2020. I did the review of that on LTT and on short circuit because I liked what apple was doing. As much as we challenge apple as much as we get up in their face. I actually like what they've done. - [Andy] Your check is too loud. - Ah, the I iPad air. I was actually excited to see this because I like what apple has been doing with their iPads. They kind of like took it from being this fun product for you know, your average consumer to just like play, and I don't even know what the mobile games are now to like you know, computers more or less iPad OS is a robust operating system but it still has a lot of limitations. So I'm interested to see what the M1 chip what it can do for the format. Ah, didn't see that coming, iPad air - [Jono] Mac dress opened it up before us so... - What? Mac address already UN boxed this - [Andy] Describe to Mac address. - Shut up Andy (laughs) what it's ripping? What? - [Jono] Yeah Horst ripped it... - This is apple is just not the same as the one it was okay, well I'm ripping it then, 'cause like what am I supposed to do? So from what I understand this is like the same chassis more or less as the iPad air fourth gen. Although I've seen some complaints from some people about build quality maybe being slightly less impressive on this one. Like they say that there's a thinner enclosure but like I don't feel, oh maybe I feel a little something but that just might be the emotions. Very, very happy right now it feels okay so I don't know that's probably it looks about the same build quality in the box We got the normal stuff papers, stickers. - [Jono] Aaaw, it's white lame. - You're the worst. Who cares about stickers? Like people are like, Ooh, I wonder what stickers are in the iPad air pro box. No, it's not a pro, but it looks like a pro USBC cable because once again, the iPads get USBCS. iPhones do not be until they get their act together. Doesn't have a power adapter in the box though. So that's unlike, they're still shipping power adapters with the iPads, but not the iPhones. So when I say the same chassis as the iPad air four what I mean is it's got these four speaker grills again but there's only two actual working speakers from what I understand because they've adapted the iPad pro overall chassis design that they I think first introduced in 2018 and in 2020 when they updated the iPad air, they gave it that square bezel design that they're gonna, I guess, put on all the iPads, the iPad mini even has that the new one that you can use the phone but not actually, subscribe to Mac address - [Jono] Again. - [Andy] Yes, please. - The iPad pro has face ID and the iPad air in lieu of that they used the same design overall but they took away the face and put in the touch ID, enabled power button, over here we got the volume rockers as you would expect. And I guess the, maybe that's a mic USBC port which this time is apparently two times faster than the one in the iPad air. And here's where things get really (beep) up. Let me tell you (laughs) you guys know about the USB naming and how messed up it is but this is what's so confusing to me. The iPad air in 2020 supported five gigabits transfer speed. Okay. But at that time that was USB 3.1 gen one that's five gigabits per second. So the iPad air 2022 has USB 10 gigabits a second. But what apple is calling it is USB 3.1 gen two which is technically correct but that's not what USB is calling it anymore. The USB implementers forum is now calling that USB 3.2 gen two by one, two by one. I better 2020 head USB 3.2 gen one by one is what they call it now at the time though, they called it USB 3.1 gen one. And now apple is saying this one has USB 3.1 gen two which is actually supposed to be called USB 3.2 gen two by one. Okay. But if apple was gonna put in a 20 gigabit port in this one, it would be USB 3.2 gen two by two that's the fastest one you can get - [Andy] What like USB four? - I'm not even touching USB four no, no Thunderbolt. So that is where we can bring it back. The iPad pros have support for Thunderbolt three I believe maybe Thunderbolt four. I don't think they have Thunderbolt four. I think they have thunderbolt three over a USBC connector. Guys this is getting really confusing. You might come up against a scenario where you're trying to transfer a large file or something or use a use an accessory. And this is gonna have a slightly better bandwidth for you to transfer things over USBC or connect accessories or whatever. Everything's better than a lightning port. That's my song. This starts at the same price as the iPad air 4, $599 for the 64 gig version, you can bump it up to 256 gigs of storage and then you'll pay $749. And then on both of those, you can add 5G if you want which will bump up the price to $749 and $899 I believe. So also got wifi six. So that's nice. It is a nice tablet from just looking at the specs. So like another one of the big differences between the iPad air and the iPad pros is the refresh rate with this one, you're stuck with a 60 Hertz refresh rate. Doesn't have the promotion like variable, you know changing depending on the content type of situation. Although it is a 10.9 inch liquid retina. So like, you know, it looks nice and sharp. Let's bring up something. Let's bring up something pretty. Do we have pretty photos on here? Hey, Adam's pretty, pretty pretty. Who's that? What's that guy's name? Robin. That's a sharp photo who took this. It's got 60 Hertz compared to the one 20 Hertz and the iPad pro And it's got a few other kind of deficiencies compared to that as well. This is not a me mini LED display. So it doesn't have the same brightness. What did you say? The max peak brightness was 500 nits? - [Jono] Well, it just says 500 nits - But that's probably sustained. - [Jono] Yeah - But I mean, I'm looking at a Mac address video right now. It still looks pretty nice. The colors, how do I get rid of the UI? It won't go away. What's going on? - [Jono] I don't know. - Apparently this thing does have, you know, true tone with like basically every Mac product with a screen has these days and the P3 color gamut. So I don't know how to gauge that. Why it turned itself down again? make yourself bright for me. And I wanna show you everything else that this iPad has to offer after this word, from our sponsor dbrand they didn't even send us this thing with a fancy skin on it. - [Jono] No cause have to put it on. - I'm so bad at this, that's a leather skin baby. - [Andy] Dead cow - What'd you call me? What is this thing? Is that a cow? Is that the dead cow that made the leather - [Jono] That's Betsy. - Get yourself a skin made from the Carcas of old Betsy. Our favorite cow that we killed. This is like leather. - [Jono] It is leather it's real. - This is real leather? - [Jono] Yeah. - Wow. - [Jono] How does it smell? - It's like old Betsy is in the room with me right now (background noise) - Don't mess. - Oh no it's not an absolutely perfect application, but listen this is what I said. I'm not good at this that goes on on the lens. That's kind of cool actually cause then it protects it from like hitting into things. That's beautiful dbrand - [Jono] How does that feel? - I love you. - [Jono] Did you know that it actually changes colors as you use it? - You mean it's got a patina. You wanna put a dead cow on your devices, go check it out the link below dbrand.com/shortlinus (laughs) Okay. So now we know that Jonathan horse looks amazing on the iPad pro or iPad air four display. It looks like an iPad Pro can you blame me for keeping continuing to confuse it? - [Jono] Nope - So, because this thing has the M1 in it it has actually doubled the Ram as the previous iPad air four as well. That one had four gigs compared to the, you know at that time, the iPad pro based on the A12 Z bionic had six gigs of Ram and the iPad air had four gigs of Ram but now all the iPads have so much Ram you can get. So this one comes with eight gigs of Ram cause of the M1 and the iPad pro with the M1 you can get up to 16 gigs of Ram on an iPad. That's crazy is that exciting to you? You're you're chewing. Don't try talk. And what's even more impressive. Is that with a more powerful chip it still has all day battery as apple likes to say but when you actually look at the specs they say it's 10 hours on wifi and nine hours on cellular. But we'll see, I won't see cause I'm gonna be done with this after this video, but someone will. The cool thing about apple deciding that it was basically gonna have the same physical design more or less there's thicker bezels on this compared to the iPad pro is the fact that they are compatible or I think they are with like other accessories. So I'm okay with them not having giant innovations in physical design as long as they fit into the same accessories. This is the Logitech folio touch, which I took a look at when I reviewed the iPad air four, it's not working. Is it because of the dbrand skin? It might be cause of the dbrand skin it's thicker. So unfortunately if you get the fancy dbrand leather skin, it might not seat correctly. And in the log detect combo touch that has the detachable keyboard. We do have the the track pad working, the keyboards working but on the non detachable Logitech folio touch keyboard we weren't getting the, the seating, like the the connector wasn't seating properly. So that's too bad but what about the magic keyboard? This is a mess. What is going on? We don't have our apple accessories in order but you know who does? Mac address Subscribe - [Andy] Yeah - I think it'll work. Oh, we don't have an 11 inch (laughs) I think we can make it work. I think if we just kind of, - Oh whoops. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Perfect. Well, if you get the 11 inch version of the magic keyboard, I'm pretty sure it'll fit. All right Well, I was going to look at the camera while it was sitting in a thing but I guess we're not gonna do that. Oh, is center stage on right now? Yeah. And moved. So that's the other thing that they're adding to the iPad air this time is the ultra wide 12 megapixel on facing camera that enables center stage. So you can, don't worry, This is very stable. - I've gonna block you. - Oh, and over here and then you move over here and then, oh, it's trying it's trying. - [Jono] Oh it's focusing on me. - Yeah, it focuses on, you know, whatever idiot is in the room so. - [Jono] Aww what - And on the back we have the same 12 megapixel just regular wide camera and that'll let you shoot 4k video. So that's nice - [Jono] Up to 60 frames per second. - Do you want me to take a nice photo of this horizon thing? How much is this sink? - [Jono] I think 250 US - 250 US dollar that's wrong Jono. - [Jono] I didn't buy it. - That's not right. It doesn't even look like anything it's too busy. - So if you're the type of person to not be ashamed when you're out in public holding up a iPad, filming something Apparently the camera's still pretty good. - [Jono] Tourists. - The coolest thing about this new iPad is the M1 as I said. So I think for most people looking for a tablet you still wanna look at the iPad. Ninth gen, just regular iPad, cause that starts at $329 and it's got A14? A13 bionic, which isn't an M1 but it's still pretty good for like tablet stuff. But I feel like the iPad air has now established this kind of like middle ground where maybe you're not like a full professional and you need like an iPad for your for your work all the time. But maybe you're like an artist and you have a computer you have other things and you wanna have a tablet that is reasonably powerful that you can like use procreate on or stuff. You know, that's a nice niche to be in. I can't really like test the performance per say cause that's for the full review. We're not doing a full review. Mac address is, one more thing though, the speakers - You're not a crab don't talk to me. (instrumental music) - That's a tablet if I didn't know this was a tablet, man was like over there. No, it still sounds like a tablet. But as far as mobile device speakers go pretty good. There's a good amount of mids and base on that thing. - [Jono] You'd watch a movie on that thing - No, I would still use headphones. I have no problem watching, like using this as my visuals. But, but sound is like more important than visuals to me. And it's also more important to me that you watch to the end of this video. Thank you so much, dear viewer, Hey subscribe to short circuit for more videos like this. And if you wanna to buy this tablet, use the links below. Those are the best ones I tried the other ones.",

    "transcript": "The Wireless Future they promised us Ryan come in this video *No* *Laughs* Ohhh! Wireless charging You probably don't have it, you might have it You might have a phone that has it but then you have another gadget that doesn't. Everything is going back to the wall. There is power going here, there's power going there How do you take a device that doesn't have wireless charging and give it wireless charging? I got a playstation controller over here, that doesn't have wireless charging Today it will With the help of something called *Fly Charge* This is an indi-gogo campaign right now They hit me up like, hey Lew we got the next-gen thing. Not sure if I believe you Whats the *Fly Charge*? What makes it so different Lew? Why is it so special and why am I watching this? Well this is faster than traditional wireless chargers and its modular So no matter what device you have, you can interact with it. Now keep in mind, this is a prototype situation. This thing is actively being funded on indi-gogo right now. So they just sent me the (boatload?) So the core of this system is this little pad right here Now this thing According to their videos can just live sort of on your kitchen table, on your counter top. If you wanted to get down let me show you the way. Whooo!! Conductive wireless charging not inductive. So that means metal contact points will touch this guy. And the reason that's important is because that gives you way faster charging than the inductive variant. So inside these little bags are some different units. That will interact with your devices. This is a little pad with 3M adhesive I immediately thought of battery banks. Jack's always stealing my juice. Look at this, it's like christmas morning over here Cases for popular phones. This one is for the iPhone Bingo- Bango you are also juice and hard. What if you wanna use your device while charging? This aims to defeat that USB-Port but then wireless on the bottom Oh and it sticks like it has a magnetic component. More bricks more cases. They hit me with a kitchen sink. Is there a typo? You have seen it before, you have seen the case that you stick on your phone and add wireless charging to it. Booyakasha Here is what things get a little spicier So check this out Take your stickie And then ... *lookatthe* magic. All of a sudden. Green light Jack pick up the green light. Then you're ready to go on your trip, you just... This one is interesting to me because if you have got this wireless charger and some things interface with it but others don't Like what about the things that don't or what about the things i wanna keep using This guy fits down on there A USB cable Let's say it's an iPad ohh are we sucking too much juice now? And the image online shows like how many things on there?! Could it be that this is like a prototype? Let me try this one, the OG Working This unit here that one was on the top charges all these guys no problem This one is cutting in and out so I am assuming that maybe.. what am I assuming That is not good for the devices so I go back to this for now. Prototype one of the earliest packages out there so I am not trying to condemn it I am just saying like step your game up. You are gonna be on Unbox Thearpy We are trying to max out this one too, to see where the drop off point is See that's orange. This must be what they are eventually getting towards because this is,.. wow we got a lot of things charging here. Is it a complete game changer? meh There has been no proveiling tech There has been not one system that became the VHS to somebody elses beta. That is an old reference Where is this wonderfull wireless future? How do we get there? Where ever that place is.",

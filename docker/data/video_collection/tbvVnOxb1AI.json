    "transcript": "I have something like five video topics that have half-baked sorta-started scripts and its driving me up the wall a little bit so heresa hastily thrown-together script brought to you by a disappointing tript to home depot, hequipped. Philips, and this is not sponsored in any way which will become increasinglyclear as I get more and more upset with them, makes what is to me the holy grail of dimmable LEDlight bulb. They call the feature Ive grown to love the Warm Glow effect and the idea is thatthese can rather faithfully mimic the shifting color temperature of an incandescent light bulbas its dimmed. Here, take a look; Dimmer, warmer! Brighter, less warm. Kinda dim,kinda warm. Really dim, really warm. I know Im old fashioned, but this is exactly the sort of thing I want my light bulbs to do. See, back when hot glowy wires were the norm, adimmer switch would cause the light output of a tungsten lamp to shift downward from its 2700kelvin (or maybe 3000 kelvin in the case of halogen) color temperature into a progressivelywarmer-looking color as brightness was reduced. This happened because the filament was in fact getting cooler, and yes the fact that we describe cooler literal temperatures as warmer color temperatures does rile some folks up a bit but language doesnt have to be scientificallyprecise. Except, of course, when I say it does. Anyway, in an incandescent lamp, the apparent color temperature is a result of the filaments literal, actual temperature because the fantastically hot filament is essentially a blackbody radiator. We call this a 2700K color temp because that filament is 2700 kelvins hot, or 2462 Celsius hot, or 4400 Fahrenhot. When you run one on a dimmer switch and limit the power going to the lamp, the filament gets less hot, resulting in not only less light but also warmer-looking light. Because again, the color temperature is a function of the filaments actual temperature. At very low light levels, the color is almost an amber, not far off from candlelight. And when I want to rest my eyes in a dimly-lit environment, thatsexactly the sorta thing Im looking for. If you know anything about my Christmas lightshenanigans, it probably wont surprise you to learn that my biggest issue with LED lighting as it was first hitting the scene was that, even once we got dimming pretty-well figured out the dimming experience always seemed wrong to me. Side-note, this isnt a video on how dimmerswitches work, but as a brief summary dimmer switches repeatedly chop up the AC sine wave as itgoes through them because thats really the only efficient way to throttle output power. Whilethat approach was fine for incandescent lamps, when dimmable CFLs and LEDs appeared, which both have electronic drivers to control the glowy bits, well it required some careful circuit design in order for these new lamps to A) work correctly with that gnarly chopped uppower and B) interpret its relative choppiness as a desired brightness output. The fact thatdimmable LED bulbs manage to work at all on this wacky power is pretty impressive if you ask me, although lots of older dimmer switches themselves couldnt handle the strange load characteristics of these newfangled lamps and thats why the dimmability of LEDs is still a sore spots forsome folks as you may have needed to replace some dimmer switches if you had a flickerfest. If you havent looked into this in a long time, LED-compatible dimmers are pretty cheap these days and so long as youre comfortable swapping one out, I promise the energy savings are gonna pay for that new dimmer switch pretty quick. Uh, right, so even once we got dimmable LEDs working well with dimmer switches, they never looked right to me at low brightness levels because, without getting warmer like an incandescent bulb does, a warm-white balancedLED starts to look almost grey when you get down below 25% brightness or so. Its nice that itsless light, but there was no way I could rewire my brain to accept that as anything but wrong. So it was a glorious day when I first laid eyes on the Warm Glow packaging, saw the little picturePhilips put together and realized Holy crap theyve done it. This Ive gotta try! and I boughta couple, took em home, and was hooked. Finally, an LED light bulb that truly looks and behaves like an incandescent lamp, bringing all of the techs advantages with virtually none of the downsides. While you werent looking, I put a Warm Glow bulb in here. Thats right. This guy. Is. Not. Incandescent. That was a really smooth reveal. That was quite some time ago. Philips has beenmaking these for gosh close to a decade now I think, I know for a fact I bought a bunch back in 2016 including this one right here. And I had a pretty good guess into how they worked - it seemedlike there were probably two sets of diodes, perhaps balanced at 3000 kelvin and 2100 kelvin, and at full brightness they mixed together to make what looked like 2700 kelvin. Then, as the bulbdimmed, it would first lower the output of the cooler LEDs, gradually shifting the color temperature down, until finally only the warm set was lit. It could then still get a bit dimmer but thats as warm as itll get. Lately they started producing filament style bulbs with the warm glow effect which reveal that, sure enough, thats exactly how this works. Youcan even see when the bulb isnt lit that two of the filament sticks are a bit paler thanthe other two. In case you werent aware, modern white LEDs are actually not too far offfrom fluorescent lighting tech as the diodes emit blue light - or, as is increasingly common, near-UV light - which is then converted by a phosphor mix sitting on top of the diodes into other wavelengths of light. When that's all combined it produces a white light - at least, one thats good enough for our eyes, anyway. Generally, LEDs with a warm color temperature have a very deep yellow, almost orange phosphor coating, and as youmove up the color temperature scale the phosphors become an increasingly pale yellow. Take a look at one of these video lights, which have a matrix of warm white, cool white, and RGBdiodes and its obvious which diodes are which. So, as predicted, at full brightness all of thefilament sticks are lit. And as the light is dimmed, at first only two of the filament sticks (thecooler-looking ones) start to get dimmer. Since, as that happens, an increasinglygreater proportion of the total lightoutput is coming from the still-bright, warmer filasticks, themixed light output appears progressively warmer. At least, to a point. Once the cooler filasticksare completely extinguished, it cant get any warmer but it will get dimmer. In fact these will justbarely glow if you want them to. At first I thought this idea would be a poor fit for these filament-style bulbs, and it does look a little weird to have only half of them doing anything atlow brightness, but given how this style of bulb isnt exactly easy to stare at anyway, I thinkits fine. And actually, once they started making these the last meaningful differences between incandescent and LED were all but eliminated. I have been extremely pleased with these LED lamps since I first discovered them. Theyve performed excellently and flicker-free on nearly every dimmer switch Ive tried, although I have had some flickering on certain switches but it generally happens only at very specific brightness values. Also, they have a great light quality to them; notexceptionally good but certainly better thanaverage. And in all this time, if memory serves, Ive had exactly three failures: The worst one was a bule that just died about a year after I started using it. And then there's this one. Uh, this one seems to have some sort of wiring problem because at full brightness, it can get a little flickery. And I just discovered (literally just now) that at low brightness settings, it's not doing the dimming effect correctly. All of the filmanet sticks are working together. And then the other failure, I think, was just a hilarious manufacturing boo-boo. Ihave a frosted glass bulb version of this bulb and it works absolutely fine but it doesnt get warmer! It's just awee bit cooler-looking than the package mate it came with so I think that one got made with all-cool filasticks. Id show it to you but I cant find it. Oops. Aside from those three failed lamps, there is literally just one other problem Ive ever had with these andits, again, minor. But weird. I have a few of these PAR20 lamps in recessed cans and all of them handle the transition from cool to warm a little bit wrongly. If you start out at fullbrightness, theyre perfect! But if you dim them down to a certain point, even though it startsout mixed correctly the bulbs will slowly just stop outputting any light from the cooldiodes and go full-warm. It took me a while to realize this was happening because it occurs over a period of several seconds and they all do it in precisely the sameway - I have four of them on the same switch and they behave identically. In fact Ivegot another pair on a different switch from a different manufacturer and yep, same exact thing. Infact that assured me it wasnt the switch drifting a bit as I thought, its definitely a flaw inthat bulbs driver design, but since its really only a problem around a relatively narrow dimnessband, Ill give it a pass. Its just pretty weird. Now, I said that Im making this video thanks to a disappointing trip to Home Depot. In my area, and maybe this is nationwide, Idunno, the different hardware stores seem to have exclusive deals with certain lighting brands. MyMostly Midwestern Mega Merchandise Mecca, Menards, doesnt sell Philips bulbs at all. They sell mainlySylvania - and theyre gonna come up later. I think Lowes sells mainly GE bulbs from what I remember. And wherever else you might find a light bulb tends to have a mishmash ofwhatever, really. Anyway, the important thing is that the Orange Store has been the place I needed to goto get these or really any Philips lighting products. And I made a trip to the Orange Store to get a fewof these for some new lamps of mine and there were none to be found. No shelf space in that entire store was devoted to my favorite, fantastic Philips flight bulbs. No matter, I have Internet. That waspretty fruitful but the pickins are getting increasingly slim. There are nowhere nearas many varieties available as there used to be, and a ton of what shows up is out of stock. Not long ago Philips was putting this tech into pretty much any kind of lamp you could think of, from your basic A19 things, to candelabra-type bulbs, frosted floods and PAR lamps, and even GU10 halogen replacements! In fact,they even sold those fancy LED trim retrofits meant to go in can lights with the Warm Gloweffect. Ive got some of em and theyre great! But these days? Well, they seem to be an endangered species. Even Philps own website isnt helping things. Yeah, they still have a page for the product, but you click on the link to browse and well this is useless. Lots of these areclearly not Warm Glow capable - anything daylight balanced surely isnt, and looking through thefilters on the left - yep, theres nothing there specifically for this feature. So what in the heckis goin on? It cant just be you weirdos who like daylight-balanced lighting, I mean plenty of softwhite bulbs are still for sale and any remotely nice one will be dimmable. Its pretty much just the contractor grade stuff that isnt these days. Well, I dont know. But I can guess! Thereis of course the whole global supply chain stuff were still dealing with but Idont think that can quite explain this. As recently as January I ran into a couple of Home Depot stores and they both had a solid selection. AlthoughIll be honest I got inklings of trouble since I couldnt find a ceiling fan bulb with Warm Glow which was why I went in there in the first place. I feel as though since the Orange Store had just six months ago committed a good section of the light bulb aisle to these bulbs that supply chain stuff is unlikely. What I think is far more likely to be the case is that dang smart stuff all the kids are intothese days. I think it was an inside job. [whispers angrily] Huedid this! Philips has definitely been pushing their Hue line of smart whatevers (and plenty ofnon-Hue smart whatevers it seems) and while they coexisted in harmony with Warm Glow for quite afew years, Im thinking Philips is gonna make the folks like me who are just a little bit tooanal about our lighting invest in something like their tunable white bulbs. Actually, Icant tell if they get any warmer than 2700K, so I might even need to get one of those full color ones and get all fiddly with an app or some junk. Now lest you think Im going into this future all kicking and screaming well I am. A little bit. But I actually have alot of smart lighting stuff and have for years, but I am on team smarten the switches, not the bulbs. I have bought a grand total of two Smart Bulbs in my entirely life, one of which never got used. You can finda really old video of mine where I went into home automation stuff back in like2017 - oh actually it was December of 2016, holy cow. And in it I talked about my Z-wave dimmerswitches, all of which Im still using by the way! Z-wave and Zigbee are two communications protocols made specifically for home automation stuff, and the really neat thing about those protocols is that none of my smart switches or sensors even know what the Internet is. My entire smart home has onedevice connected to the internet, not counting smart speakers, and thats the hub which actually processes commands and coordinates all those switches. Thats the last Ill speak on the...matter, though as the smart home landscape is in the process of changing, andhopefully to something simpler and better. I just wish Z-wave and Zigbee were more widely understood as the internet-optionalecosystems that they are. Needing ahub is actually a very good thing, especially when it comes to network security, but nobody ever communicated that very well. Still, Im not anti-smart bulb, for whatits worth. Installing a light switch can be intimidating and most smart switches needa neutral wire to function, which many older homes didnt run through the switch boxes. And indeedsome rather new homes as Ive recently discovered. But all Ive ever wanted with my homeautomation, at least in the realm of lighting, is to have control over brightness. And sincea light switch is usually in control of at least a few light sockets, it was MUCH cheaperfor me to install smart switches than it was to buy smart bulbs. Anyway, while I dont care to have control over the color of my light bulbs or anything like that I do want them to mimic incandescent lights as closely as possible, and the Warm Glow bulb was an elegant - andalso pretty cheap! - means to that end. The new tunable white options areinteresting but heres the thing. I never want daylight balanced lighting in myhome. I know that lots of people find it useful, and I can see the value of a light bulb which shifts the color temp throughout the day; being daylight balanced when the suns up, and nice and warm when its not. For me personally, though, that just doesnt have much value to me. I know not everyone has enough natural light in their home to dothis but, I generally dont need the lights on at all when the sun is up. And to be honest,on dismal overcast days I actually find the warmth of incandescent-balancedlight to be soothing and cozy. For that reason, a bulb with daylight and soft white diodes would be half wasted on me. I suppose if it had a super-warm set of diodes, too, and could still do a warm-glow-like effect that would be neat, but once you get that complicated you might as well just make the thing a smart bulb. And thats why I appreciate these so much. Its acheap, simple, and elegant tweak to the dimmable LED concept, adding that subtle but very important effect back into a modern, efficient light bulb. Thats all I was ever asking for, and dangitif were gonna lose this option to smarter, connected light bulbs Ill be upset. And that's why I bought all these and stocked up. Philips, YOU ARE NOT TAKING THIS AWAY FROM ME Oh, right, Sylvania. I said they were gonna comeup. For a short while, Sylvania was copying this idea. They called it premium dimming or something like that; I only remember seeing them a few years ago, and I never bought any to compare to Philips. There are a few new-old-stock options out there, but it doesnt look like theyre still inproduction. Again. Boo! Id be curious to know if people just dont understand what this feature is or knew to look out for it. There are enough people that just dont care about color temperature at all - I mean, if theres one thing that offends me more than a daylight-balanced light bulb in a bedroom, its mixed color temperatures in the same room (or worse, fixture) Yet theres a ton of folks out therewho truly dont care about that. Maybe they can't see it. I dunno, I dont know how they can look past a fixture riddled with a hodgepodge of different color lighting in it but oh well. They do. Are these light bulbs for everyone? No. If youdont like warm lighting, theyre definitely not for you. But for those of us somewhere in between fuddy-duddy and smart home enthusiast, theyre great. Philips, if you're listening, please dont stop production of these. Ihope this is just a supply chain hiccup, but Im honestly not holding my breath. Whoever was first responsible for these, thank you so much for your efforts. I truly have neverbeen happier with a lighting product. And, Ive converted a fair share of LED skeptics by convincing them to try a Warm Glow bulb. These are really so close to incandescent dimming in their behavior and appearance, and if thats your jam these are your bulbs. Anyway, thats all. These bulbs have come up inthe past a few times on the channel but Ive never bothered making a video specifically aboutthem. And frankly, I wasnt planning on it. But now that it looks like they might be an endangered species, well I mean I couldnt just sit here and do nothing! I suppose its very possible thatdimmer switches are just far more of a niche thing than I realized. Certainly I can think ofplenty of environments without them. And, uh, now that I think about it, I imagine most rental apartmentsdont offer them. So maybe thats whats going on here. Smart bulbs are a nice way to add dimming, remote control, and more with little hassle. Still, Philips was putting this tech in to such a wide variety of products not that long ago that I think dimmers cant be *that* niche, can they? Oh, and I didnt evenmention the really irritating thing which is that, now that I mostly have to buy these online, Im not getting those great time-of-sale rebates my utility offers on LED bulbs. Its agood thing these have proven to be so reliable overall. Oh and might I suggest, if youre looking to add some dimming in your life, you should look at these plug-in dimmers for lamps. Sure, they donthelp with any permanent lighting in your home, but a few lamps here and there can make a big difference to a space. Plus, lots of these have smart functions! Ive been using a Z-wave enabled dimmer for this video. Usually I try to thinkof some sort of real ending before I c endangeredly smooth jazz They call the feature thats thewrong box! You did this to yourself. We call this a 2700K colortemperature because (laughs) You gotta pick it up a little higher there, buddy! Thats exactly how this happens. You can even seewhen the bulb isnt lit why did I say happens? Thats not what the s thats not what it says. And in all this time, if memoryserves, Ive had exactly two failures. I just remembered a third one. And as I made a trip to the Orange Store to get a few for some new lamps of mine. Well thats not the words that are there. [fart sound] Man, I forgot to move the frame for that blooper where I bonked the lampshade. That's gonna haunt me forever. OK, well not for that long. But I hope this video haunts Philips execs forever! Unless of course they keep this product line going. Then I will revoke the haunt.",

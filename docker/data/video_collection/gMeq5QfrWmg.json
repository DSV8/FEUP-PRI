    "transcript": "- You think tech news just grows on trees? Who told you about the tech news trees? - Wow got a good harvest today. - Riley! - Oh, shoot. - [James] At Facebook's connect conference yesterday, real human Mark Zuckerberg finally ingested enough of Facebook's users' personal information to begin a metamorphosis of sorts. He's going all Jeff Goldbloom, eventually emerging from his cocoon reborn as Meta, the cyber punk God of data. - I am proud to announce that starting today, our company is now Meta. - [James] Yeah, so Facebook, the company is now called Meta because they had to do something about their image. Unfortunately, Facebook, the platform, still exists, but it's now only one part of Meta's grand vision for the metaverse, a VR world meant to essentially replace the internet. Hilariously, Meta's own consulting CTO for VR, John Carmack, said in his connect keynote that he thinks actively trying to build a metaverse is a bad idea, calling it a honeypot trap for tech dreamers. - [Riley] Sign me up. - I don't get, like, I don't get that. But we have to admit, Meta did announce some interesting stuff. They're phasing out the required Facebook login for VR headsets, which will soon be branded as Meta, not Oculus. Why? And they teased the next gen Project Cambria headset, which to me sounds like Cambridge Analytica just smooshed together. Idiots. This thing is probably the leaked Oculus pro, I think. We also saw impressively photorealistic avatars and a leaked reveal of Meta's upcoming smartwatch, which will have a notched camera. - [Riley] Apple got to them too. - There's just so many things to talk about that aren't leaked documents showing Facebook is the worst company to build the Metaverse, ever. This is, what a relief! - [Riley] Woo! Long live Howgen till I die. Viva la Howgen. Excuse me? Intel also had an event this week. Did you forget? It's fine. After unveiling the 12th gen Alderlake CPUs on Wednesday, Intel showed off some gaming demos with its XESS, super sampling technology. Excess? - [Riley] Sassy! - Or cess? Poop. - [Riley] Xess sells. - It actually looks like Intel may just given videos DLSS a run for its money in terms of sharpness. Intel also had some other performance gains to report. The company's Aurora supercomputer is apparently capable of nearly double the perms it was initially expected to achieve because team blues (speaks foreign language) you know, GPU is a way better than they thought. - [Riley] Nice mistake. - Excellent. - [Riley] Coincidence. (James chuckles) - Intel says Aurora will be the industry's first two EXAFLOPS supercomputer when it's installed at the Argonne national laboratory - [Riley] Aregonne. - Are gone, Argone, Argone? - [Riley] French? - You never know with Americans, they say pasta, it's like, so inconsistent. That will be installed whenever the chip shortage allows that to happen, and it just takes the wind right out of your sails, doesn't it? - [Riley] So many cool tech and you can't get it! - And speaking of giant computers, leaks are shedding light on AMD's plan for its epic server chips, and they got cores. We're telling ya, they're multiplying. AMD hasn't released its next gen epic Genoa processors yet, which are expected to have 96 cores. 96 cores. But new leaks claimed that Genoa will be followed by Bergamo which is like the end of, which really sounds like Inglorious Basterds pronunciation. Subscribe to they're just movies. Bergamo is gonna feature 128 cores, which will be followed by Turin with 256 cores and 512 threads, and a whopping 600 watt TDP. - [Riley] Wow! - [James] The leak comes from fairly accurate tipsters. So even though these releases may be delayed, at least we have something to dream about. - [Riley] Where am I gonna put all these cores? - Imagine they just get made in America and shipped to your door. Amazon prime, two days, baby. Riley, if you're here, how can you be here? - Now it's time for quick bits, brought to you by Wealthfront. The service that makes investing feel less like a roller coaster and more like a nice stable gondola. It's easy and affordable to set up your account and let Wealthfront take care of the rest, but you can build your own portfolio too, with accounts for everything from general savings to retirement.

The software is monitoring the portfolio so Wealthfront can rebalance it based on the client's preferences. It's looking for tax loss harvesting opportunities daily. It's learning to love the client for who they are inside. Whatever your investment goals are, Wealthfront has your back. So check them out and get a special signup bonus at the link below. - In the metaverse, quick bits will appear as little sparkles of light floating into your ear holes and on the rim of your glass. If your avatar has ears. Google has added end to end encryption to voice calls between two mobile devices using Google Fi, making it the first service to have such a function. It won't work over traditional cellular connection. Both devices have to be using either wifi or voiceover LTE, but at least you'll know you can say some things without Mark hearing. I don't even know if that's true, he has eyes everywhere. - [Riley] He's behind you! - Ah! He's in the signal protocol. (Riley laughs) Recently, DGI launched its Ronin 4D. The first cinema camera to feature a built in gimbal. Really? They're a first? This thing looks wacky. The full frame sensor is located at the end of a gooseneck arm. You just want to wrap your hand around their little necks, don't you? You just want to shake them. But Corridor Digital says it's a perfect camera. What do you think, David? - [David] It's pretty cool, is it? - A hundred percent, pretty cool. Microsoft has done their old rival Apple a solid and identified a vulnerability in Mac OS. It's called Shrootless because they don't like Dwight. - [Riley] No Dwight in sight. - Actually it's because it exploits a hole in the System Integrity Protection feature of Mac OS to allow an attacker to get root level privilege. Makes sense. Thankfully, Apple has already patched the flaw in currently supported versions of Mac OS Monterey, Catalina, and Big Sur. Sure they did. Though older versions may still be vulnerable, but don't worry, Mac users, Microsoft has your back. Unlike windows users. Microsoft has left us to die. Sony has officially named the publishing division it uses for PC ports to PlayStation PC, LLC. In a filing Spotify Video Games Chronicle, all former PlayStation exclusive games that have come to PC were published under PlayStation mobile label, so the change makes it look like Sony is serious about reaching the minority of PC gamers who also own a PlayStation console, like David. Yes. - [Riley] He's a weirdo. - Yes. Lend us your power. You cannot keep your games from us. We are the PlayStation all stars. Look at me. I am the PlayStation now. - [Riley] I'm Kratos. - I'm Kratos. (chuckles) I want to be Kratos! It's Halloween. And the US Army has awarded a joint contract to Boeing and General Atomics to develop a 300 kilowatt laser weapon, lase guns guys, dune, which would dwarf the power of the 30 kilowatt model the Navy was testing in 2014. - [Riley] That was, - Practically the stone age. - [Riley] Yeah, this one's for the kids. - That's for children now. This baby could shoot down missiles, drones, and even helicopters and planes. Question, is it mobile? Can we wheel this thing over to Meta's servers? - [Riley] Nip it right in the bud. - Yes, just take it out now before it grows too strong. Well, that's the end of this broadcast. I mean, and for my part, Metaverse sounds cool. I want it. - [Riley] No, you don't. - Yes I do. - [Riley] Whatever. - Yes I do. I'm gonna use meta's signals instead of the Facebook crap, whatever. Come back on Monday for more tech news approved by Boz. He's such a great guy, he even had a robot avatar, very cute. - [Riley] He's charming. - He's Mark's best friend. They're best friends.",

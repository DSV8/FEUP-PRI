    "transcript": "so Sam tell me what's going on here it sounds like watchdogs or Mr Robot? Right it definitely is like watch dogs we realized that when we found this vulnerability we could actually build a tool that is exactly the same as the actual watchdogs tool in the game so what actually happens in watchdogs is the character like walks up to a car you know does whatever and is able to like remotely unlock and start the car and using this vulnerability you can do the same thing knowing only the victim's like license plate number. Sam this is crazy from a privacy point of view if I understand this correctly you guys can find any Kia car in the world basically is that right? Yeah basically if you see a license plate of a Kia vehicle online of like some celebrity you know if an attacker were to exploit this they could just type in that license plate number and find the exact location of that car and do it persistently and the victim will never receive like a notification they're not going to get an email like hey you know somebody's tracked your car it's just like dead silence and you know somebody can just keep tracking it over and over. Your phone rings the number displayed is our phone rings the number displayed is someone that you know when you answer the call the voice sounds like one of your children or a family member or your boss and they are asking you to urgently send money but is that actually the person you think it is or is it a scammer now unfortunately in today's world with the rise of AI of voice cloning you can't trust that the voice that you're hearing is actually the person you think it is this has been an ongoing issue for a long time where your personal data is sold by data brokers online freely available or available for a small cost for scammers hackers and companies to try and hack you or to just follow you online and violate your privacy Rachel Tobac an ethical hacker who I highly respect has done various demonstrations with CNN where she has phoned companies pretending to be one of the reporters as an example spoofing their telephone number using voice software to sound like that person and for instance to change bookings or steal Airline points she's also used voice cloning to phone an assistant pretending to be a boss getting them to do something that they shouldn't have done those were fantastic demonstrations of a real world problem this is happening all the time you need to make sure that your data is removed from the internet you can either do that manually which is a really difficult task or you can use a service such as DeleteMe which I'm using because of the recommendations of Rachel Tobac and others that I respect in the cyber security industry don't believe that this will never happen to you in the us alone in 2024 there were over a million reports of identity theft so scammers are trying to scam you hackers are trying to hack you they're trying to steal your identity they trying to get access to your money they trying to get access to your bank accounts they can find your personal data they can find your name they can find your telephone number they can find your address they can find a whole bunch of other information about you including really confidential information such as your social security number if you're based in the US unfortunately even your passwords are out there because of data breaches that take place I personally use DeleteMe because of the recommendations of Rachel Tobac and others what's fantastic about their service is it's a hands-off subscription service your personal data is continuously monitored and removed from the internet you could manually go and ask Google to remove your data from their search results that is a lot of work it's much easier and more convenient to have DeleteMe go and do that than you continuously try and monitor the internet and remove your data the choice is yours however now if you want to join DeleteMe and get your personal data removed from the internet use the link join joindeleteme.com/bombal and get a 20% discount one other thing to remember is it doesn't just apply to you personally it also applies to your family members you can pay for a family subscription service that protects you and your family now this doesn't just apply to the US DeleteMe has offerings for other parts of the world once again use my link below to sign up I really want to thank DeleteMe for sponsoring this video and supporting my channel as well as protecting me and my family by removing my personal data from the internet. Everyone it's David Bombal back with the amazing Sam Curry Sam great to have you here. Oh yeah great to be here. So Sam you guys have been up to some uh I don't know shenanigans maybe or something so perhaps you can tell us about this newest car hacking piece that you've put out. Sure so the short of it is we built an app that lets you type in a license plate of any Kia and just unlock and start the car you can also locate it and track it but Kia s like patched this vulnerability and we only Built the tool as a proof of concept yeah. I think it's really important to say that right because you guys are ethical hackers you're not I mean you could have sold this on the black market for probably quite a lot of money but you're doing this ethically yeah we're doing it ethically to report it and make the kind of car ecosystem a little bit safer um so we kind of had some fun with this one to make the disclosure process a bit better yeah so just so that people understand you've got this app on your phone and through that app you're sending some kind of commands to the cloud or an API or something and that gives you full control over the vehicle uh just with the number plate is that kind of right right we built an app that leverages of vulnerability in Kia that affects the dealer portal where an attacker can basically type in a VIN number which you can derive from the license plate and then execute commands like unlock locate or start so I mean it's it's scary from the point of view that if I had your number plate I could find where you are so from a stalking point of view that's also insane yeah I mean it's really kind of terrifying because like road rage from a threat perspective and like is actually kind of a scary thing right like the number of friends I have who have like people who follow them home or like tried to like run into them in traffic is kind of crazy but when you add this element into it where it's like somebody can just type in your license plate number find you track you and basically see you know where you live and unlock your car it's a little scary I mean we had an interview which I'll link below where you guys hacked like 15 million cars or something crazy all kinds of Brands Ferrari uh BMW Mercedes I mean a whole bunch of them but this attack was specifically on Kia so any Kia vehicle or car is susceptible to this is that correct pretty much every Kia vehicle made after 2013 and the cool part about this attack is it doesn't require that the victim is paying for any sort of subscription so as long as you have that remote connected Hardware in your vehicle we can actually activate that hardware and then perform the attack on your behalf without you really knowing about it yeah because when I was reading your notes so just for everyone who's watching I've put a link to Sam's blog below where this isn't explain in a lot of detail you just by getting the license plate number could I I for different Vehicles right it's um you could find it to geolocate it you can remotely unlock it lock it remote start uh light put the lights on is that correct and hunt the horn um yep you could also turn the camera on right yeah so for the vehicles that had it enabled they had like these 360 cameras we could actually go ahead and view those like live cameras from wherever they're at so it allows you to like take pictures of like a full 360 Degrees around that car so for like you know I think models past like 2018 or 2019 that had that specific trim we could do that so from a privacy point of view it's a nightmare because you could locate the vehicle without any additional subscription is that right right you can remotely control the car so you could literally just walk up to a car like you showed in your video unlock the doors uh turn it on and drve away yeah exactly and it's it's kind of interesting because it's not a fake video like that is a real video of a car we rented that we had no association with so all you did was rent the car you they they obviously put your name on the registration etc etc but just by getting the license plate you had total control right and you could do this with like pretty much any Kia we tested it on our friends Cars uh the journalist who covered the story Andy Greenberg to actually validate that this was possible he I think tweeted and found a random one of his followers to come out and just show his key to us and then we tied in the license plate and did the same thing to him Sam last time we spoke you were talking about how you guys Target like cloud-based infrastructure or centralized infrastructure and that's means that unlike a Flipper Zero you can just like perhaps replay like do a replay attack against a single car you you're attacking millions of them so can you kind of explain in bit a bit more detail how that works because obviously there's an app on your phone but like what's happening in the background. Sure yeah so very straightforward when you actually type in the license plate of the victim vehicle there's a thirdparty database which is basically a public accessible conversion between like license plate to VIN number so we'll go ahead and convert the license plate to the VIN number and then once you have that VIN number index you can actually use that VIN number in the cloud-based systems to exploit vulnerabilities so what we did is we found vulnerabilities that allowed you to basically completely take over victim's account or vehicle and you pass the VIN number then to those vulnerable APIs and at that point you become the owner of the vehicle and all this happens without the victim ever know like knowing there's no email that's sent to the victim that notifies them that we've added ourselves to their account and then once we're in their account and can access their vehicle we can go and execute commands on that vehicle so for instance like you could track a car go to it unlock it and then start it you can also like unlock the trunk uh take photos from the 360 cameras things like that. Because you guys did something interesting right you didn't attack like the central portal you found like a separate website and perhaps you can just tell us about that? yeah sure so we actually targeted the dealer infrastructure we found a lot of vulnerabilities in the past on like other automakers but we tend to focus on the user you know front end for like customers right yeah but this time we focused on like the actual dealer side of things which surprisingly You' expect to be behind VPN you know actually hard to get to but anybody on the planet could like load these websites and then find vulnerabilities in them so you you found a deal website that was just open on the web and then if I if I understood your write it correctly and you you go deep in the technical stuff so unlike like perhaps a normal journalist to you know give us the the nitty-gritty um you found that you could get a token and create an like a dealer account or something right? Yeah so basically what we found is that when they built the dealer infrastructure and the customer infrastructure they were actually parallel it was like the same sort of APIs so what we did is we just copied the request from the users's API and we use it on that dealer infrastructure and we're able to actually like register for a dealer account ourselves and then from that point we can make a token and then dig through all the JavaScript on the dealer portal to find those API calls and then we can call those API calls using our author authorization token. Sam you've obviously got this blog perhaps you can like show us exactly what's going on and you know for the technical people in the audience you know don't don't be shy give us the details of like the API calls and you know the the JavaScript etc etc go deep man. Yeah sure so key infrastructure is really really interesting there's kind of this like front end reverse proxy to this backend API which runs everything and we're able to actually find the Kia dealer front end the backend API and there's this like HTTP request where if you copy the normal HTTP request where you register as like a customer like a normal Kia vehicle you can actually register to the dealer portal and then from that dealer portal if we scroll down there's these API end points where you pass in this header called API URL and you can you know index specific API calls to do certain things with the vehicles so the second API call what it'll do is from that VIN it will retrieve the victim's name email phone number physical address and then you can actually like see who you're targeting right so not only is this like a security issue from like a physical take over the car perspective but also from like a privacy perspective right if we go back to the scenario where it's like somebody cuts you off you can you know obviously like pull their address and stuff so the third step here is we actually modify the owner's permission of the vehicle so like let's say that the car was being utilized through the remote connected app and that there was like an active subscription we can actually modify the owner's permission where we can invite ourselves and then become the prim primary owner and basically demote them as a secondary owner and then when that happens they're never notified that we're accessing their account and we can also like become you know access those additional permissions to execute commands yeah and then the last thing we can do is just like add ourselves to the vehicle so after we modify the victim's permissions for their vehicle we can add ourselves now as the primary owner and then execute those commands and then lastly what we'll do and it's not documented the actual HTTP request in the blog post but there's all the different commands you can send to the car yeah. I can understand that you guys are hiding that but from your app it's going to the dealer portal or somewhere in the Kia infrastructure right and then just making API calls and then sending that down to the car and then getting the car to do things like open up. Yep exactly. I I think last time we spoke about this I had the same reaction right this is insane they want you know the government or whatever wants all cars connected but like guys like are showing like huge vulnerabilities from security point of view but also privacy point of view. Yeah 100% so it's really really fascinating from like actual security and privacy perspective because it's like say the vulnerability is patch like this is a one-off vulnerability that we found and reported that they'll put a software update and the infrastructure will still exist for like Kia dealers for Kia employees to be able to modify this and at the backend level there's still going to be those internal APIs and it's interesting because it's it's on behalf of Kia the organization right it's not like a dealership has these apis they have access to them but they don't run them right there is that centralized point which is Kia which has access to all these internal APIS which can do all these things so yeah it's really interesting from a privacy and security perspective. yeah I mean I think for a lot of privacy conscious people the it only takes one subpoena from the government to like say where's your car where are you? yep and like it definitely happens right like they will definitely they definitely store like your location and like it it is there in the app right unless you physically disable these sims they are sending data out yeah I mean there was a case in the UK where someone was murdered on a farm and they managed to find the person even though they had burnt their vehicle by going through the history of the logs of where the car had been. Yeah it's really interesting like and if you're going to like murder somebody I assume you try to think about something like that so it's really interesting even like somebody who's like calculated or done a murder like isn't thinking of these things which is kind of crazy to me so like most people I don't think would think that unless they're paying a subscription you know they're not getting those connected services but the reality is they're still existing. yeah I mean because all the cars are connected um and I mean when we when you did the last hack you were talking about Jasper right that allowed said just talk about what what that is again for people who didn't watch the previous video. sure yeah so Jasper is really interesting because uh if you're a Kia and you want to buy like a million SIM cards that you're going to put in your vehicle they all get managed through this centralized system called Jasper and Jasper is like this multi-tenant Telco system which allows like the tenet Kia to actually manage those SIM cards right and through you know like normal telecommunication functionality you can actually like triangulate where the SIM cards are so if the SIM cards plugged into you know any sort of device for instance this time like a car the actual provider that Telco Jasper system but basically you do is triangulate your location. Yes so I mean the I think it it's Cisco Jasper now right so the um there's a centralized device or system that has all this information about all these cars and wherever they are at any given time so if a if if a I mean from a law enforcement point of view it's obviously fantastic because like this murderer was caught because of the location of the car they could prove that he had been there but from a privacy point of view as a normal citizen not doing anything wrong it's a worry right? It's definitely a worry and there's been cases too in the US where like a police officer or somebody working for the DMV will actually find a victim's address and then like you know Murder or like go to their house and things like that and it's it's been really bad so the fact that like you know someone like me can go and like find a ility like this which allows you to access that it kind of begs the question like are other people going and finding these issues and like are they being exploited to target for instance like specific individuals. I'm glad you mentioned that because I mean I don't want to downplay you guys because you guys are rock stars in this field there there's like four or five of you is that right as a team? Yep there's a so to just say you know this research was done by me Nico Rivera Ian Carroll and Justin Reinhardt. So I mean you guys four rock stars doing this but like nation states or you know well-paid groups for lack of a better term they are also looking at these things. yeah definitely I mean from like an intelligence perspective and like a nation state perspective it's a really fun idea to like you know if you're tracking a country or tracking people on a country to actually have like what is essentially like long standing tracking of like where they are and where they're going I think it you know sheds a lot of light for like these kind of like secondary attacks you know who's visiting who like you know things like that like some nice social graphs. yeah I mean so from a privacy point of view we're getting tracked on our cars and so the I I think from my point of view I need to buy a classic car is what I said last time and I think I should really look at that right not that I've got anything to hide but from a privacy point of view you don't want to be tracked 24/7 but your phones and other devices are also tracking you so from a car point of view it's a nightmare but you guys also did work with apple right you also hacked Apple? yeah we found vulnerabilities where like you could essentially query any user and pull their you know name billing information physical address purchases and just like all the general stuff on your Apple account we also found vulnerabilities that allow you to like leak and enumerate people's iCloud photos yeah so you could look at people's photos stored in the cloud? yeah there was a vulnerability which allowed you basically by sending a malicious email that you open on your iPhone it would basically leak to us your photos so it took advantage of a vulnerability in the actual like Apple mail client so where when you open it a payload executes and then it pulls all your photos from iCloud and sends it over to us. so Sam I I'm a bit slow with these things how did you get the number plate to VIN and I mean I'm not sure if you shared that on your blog but you know how does that connection work? yeah sure so this is something I learned about recently and like the last year um I didn't know it was possible originally but somebody told me that the DMV in the United States actually sells this data to a few companies or they like have a relationship and give it away but those companies with this data I think they realize that there's a market for it so those companies has actually built out APIs for you know normal businesses and like law enforcement to use so anybody like myself can just go and register to these APIs and then it costs like you know one or two cents per query to actually convert somebody's license plate to a VIN number so yeah from like an attacker perspective it's really really interesting because most of the connected car vulnerabilities will index the vehicle by the VIN number so when you can just you know find a photo of a celebrity getting into their car take the license plate turn it into a VIN number and then just like basically hack them right it becomes like a a more accessible kind of thing. yeah I mean that's crazy because I mean like you've just said there if I see a photo of some person some celeb that I want to know about all I need is their their their number plate I pay a few cents get their VIN number and then I can locate them that's insane. yeah it's definitely like kind of freaky and like there's a lot of uh like other information you can retrieve so there's like a lot of like billing information about like your series XM connection and like these different APIs that just leak tons of information and like there's so many that like haven't been fixed or still being fixed that like it's kind of scary because it's just like you know you can derive so much from somebody. And that's on the DMV side right that's not specific to Kia this is just general. yep so in the United States it's pretty much like every vehicle if you have a license plate you can derive it to the actual make and model of the the car they have like an ongoing relationship so it's it's not sparse they have like everybody's data in every state and can do this for anywhere. so okay so just so walk me through it again because I'm slow you get the number plate from this rental that you showed in the video you go to this API from the DMV or this this data broker whatever you get the the VIN number so you get the association from number plate to VIN number then you went to the dealer site and you could by creating this fake you became basically a k dealer right and that's how and then you tied that in the VIN number into the dealer site to get the details of the car did I did I say that right? yeah basically there's a a lot of like vulnerabilities kind of in the middle part there but yeah is going to be license plate to vin number to exploit on the dealer portal to physically being able to access that car. yeah it's mad because I mean I mean it sounds like okay it's one hack but it sounds like there's a whole bunch of things that you guys had to do to actually get this to work. yeah so the the actual idea behind building the app is like when we did the car research a long time ago I always had the idea it's like you know to actually really get like the public understanding of like what is possible you kind of need to build the Mr Robot type proof of concepts right so the idea for like the Kia tool or like an app that lets you type in a license plate and get the VIN number that's like a really big process for us because once you have that VIN number every single car company has like different types of vulnerabilities with that VIN number right so you can basically load in as many exploits as you want into this tool and then you'll have like kind of this Universal tool to like either unlock locate or you know dock somebody from their license plate number. I mean that's crazy I mean it's you're obviously not giving all the information on your blog and understandably so um what's worrying is okay so this is here they fixed it but you know I'm I'm hoping you you you you've already got other car manufacturers in your in your sites and you're going to go and see what they doing. yeah like we want to look at car manufacturers a little bit more it's kind of tricky because it's like uh we've done we've been on the car hacking beat for like a few years now so it's like we may want to like move on a little bit to something new but like we think this proof of concept does enough to like demonstrate like hey you know like this is a really big deal from like an attacker perspective because it's like you know car theft is very rampant in the United States like you could sell this to criminals very easily and it's just like instead of having to smash Windows just car hack it unlock it leave and everything's going to look normal until you know people come back yeah. I mean a lot of I think the the big takeaway whenever I talk to you is unlike these other car uh theft uh gadgets if you like Flipper Zeros in you know was made a big thing of in Canada and they seem to have like misunderstood you the the limitations of the Flipper Zero but I mean that's one car uh you know these guys have these tools where they can unlock a specific car but you could unlock any car that you wanted to? yeah so any Kia vehicle pretty much made after 2013 at minimum you could do is track and unlock it a lot of them had like extra features again like viewing the cameras or things like that but yeah pretty much it is wild because it's like I'll be I'll be driving right and I'll see a Kia it's like I could Hack That and another Kia it's like I could hack that and it's just over and over it's just every car basically. So tell me you could get open unlock the car you could get in start it and drive away you didn't have to do anything else just with that app on your phone you could do all of that and just literally take the car. yeah so you' you actually have to pair it with uh some specific vulnerabilities so for instance there's like key fob vulnerabilities you'd have to use or you'd have to actually bypass it using just like a normal thing the the app itself won't allow you to drive it away but yeah like with Kia like there's a lot of secondary issues obviously with like starting the vehicle so it's not like it's not a long shot to do that but it does require a little bit more. So I mean a lot of the audience watching are very technical and into cyber security but what was your what was the reaction from the the wire journalist and like the less technical people? yeah so we actually demonstrated the vulnerability to the wire journalist Andy Greenberg he was really shocked because what he' done is he asked his followers said hey you know does anybody own Kia and if so come out to like Denver Colorado and we want to test something and we got this group chat together and the dude in the group chat I asked him if he could just like share his license plate and then he shared his license plate and then like 15 seconds later he's like hey my car is honking you know and then he's like this is the craziest P I've ever seen because it's just very very very straightforward right so then we eventually like flew out all to Denver and all of us were in this parking lot and you know the guy drives up in his Kia and it's like a very quick thing where on a laptop or on a phone we're just very able to quickly take over his car track it unlock it start it. yeah I mean what I love about it right is it's exactly that you guys have taken this really technical thing like this hack or a bunch of hacks I mean you've been showing me like the code and people who are technical understand that but to actually make it real for a normal person in the street that app just you know really seals the deal. right it's really interesting too from like a security perspective because like sharing these things often like you'll get a all these security companies will share these crazy blog posts about these vulnerabilities but when you actually read the story you realize it's not exploitable unless there're like these preconditions met but with this vulnerability it affected pretty much every Kia I made after 2013 and you know if your friend own Kia and they're not paying for the subscription we could still hack them if it's an old Kia from like 2015 and it doesn't have much features like we could still hack it like pretty much every Kia after 2013. I saw you shared in your blog there was a link to someone testifying in Congress about what you guys got up to? yeah definitely so that was Paul Roberts and he actually testified I think on a senate hearing on like vehicle security and it was really cool because we actually for a different vulnerability for like a TSA vulnerability we got to go out and like sit in the Senate hearing so it's really cool to see because I think with the vehicle hacking uh US government is like taking it very seriously from a privacy and security perspective because you know more and more the US seems to be shifting towards you know companies themselves should be responsible for software vulnerabilities and you know having hearings like that to like really kind of hammer the idea like you know if you guys keep messing up like we're gonna have to change something. yeah I mean it's it's it's crazy how the how the world is moving so quickly ahead right with um IoT uh connected cars but security is is is is an after thought. The car ecosystem is really interesting because like there's so many there's so much similar between every vehicle so like for vehicles to stand out they really have to go the extra mile to like push the extra feature you know and when Tesla came out and like basically kind of spearheaded a lot of like the connected vehicle stuff with like hey you can control your car with your phone the other automakers like I feel like felt like they had to catch up and they're pushing out these changes and like these new configurations and new things like 360 degree cameras without considering like a lot of the security implications and for researchers to like come in and like you can demonstrate that these are vulnerable systems and that you can't exploit them it's it's like a really kind of scary thing. I think the more you learn about cyber security the more paranoid you become and rightly so especially when I talk to experts like you and other people right it makes me like think I really want to disconnect my life because the more the world is moving to be more and more connected but security is lagging behind. Right yeah definitely and there's like a really funny quote um a friend of mine shared that a friend of his who had like worked at Tesla you know he was talking to him and they're like oh what kind of Tesla do you drive and he was like oh I drive like a 2016 Tesla and then the Tesla employee was like oh my God I wouldn't get in a 2016 Tesla and like you have to think about that from like a security privacy because someone someone internal at Tesla's like oh my God like I understand like that's not safe so like what is really going on like behind the scenes is there like a lot of you know mitigate or people just kind of skipping security and like pushing out changes and knowing that like these systems are vulnerable it's really kind of interesting to think about. You I mean it's and what you've said is like Tesla have pushed the limits of this with connected cars making our lives easier perhaps like you walk up to the car the door unlocks all that kind of stuff you know starting the car with your phone and the other manufacturers are playing catchup at feels sometimes but you know they they they rushing these features out the door without thinking about security implications. Right and I'd be like kind of terrified so like Tesla implemented a thing called summon mode right and summon mode is literally you signing into your account on the app and from like anywhere in the world it it does like a location check like a proximity check on your iPhone location to car location but you can bypass that right and from anywhere in the world you send that remote command and it will like actually move the car right and this is accessible to like all consumers but it's it's kind of a wild thing to say like oh you know if somebody hacks your Tesla account they can instead of like even you know honking your horn whatever it's like they can physically move your car right so for other auto manufacturers like Kia or you Hyundai or whoever if they wanted to like copy Tesla and push this out I don't know if I would trust like the security of that kind of implementation. Sam you had this part of your blog where you say taking over vehicles and you're showing like attacker K backend um the victim vehicle and you're showing these different messages could you just talk us through like sort of the the logic of what's going on. yeah so with this diagram the first step's kind of cool because it's like the actual vulnerability so when we actually generate that dealer token we're using that vulnerability we found to actually create that dealer account but once we generate that dealer token we'll retrieve the victims like name email phone number all that and then after we know who the victim is we can actually go ahead and like modify their account and after we modify their account the final thing we're going to do is add ourselves to the account as the primary owner and the cool thing too is like the victim is never notified there's no email like there's been changes made to your account it just happens right and finally after we've done all that we can actually send those commands to the vehicle. Because in your app I saw you have two parts to garage and then something else is that right? yeah so I made the decision to add like a garage page to our app because like let's say you hacked a vehicle and then you like the next day you came back to it you'll actually keep that vehicle in your account that you can still like send those commands to um so the actual exploit takes around 30 seconds but the actual commands take like four or five seconds so once that vehicle has been initially compromised you can just go to the garage at any time and then find the vehicle you want to send commands to and click the commands. So you had the garage part that's where you're doing stuff with a car correct and then your exploit is the actual hack did I understand that right? Yep the exploit page is going to be the actual hack so all of like the backend like stuff you're not seeing takes place once you actually click exploit so it sends about probably like seven or eight HTP requests and it'll give you like logs of what's going on so for every step in that exploit process you get like a message in your air log or your console and uh and then once the car has been successfully exploited you can just click garage and it'll show up on garage as a victim's vehicle that you've taken over and then from there you can actually click to execute commands. Now you've mentioned this on multiple times and I'm sure someone's thinking about it because I was like okay you keep mentioning HTTP but I'm assuming it was encrypted it wasn't clear text stuff. yeah HTTP sorry yeah that's that's fine because I mean I it's like is it that bad hopefully Kia used encrypted stuff but it's um I understand you're talking about HTTP response and requests but it's it it was encrypted but I mean it didn't really help in this case because you could just become a dealer. Right exactly it didn't it it was encrypted but yeah just sadly vulnerable. I was looking at the timeline and it looked like you guys find it on I I got to look at the American um like date so it's the 7th of June this year that you guys uh sent the message to Kia first correct yep and then you had to prompt them like multiple times about how serious this was. Yeah it took a while to communicate and I don't really like to bash companies because like I think even just like fixing it and not really responding is still like a really good thing with them to do but yeah you know Kia was kind of like not super communicative so like we had to prompt them a few times and then even like when we intended to disclose it we had to like prompt them a few times as well to like say hey you know we valid it's fixed but you know we're going to wait the full three months because you're not being very responsive so. yeah I mean it's a problem for security researchers I mean you guys have been doing this for a long time what's your advice for someone who wants to get into car hacking or just into security research um in in whatever area it is because like how do you pay yourself how do companies pay you you know what's your advice for the journey? yeah so the journey is very interesting right like uh I always joke with my girlfriend that like you know if if security research isn't paid then we'd be broke right you know y like but the whole uh the whole thing with like doing work like this is like with car companies and companies like this they can be a bit litigious so like kind of approaching it lightf footed and understanding like the risks involved like both like legally and from a security perspective of like making sure you're authorized to test and not overing any boundaries um yeah I think the the big thing that I would say to people is like individual like hackers have so much power because like if you're a team even if when you're like a team of pentesters and you guys are like the elite team of pentesters it's gonna take you two weeks to set up an audit you're gonna have like a time box like 80 hours to audit something and then yeah afterwards there's like a you know write the full report so like even just from a time perspective right if you're like this elite pentester you're on this like crazy schedule you can't hack what you want you know you're kind of stuck but yeah to add the second part of that it's like from an individual perspective right there are so many Open Security Programs that you can pick pretty much anything and you can put like a dedicated effort and most of the time find really serious vulnerabilities like the the way companies work and the way like everything works is like most of the time there are areas that are being neglected by organizations from a security perspective and as an individual if you can like kind of research that and from an outside perspective just say like hey you know it looks like you guys didn't secure this portion and I found a vulnerability in it it's a very like valuable and approachable thing for individuals. So did you go buy bug bounty was it is this part of a bug bounty program or was it just like okay we get we decide one day we going to start hacking Kia. yeah so it's it's just for fun um it's part of a disclosure program that doesn't pay money but we do other bug bounty programs like I I do work I sold a company like I I'm very like financially motivated but at the same time like this work is all passion projects right like I I very much enjoy kind of just like the fun hacking that has like funny goals at the end of it like one of the funny things for me too is like just the funny thought like you're in a Drive-Thru at Starbucks right and say there's somebody in front of you you know if you exploit this vulnerability you could technically just type in their license plate and make their car honk right and it's hilarious right because it's like this person has no idea what's going on their car is honking and then like you're sitting there and there's like no who is going to assume the person behind you has hacked your car like make it honk it's just it's really fun so. yeah me I love what you're doing because you make it like like a joke or a prank but I mean at the same time you are closing serious vulnerabilities in cars or other systems like Apple etc and making the world a more secure place. yeah definitely I think there's like there's very serious and then there's very like whimsical kind of and they kind of collide a little bit so. What would your advice be to someone who's starting you know is like they interested in this stuff I mean you've already shared your journey and I'll put that video below again but maybe like in brief you can tell us like any you know bit later now any in like in our interview from the previous one you know what's your advice for someone getting started. yeah I mean the biggest piece of advice I'd say is like just have fun with it like you don't have to be studying these like really long courses or reading all these books like just kind of find something you like you know maybe if you're part of like a tennis club or something there's a tennis club website you know like it's really silly but it's like if you could report a vulnerability there and like you know it'd be fun for you then why not you know like obviously you know test with permission blah blah blah but like try to stay focused on things you actually enjoy. Sam I really want to thank you for sharing and inspiring people I think it's so important that all of us see people like you in the industry doing this I mean you're not a boomer you're someone younger you've done a whole Bunch already in your life and it's fantastic to see you inspiring people but also inspiring people to go on the on the right path so thanks so much for sharing. yeah definitely 100% happy to be here",

Even the Mac mini which used to be the \"budget-conscience\" Mac starts at just under $1,000. The new MacBook Air is insanely expensive at $1,099 and with dismal entry-level specs (like a 128GB SSD and Y-Series processor), a hackintosh laptop seems like the best way to go. Just like the hackintosh desktop builds we have done in the past, this one works great. Perfectly! And we're really excited to show it to you. It's a MacBook Air KILLER at just $279.",

    "transcript": "Its no secret that Apple thinks tablet computing is the future. I mean, at the end of the day wHaTs a ComPUtEr?! Its kinda hard to blame them when they absolutely topple sales charts with over 70% tablet marketshare and for many people, something like an iPad can be a genuine computer replacement. For others, however, it cant. The problem is that Apple no longer offers a low-end Mac instead re-directing consumers to iPad. Well, they offer low-end Macs, but they dont offer low-priced Macs. Apple is only the fourth-bestselling computer maker in the world with a mere 6.8% marketshare; however, their ASP (thats average sales price), is nearly $1,300 per Mac which puts them at #2 in total revenuejust behind Lenovodespite selling less than 1/3 the number of units. What Im saying is Apples not going to be offering a budget Mac anytime soon. If you want the macOS experience but cant justify buying Apple hardware, the hackintosh community has been thriving for a number of years and weve done several desktop builds in the past. But the reality is that most people own and purchase laptops. So weve built what I believe to be the cheapest Mac you can get. Period. And its a 15.4 MacBook alternative for $279. We call it, WhackBook Bro. The best part? Everything works. Well, everything except the SD card slot reader (which who cares). But youll care about our sponsor for this video, Dashlane! Protect yourself online and never forget another password with Dashlane Premium. Sign up free today with the link below. The Lenovo laptop used is currently listed for $379 at BestBuy.com, but we picked it up for $279 a couple weeks ago during a back-to-school promotion deal. That specific BestBuy deal is now gone, but you can find them elsewhere online for about the same price we did. For less than $300, youve really got to temper exceptions when it comes to specs. The CPU is a dual-core i3-8130U with a base clockspeed of 2.2GHz and 3.5GHz boost with Intel UHD Graphics 620. It ships with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. These specs arent horrible. Theyre not good, but theyre fine for the price. The biggest area of compromise is the display which is look, Im kinda spoiled by good displays, but this thing is awful. Its low-resolution at 1366x768 which while poor is tolerable. Whats not tolerable is the horrid viewing angles, uneven and dim backlighting, heinous color accuracy, and atrocious response time. Its just a really, really, really bad display. Now, what we didnt do because we were short on time but what you could do for a massive quality-of-life improvement, is replace the display with one of the many 3rd-party IPS models. Because of the pin configuration of the ribbon cable, youll sadly need to stick to the 768p resolution, but you can at least get a better quality display. Okay, so the laptop packs specs that are nearly sufficient to run macOS Mojave but not quite there. Apple recommends a minimum 8GB of RAM and weve only got 4 gigs soldered to the board. Furthermore, the machine doesnt have on-board Ethernet and the Wi-Fi card included with the laptop is not macOS compatible. So, I cracked this baby open (which was extremely easy to do, by the way) and did just that. I installed an extra 4GB of RAM which I got for less than $20 on Amazon (Ill link all this stuff below, by the way), and fit it into the single DIMM slot available on the motherboard. Its cool that even though the base memory is soldered, Lenovo permits additional user expansion. After that, I replaced the wireless LAN card that came with the laptop in favor of a Broadcom card thats supported by macOS. This is a very easy process. Pull off the coax antenna connectors, remove, replace, repeat. And thats it! But, before we seal the laptop back up, I just want to point out a few things that are pretty interesting and funny. For one, the battery is tiny. Battery life with Windows 10 S (which the laptop ships with) is similar to macOS and both are pretty terrible. Even doing light laptop work, youll be lucky to get 3 hours out of this machine. The battery is only 30 Wh which is a clear cost-cutting measure to get this laptop out to consumers cheaply. Theres a huge amount of just dead space inside the laptop where there arent any components in sight. Quite the contrast from a MacBook which are packed so tightly with boards and batteries that they can barely close. Theres a generic 128GB SATA SSD which you could upgrade cheaply if you wanted more storage which is nice. Also of note, the motherboard doesnt have any dGPU on it, but you can see that the board is ready to be flowed with components. There is space and solder for one. Why? They just use this same motherboard design on higher-end configurations that come with a graphics chip. Kinda neat. Once its sealed back up, its time to install macOS. Now, Im not going to go step-by-step through this process because its boring and is subject to change in the future, but the installation was refreshingly easy. This is a pretty popular model of laptop and so there are a bunch of people that have already done the hard work of troubleshooting and gathering needed files. Ill link below to a forum post that Ive created helping users through this process step-by-step to save you the pain and anguish of tracking down tutorials and files from all over the web like I had to do. All in all, this entire install should take you less than an hour. Its not bad at all. Once the macOS install is complete, thats about it! You should note that everything works excellently. The trackpad works swell and even supports macOS multitouch gestures though, the location of the trackpad to the left of the laptops chassis drives me absolutely bonkers. The keyboard adjusts the volume, supports modifier keys, and while theres quite a lot of chassis flex, it actually feels nicer to type on than I expected; more than passable for a sub-$300 laptop. Audio works perfectly (although the speakers are pretty crappy), the microphone is supported which allows for integrated Siri support, nice the built-in camera even works and [nothing says $279 laptop quite like this webcam]. On second thought, thats actually not horrible compared to the dismal webcam on the current-gen MacBook Air. All our plentiful I/O works just great save for the SD card slot, and boy it feels super strange seeing this many ports on a laptop. Hope they bring that cutting-edge feature to the MacBook line some day. WiFi works swell and all the features youd expect like AirDrop, Continuity Clipboard, and more work just fine, though, I did have a bit of an issue getting the machine to show up in the Find My app. I did not setup iMessage nor FaceTime because Im currently on the Galaxy Note 10, but others have reported success and Ill link to those tutorials in my forum post I mentioned earlier. So the screen kinda sucks, but general performance is excellent. Better, in fact, than I expected. So I took to the benchmarks to see how shed perform and holy smokes, this machine out-benches the newest MacBook Air in the new GeekBench 5, as well as CineBench R20, and even during our in-house Final Cut benchmark, it came in closer to the base-model 13 MacBook Pro than it did the 13 MacBook Air. Nice! Because there is no dedicated GPU, gaming performance is pretty dismal, although, thanks to the insanely-low screen resolution, you can play less-intensive titles just fineso long as there is native macOS support. Does Apple need to be worried about this laptop? No, not really. This is a segment they have no interest in serving and the quality of the hardwarewhile passablewould never in a million years appear on Apple.com. That said, for students, beginning developers, and just normal users who want macOS but cant afford an Apple laptop, this is a great option you should seriously consider. And I mean, look, it out-benches the MacBook Air for less than $300. Come on, Tim, at least admit thats kinda funny. Do you know what else is funny? Someone logging into your bank account and stealing all your money cause you use the same password for your bank as Yahoo Answers. Oh wait, thats not funny. That sucks.

    "description": "Foldable screens are the biggest revolution in mobile tech in over a decade. In just one year, the foldable phone has gone from far-fetched sci-fi movie prop to reality, with four models available now and more coming soon. Ive been following the foldable-screen revolution ever since picking up that first ill-fated Galaxy Fold from Samsung in April 2019, and every model since  the Huawei Mate X/Xs, Motorola Razr, Galaxy Z Flip, and even the LG Dual Screen faux-ldable, has advanced the story of the foldable phone. With a Lenovo folding-screen laptop on the horizon and still more variations on the foldable theme coming from Microsoft with its Surface Duo and Neo, the days of the boring old rectangular slab appear to be numbered. And I couldnt be happier.   [SUBSCRIBE TO MRMOBILE]     [ABOUT INTO THE FOLD, EPISODE 1]  This is the first in a series of episodes exploring the many facets of life on a folding screen. From the best foldable phones of 2020 to the bleeding-edge world of folding-screen laptops, Into The Fold is MrMobiles showcase for the most exciting movement in mobile technology since 2007.   In Episode 1, MrMobile outlines the four basic types of folding phone to help you decide which one might be best for your lifestyle, and also to shine a light on the best (and worst) aspects of foldable phones in 2020.

    "transcript": "- [Michael] I wanted to start this series on foldable phones with a followup review of the one I've been carrying since new years, the one that official made foldables a thing nearly a year ago, the Samsung Galaxy Fold. But when I got the chance to spend a few days with the newest, hottest, most polarizing foldable phone in existence I took a page out of Will McAvoy's book. - Let's throw out the rundown. - Oh boy. - Welcome to life on a folding screen, Mr. Mobile's exploration of the biggest revolution in smartphones in over a decade. Episode one, the four kinds of foldable explained. (upbeat contemporary music) Now most folks don't own a folding phone yet and for good reason; they're fragile, they're expensive, and they're so new that they're also unproven. In fact, whenever someone sees me in public with a foldable I usually tell 'em you probably don't wanna buy this one but the next generation, that might be worth a look. Now because the category is so new some companies aren't jumping with both feet into actual literal folding screens yet. Instead, they're making what I call faux-ldables. Faux-ldable, it works better on paper. (upbeat contemporary music) This is the category that's been around the longest because it's the simplest. These are phones or tablets with two screens joined by a hinge. The first time most of us saw one of these was the Kyocera Echo from 2011 followed by Sony's Tablet P the year after. The category went quiet for a few years after those failed until ZTE revived it with its Axon M in 2017. Well, tried to revive it anyway. Until Microsoft launches its Surface Duo and Neo, the only company flirting with this dual screen approach in a big way is LG with removable cases like this one here for its latest V60. LG has some good ideas here. You can launch any app you want automatically on the second screen so every time you open it up you jump right into Twitter or your calendar and you still got a whole other screen to do with what you want. If you wanna use LG's keyboard you can devote a whole screen to it and make your phone into a mini laptop. There's dedicated software for gaming which I've yet to try out but it looks pretty cool, multitasking is obviously easier, and because there's not bleeding edge folding display it's a more durable design. The phone half has actual dust proofing and water resistance. The thing is, well just look at this thing. I'm sorry but LG has taken a lifeless lump of a phone and strapped on a brutalist brick of a case. It looks like a shrunken netbook from 2009. And more to the point, I can just never stop seeing that seam between the screens. Dual screen diehards will argue that it's made specifically for multitasking. You put one app over there and one over here and they're meant to be kept separate and I get that, but that argument breaks down once you admit, as you must, that you can do the same exact thing on a folding screen. That's why for me a true foldable is the superior option. See when I look at a foldable, tablet-style smartphone I see the product all those dual-screen smartphones are trying to be. I can run two apps side by side on my fold, in fact I can run three and give each one it's own little slice of this big canvas or I can use the entirety of that canvas for one app and if I do, I only have to put up with this little seam that I can barely see not the big bezel gutter of the dual screen design. As you'll know if you're a subscriber, that versatility pays off. At this point I think I've done four or five Galaxy Fold videos so you've heard me talk about how the fold was great for juggling StreetEasy and Google Maps on my Brooklyn apartment hunt. Now because it's almost exactly the size of an Amazon Kindle it's my new preferred reading companion. How wonderful it is to have a tablet-sized screen when you want it that breaks down into pocket size when you don't. A word on nomenclature here. We call this broad category an innie to distinguish them from the Huawei coming next. With an innie the primary display folds over onto itself so when the phone is closed its outer casing envelops and protects it. Now that is crucial because folding screens are extremely fragile and it also means you need a secondary outer display to be able to use the phone while it's closed. The need to fit two screens into 1/2 the device means the phone gets thicker or the display gets less useful and in the case of the Galaxy Fold, unfortunately both are true. (contemporary music) That's a problem the outie display solves by taking exactly the opposite approach. See, the Huawei Mate XS doesn't have an outer display on its casing, its casing is the outer display. Yeah, instead of wrapping the screen in a protective chassis it wraps the chassis in the screen. That means the Mate XS actually feels like a full-on smartphone when it's closed instead of some watered down approximation. One handed, two handed, portrait, landscape, in pocket and out, the Mate XS is a phone you already know how to use. And then you push the button and it becomes a tablet you also already know how to use. I gotta give Huawei credit. The polish with which it's executed this design is impressive. Sticking the cameras and USB port into this chine mean the rest of the thing can be impossibly thin and you get a nice handle to hold it one handed. I mentioned the Kindle before. This is an even closer analog to that e-reader. Unfortunately, the very thing that helps the Mate XS stand out from every other foldable also reinforces the fundamental truth about all foldables, compromise. No, I'm not talking about the fact that you can't buy Huawei phones in the US or the problems you'll have trying to run Google Apps on this device. At this juncture I think we all understand that this is a foldable for those who don't need Google and if you don't understand why I'll link you to Daniel Bader's excellent article on the matter. Rather, the compromise I'm referring to is that display. You remember how I said foldable screens are incredibly fragile? 'Kay, now remember how I said the Mate XS's screen is its outer casing? Okay now put those together, yeah. Where I can just drop my fold on a table without thinking much about it, the Mate XS demands a higher level of care. Thankfully it does come with a bumper case in the box that offers limited protection and maybe I should've used it before my review sample developed these mystery scratches. Seriously, I've been babying this thing like you wouldn't believe and it still got gouged, ouch. So then maybe it's no surprise that our final category is also an innie but instead of a phone that turns into a tablet this is a phone that turns into a smaller phone. I could spend a whole video talking about why I love the clamshell category and I'll give you a concession here, yes, some of it is nostalgia. Certainly Motorola's resurrected Razr is laser targeted at those of us who wouldn't mind a quick trip back to 2005. For a few years there in the mid aughts almost every phone you could buy in the US was a clamshell and that wasn't just for the benefit of those of us who privately called our cellphones communicators, it was a reflection of the fact that a device that could be small enough to pocket but also big enough to comfortably use it, well turns out that makes a lot of sense. So it is, for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip and that Motorola Razr. Both are innies that instead of folding on their y axis instead bow at the waist. Open, each feels like a typical if tall smartphone. Closed, they stow away their fragile screens inside their metal exoskeletons, collapsing down to half their deployed size. In the case of the Z Flip you basically can't use it while it's closed thanks to that tiny external display but you do get more functionality. You can fold the phone into an L shape for selfies or those video calls we're all doing a lot more of in these days. So which, if any of these, categories is right for you? Well, it depends on your lifestyle and I do mean if any. Look, with four folding phones on shelves already, more on the horizon for Microsoft and TCL and even a folding screen laptop coming from Lenovo, it's easy to forget that all this has happened in barely over a year. It's still insanely early to tell if these things will get traction and between $1,300 and $2,700 for the true folding screen phones, it's also still too early for all but the most zealous early adopters to actually buy one. But despite their many drawbacks at this embryonic stage, I still believe foldables will make up a big part of our mobile tech future and I'm excited to explore that foldable future further, delights and drawbacks alike, in the year to come. Episode two preview. The Galaxy Fold had pretty much the rockiest start a product can have with defects bad enough to prompt a recall and as a result its reputation suffers even today. Well I've carried the redesigned version of Samsung's first foldable since January 1st, how it's held up and how it hasn't on the next installment. Make sure you're subscribed to the Mr. Mobile on YouTube so you don't miss it and hey, Android Central just did a boatload of articles on foldable phones, some of which came from suggestions by yours truly 'cause I just can't shut up about foldables. Check 'em out at the links in the description below. As always, no company featured in this video paid a fee for inclusion or had any editorial input or early preview of this content. That means they're seeing it for the first time right alongside you. Until next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends. (mellow contemporary music)",

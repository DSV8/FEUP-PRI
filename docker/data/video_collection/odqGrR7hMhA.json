    "transcript": "- [Cameraman] You guys excited for Fortnite? (crowd cheers) Let's go! - [Justine] Hey guys were here at the Fornite Pro-Am. This is going to be so much fun there is-- Hi! Oh my god! - [Xavier] Hey. What's going on? - Hello, how are you? - You doing okay? - I keep telling everyone, I need to interview you. This doesn't happen on the street and guess what? - We're talking now. - What do you think about this whole event going on? because this is insane. - It's ridiculous. I was asking people when you first started playing Fortnite did you ever think that it would turn into this? Cos I mean, it was big, and you heard 'Oh, most important game in the world', 'most popular game in the world' but like, we're in a stadium now, and it's like 98 degrees and everyone's stoked to play Fortnite in the sun. That's a lot! - [Justine] Well, the craziest thing too is last year at E3, they were telling me 'we've got this little game called Fortnite, you might want to try it out, it's gonna be big', and here we are, next year, at this incredible event, it's gonna be so amazing. - Yeah, how has it advanced so fast? - I have no idea, but I cannot wait to see what happens. Are you going to win? - Of course. - Okay, great. - Of course. - I'll be cheering for ya. - I'm on both sides of this. Streamer and celebrity, well like D-level celebrity, but still, c'mon, I can do this. Get a man who can do both. - You got this. It's you! - [Justine] Oh man, you never know who you're gonna run into. It's Swooz1e! - [Swooz1e] Hello - Hey, you wanna be in my video? - [Swooz1e] I would fricking love to. - How are you? - I'm great. - Good to see you - Should I hide this logo? I don't know if this is sponsored - No, this is a Justine video - Oh my, I get to be in a Justine video? - Can you believe it? Guys, Swooz1e. So, are we gonna do maybe like a $10,000-- - Oh, it's $50,000 now - What? - Shhhhhh, so it's gonna be Fortnite fight club. - Oh my goodness - Don't tell anybody. You're not gonna post this right? You're just gonna keep it for yourself? I was like wait, is this a joke or is this real life? - Change that up, editor. So yeah, $50,000 - Me - You're the editor? - Yeah - I love that! - So don't worry, I'll edit it however you'd like. - I'm still editing. Hey, future me! - Hey, can we talk about this for like two seconds? - Okay, let's talk about it even more than two seconds. - Like, there's a llama here. - [Justine] That's my lab! - [Swooz1e] Like, this is a soccer stadium. - [Justine] I know! - [Swooz1e] And we're turning people away outside. - [Justine] So, what do you think of this whole match-up? Because we've got celebrities and streamers, but then some of the streamers are celebrities, isn't that always the way? - [Swooz1e] Yeah, I heard about that, I was like so how do they differentiate the celebrity line? Because some of these gamer celebrities are more popular than their... - I didn't want to say it, you're the one that said it. - Quote me on that. - This is a new world that we're living in. - I love it though, I mean it's just you get out you have to meet your subscribers, meet your fans, we're here gaming. I got to meet Myth, got to meet Ninja, a lot of these guys were like 'Swooz1e!' and I'm just like [breathes Deeply] - [Justine] It's so great, it's really cool. - [Swooz1e] I just love it, I mean look at this! Watching this on YouTube, you don't get the scale. I love it. - [Justine] Fortnite baby! - [Swooz1e] It's like this is where it's at, get on the bus (Bus Horn) - Get off the buss (Whistles) dropping in! Oh, so many jokes. Okay, we need to talk about this. - Yeah, let's talk. - Nintendo switch Fortnite - [Swoons] Catch me! (laughs) - That's how we're doing the $50,000 tournament. On switch. - Think about it, think-- I'll catch you now. - Oh, god. I'll see you later. - We're in the wrong field! - I hope I get an invite to the tournament. - [Justine] Look who I found! Guys, it's Nadeshot! - Hey, what's going on? - I hear you're playing today. - Yeah I am, so I started drinking. - Oh no, have you been practicing? - Yes, I actually have been practicing quite a bit. - Good - My teammate is Tyron Woodley, a welterweight UFC champion, and we're very excited to watch you host the event. I was actually standing outside watching you go through the dry runs and everything. - [Justine] That was rehearsals, do not judge anything that you've seen. - They were great! - It's gonna be great. - No, Justine's a pro. Honestly, there's nobody better that they could have picked to host this event, to represent the community. - Thanks Matt! - Justine's crushing it, in any setting that she's in. - I'm gonna put this on replay, and just watch it whenever I need a pick-me-up. - You should, I give credit wherever credit is due, and you're fantastic. - Thanks Matt, good luck today! - Thank you - Nadeshot, the real MVP. - [Goldenboy] Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this? Why are we moving so slowly, it makes no sense! - This is our Fortnite Pro-Am caster squad. We've got Goldenboy, Lupo, should I call you Dr. Lupo? - Doctor, please. - Dr. Lupo, and Gloom, I'm so excited to meet you, actually both of you, we've met before. - I've met her, too many times - You're old news! - I'm old news. - How does that feel? - It feels sad, depressing. - Don't worry, I still love you. - It's okay, we've been around. - Very true, fist bumps. - So what do we think about this whole event, because this is actually insanity. - It's wild, this many people here? I've not been more excited for something like this ever. - How many people, total? - 3500. - Yeah, I heard 3500. - [Justine] In here? - [Lupo] And there's 200,000 on Twitch, watching right now, and it hasn't even started yet. - [Gloom] The countdown hasn't even started yet and there's that many people. - This is actually crazy. Like, I can't even get over it, that there's all these celebrities that they got here to do this, it's pretty crazy - I had a lot of free time, so it wasn't-- - Honestly, well for me, y'know, I'm cheap. - That's a perfect cut right there. - Who do we think is going to win? Because I feel like it's between Sypher and-- - Oh, Sypher. - Sypher and Treeg, bye. - Wow! - Mike drop! We don't even have a mike. - Wow wow wow wow wow - Too many wows. - They're going to win. - Why are you so confident? - I could see it in Sypher's face when I said hi to him. I was like you're gonna win and he was like don't say that, because I am, and I don't want you to jinx it. - You're going to ruin everything. - Well, I'm a little concerned because the streamers I'm not afraid of. But what if they're partnered up with someone who may not play to their caliber? - I would preferably hope that Ninja gets eliminated, I don't know, by Courage or something like that, that's what I want because Courage will never let him live that down. That's the best thing. - This is gonna be so unpredictable, but it's all for charity too, which is amazing. I'm excited, I'm so excited to be working with you guys. - [Goldenboy] Teamwork! - Team huddle - Should we say Fortnite? Three, one, two, three Fortnite? - Yeah sure. - Okay, ready? - One, two three Fortnite! Let's go, let's go, let's go guys we gotta go! - [Justine] Welcome everybody to the Fortnite Pro-Am! (crowd cheers) This is going to be such an incredible event and I'm so excited that so many of you are joining us here, live, and in person and online, joining me today I have some incredible casters for this event. First up, let me introduce you to our eSports commentator, Goldenboy! - What's up silverlake, I need some noise, gimme some noise, go, c'mon c'mon! (crowd cheers) That's what I like baby! That's what I like. - Next up, we've got YouTube content creator Gloom! - Hi Guys! I'm so excited. - It's going to be so great. And last, but not least, we've got the twitch broadcaster Dr. Lupo! This event today is going to be so much fun, and I'm so glad that you're all here for it. - I can't believe it, look at this crowd! (crowd applauds) - [Goldenboy] Wow, what a game! But what a performance from Courage as well. - [Dr. Lupo] Unbelievable, that last couple circles were so tense. - [Goldenboy] But this man right here, Ninja and his Market Marshmallow, will get the victory, let's actually send it over to Justine. - I am here with our dual winner, Ninja and Mashmallow, guys congratulations! - Thank you so much, this is amazing - I mean you guys are watching it online but there's so much energy here in the stadium. - Yeah, I could even just feel it like after every single fight you'd hear one massive shotgun blast and the entire crowd just freaking out, loosing their minds because it's just so intense, it's way more honestly epic IRL than it is online, honestly it's amazing. - Really it's great. I feel like you guys work really well together. - Oh yeah, well I just thought maybe, y'know, I had to try. And we have our winners! Oh my god, this has been such an amazing event I've had so much fun hosting, and congratulations on Ninja and Marshmallow for their win. This was amazing, I can't even say any more words because I am completely speechless. This was so great. Alright, time to go to the party now. Hey guys, our whole squad is here! So we're now at the Fortnite afterparty and-- I actually just ran straight into this bush. But the best part, it's actually a moving bush. Hey, can you move? Like, do something? Oh my gosh this is real life.",

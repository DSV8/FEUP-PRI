    "transcript": "Sam Bankman-Fried has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was arrested last year following the catastrophic collapse of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded in 2019. The sentence is about half of the 40 to 50 years that prosecuters wanted, but it's also not as short as the five to six years that Bankman-Fried's lawyers wanted. During sentencing, Judge Lewis Kaplan didn't buy into the defense's claim that Bankman-Fried was deeply sorry for what he has done. Instead, Kaplan said Bankman-Fried knew what he was doing was wrong, and that he was aware he was putting customers' money at risk. He also dismissed arguments that FTX customers could be repaid with crypto prices rebounding, and FTX's investment into an AI company. As Judge Kaplan put it, a thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on the sentence by using his Las Vegas winnings to pay back all or part of which he stole when he finally gets caught. Bankman-Fried has been in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York since violating the conditions of his bail last year.",

    "transcript": "- We recently took a look at the INZONE M9 from Sony. It's a 4K 144 hertz display for about $900. Can the AOC AGON PRO do better? I don't know. It's about $900 for 1440p, 27 inches. But, the big kicker is it's 240 hertz. So, for all of you like, major epic gamers out there who really need that super crazy high, fast refresh rate, honestly, I'm not sure if this is the one for you. So we're gonna unbox it. We're gonna take a look at it, and I'm gonna find out if it's any good. First of all, I'd like to point out some of the really cool stuff, like the unbeatable branding. I don't know about that. Hey, we got instructions on the top here. David, get these instructions for the people, so that they know how to unbox. What else we got in here? We got a shading hood. Oh, comes in its own little box, it looks like. This is great. That's how you know you're a pro, when you start using the shading hood, or as I like to call it, the horse blinders. To like, really get you in the game. I like that it comes in a little separate box. Sometimes, they've just got it tucked away in the foam. What else is in here? There's a few boxes, there's boxes within boxes. This is the AGON PRO. That's it, that's the monitor. I honestly don't know what's in here. Let's see. Maybe it's the stand or something. Cable box? Yep. Cable box. You got some 3M tape and some cable clips stuff. HDMI cables, the power cable. The rest of the beefy power brick that they got there. This is, I don't know what that is. This is a Display Port cable. This is a USB B cable, so you can tell it's got USB B on it. And an Allen key, slash Phillips. To put everything together. That's great. I like when they, I'm so torn. I like when they include screwdriver stuff to make sure that you can assemble something. I also don't like it, because then I end up with like 50 Allen Keys just sitting in my house and they're all useless, because I don't know what size they are. And then we've got this nifty puck here. I don't know what this is. David said it's for changing your gamer profile, and this thing can do a number of different profiles. That is a feature it does. So he's probably right, but I don't know for sure. It does look like it, though. It's got like little numbers on there. 1, 2, 3, 4, or no. Sorry. 1, 2, 3 and then back, and then okay. Oh, maybe you can navigate the OSD with this thing. That actually, that'd actually be pretty cool. I'm kind of into it. The only thing I'm not into is this connector. It's a USB mini? Here's the stand or at least the base of it. I'll tell you one thing, I already like this part of it at least, much better than the M9. That was a great monitor with a lousy stand. Oh yeah, this thing already looks way better than the M9. It uses 100 by 100 VESA mount. Oh, there's like a connector here? I don't know what these four pins are for. Maybe RGB, yeah. David said RGB, I think he's probably right. I can't think of anything else. If there were ports somewhere along here then, I would say maybe it's an extension for USB. But I don't see any ports anywhere so, let's plug it in and find out. This is kind of a weird take on the system that I like 'cause it's like, this, yeah, this is right, for sure. It's just kind of weird 'cause the post, there's like four posts instead of just one or two. I don't think I've ever seen it done this way. But you know, there's a first time for everything. They're also a little stubby. Normally the posts are a little longer, to kind of give better foundation but, I don't know, I'm not an engineer. This is a very long screw. And my other issue is that my hands are kind of small and I'm having a little trouble turning this while getting my hands in there. But you know what? We got there. But if you've got big hands, that might be a problem for you. And I gotta, you know, I gotta recognize it right now. We got the G-SYNC Ultimate badge on the side. I haven't seen it done this way either. Usually it's like, a sticker. This is like almost silk screened on there or something. I don't even know, painted on? G-SYNC Ultimate does have some latency stuff in it, I'm pretty sure. But the main thing that I'm aware of is for like, 1000 nits peak brightness. Okay, I was close. We looked it up really quickly because I was sure that it meant 1000 nits. That's the old descriptor. Now, it's just for life-like HDR. So, this is VESA certified 600, which is a lot better than 400 at least. But, I don't know, 600 is not that great. That being said, this thing has like, 32 dimming zones which is about a third of what the Sony has. But it's 1440p, 240 hertz. I don't know. We'll see, we'll see, we'll see. But yeah, that's why they're not cheating with the G-SYNC Ultimate life-like HDR. Sure, it's close enough with dimming zones, so. Alright. Oh this is neat. I've never seen part of it like, exposed like that. Okay. I had no idea what these contact points were for until we looked back up here and Bell pointed out that like, hey look, they fit that and it rotates. So yeah, this makes sense. 'Cause look, we slot it in, bada bing, bada boom. And the reason it was obvious that that's what those were for, is because this thing should rotate. There we go. So, that's why the contacts were like, a crescent, so that the pins could still be in contact with them, which is pretty neat. Let's talk about the other stuff that's on this display. We got a USB B, four USB A ports. I'm not sure what the differences are between the yellow and the green. One might be like, the firmware one specifically. HDMI 2.0, 2 ports here. It's you know, 1440p, 240 hertz. So that's fine. Display Port 1.4, I don't know when 2.0 is coming but I'm ready for it. And then we've got, what looks like our power bar and then a headphone jack, a microphone. Wow, there's like two mic slots. Is that not a mic? They both look like they have the mic symbol. And then, this looks like it's for updating the firmware, actually. 'Cause I've never seen a micro... Oh, it's for the OSD thing. Hey, look at that. So yeah, this hopefully controls the OSD stuff. And then there's a Kensington lock over here, in case you wanna lock it up. We've got our classic navigation nipple here, in case you don't like the OSD puck. And then on the other side, we got a little headphone hanger. Hey, look at that. It's a little small. Could be a little, just a smidge longer for any of those wide band headphone users out there, but that's okay. Should still work in a pinch. Back to the stand. It feels a little wobbly. Like, this thing isn't too bad. It can do some side to side, yep. It can do some tilt, it can even pivot, which is great. I think it's height adjustable as well. Yeah, it is. Maybe it's because of the height adjustment. I don't know, but it just doesn't feel super sturdy, the way this red metal piece is connected to the rest of the stand here. It's just kind of, I don't know. Maybe it's just me, but it feels a little flimsy, a little wobbly. They do mention they've got some super thin bezels and I can confirm, these are pretty thin. They've actually got like their marketing material with three of these, you know, side by side. And it looks pretty decent. But you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna fire it up and we're gonna take a real look after this word from our sponsor. - [Cameraman] Jackery. - Jackery. Jackery's new Solar Generator 1000 Pro is their fastest solar and wall recharging generator yet. It consists of a Jackery Explorer 1000 Pro portable power station, and 80 watt solar panels. Plug it into the wall and get a full charge in under two hours, and deliver up to 100 watts of power thanks to the two 100 watt power delivery ports. Check out the new Jackery Solar Generator 1000 Pro at the link below. (funk music) I'm calling this the gamer puck. I don't know what it's actually called, but it does work to change things on the OSD. Like color set up, G-SYNC processor, game setting, luminance, light effects, audio. I don't know which one's correct. I'm not gonna use the gamer puck anymore. I don't like it already. Friendship with gamer puck is over. Okay. I don't like their OSD at all. It's not, it's no longer about the puck. It's about their OSD being navigable. Color setup. Sure, what's in here? Low light, DC, DP, YCBCR. Sure, sure, not using that. Okay. That's it. What's in extra? Switch DP, logo projector? Okay, so maybe that is the connecting pins that we saw on the back here. We think it's for the laser. Otherwise though, there's not much in here. And you just saw us struggle with this OSD. It's kind of a pain, and I don't like it. Oh, you can do USB charging? That's cool. They didn't mention that like anywhere. You can turn Reflex on, that comes with a G-SYNC module, so that's cool. But that still doesn't help, why we are stuck at 60 hertz. Yeah, so it's been about a week and a half. Two weeks or something since we actually shot this. Unfortunately, as you can see, the monitor didn't work and it was definitely our display. We tried a ton of stuff, didn't do anything. But now AOC sent us a new display and you can probably do the same thing if yours is busted because RMA works. But as you can see, look, boom. We're getting it. 240 hertz getting 8-bit color. Oh, use HDR. See if it does 10-bit. I don't think it does. Yeah, just 8-bit with dithering. But that's okay, that's not bad. 240 hertz, that's crazy. So let's check out some UFO test. It looks pretty good. I don't see much weird overdrive or anything. Let's make it faster though, we're at 240 hertz. Oh, that's better. Yeah, he's a little blurrier now, but like honestly, it's still decent. I mean the reality, is going from 60... 30 to 60, enormous. 60 to 120, 144, still a really big jump. But as soon as you start going from 140 or 120 up to like 240. It's a really, like it's really diminishing returns anytime you do that, so... I don't get it really, the hype, I mean 240 is good. And if I had the option and they were the same price, yeah of course I want the 240 one. But I mean so many people don't even play games that are going faster than 200 and like 40 frames per second anyway. So, unless you're a esports enthusiast, like Dota or Counter Strike, or League or something like that. I don't know how necessary this is for most people. Let's open Counter Strike. Bot Yuri come back, no, bot Yuri. Oh wow, that was bad. Yeah, I'm pretty bad right now. Boom, get wrecked, bot Ulysses. So one thing that I can guarantee you is that a higher frame rate is not gonna make you a much better player if you're already not very good. It does improve things on the really high end of stuff, and obviously going from 30 to 60, or 60 to 120 is going to make you, personally, a little bit better. Because it just, it is easier. When the frame rate is buttery smooth and the, not only the frame rate of the video game, but the refresh rate of your monitor is just buttery smooth and perfect. But, it doesn't just fix everything magically. So, I guess that's my main takeaway here. Does this monitor work and look pretty, and give a really high refresh rate? Yes. Is that going to make you better and start winning Counter Strike, or Dota, or League matches? No. But anyway, back to past me. I'm a little more upset. We're gonna check with the HDR really quick. Game on it a little bit, see how it is and then call it a day. So let's look at the HDR. Looks okay. There are 32 dimming zones, which is a third of the 96 on the INZONE monitor. But it's a lot more than, your like, six column HDR 400 display that you're gonna see a lot of the time. Does it still justify the cost of $900? I don't know, but this looks like, okay. I really need to see the dimming zones in action. So I need to like bloom some stuff up here. Yeah, that's Tomb Raider. I mean, all those things moving around look pretty decent, and the lighting looks okay. But one, this isn't the best HDR game. All of our stuff was uninstalled. I am sorry. It looks okay. I mean it's 144 hertz, not 240. It looks decently clear. Like, when you shake everything around. It does go into its spot pretty quickly and you can still like, I can see that bush pretty clearly whenever I'm shaking stuff. Like, yeah it's getting a little blurry but it's like, I can still clearly see that that is a bush, and it's not just a green blob. Once as, you know, you start to move the camera. Still though, I'm incredibly disappointed that we can't get this thing up to 240. We're gonna do a quick local dimming test to see how decent the local dimming is. 32 zones isn't bad. I mean, that's what like, like eight by four. It's not perfect and I've definitely seen better local dimming. But with 32 zones on a screen this size, you're getting to the point where HDR can actually look okay. Instead of just like, with these weird splotchy columns and stuff. It's not ideal. Like, even the 96 zones on that INZONE were looking pretty sweet, and I really don't want to have to move backwards down to 32. Especially when the price is basically the same. So you're kind of sitting there thinking, hmm, do I spend... I'm gonna spend $900 on a monitor. That's just, that's a given. That's what your budget is. You're gonna buy a new monitor. Do you spend 900 on the INZONE, with the terrible stand that I hate, but much, much, much, much superior display with 4k, 140 hertz, 96 dimming zones. Like, that thing is just a beast. Or do you spend $900 on the 27 inch AOC display? I can't do it. I just, I just can't. I like the stand a lot more, but you know what, that's what wall mounts are for. That's what arms are for. Especially with the experience that we've had today with Display Port just not wanting to work out of the box for whatever reason. Maybe we got a single bad unit out of the whole lot. And you can send it back and RMA it, whatever, that's fine. It happens. I've just... It's an issue that I personally have never had to run into. Or if I have, it's a quick fix. It's like, oh, I just, I didn't have an update that I needed, or oh, I had to unlock something in the OSD to unlock these higher refresh rates. But that's not, it doesn't seem to be the case today. So maybe I'm crazy. If you guys think that I'm doing something completely wrong and I've missed it, and it's so obvious. Tell me in the comments. I'm so sorry. I wouldn't buy this thing though. Not at 900 bucks. I'm sorry AOC. I just, I think that you're better off with the INZONE, or maybe a different display entirely. So, that's Short Circuit. Thanks for watching. If you wanna see another video, maybe check out the INZONE video. The stand sucked, but the rest of that display is actually like, pretty sweet.",

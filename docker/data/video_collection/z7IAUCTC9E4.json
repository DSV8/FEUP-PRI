    "transcript": "- Hey guys it's Justine. Happy Easter to celebrate. I thought I would record some gameplay here for you because I have no other videos to post so let's freaking celebrate by showing you what's up on my Animal Cross island and Easter is one of my favorite holidays and I'm so sad because I always go home to visit my family. And my sister has a baby and I don't get to see the little baby. She's so sweet and so cute. Here she is, that's' Brin. She didn't even get to sit on the Easter bunny's lap this year. So, I guess she'll have her Easter next year. If you have been playing this game you know that there have been eggs that have been dropping all over the island and I'm absolutely so sick of it and I'm so 100 percent over it. But, I created this little guy. This was one of the things you had to create. And then you can give him all the Easter eggs and he gives you a basket and there's another diy recipe he gives you so spoilers. If you've been playing this game you probably already done this, so. This is all the stuff I've created out of the outfits from all the eggs. - [Justine] I thought I would show them off because what else do I have to do. (net whooshes) I mean I sure I could be doing something else. The question is, do I want to anything else? (whispers) No. I guess I'll show you guys what's been happening on my island since the last time that you guys have seen it, it's been quite a while. I'm actually collecting, this is my favorite one of these because when Flip comes to visit or Flick, Flip, Flick. The bug catching dude, he comes and he'll make you like a little art piece. I'll show you what he made me. If you collect three of the same bugs, he'll then make you like a little statue. This is what he made me. He made me this man faced statue. So I want to get one made of this thing, the orchid mantis it's really great. So I guess I'll just start from over here some of my villagers. I've got this chicken his name is Knox and he does weird stuff. He goes around the island just being weird. I don't know how to explain it. (record player playing) It's basically like a funeral home I think there's bodys in here, those are coffins and then he's licking his freaking lollipop. I don't even, like what is he doing. I want him to say something weird. I hope I have something. I don't have anything. I'll give him a butterfly, cause. (indistinctive talking) Bug care you put them in your belly. So, this is Knox. He does weird stuff, so that's why I jailed his outside of his house cause I just, I don't trust him guys, I don't trust him at all. And this is Kidd I love Kidd, Kidd is like an obsessive cleaner so he just goes around and is cleaning all the time. He's a musician, so I gave him a little microphone. (indistinctive talking) And early today he was just singing outside. I was like what are you doing Kidd. I went and replanted all my trees you guys, I've spent probably, let's actually, let's see how many hours I've played. I've played for 140 hours or more. I have really nothing to show for it. I have nothing for show for except this pig nose that my sister bought me and this whole egg outfit. I also realized that I was not pressing \"A\" the whole time I was catching those scorpions so thank you everybody and by everybody I mean everybody who let me know that I need to press \"A\" to sneak. I just started sticking stuff all over the island because Isabelle gave me a ranking of two and I'm a be honest with you I was really hurt because I know how much time I've been spending in this game and the fact that she gave me a two on my island, I was very upset. These are some more fruit trees. These are some money trees that's why they're all marked off. That's also a money tree, that's why it's front of here and I started doing some attempts at breeding flowers. I would say that I bred, but I did not I got them from a Nook miles ticket on an island and I just kind of picked them and put them there. These ones I did breed. So I got them all laid out in like the X pattern. That is supposed to optimize the key breeding of flowers I don't know I read it on the internet, it seems to be working for me quite well. No new ones since I last checked, five minutes ago So that's unfortunate I was trying to lay my island out very strategically, like line all the houses so that I could have the rest of the land to just do stuff on. Is it a good idea, I don't know. I've just been sticking stuff everywhere, like it's actually quite a disastrous mess and it makes me so sad to know how much time I've put into this and I don't really feel like I'm happy with what I've done at all. (laughs) I've seen some people's islands, they're so beautiful and mine's a freaking, just it's a pigs dye. Very fitting for my pig nose that my sister got me. Is this Francine? I think that's her name. Yes, she's really cool. So that's, that side of the island. We've got a little shop here. I cannot even be bothered to talk with him anymore because he's been haunting my dreams with these eggs that are dropping. Eventually I'll remove these little labels on here but, I'm trying to figure out where I wanna replant them to. And I'm saving these for Ed's fossil swap. I kept selling them because I needed money. Hey Rocket! It's Rocket's birthday on the 14th, so that's soon I have it on my calendar, I've started putting my fake friends from the game. They're not fake friends, they're real friends, they're just you know like not real. If you play this game you understand, if you don't play it then you don't understand. I've got two of these matching brick bridges built. This is a nice little orchard that I've been working on. I planted all of these trees so close together and then they didn't grow. So it left me with a dilemma of having to go and replant some up above here and I think my trees are starting to change colors because I'm in the southern hemisphere and it's fall, I haven't had any cherry blossoms it's quite upsetting. Nothing is growing I came back like several days ago and I'm like these aren't growing, I've wasted so much time with my life, I don't know. So I don't know what's happening up here, I honestly don't know. It's kind of just like a nice little park area. I also replanted all of these trees to be nice and straight. Here's a porta potty. I wonder if you can open that. No, you can't but you should be able to. You could see it, I got my lighthouse up there. We will pass the camp sight first which basically looks like a big trash heap. There's just, it's not very rare. (xylophone playing) Look at all these pink flowers I have. I got most of these on a Nook miles ticket from somewhere else on one of those islands. But, I did breed some of those. So this is kind of like my little house area. Let me show you my house. I was so proud of my house before and I wanted to do a house tour to show you guys but then it slowly just kind of started falling apart and I just started running out of storage so I had to put stuff everywhere. This did look a little better now it's getting a little cluttered but I'm still pretty happy with you know how things are progressing but a lot of this stuff I'm gonna move in to my other room which I just got yesterday. And you guys can see I can't even get in there because I've got it blocked by some stuff but that's gonna be a whole nother process. Let me show you what happens when you run out of storage. I just dropped everything that I had into this room. There's not even a single bit of space to put anything else. Is that a pizza? What kind of food is in that oven and that microwave that looks good with a cake. My other room I also was working on some stuff so kinda turn this little set here into one separate room so it'll be like my office. Yeah, I paid 34000 bells for that camera and Ed actually bought it from one of his friend's islands and then he brought it to me and then I paid him 34000 bells for it. So that's something that's been happening. This is I don't know, I have no idea. Just not sure but I do like my little pro max little sign up there, that's my flag. So I haven't even gone into my other room yet let's just go and see what's up. Look at this. A new fresh room to do what ever I want. I have so much stuff in my storage. I have been obsessed with customizing things. Man, I can't customize those desks that sucks. That would probably go nice in that other room that I have. Mph office is coming together nicely. Well I'll work on that. Just stuff I have, it's just a lot of stuff. This is my favorite, I got this from the fishing tournament. What am I gonna do with that? Why am I gonna want that? I don't want that but okay, whatever. Oh so freaking cozy. Let's see what this looks like. That's cool but like I don't think that is fitting the vibe that I'm going for. But, I'd like to show you guys where we started from in the last episode. I just have a lot of stuff, before it was even worse. I had so much stuff everywhere that I couldn't actually walk. I mean I have a mixer on the floor. And now we're here I also don't like this welcome mat. Where did that come from? What did I just take down? Put that back up there. I don't like this welcome mat but it was kind of cool so I just stuck it there. I also, there's so much stuff I need to do okay let's just get out of here. Oh, over here if you guys remember I have a little flea market. I have so many recipes that I don't need anymore so I just keep dropping off like duplicate things If you guys have any suggestions or anything KK Slider was supposed to be here two days ago but yesterday was the fishing tournament and today is the bunny event so guess what KK is not here yet. I've bee collecting Amiimbos since the beginning so ever since they were announced two years ago, it's been just something that I've put a lot of time and money into collecting. So these are the animal crossing Amiibo cards and these are some of the Amiibo characters. I haven't invited any of the character characters. I wonder if I can do villager. Let's see if I can bring him in. Basically you go to the little Atm and then you can choose to invite a camper into your camp sights so yeah I wanna invite. Then you put it on here. That's the villager amiibo. Wait why can't he come to my camp sight! But why not! I'd already picked some that I wanted. I've already invited Muffy, Rolf. Okay, I think I'm going to invite Merengue cause Merengue looks cool. Place it right here, it uses NFC, connects to here and Merengue is on her way. (indistinctive talking) Please, please, please, please, please. Yes you gotta be interested. I'm trying to keep track of the ones I've invited because then if you'll invite them back they would eventually will move to your island. So this is the camp sight and this is where the amiibo are brought in to and then here we will have Merengue hanging out and hopefully she gives me a diy and then I go make whatever it is she wants. (music playing from radio) I'm always eating something. Fantastic. (indistinctive talking) (crafting item) Great, lovely okay I made a wooden toolbox. Yep all ready just for you. She got a little pink radio. I love the idea of bringing a wooden toolbox home. Do you really? A Victorian dress. Oh okay hello, I'm into that. I look good. But, I'm celebrating Easter today so I have to put my egg party dress back on, sorry. And that's it so I hope you enjoyed having a good Easter. I'm having as good of a one as I guess possibly can. I made myself breakfast this morning. I had some, some eggs go figure. And now I'm gonna probably continue playing this game and have another Yerba Mate and call it a day. Happy Easter, I love you guys and let me know if you have any suggestions for things that I should do on my island. God what a mess. I just need to do a overhaul but that's gonna be, I'm just gonna wait till I get terraforming so that maybe we can do a little landscaping. All right that's it I'll see you later bye.",

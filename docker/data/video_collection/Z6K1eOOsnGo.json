    "transcript": "- We need an intro Riley. - [Riley] What's the intro? - I don't know what the intro is. - [Riley] Oh, Tech News. - Tech News. So the big news so far this week has been the new Apple Silicon Chips, announced at yesterday's Apple event. In case you haven't heard, Apple is now making its own CPUs for its Macs, and the first of its new chips, called the M1, is a 5-nanometer system on a chip featuring 8 CPU cores and up to 8 GPU cores. Half the CPU cores are high performance and half are lower performing, but friendlier on battery life. Apple is claiming it has the best performance per watt of any laptop CPU and given how fast the A14 SoC was, that might very well be the case. The in-house silicon has also made it possible for Apple to optimize first priority software such as Final Cut, but we'll have to wait until Macs based on the M1 drop next week to find out for ourselves. Apple announced three such devices, a $1000 MacBook Air, a $1,300 MacBook Pro and a $700 Mac Mini, that all kinda seemed to be the exact same thing. (Riley chuckles) Hopefully you've got your Apple credit card ready to, waste some money. I guess I shouldn't say that yeah, but, I think it's bad. - [Riley] We have to go deeper into the cult. - The other big hardware launch, was of course the Xbox Series X and Series S. In a bit of bad news, that'll be very familiar to anyone that's tried to get their hands on RTX 3000-series graphics card. The new Xboxes are sold out, basically everywhere as long lines at Brick and Mortar stores and rushes of online orders were the norm. It looks like, stock will remain very limited through the rest of the year, and if that wasn't bad enough, there was also an Xbox Live outage, that struck around 1:00 p.m. Eastern on launch day. Wait, I was so confused last night 'cause I was playing, \"Sea of Thieves.\" And, (Riley laughs) there was just suddenly no one on there. - [Riley] Now you know. - Now I know. - [Riley] You've got some Tech News. - It was only PC people. Microsoft resolved the issue within a couple of hours, though, that combined with the stock shortages, made it a bit of a disappointing Tuesday for a lot of Xbox fans. I miss the good old days before order bots and multi gigabyte downloads ruined console launches. - [Riley] Breaking my day, the consoles you played in the 1900s. - I can't wait to water cool it. So far, most self-driving cars can steer, accelerate, brake and, even park for you, but the driver still has to monitor what's going on at all times, be ready to take over if an unexpected situation pops up. However, Honda thinks. (Riley screams) Ah geez, you scared me. However, Honda thinks it's ready to take the next step forward as the Japanese auto giant, has announced it should be rolling out a car with Level 3 automation before the end of March next year, meaning that the driver can do something else during the ride and we'll have more time to, intervene if the car requests it. The vehicle will be an updated Legends Sedan and it appears that the rollout will be Japan only for now after getting approval from the Japanese government. Of course, seeing how Canada misses out on everything cool, maybe we'll be seeing it here in like 15 years. - [Riley] Get it just before we die. - Yay. - Now it's time for quick bits, brought to you by Hello FRESH, the premier meal kit delivery service. They create delicious step-by-step recipes every week, and send them to you, along with fresh pre-proportioned ingredients. Mmh I love those.

Hello FRESH delivers straight to your door and you can get $80 off plus free shipping using our promo code TECH80, at the link below. So click it. It's got nutrients. - Now for the quick bits. - [Riley] Are you okay? - I'm actually fine, yeah. You know that Apple M1 Chip we're just talking about? Well, the one thing that apparently can't do is connect to an external graphics card, it's not clear why support for this feature has been removed, though, past Macs have had issues with external GPUs and Apple might have just been in the position of like, ah, good enough, most people probably won't use it anyway. It'll also drive people who need more processing horses to future Mac Pros with other Apple future silicon chips. Don't you just love having less functionality when you buy an expensive gadget? - [Riley] It's because it's a prestige project product, it's curated. - All the new Xbox consoles will support 1440p, it's currently notably missing from the PlayStation 5. This isn't a huge shocker, considering consoles are built primarily for TVs and, virtually no TVs out there have a 1440p resolution. However, many console players do use monitors, and Sony is reportedly thinking about adding 1440p support, if there's enough demand. If only consoles would support ultrawides. - [Riley] Yeah, a lot of plug console players with ultrawides. - Loads, absolute, droves. - [Riley] Dozens of us. - Yes, dozens. The US election is over and with it the end of the huge barrage of political ads you've constantly seen on TV. If you're as sick of them as most people are, there's a bit of good news today as both Google and Facebook have extended their bans on political advertising for the time being. - [Riley] Now, it's till the end of time. - Yay, Google has said the decision is related to the amount of acrimony that, that's like lying, isn't it? - [Riley] Legal term. - And misinformation circulating around the election result. Can we all just get along? - [Riley] Not when you're being acrimonious. - Nanoleaf, the company that makes those, colored light panels for your gaming den, is about to launch competitor to Phillips Hue called Essentials, featuring colored bulbs and light strips. It works with thread mesh devices, so you won't need a separate bridge to control them. Unfortunately, they won't be cheap as a bulb setting you back 20 bucks, wait that's not too bad, unless you're costing 50. Hopefully competition will 'cause a drop in prices, but, you also can always throw in some colored film over your plain old desktop lamp if not. - [Riley] Or some food coloring. - Yeah, that would work, great Riley. And Walmart, is expanding its reach to the realm of, driverless home delivery, to compete with Amazon. In partnership with General Motors, the retail giant is going to be testing some autonomous driving in Scottsdale, Arizona, starting next week. It's pretty cool news for the folks out there, but, I wonder if they'll miss hanging out with the people of Walmart. - [Riley] What's that? - You know, the people of Walmart. That's our show for today, come back on Friday for more Tech News for the low price of your time. - [Riley] Wait, this show's free. - No, yes, but, (Clark laughs) I don't know what I'm doing, let's leave.",

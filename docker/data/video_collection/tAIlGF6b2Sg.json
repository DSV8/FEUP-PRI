    "transcript": "- Whatever it ends up being called. It seems highly likely that we'll get a new edition of the Nintendo Switch sometime in 2021 the dockable handheld is still wildly popular, but it hasn't gotten a real update since it launched back in 2017. unless you count the TB incompatible switch Lake. So naturally there are some features gamers have long been pining for. A big one is 4k support in docked mode. Even back in 2017, it was a little puzzling that a brand new console didn't support 4k at all. And today with even inexpensive TV supporting 4k, it's nearly certain that a new switch will render games at a handheld friendly, lower resolution, then scale the output to 4k using invidious impressives deep learning super sampling technology. Boy, that's a mouthful. Additionally, it sounds like the upgraded switch, will feature an OLED display, similar to what you see on mid to high-end smartphones, for better color accuracy and clear gaming on the go. Now this last one is purely speculative, but hopefully a sturdier redesign of the joy-con controller is in the works as well. Far too many Switch owners have reported issues with Joy-con drift. Our second entry is one that could help keep your new Switch and other expensive electronics, safe when you're out of the house. Officially called the Always Home Cam, Rings camera equipped mini drone is designed for use indoors rather than outside, like most other drones. The idea is that you set paths for it to follow, and then the drone will regularly patrol your home, with no input from the user. The drone is designed to be intentionally audible so that in the event someone breaks into your home, the noise will serve as a deterrent. If your home alarm wasn't already triggered obviously. That all sounds pretty neat, but what does it cost? In dollars 249, in your privacy, well, if Rings parent company Amazon is already listening to everything you say, I guess what difference does it make, if they can see it too, right? Here's something I want to see though. Samsung is a familiar name and high quality TVs. But they're in country rival LG, has been a step ahead in recent years, thanks to their use of use of OLED panels on their top tier models. Samsung is ready to strike back however, with MicroLED, an all new type of panel that delivers OLED level inky blacks, with better brightness and without the downsides. You see the O and OLED stands for organic, and these organic materials degrade over time, putting your fancy new TV at risk of image burning. This is particularly problematic, for people who often play games with static display elements like health bars or speedometers. Micro LED will still lose some brightness over time, but theoretically it should offer superior longevity. The bad news, however, is the steep early adopter tax. Currently MicroLEDs are very complex, and expensive to produce. Meaning you can expect prices to be from the high five figures, all the way up to around 150 grand depending on the size. Oh, I really hope Linus doesn't hear about these. Thankfully, our next product will be far less expensive. Assuming the scalpers don't get to it. Intel is finally getting close to a large-scale release of their first discrete graphics product for gamers, the XE-HPG GPU. According to leaks, we can expect performance comparable to a G-Force RTX 3060, or a Radian RX, 6700 XT, which would have Intel competing in the enthusiast segment of the market for the first time ever. Before you get too excited, though, it looks like this year's XE-HPG parts will be restricted to laptops, with desktop versions showing up sometime in 2022. An interesting side note, is that while Intel has its own chip making tabs, team blue is reportedly using contract chip maker TSMC to fabricate these new products. That means they're stuck in the same manufacturing queue as competitors AMD and Nvidia, which might explain the slow timing for the rollout. Finally, we've got another entry from Intel, Alder Lake processors. By this point, you're probably burnt out of all the Lake variations of Intel CPU's that seem to offer only modest performance schemes, except when they don't. But Alder Lake is fundamentally different in a few ways. Alder Lake is a hybrid CPU that incorporates both high performance cores and power saving cores on the same CPU package. This is similar to what we've seen in ARM chips for a number of years now, and is a big part of the reason why your smartphone can save battery when you're browsing the web, but kick it up into high gear, when you're touching up your selfies or playing a game. This kind of efficiency improvement is mostly geared towards helping laptop users. But what will help the rest of you, is that Intel is finally moving to there many times delayed 10 nanometer process on the desktop. Additionally, Intel will be using its new SuperFin transistors. A variation on standard FinFET that allows for better powerful end faster performance. So hopefully the gains will be larger than what we've seen in recent years. And Alder Lake should also feature support for DDR5 and PCIe 5.0. So it could be an interesting platform, if you're looking to get ahead of the curve, with the rest of your system. Of course that's not all the new tech coming this year. We didn't even mention hot upcoming devices like the Pixel 6 and Apple's iPhone refresh. So if there's something you're looking forward to that we missed, let us know down in the comments. As for me, I'm looking forward to telling you about our sponsor, which I'll do right now. MSI's MPG Z590 Gaming Force motherboard supports 10th and 11th gen Intel core CPU's. It's compatible with 5333 megahertz overclock DDR4 memory, PCIe 4.0, it has enlarged heat sinks with heat pipe, MOSFET thermal pads, and additionally it has choked thermal pads, and a bunch of other good things to keep things cool. It also has MSI's mystic light, RGB, and a pre-installed IO shield, which is always nice to have. Learn more today at the link below.

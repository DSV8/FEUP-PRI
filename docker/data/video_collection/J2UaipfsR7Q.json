    "transcript": "- This is why I have trust issues. (Andy laughs) - This is way too much waifu again. It's the year of the rabbit. And to celebrate Chinese New Year, we are roasting the wackiest setups from our audience in China. A place that's known for coming up with unusual solutions to technological challenges. - Yeah, this should be fun. Like everywhere else in the world, gamers in China are creative, occasionally janky, and very, very roastable. Just like this segue to our sponsor. - Build Redux. Build Redux makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help along the way. They also offer competitive pricing as compared to building the PC yourself. Head to buildredux.com/linus to start your new build today. (upbeat music) - Two questions out of the gate. One, why are we using Outlook? And two, where on earth we're getting these submissions from? I'm gonna do the second one first. You guys probably don't realize that we have a massive following on Bilibili.com in China, which came about because there was a group that was pirating our videos, translating them, and re-uploading. We then hired those same people to officially translate them and maintain an official channel there. We're almost at a million subscribers. So if you're in China, go check it out. As for why we're using Outlook, well, we weren't sure if having screenshots of Gmail would get the video banned there. - I'm pretty sure it's fine to receive email, but like it's just, you know, try to avoid that, you know? - And we needed some way for people to contact us, and it sure as heck wasn't gonna be Twitter, so... Hotmail! First up we've got EngineWu, who made a DIY version of Razor's Project Valerie. - [Jake] Is that Lego? - This is so much better than I thought it was. - [Jake] It's actually aligned properly. No, it's not Lego. - No, that's carbon fiber. This is like custom fabbed carbon fiber hinges on two additional displays. Then it's just like a bracket that holds on the back of the laptop's original screen, and then these carbon fiber fabricated arms hold the additional displays in place. This is better than the commercial solutions I've seen. - Kwumsy? - [Linus] I know, right? This ain't Kwumsy at all. Oh, okay. That's cheating. That's cheating. Now you're automatically the best setup. - I mean, clean your desk. - Yeah. - It stays full of power. - Thanks. Andy's here to help us. - Yeah. - [Linus] All right. What kind of case is this? The input output case. No, I don't see any other branding. - [Andy] No, no, no. - [Linus] Wait. - [Jake] Is that a chiller? - [Linus] No. - Does he have a chiller? No way. - Chilled set up blocking the RTX. That's gonna be a 3090, I think. Hold on, there's a temperature reading. - [Jake] 16 degrees on the return coolant it looks like. - Oh, that's interesting. That's not that cold. Which makes sense, because you don't actually want condensation to form. They probably have that fine control so they can run it exactly as cool as they want. - Is it even worth it then? - No. - Yeah. - No, it's just awesome. - Oh, okay. I like. - Exactly. I am loving some of the redneck engineering I'm seeing here. - This is like Terran's desk all over again. Wait, it's a square monitor! - [Andy] I have that one on my desk. It's awesome. - I actually really like this setup. You gotta give respect to the people who appreciate a proper audio setup. When I see a pair of speakers behind a multi-monitor setup, I lose my crap. I can't handle it. - Hey, I have big speakers. All right? Yeah? - This is a little anime from me. (everyone laughing) - He's got some sound foam and- - [Linus] Oh yeah, maybe for streaming. Is there a microphone I'm missing over here somewhere? Well that explains it! So the recording set up is probably sick, but not for vocals. But what are we not supposed to be looking at? - [Andy] Got a (indistinct). - [Jake] Big on Cooler Master power supplies. - [Linus] Yeah. Okay. - [Jake] Core i9, all right. - You know what's funny? Back when I did the build with Strange Parts, my intention was to go into the tech mall and buy only brands I'd never heard of before. I was shocked to see how many Chinese stores are just full of the exact same products that I would find here in North America. - [Jake] A lot of it is made there, right? - Of course. But, like, that's never what makes the headlines. - Yeah. - [Linus] Okay. This wide shot, though. - [Jake] Whoa, look at the ceiling. He's got a cool ceiling. - Okay, hold on, hold on. Go to the plug. - [Linus] Go to the plug? - This guy is not in China. - What is that? - It's probably North America. - That doesn't look like a North American plug. - It doesn't look like a Chinese plug. Yeah, that's a North American plug, Jake. - [Jake] What? - Look, that's an ROG logo. Big liar! No! You're out, you're done! This looks sick. This is RGB. - [Jake] Whoa. - Done. You know? - [Jake] Oh my God. - [Linus] Endgame RGB. - Who needs a screen at this point, you know? - [Linus] What am I looking at here? - [Jake] Edifier. - Is that your subwoofer-slash-volume knob? Like, here's the speaker. - [Jake] Yeah, yeah. These are the (beep) Edifier ones, like the old ones. - You spent all the money on your PC, and you have no money on your speakers. - Yeah. Those are Colder disconnects. They look jank, but those are the bomb. - [Jake] Is that the heating? - Wait, wait. No! No! Did they do whole room water cooling (beep)? - Hold on, hold on. - No, I wanna see it, Andy! These are insulated. - [Jake] Why is it- Look at those zip ties. Oh my God. Wait, is that just a distribution plate? Oh my God. What the (beep) is that? (everyone laughing) - [Linus] Two water loops with a heat exchanger. - Oh, so the big tank is a heat exchanger. - [Linus] So this is what? This is a chiller? - It might be outside. - [Linus] This is outside. - Oh, so he's got a thing outside? - [Linus] Yeah, this is outside. - Yeah. - It's brick wall. - So this is gotta be the something. And it's insulated, so this has to be cold. This has to be cold side. - [Jake] Yeah. - What an unnecessarily elaborate setup. I like it. - That's a 13900K. Oh no, he's got two GPUs. - [Linus] There it is. - [Jake] Oh, it totally is. It totally is. What the (beep)? (Jake laughs) - The problem is this is like XL case. - You can't even say that you're mining to heat your house, 'cause then you're using refrigeration. - Yeah. - Why do you have two GPUs? - This is next level. - Aye-yai-yai. It just like stresses me out. - No, no. It's \"aye-yah.\" Those are some big, fat tubes. - [Jake] For a very small water block. - [Linus] Yes. - The GPU's very special. - [Jake] I'd tap that. - [Linus] Is that a \"Hall of Fame\"? I think it is. I think that's like a Galax- A weird Galax Hall of Fame. - [Jake] Hey, look! Look at that. - [Linus] Hey! - [Jake] JerryRig everything knife. Love it. - Oh, wait, that is a gigantic sound bar. You're not actually supposed to sit that close to a sound bar. A HEATKILLER? That's a name I've not heard in a long time. These used to be pretty popular. These external water cooling things. I am liking this build. That might be a HEATKILLER. \"Made in Germany.\" It's probably a HEATKILLER. HEATKILLER was known for having okay performance, but, like, really nice looking stuff. - I don't like the Trident Z Royal. I will never like Trident Z Royal. It's awful. - No, it's cool! - No, it's so aw- Yeah, you can't see it, so why would you buy it? - You can't see it anyway. - No, it's cool. - No, it's stupid. - It's cool. Oh, no! The side of the back panel's missing. You can't have a gorgeous system like this and be like, \"Ah, I don't know if I'm gonna put the back panel on.\" - They just need cooling for that SSD back there. - [Linus] Very trendy. Got the tissues. (everyone laughing) - [Jake] I like how a quarter of his desk is taken up by the computer. You could just put that thing on top of the computer, and take up half as much space. What is wrong with you? - I'm trying to get it to- I'm trying- Also, what is this? (everyone laughs) It just works. - Oh (beep). - Oh, can't believe you've done this. - I can't believe you've done this. (Andy laughs) Whoa. - [Andy] Ooh. - [Jake] That's pretty. - That is an absolutely sick set up. - I'm a little confused why some of them are fittings for the corners and other ones are not. Maybe I guess it's just the style. - [Linus] Yeah, it could just be aesthetic. - Yeah. - Like, okay, would you wanna do, in hard line metal, would you wanna do this bend and this bend and try and get them perfect? - Yeah, probably, if you're going through the effort of bending metal. - [Linus] Nah. No, man. I wouldn't. I would do one bend, for sure. And then it's just 90. - It's a cop out. - You're gonna look at this build and be like, \"Cop out!\" - Look. - What a hater. - You haven't done metal tubing, have you? - You're a hater. You're being a hater. - I am being a hater. Okay, that's pretty dope. - [Linus] See! Don't be a hater! - [Andy] Yeah. - I just- I always have wanted to build like an open concept computer, and then you look at how dusty your computer gets closed concept, and you're like, \"No!\" Oh my God. Looks like he builds computers. Maybe he runs like a mini SI business out of his apartment. - Yeah, I could see that. I mean, if I could build computers like that, people would probably come to me and ask me to build them. - Yeah. - From time to time. - Clean up your goddamn room. Why do you have a TV sitting on chairs? - [Linus] Yeah! Yeah! Wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Are these design files for a computer in a laundry detergent bottle? - [Jake] Yeah. - Is it mineral oil? Is it submersion cooled? - No. - Oh. There's a fan on the side. What do you mean? - Oh, I thought it was inside. (Jake laughs) - No way! Oh, that's awful. - So basically the only two things you need on your desk are your computer and your tissue box. - [Jake] Yeah. Does he have a LED in the pump? - [Andy] I think so. (Jake and Andy laughing) - [Jake] What is that? - [Linus] This is a frame that was fabricated to- - [Jake] Oh, it's a- - It's a stove. - [Jake] It's a little stove. Look at it. - It's a camp stove. - Oh wait, this is a separate machine. - [Jake] Yeah! - [Andy] It's a separate machine. Yeah. (everyone laughing) - Oh, that's amazing! - I like how he put the fan at the top. That's awesome. - [Andy] I think this guy has a channel and a video like above those. - Oh, that's such a smart place to put a little 1U power supply. Oh, I like it. I like it. - And the best part is you can pull all the stuff up and still like access everything. - [Linus] Totally. Totally. This is one of those mods that's actually probably more usable when you're done with it. - Dude, if you could adjust the fan speed with the knob, that would be pretty baller. - All right. This one's pretty cool. - Huh? - [Linus] Okay. It's the ultimate portable setup. It almost looks like a Lego technic project, but really fabricated. - [Andy] Yeah. - [Linus] Big heavy hinge for the kickstand. Who needs a Microsoft Surface, am I right? (everyone laughs) - The edges, you gotta be careful with this thing. - [Linus] Yeah, more like the Microsoft Weapon. - Imagine bringing this to a coffee shop. - [Linus] That is not a real 80 plus bronze sticker. (everyone laughs) That is orange. - Screws look like they're starting to rust. - [Linus] Yeah. - It's probably for the look. - Oh yeah, yeah. It's really enhancing it for me. - I don't know, Andy. (everyone laughing) I think those might just be old screws. Wait, what? - [Jake] Are those speakers? - [Linus] No, those are monitor arms! - [Andy] \"Dataland\"? - [Linus] What is \"Dataland\"? I've never heard of \"Dataland\" before. Let's go Jake. - Wait, they're on Newegg. - No way. - [Jake] Well, they were. 6900 XT. - [Linus] This is sick. DIY monitor stand computer. - [Jake] Oh. Huh? - I have never seen someone DIY a monitor stand with VESA mounts. - Is dust like not a thing in China? - It's definitely a thing in China. - Yeah. So why is everybody building these open-concept PCs? - Maybe they just clean their house once in a while, so. - Okay. - [Linus] Why is it in a box? - It's one of those desk things. - It's in a little alcove. - It's probably like a dorm. - Oh. - Oh. - Check your privilege, man. God. - What? Okay, well, if you have headphones like this, my question's valid. - Is the monitor on a little tripod? (Linus laughs) - What's up with this (indistinct)? Did you just buy-? - [Jake] Oh my God. That's a tablet tripod. Look at the top. Look at the top. You see the other part of the- - It's a clamp. - The clamp. Yeah. (Jake laughs) - [Linus] Did you DIY this monitor? That is not a good place for your wireless router. - [Jake] Signals, who needs that? - Some kinda audio interface of some sort. - [Jake] Looks like a headphone amp. - I am loving the left-side numpad by the way. That is an A-player move. And I am liking the classy, wood wrist rest. Do you remember when I pitched this video idea? - What? - The cheapest NAS setup. Where it was just gonna be like four pieces of extrusion and just a tower of external hard drives. You buy cheap HBAs that have the external connectors on eBay, because those tend to be lower priced. And then we just build an external CD tower, essentially, of hard drives. Someone did it. On a smaller scale. - I don't know if that's gonna help with filtering, but at least you won't poke your finger in the fan. - [Andy] It's a grill. - [Linus] Which is a real problem that affects many people. \"This is a computer made with idle motherboard.\" - [Jake] \"Bazooka Plus.\" It's in the motherboard box. (Andy laughs) I don't know how much I believe that this is actually his setup, because the hot glue gun is sitting right there. - [Linus] Yeah, I don't believe it. - It also looks like he cut holes for the power supply and then realized there was no space. (Jake laughs) - Wait until you see the other ones. - [Linus] The power supply- (everyone laughing) - [Jake] It's on top of the motherboard. Oh my God! - [Andy] The funny thing is \"RPG-enhanced board.\" - I think that's just a really bad direct translation from the English, ironically. There's a pretty disrespectful word for poor translations from Chinese to English. Do you guys have an equivalent term for that? - Yes, we do. When I was a kid I watched like \"CCTV-6,\" which is like China Central Television, but the movie channel, they always have like, you know, like the Chinese speaking, but like western movies. - Sure. - So that translation is like, \"Hey, I'm gonna kick your butt.\" \"Hi.\" (Andy speaking in Chinese) It just sounds really weird. In a way. So like, we call that \"translate tone.\" - Translate tone. - [Andy] Yeah. - So how did they end up with that? - I don't know. - [Jake] RPG-enhanced. - RPG-enhanced comes from the \"Bazooka Plus.\" - Ew. Wait, hold on. - Wait, hold on. This is a water-cooled laptop. Shut up. Did you make your own quick connect fittings? - I don't think so. I think they're just (beep) quick disconnects, but they leak. - [Linus] What is growing on your mouse, brother? - [Jake] I think that might be grip tape. - [Linus] And this might be the external reservoir radiator unit? - [Jake] Right. Oh my God. Why? - If it's gonna be this big and this not portable, 'cause it leaks all over the place, you need to get a desktop, brother. You need to get some clamps on this tube here. Like, now. - [Jake] Especially 'cause it's like the one that goes out. - [Linus] Yeah. - Is there no photos of how it connects? Oh, it just goes into the laptop. It must be like one that you- - [Linus] It just goes in there. - So you can't use it without it being connected. So you might as well have a desktop. - Yeah. Okay. - [Jake] What? - Is this a Hacken Tosh? Is that what I'm looking at here? Mac Station? Is this a giant soundbar that you couldn't even have centered under your monitor? These wifi antennas though. My goodness. You know you can get your own access point. Okay? You don't have to take it from your neighbor down the street. (Jake and Andy laughing) \"The black can next is a DIY audio system.\" - [Jake] Are they speakers? - [Andy] Are those like real cans? - [Jake] Yeah, like soda cans. - [Andy] Kinda looks like soda cans. - [Jake] But are they just speakers? They look like speakers. They totally are speakers. Why? - [Andy] What? - In what universe is that an optimal setup for anything? Plus you have this sound bar. But why would you want your subs like in your computer? - [Linus] \"I live with my parents in Shanghai. Here's one side of my room.\" I like it. - [Jake] Were those things-? - [Linus] Look at these cable management tracks. - [Jake] Are they lights? - [Linus] I want this in my house. - If you have plugs underneath your desk, why do you need that? - Because you have your HDMI- - [Linus] Yeah, whatever. That's freaking awesome. - I mean, it doesn't look amazing, but- - It looks a lot more amazing than running it across the floor. - [Jake] Yeah. Not as good as running cable channel along the top of the ceiling, but, it's not bad. - I like it. You don't need to hide cables if they have some style. I'm into it. Also, loving the badminton racket. Very nice. I can't tell what racket it is, but. - GTX 560s or something like that up there. 560. - Yep. - Got the swing bar. - [Linus] Oh, that stupid light. - [Jake] It's not stupid. - [Linus] It is stupid. You don't need a light pointing at your screen. Do you have any idea how much engineering has gone into reducing light shining back at you from the screen? - I think you should just try it for a month. - I don't need to. I don't need to. I want as little possible distraction and light on my screen. - There's none. Everything's labeled and color-coded. I love it. - [Linus] This is not necessary. (everyone laughing) - [Jake] \"Front.\" I can understand labeling fans, maybe. But the rest of this- Yes, that's a SATA cable. - [Linus] I mean if you're just gonna label- Yeah. If you're gonna say which one, fine. But if you're just gonna label it \"SATA.\" (everyone laughing) Is that your pump, sir? - [Jake] No, that's a CPU block. - [Linus] No, that's a GPU block, Jake. - [Jake] Oh my God. - [Linus] They used to have a water cooled GPU, and we're like, \"Eh.\" (Linus laughing) - Like is it leaking, too? He's got like a tissue in there just in case. - [Linus] He's got a paper towel under it! Oh no! And how are these fans even mounted to this radiator? - [Jake] Zip ties. - [Linus] There's some screws. - [Jake] There's also zip ties. - [Linus] There's also zip ties. (everyone laughing) - [Jake] They also don't fit, at all. - [Linus] You need to top up your reservoir. Also, this is fulfilling the reservoir, it goes the other way. - This is not a cap. - This goes in. This is not a lid. Oh my goodness. - Is there more photos? - Nope. That's all the context we get, Jake. - This is why I have trust issues. - [Linus] This is their Minecraft server, apparently, by the way. - Oh, sick. Need a slim line optical for my Minecraft server. Aye-yai-yai. Stop drawing on your desk. - [Linus] Yeah. Can you not do that please? Like for real? Also, what's your keyboard doing way over here? - [Jake] Look at the tissue! - [Linus] Ah! - [Jake] It's like a used tissue. - [Andy] The pink thing is tissue. - [Jake] What the- No! - This is a gigantic fire hazard. - [Jake] Don't solder over your computer. What are you doing? - [Linus] Yeah, this is on. - [Jake] Yeah, look at the USB. - [Linus] Oh no, I think this is the Minecraft server. This is- What is this motherboard? - [Jake] Wait, what is that? - [Andy] It's got a pillow. - [Jake] Why's it got a display connection? - [Linus] \"ITX and Minecraft server in my room, because I have to take my PC to university that it must be ITX type. However, there's not enough room for me to place the disc, so I had to hang it outside.\" - [Jake] Can I see it one more time then? - There's no other pictures, Jake. I'm afraid that's all we get. - I have so many questions. - No amount of looking at this is going- - What's with the pillow? Like is that where his bed is? - I don't know, Jake. - It's stressing me out. Oh my God. - [Linus] I'm liking the ducted AC to the rig. - [Andy] It's not AC, it's a blower fan. - [Linus] It's a fan. And then it just blows over the GPU. - What? Why? - Bringing the air from the room directly to the GPU. - [Jake] You could just put a fan without taking up half of your room. - No, Jake. This is the right way. - [Jake] What model is it? M40? M60? - [Linus] Oh, wait. Hold on. An M60 might actually- No, that might be why. I love it! - [Jake] You could still just put a fan there. - Well, you could. - [Jake] It's not a quadrant, it's a Tesla. - Yeah, you could 3D print a shroud or whatever, but if they need to do- - The first time with that CMP, you know what I used? Duct tape. I made a thing out of duct tape. And that worked. - And this is? - This is their duct tape. - Equally elegant. - \"GreatWind\" power supply. They got two of them. They've got multiple GreatWinds. - Wait, there's one we missed. YuuKi-AnS messaged us. (Jake laughing) - [Jake] What am I looking at? - [Linus] I don't know how this guy gets it, but he has early samples of all the wildest stuff. (Jake laughs) And he is trolling me. Basically. - I wanna see him put it in his mouth. - Clearly trolling. I have no idea what I'm looking at here, but it's blacked out, so I can pretty much promise you that it is like NextGen and no one's seen it. Oh, you know what I bet it is? 'Cause he gets like the wildest Intel stuff. This is probably- - [Jake] Sapphire Rapids Max or whatever? - [Linus] No, no, no, no. The GPU thing. - [Jake] Oh. - [Linus] The Ponte Vecchio. Look at this Intel board. It's gotta be like this big. What does this even go in? \"Internal use only.\" - [Jake] \"Everest\"? - [Linus] \"Everest\". I don't know if I've ever seen one of those. I think Everest was a proposed product for like an even faster, that era, something that never- - (indistinct) CPUs were used for high frequency stock trading. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, that's super cool! - [Jake] So there's some of those like specifically made for one company kind of thing. - [Linus] Yes! - [Jake] It's on x86 Guide, Sandy Bridge. 6 core, 12 thread, 4.4 gigahertz. - Oh, and here's a Hygon, 24 core Hygon. I've been trying to get my hands on one of these forever. - [Andy] It's an epic socket. It's SP3. - [Linus] Yeah, it's that Chinese epic. This one is simply labeled \"pragmatism.\" You roll outta bed, you get in your chair. - [Jake] That chair looks brutally uncomfortable. What? - [Andy] So when you have a friend coming over, you can just sit in your bed and your friend can use your own pc on the other side. - [Jake] It sort like- Is that leg holes? You put your legs down there? - Maybe. Okay, that's all we get. The word \"pragmatism,\" and those two pictures. That's clean. - [Jake] Wait, what? No fans? - [Linus] What is \"DIY-Ape\"? - So that's a Bilibili creator. - [Jake] That's pretty sick, but- - [Linus] It's pretty cool. - [Andy] The over-cord is on the back, and that creator collabed with some of the manufacturers, and they make that type of board. - That's pretty cool. \"Hi, dear friend. This is the suitcase computer I made. It is 41 inches long.\" - [Jake] Noice! I don't know about that ventilation. You might need more than that. - It looks cool. Can confirm, that is a suitcase. Wait, what? - [Jake] Is that a laptop? - [Linus] It's a laptop that doesn't have the top cover with the keyboard anymore. Is this the cooler? What are you doing, bud? This is your VR. That's their VR setup. Okay. What on earth is this? - So he's got a Mac, and then also the pc that is that laptop. - [Linus] Yeah. Okay. - [Jake] He's got the stupid light, too. - No, it's not stupid! - It is stupid! - It's not stupid! - [Jake] It's so stupid. - It's so stupid. - You guys should try it. - [Jake] Hey, that's cool. - [Linus] That's sick. Okay, I don't know about this. - [Jake] Yeah. Or all the cables hanging down. - [Linus] Is this masking tape? Okay, my initial reaction is- - Oh! Ew! - Yeah, you gotta- Don't kick your wall. - [Jake] Clean your toe jam off the wall. Ew. - \"After a couple months, there's barely any dust.\" - [Linus] Ooh. - [Jake] This is pretty. - [Linus] This is a sick setup. - [Jake] Took some proper photos. - What's there to say other than \"that's gorgeous\"? - Yeah, it's like Ikea pegboard. - [Linus] Love it. - Cool. - [Linus] A transparent screen. - [Jake] Oh, cool. This is like a DIY one. I haven't seen somebody DIY this in a long time. - [Linus] Oh, that's awesome. Basically took the internals of a monitor without the backlight, and then just made a side panel out of it. - [Jake] Yeah, that's pretty cool. What RAM is that? King- - \"KingWin\"? \"KingBank.\" - Wait, are they running off a Steam Deck? No way. - [Linus] Oh, I like it. Yup, they're on the dock. There it is. There's the dock. Yep. - [Jake] And they're just running Windows. You could run Windows on that. - Oh, they're running lots of things. Hold on a second here. Here's your subwoofer. There's your AVerMedia capture card. There's your Nintendo. There's your Xbox. There's your PlayStation. There's your NAS. This is about the most dense setup I think I've ever seen. Got your Wii U. - Turn them all on. I dare you. I think he is running- Oh, no, no. - Oh! - Clean it! It's like too much waifu type of thing. - Yeah. Ooh, that's a lot of life-sized waifu. - That one just looks kind of cool. - [Linus] Yeah. - I mean, I'm ignoring the background. - [Linus] Yeah, there's definitely too much waifu. - [Jake] What is it with these? Oh, this one opens! - [Linus] It's the briefcase cardboard pc. All right. - Oh, this is the GPU that I was trying to buy. - [Linus] This thing? - Yes. - What is it? - The Sakura. The Chinese brand. - [Jake] Is that a normal Steam background? Can you do that? - [Linus] No, that's Chinese Steam. - [Jake] Oh, it has themes? - [Linus] I don't know. - It's Mac. - [Linus] Oh. Oh. - [Jake] Wait, what? - [Linus] Yeah. What are we even looking at here? - [Jake] No, it's not a Mac. Maybe it's a Mac. Oh my God, it is a Mac. Wait, where's the Mac, though? - [Andy] I'm so confused now. - [Jake] This a Hacken Tosh? Is that an AMD GPU? Because then it could be a Hacken Tosh. - [Andy] Probably. - But why? I don't know about running that stuff on a Hacken Tosh. Could it just be like a Mac skin? - Could be. - Because like the bar on the bottom looks a little sus'. - 3080- - [Jake] No, it wouldn't be a Mac. - [Linus] Here's the shelf on your shelf, and you just shelf your computer. This motherboard is just balanced there. - [Jake] Just vibing. - [Andy] I just like the shelf. - [Jake] He's got a door. - Asus Book. - [Jake] You see like the door? He didn't have screws for the acrylic, so it's zip ties on the finish. Oh, come on! - [Linus] Ah, that is too much waifu. - [Jake] What? Go back up. What about the laundry? You didn't see the laundry? - [Andy] You didn't see that? - No. - I mean, if you only have that much space, I guess. - Okay. The only question is, does the person who took this picture wear these or collect them? That's a big radiator. - [Jake] Oh my God. - That's a big radiator. - So close to having all the fans match. - [Linus] It's big. There's like three more. No. - [Jake] Oh my God. Wait, so another person did this? - [Linus] No, no, this is that again. Wait, this is this done worse. - [David] We need to watch the video. - [Jake] What? - [Linus] That is hilarious. - [Jake] \"I am also a blogger.\" Maybe this is just like the V1. - [Linus] Yeah, was this a trend? - [Andy] It's a pretty minimal thing. - I think one was the correct number of times for someone to build a computer in a pump bottle. Oh, it's a car computer! - [Jake] Okay, that's pretty cool. - [Linus] Jake, it's a car-puter! Oh, I love it! Okay, last one. - Wow. - [Linus] The computer now goes in the kettle. The GPU's in the kettle! Oh, I love it! - So this is just like a trend. Okay. Outro. Do the outro. - Thanks to Mine for sponsoring this video.

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video and today... another something that floats. Levitates, you know I love levitation. This is some next level thing. It's called Flyte, it is a floating light bulb legitimately-[hand motions] \"Flyte, set the light bulb free.\" This is fancy stuff. Let's crack it open and get fancy together. Very nice unboxing experience. Flyte on the top. Ooooh... For some reason, I looked at this... cork-looking deal and it reminded me of that game, \"Myst\". (To Jack) Did you ever play Myst? (To Jack) You never played Myst... You did. Thumbs up if you played Myst. Hell of a game. It was a little weird. Oooh. Aaaah. This helps you get the bulb in the right place. Wow, wow, wow. That's kinda heavy. I guess this is the base here. Sure, let's put that down. We have some various tips. So no matter where you are in the world, you're going to be able to take flight. See what I did there? Get it? Very short power brick, and then a longer power cable that it plugs into - that, again, I'm getting \"Myst\"- like vibes here. It looks like a rope on a pirate ship, or something like that. This is a classic-looking light bulb; this is the kind of light bulb that you would see in a cartoon, like when the thought when a guy gets the... t-the great idea? This goes off - ding! Oh, I feel the magnet already working; take the... The guide here and then... I'm gonna slide it out. [breathes out] We're floating now. (Reading instructions): \"Gently tap the flight base to turn on the LED.\" Oh! Wireless power! That's cool. I'm into that. Should we hit some lights? Ooo hoo hoo hoo hah hoh! The future is now, my friends. That's some high end kinda look! It's - it's very instant too, the touch control. Wait a sec - how long does that spin for? Human beings are weird. Are we not? Look what we do. You need to have like, it's just a room - a huge empty room - in the centre is this thing doing this, and you invite some people over but you're not there - it's just the lamp. Then there's a record player, and it's just lapping around - it's been- i-it finished a long time ago - it's just *shoom*! *foom*! *poom*! Y'know what I'm saying? Jack, I'm inviting you over. Power's gone. Is that dangerous? Alright, let's boot it up. Oh, the classic crackle...",

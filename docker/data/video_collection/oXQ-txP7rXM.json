    "transcript": "hey folks Eber here with Hardware Canucks and this is the Aero 15X from gigabyte a very popular notebook among content creators and gamers who are looking to get the most out of a notebook in a thin and light form factor now the Aero lineup of notebooks was introduced when Nvidia rolled out the GTX 10 series max-q designs and gigabyte has continued to develop upon that foundation now this is the updated version that comes with the RTX 2070 max-q GPU so let's find out how it actually performs and how well can a finit like notebook can properly cool an RTX GPU because yeah it's that's quite something so let's get into that right after message from our sponsor the new razer blade still defines portability without compromising on performance featuring Intel's latest agent CPU and NVIDIA MX150 GPU up to 16 gigabytes of memory and up to 13 hours of battery life experienced some of the most popular games wherever you are learn more about the blade stealth down below alright so if you're familiar with previous Aero 15X notebooks nothing really has changed here in terms of design with this new model gigabyte has still stuck with the same chassis that's built with a few aluminium components there's also the same gigabyte glowing logo on the front lid it's nowhere closer to what you would get with the Razer Blade 15 notebook the keyboard layout still remains the same with perky RGB lighting and a few handful of lighting effects the trackpad has improved significantly this time because it now features Windows position drivers so you can take advantage of all the gesture controls baked into Windows 10 I'm glad that gigabyte listened although I will be honest coming from my blade 15 base model featuring a glass touchpad the responsiveness is definitely noticeable coming to the Aero 15X it's just not as smooth as would you'd find on the blade notebook I just feel like I'm just boy by the blade dammit the one thing that I really wish to keep I did was to reposition the nose cam to a an actual proper location because it's still where it is and it's super weird I mean the quality is also pretty terrible port selection remains the same as well and honestly I have nothing to complain about it especially in 2019 since we're seeing no good manufacturers eliminating the important ones so on the right hand side you get your Kensington lock power in two USB 3.1 gen2 a thunderbolt type-c connector and a fast UHS card reader guys this is a big deal because you know personally as a content creator I shoot a lot of video especially in 4k and if I want to transfer footage when I'm in trade shows like CES that card reader can come in super beneficial because a it's fast and it's also built into the notebook so I don't have to carry external adapters everything like that Thank You Gigabyte I think this is probably one of the reasons why content creators will would look into a Windows notebook especially like the Aero 15X because it's it's got everything I mean you can say no to that switching over to the left we have an rj45 port another USB 3.1 gen2 port HDMI to PI know a USB C port that carries a DisplayPort 1.4 signal and a headphone / mic jack moving on to the display and this in my opinion is a significant upgrade from the previous generation it's a 1080p IPS screen with a refresh rate of 144 Hertz this panel is made by LG and it features the Pantone certification and the colors look fabulous on the screen I'd say it's a tad better and brighter than my blade 15 base model if you're a content creator you'll absolutely love color correcting and colored waiting of footage on the Aero 15X because it's just so good I don't think I have anything to complain about this display and when you pair that up with 144 its refresh rate it's definitely something that you don't want to miss especially in 2019 because gaming on it as well is a fantastic experience I mean once you go 144 Hertz it's really hard to go back to a 60 Hertz screen which is why I'm very hesitant to go back to my blade 15 base model because that notebook has 60 Hertz displays so 144 hurts man the cursus wheel specs wise this notebook features a core i7 8750 six core 12 thread processor it's got 16 gigabytes of memory clocked at 26 66 megahertz there's also a one terabyte Intel 760 P nvme SSD that rocks read speeds above 2.8 gigabytes per second and writes around 1.4 gigabytes per second so pretty fast and star the shows of course the RTX 2070 Max-q when you get inside this notebook you can easily get access to the internal components so for instance the memory is easily accessible you can actually max it out to 64 gigabytes which is kind of insane and there's also an extra nbme m2 slot that you can populate so you can have a dual storage configuration which is quite nice and there's also a 94 kilowatt hour battery that is pretty good especially when it comes to light load test I mean you need to consider that this notebook features a 144 to refresh rate so I was able to get just a little over 6 hours of use with my light load test which can consist of you know refreshing a Chrome web page for about 15 seconds and under a heavy load it's definitely gonna reduce especially when you're gaming on it I wouldn't expect you know all the battery life with this notebook but it's very respectable considering that the specs that it features alright so I guess the last thing to discuss here is performance but before I get into the numbers I do want to talk about the specs on the RTX 2070 because it actually ranges on the type of cooling design that gnomic manufacturers have in-house inside a thin and light chassis so it depends from brand to brand and if you look at videos website it's actually funny enough because suspects on the Arctic's 20 70 states that the clock speeds the boost clock speeds can range anywhere between 1100 megahertz to 1440 megahertz and you know it's funny enough when you look at the RTX 2080 the delta in terms of frequency is 500 megahertz and that's insane so it's up to the number of manufacturers to kind of find and tweak what the speed sweet spot is so I really had to monitor clock speeds to make sure that I was getting what was what was actually listed on the India's site so let's talk about that kicking things off with some synthetic tests the six core 12 third CPU is a strong performer for Wren if you're an architect or designer or even a content creator this thing will do an amazing job I took this 13-minute 4k project exported it to the YouTube 4k preset and this notebook took 15 minutes and 17 seconds to render now I do need to point out that if you're coming from a notebook featuring gtx 1070 or gtx 1018 max-q GPU then there's absolutely no reason to upgrade to the rtx notebook because the difference in performance especially for rendering is really not that big gaming on the other hand was a fantastic experience and pair that up with a 144 it's refresh rate display this thing flies you can easily push over a hundred frames per second in most triple-a titles at the highest preset except for Metro Exodus and battlefield once and say are a bit demanding now when you turn on RTX on Metro Exodus it's definitely gonna take a dip in performance taking a look at temperatures on a full synthetic load using either 64 the CPU did get quite toasty around 89 C and the clock speeds were hovering around 2.8 gigahertz which is pretty respectable for casual tasks the CPU was easily able to hit 4 gigahertz that's nice the rtx 2070 did max out at 86 C and the clock speeds were shifting back and forth between 1300 and 1410 megahertz which does align really well with an Nvidia spec sheet fan noise is something to consider what the Aero 15X as it's not a quiet machine especially when you enable gaming mode within gigabytes own utilities software speaking of gaming mode they're actually three modes built inside this PC on utility software so there's quiet normal and gaming I did all my testing with gaming mode enable to get the best out of the system but if you decide to use a normal mode it's going to take a slight dip in performance not significant because the clock speeds kind of vary between 1200 and 1300 megahertz versus thirteen hundred and fourteen hundred megahertz when you enable gaming mode and when you enable quiet mode it does it does tune tone down the fans just a little bit but it also takes a little bit of a hit in terms of performance okay so I guess this brings us to the conclusion and I want to kick things off by clearing some misconceptions I've been floating around the internet you see a lot of people think that the new rtx notebooks are ridiculously expensive and to an extent I can agree because they're not cheap but you need to understand it when if you kind of go back a couple of years ago when Nvidia rolled out GTX 10 series masks you designs those notebooks were priced similarly to what the RTX notebooks are right now I mean a good example would be this exact same Aero 15X notebook that I looked at a while back featuring a gtx 1070 max-q GPU that thing cost around 2200 dollars and when he compared to something like this featuring an RTX 2070 GPU it's $200 more expensive but that's totally justifiable for the performance that you're getting in gaming and I get it if you are on a budget trying to save some money you're actually much better off looking into a notebook featuring a GTX 10 series design but if you really want me absolute best in terms of performance RTX notebooks are here and it's kind of amazing to see brands pack so much power in a notebook that's easily portable I mean you can take this with you I mean anywhere you go if you're trapped if you're going for shows or doing coverage and stuff like that it's it's there for you the performance is there I don't think you'll ever be disappointed whatsoever so coming back to the Aero 15X should you buy this notebook well the answer really depends on what you're looking for in a notebook if you want the absolute best performance in a relatively thin aligned chassis then this is the way to go except mind you this notebook in particular does run a little warm and the fan noise is also quite loud so if you're gaming on it I highly recommend pairing you know maybe throwing on some headphones to eliminate that also the speakers on these are absolutely they're not really that great it's not fun facing they're kind of bottom facing as well so it really doesn't sound that great compared to something like the Razer blade 15 the book quality is also not on par with that and that's about it that's the only complaint I have about the Aero 15X so yeah that's pretty much it guys let me know what you guys think about this notebook I mean you know considering that it cost around $2,400 sure you can build a gaming PC the arguments always there but I'd love to know your thoughts about RTX on a notebook what do you think about it is it something that you'll consider looking - also I'm really looking forward to Nvidia rolling out the GTX 1660 Ti into notebooks I mean that would be kind of Awesome I just can't wait for that to happen so anyways that's been it thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribed to our boot sequence channel I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

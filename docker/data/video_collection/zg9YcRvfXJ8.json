    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   These earbuds / earphones / headphones are some of the coolest I've seen. The glow or pulsate to the beat of the music using Corning fibre optics. The Glow are an in-ear style headphone with an ear hook, making them a good choice for jogging, biking etc. The Glow are not just a gimmick as the pulsating light can make an individual substantially more visible (to cars etc.) when out at night.    From the manufacturer -  Premium sound with ultimate expression.  Glow lights up with vibrant laser technology that pulsates to your favorite music. Use the Glow App for iOS or Android to control the laser intensity, so you can go bold or subtle depending on your mood.  Beautiful and brilliant, Glow is the only headphone illuminated by Fibrance light diffusing fiber designed by Corning to conduct pure, radiant laser light that pulses to your music.   The intuitive touch button design lets you respond to texts, snap pictures and use voice commands to stay connected like no other headphone.

    "transcript": "\"Yo Ryan, can we film that or no?\" Background: No idea.. Lew: Hehhehhehhehhehheh... Headphones. Make a lot of videos about headphones. They're very popular, part of your style. Sound is important too, But the thing is, how do you differentiate yourself? Everybody's got some Beats on, or they got Apple EarPods, you're trying to take it to some different place.. If you're trying to stand out, you're not gonna see these every day. They call it Glow, and they're the world's first laser headphones. Whatever that means. The cords actually are, like they're bright, they glow at night. If you're a jogger, a biker late at night, now you've got the protection of being more visible. So what do we got here? Alright, back of the box: \"See the rhythm: The laser light in the glow headphones pulsates to the beat of the music.\" That's cool. \"The brightest headphones around: Glow in the world's first product to use Fibrance: a special light-diffusing fiber from Corning, the same folks who make Gorilla Glass!\" Jack and I use a Corning cable, optical cable, to share a Thunderbolt drive, so there you go, Corning ... we're in a family, apparently. Give me a call, Corning. They do come in different colors, I believe. These ones are blue and also, they are not cheap. Anything like this that's a \"world's first\" is almost always gonna be somewhat expensive, so.. Ooh, be bold, be SEEN! You get this cool case, I guess that's a place to keep them even after the fact, I would think so, you're not gonna throw that out. A microUSB cable with, like, the half-style USB on the other end. Earbud-style pieces, and there's also the earhook-style. If you're a guy like Jack, with th-the giant, like, the very, like, the large-sized ears.. Probably none of these will work for you. There's an app to go with it, Android and iOS, okay cool... Padded travel case, and a little bag inside as well. Ooh. Okay. You can see on the inside here, they're clear and then there's these exposed, obviously fiber-optic wires, and those are gonna be the things that glow. So fiber-optics, not just good for data transmission and fast Internet connections, but also for being flamboyant on the street. Now the cable stops at this controller here, and then this terminates into a braided 3.5mm cable. This section here has a clip on it. A switch here for turning the unit on and o- OOOOH, I saw some glow. Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm getting pumped up now. That's a pretty nice fit. It, it's an ear-canal style, so there's pretty decent isolation. So I'mma play some music, hold up. Oh my goodness. You wan' dim some lights? Can I just say, like side note, not just flashy but they sound good. I'm glad they didn't half-step it, these sound way better than a stock earbud. Yep, remote's functioning. Volume up, volume down, functioning perfectly. (music) There are different glow modes here: It can glow to the music, it can pulsate.. Just 'cuz.. It can be constantly on, and then off completely. You can also set the vibrance of it; low, medium, high.. GLOW NOTIFICATIONS! That's cool! Ooh. (music) They call themselves \"Glow\". They're headphones that glow. How can you hate on that? You add a little glow to your headphones, and next thing you know you're making a left when you used to make a right. Talking to, uh, strange women, that you otherwise would've passed by.",

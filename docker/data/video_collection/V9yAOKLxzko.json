In April 2022, the Verge went down to Brownsville, Texas to meet some of Elon Musks most ardent fans and to try and understand the magnetism behind this project.

    "transcript": "(crickets chirping) (slow ambient music) - [Peter] I wake up five times a night and stare out my window and that's all lit up and that amazes me. I feel like I'm in the middle of, yeah, science fiction. (Slow technical music) - [Speaker 1] It's known as the southernmost tip of Texas, home to diverse wildlife and soon, the Rio Grande Valley, may be at the forefront of space exploration. - [Speaker 2] Elon Musk recently said this launch site will be used to launch the rockets he hopes to one day land on Mars. - [Elon Musk] I think we gotta protect the outside here, and try to build that city on Mars as soon as possible, and secure the future of life. - [SpaceX Fan] The bonfire on the beach, like in origination, I'd say was the first, the first - [Nic] I, and many other people like me, have come down here because of SpaceX. - [Peter] I think we're witnessing history. - [Louis] It Literally pointed the camera in this direction, and the following day, I had thousands of people watching. - [Speaker 3] We're back now with that backup plan for SpaceX, Boca Chica operations. Elon Musk may not be launching from star base after all - [Speaker 4] He's talking about moving more of these operations over to Florida. - [Anthony] And I've wondered like what happens if it all comes crashing down and I don't even want to think about that. I feel like that that would take away so much hope. - [Loren] Right now we're driving into Boca Chica. It's a small area just on the border of Mexico and Texas where SpaceX has set up its massive Star Base facility. - [Elon Musk] Welcome to Star Base. - [Loren] In February, I came down to see Elon Musk give a presentation about Starship. When I was here, I stayed at this place called Rocket Ranch, and I was very enamored with the community that's kind of risen up in the area. I've met a lot of people that have kind of uprooted their lives to come be near what SpaceX is doing. They don't work for SpaceX. They just wanna be near here, or they're documenting what they're doing, or they're capitalizing on what they're doing. That feels like a very drastic move. Especially when SpaceX's presence here is kind of tenuous at the moment. - [Speaker 5] SpaceX Is under review by the Federal Aviation Administration. The SpaceX launch site is surrounded on all sides by protective wildlife properties. - [Speaker 6] Some environmentalists are concerned about the long term damage. - [Loren] So the fate of Boca Chica is kind of in the balance at the moment. - [Anthony] Well, let's start with the circus tour. That's a C O P V tank by the way. So that might have landed here at some point. - [Loren] Really? Wait from a launch? - [Anthony] Oh, maybe. - [Loren] Oh my God, alright. Anthony Gomez moved here from Florida and manages Rocket Ranch. It's become something of a base camp for visiting SpaceX super fans. - [Anthony] And a lot of us that are here are, you know, didn't have a place to really call home when we got to Brownsville. We're from other places, we're trying to make this place our home too. These are the people that are definitely like at home talking about like Tesla and Dogecoin and Elon Musk. And like people are just so tired of hearing that conversation. It's really kind of like a hub for dorks and we can really share our love for this place. We're certainly a venue for, you know, the last children of star base. (Applause) I think we have 25 here. Actually, that's pretty low number for these tours, we usually have 50 folks. So it gets filled up. - [Loren] These days, Star base is too quiet to attract many overnight visitors to the ranch. So Anthony operates bus tours of the facility to help get by. - [Anthony] All right, they're on their way. Here come the kids. Everybody, welcome to the historic Rio Grande valley. It is non-poetic that we are in a frontier. I mean, Mexico is right in front of us and it's non-poetic that we have this new frontier of space, that's just down the street from us. We have our production facility coming up on our left and we'll be rolling up into that site in just a few moments, folks. Welcome to star base. This week is very important. There is currently environmental assessment that's taking place in this entire area to determine the ability of of SpaceX's mission out here. Whether or not it's gonna be too dangerous to have out here or whether or not it's gonna land humans on Mars. One day, we're all gonna find out. So what we're seeing today is very privileged. No one's ever gotten this close on public to rockets that are currently being developed. This is the world's most advanced rocket being developed down the street in Brownsville. I often refer to it as a religious experience and it's not that far off. I personally believe this is somewhat like Noah's arc. I mean, this is the ship that's gonna allow us to take those first steps into space. All right, folks, this is our outpost observation area. You're welcome to walk around. This is what we are gonna be seeing the lunges from. You're welcome to join us if you buy a ticket - [Man] But you don't know when the next launch is. - [Anthony] We can expect to have information on that in the next 40, 24 hours. So we'll find out what the result of the environmental study that's being addressed by the FAA in the next 24 hours. And then at that point, they'll determine whether this whole project is a go or not. The future of this site is actually at jeopardy. You know, this potentially might be the last tour. We don't know, they could close this whole damn place down. - [Loren] The way people talk about Star Base, SpaceX fans. Anyway, they kind of have this magnetism toward it as if they are meant to be here. Like it's some kind of religious experience for them. - [Peter] I came here for the rockets the first few weeks I was here. I literally slept on the beach in a lawn chair cause I didn't have this trailer. This is a really light trailer. I bought it just for this beach. I bought it just so I could drag it out here and just watch future happen. - [Olga] So when I go, come from the other side of the planet just to catch this inspiration. So you say in science I trust and this is truth. - [Peter] We've camped here for two weeks. I met Olga right here on the beach. It's become a community. - [Olga] And this is my last art project because Kali, it's one of my nicknames and I won a RA for Mars. And I won RA for Mars And I need the support from the people to RA for Mars because somehow I have to get there. And basically I would not like to ask money from Elon Musk because I would like to help him. - [Broadcasting Voice] Loud imminence from the orbital path. - [Loren] With SpaceX, they're very open about what they're doing. Where they test until they basically blow things up. I think that's very alluring to people because they can see what SpaceX is doing. They feel like they're along for the ride, and they feel like these big ambitious things like going to the moon, going to Mars are right around the corner rather than decades off into the future. - [Louis] If I'm not sleeping, I'm working. SpaceX has taken every nook and cranny of my life. For instance, last night I got a call around midnight. Oh, can you focus in on the camera, on the Sentinel camera? They're they're testing the, the gantry cranes. And can you zoom in over there and get a tighter shot? It can be a little cumbersome and a little irritating sometimes, but I love my community. I like bringing it to them. So I do what I gotta do to keep them happy. You know, originally my YouTube channel was just all about spring break stuff, looking at bikinis looking at pool parties and stuff like that. I was always looking to pump up my subscribers and viewership. And as soon as SpaceX started testing I watched on the news and saw that they were getting ready to do the, the hopper test. And so I said, well, let me move the camera over there. See what happens immediately. People just started watching and piling in by the hundreds. Then within 24 hours, I went from having about 900 subscribers to thousands every month. It was, I think, my biggest month was like 17,000 subscribers in one month. Once everybody saw, everybody wanted a part of it, piece of the pie. And next thing you know, we have tons of people out here every day, taking photos, live videos - [Nic] I'm out in the elements all day, every day. So I try not to get the nicest gear out there but I get nice gear from a few years ago. I worked for NASA space flight.com the independent media organization where we cover everything and anything about space. Yeah. So this is, I don't know, just a medium shot of ship 20 and booster four in the background. I came down here once for a for a week last summer thinking I was just gonna be down here for a little vacation. It was addicting and I couldn't leave. I actually ended up camping on the beach. It was probably the best six weeks of my life. I make sure that whatever I take is posted and, and consumed within a few minutes to keep things nice and fresh. Cause who likes moldy bananas? I don't like moldy bananas. Always gotta watch the views here and make sure you're not missing anything while you're driving back. - [Louis] We haven't had a launch in almost a year now and we've lost a lot of viewership. It's a little disheartening to see people leave but I know eventually they'll be back. Especially when things start to ramp up again, they'll be back. - [Loren] What, what would happen? How would you feel if SpaceX said, okay Boca Chi is not happening. We're going to Cape Canaveral instead. Or they just completely stop Starship. - [Louis] I'd probably vomit. (Laughter) Everybody's ready for another launch. Everybody's tired of waiting. So everybody's wants to see that rocket go up in the air again. We all wanna see it go up in the air again. Feel that rumble in our chests. My main ambition is to stream from space. Whether it's from a spacecraft, the moon or Mars, I want to be in orbit somewhere, live streaming, or even just recording video from up there. Here on Earth I think I've accomplished what I've set to do of bringing all this live views to the world. Things come together pretty nicely. - [Nic] So this was the spot I moved down here and I stayed at this spot because of that view. I mean, who wouldn't want to be? I mean, are you not entertained? This is gorgeous. I lost a hundred pounds cause I didn't eat because it was just so exciting. And there's just so much stimulation and so much happening that I literally forgot to eat. So who needs a personal life? I don't have a personal life. My friends are my coworkers out here and every one of them will tell you, I don't have a personal life. I like to say I'm recording history being made. We'll see if this even hits history books, but hopefully it does. - [Stephanie] Everyone pretty much knows me at this point. I'm the, the bird lady, a crazy person that walks around these flats all the time. We used to have, you know half a dozen or more pairs of snowy plovers. And Wilson's plovers that nested in this area directly across from the launchpad. And over the years that number has dropped down to last year and this year where we've only had one pair. Yeah. I see the adult over there right in the road there. She's trying to lure us away from her nest. - [Loren] Oh really? - [Stephanie] Yeah. So it should be right up here. So the nest is right here. It's got three eggs. I don't see any signs of hatching yet, snap a quick picture. Just so I know where this nest is next time and I can come check on it. People have confused me for SpaceX enthusiast every once in a while. Think I'm one of them, but I'm like, no I don't want anything to do with this. I'm just trying to count the birds. I don't have anything against space travel, space exploration. I just wish it wasn't happening here. (Boat turning over) - [Anthony] Hold on to your butts. The FAA might take this away tomorrow but we're here now and we can walk up to Starship and we can relish in the time that we have as a community. I've made so many friends here, you know? Yeah. There's a little bit of fanaticism with all these people, right. I'm sure you guys have interviewed everybody that's down here has come off super culty or some form of like use the future like that kind of shit. But when everybody feels that way, who cares? - [Loren] Do you think you would feel this way if it was another US space company like United launch Alliance or Blue Origin? - [Anthony] That's funny. I have had that argument with myself and I have to be objective because I do have a bias. And I have to be aware of that. And you know, I'm not ridiculous about it obviously. Like I feel like if it was, Bezos doing this, I don't think they're far enough. I just have faith in Elon Musk and the things that he's done. I love this place. It's beautiful. I don't want concrete everywhere. I came here because I grew up in a city. This place is fantastic. Why would I want to destroy this? I want to preserve it. I don't want to destroy that, but I certainly don't want be trapped in a place that I can't leave. You know, ever. - [Loren] You feel trapped on earth? - [Anthony] I think we've been grown to feel accustomed to the fact that we're trapped on earth. You know, anything can happen. We have looming wars and people that are willing to destroy the entire world, happening right now. Like, that's totally possible. And I wanna live in a world where there's at least a life raft. - [Loren] I have to admit, it's probably the best view anyone's gonna get when this thing launches. - [Anthony] Yeah, I'd be very heartbroken. If this went very poorly, I feel like it would be the death of exploration and the death of that would be sad to me. - [Loren] You know, why is it so important to you that we send humans to other worlds and potentially have them living there? - [Anthony] I think that it's important to not lose the story of humanity. I think it's worthy of being told elsewhere, so that we can learn from the the mistakes that we've made here. We have made many mistakes. So I think working on something Albeit something that's relatively morbid. Like, you know, we might be done. I think that working on that problem allows us to focus on the fact that life is precious. And we do have this really rare circumstance where we reside in this perfect ball that we're ruining on a regular basis. The fact that it could be taken away because people are greedy, and because people, they don't care about their own environment. They don't care about their own neighborhoods. - [Loren] That argument could be made about SpaceX where they are getting greedy. And they're taking over an environment that we're trying to preserve. - [Anthony] That's a good point. I don't know how much I could argue with that. I'd like to think that they're on my team so I feel better about it. Oh no. Hold on. Lauren has news. This is where I get to find this out. It's gonna be delayed again. Saw that coming. Another month, dude. Jesus Christ. Yikes. Wow. Keep going. Just keep going forward. Like Nick does these bonfires out here and we go out and just hang out and talk crap and have a good time with it. - [Nic] That's alright. Yeah. Busy day to day. Doing other stuff besides SpaceX. - [Anthony] (sarcastically) That exists? Does it? I'm pretty sure that's all just part of the simulation this is the real stuff. - [Peter] I watched everything. I mean, continuously, I watched your broadcast. - [Louis] Every once in a while I checked in on the FA website and the saw the damaging news. (Laughter) - [Anthony] It'll happen at some point, I believe. I seem to think, right? I hope it does. Yeah. I wasn't in the greatest place for a second but it's like, what are you gonna do? It's like you know, yes, you're right. There has to be due diligence in the environment. We have to make sure that it's good. We have to make sure that it's safe. We have to make sure that it's not gonna blow windows away. I get it. (Overlapping talking) - [Nic] What's not to love about this? When you have a group of people who is passionate about what's going on down here and just hanging out. - [Anthony] Yeah. I still can't believe this is going on in our backyard. This is awesome. You know? Wouldn't have it any other way. (Overlapping talking) - [Nic] But the fact that this thing is like our neighbor it's the elephant in the room. It's always there. It's our friend that's in the corner. It's just hanging out, looking over us and it feels pretty special.",

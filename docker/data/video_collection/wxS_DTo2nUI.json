    "transcript": "- Deep Learning Super Sampling. This probably sounds like some kind of hokey way to balance your energy field or something. But, it's actually a new AI powered method from Nvidia to make your games look better. Now, you might have already been familiar with traditional super sampling. That is when your graphics cards renders frames at a higher resolution than what your monitor can support, but then down scales the image to fit your display. Although it's very computationally taxing, it can provide a significant quality boost that other anti-aliasing methods may not be able to achieve. DLSS however, is quite different than standard super sampling, and it's actually less demanding on your GPU. Instead of simply forcing your GPU to render higher resolution frames from scratch, it uses a neural network to predict what the frame should look like. The neural network is trained by an Nvidia supercomputer that feeds it correct frames from certain games to help it learn how to generate extra pixels accurately. These correct frames are actually 16K images, so the AI will have a very granular level of detail to learn from. The AI model is then sent to your GPU via driver updates, so it can be run locally. The idea here is that it's easier for your GPU to run this neural network when you're playing a graphically intense game running at a low frame rate than it is to keep drawing new frames from scratch. Regardless of how difficult the game is to run, DLSS uses a fixed amount of time per frame, so it often doesn't take as long for your GPU to spit out a DLSS a specific frame as it does to render one the old fashioned way. Practically thanks to newer RTX GPUs having specialized tensor cores that are supposed to be optimized for running AI. They kind of are. And a new version DLSS 2.0 was recently rolled out and features a few key improvements. For starters, DLSS 2.0 aims to provide near native resolution quality while the GPU renders well under half the pixels it would otherwise need to handle. There are also efficiency improvements to the neural network that should help it process images faster, ultimately boosting frame rates. Another big strength is that now the neural network is much more generalized. Instead of needing to separately train it for every game Nvidia now uses more general visual content that's supposed to be more representative of a variety of different games, which means improvements can be delivered to users more quickly and more games will end up supporting DLSS. Users can now decide how much they want to utilize DLSS technology rather than just leaving it completely up to the GPU and driver. Gamers can now choose between three modes range quality, prioritizing either a greater image quality or higher frame rates. The benefits of all of this can mostly been seen when looking at the finer details at a scene. Not just at the edges of objects where you traditionally see jaggies if the anti-aliasing isn't up to par. Things like text, chain link fences and details on faraway buildings should be a lot clearer with the DLSS without gamebreaking slowdowns. And in some cases, DLSS even appears to be able to make visual elements look more detailed than they even would be with native resolution despite rendering fewer pixels from scratch. If the AI figures out how to enhance a texture or shadow to a greater extent than what the gamer's code originally calls for. Of course with other parts of an image it might still be inferior to standard rendering. But the hope is as processing power increases, and the algorithm continues to be fine tuned, it'll become easier and easier to run more and more games at buttery smooth frame rates without compromising quality. Maybe it'll be just as smooth as this segue in today's (grinning) (laughing) FreshBooks allows you to easily manage your back end processes so that you can spend more time focusing on your main business.

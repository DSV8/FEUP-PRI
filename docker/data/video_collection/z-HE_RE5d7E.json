    "transcript": "- Windows 11 is a free upgrade, but why isn't Microsoft charging money for the base license? Well, it's because they don't need to, baby. Microsoft already makes tons of money off Windows licenses they sell to computer manufacturers like Dell and HP that end up getting pre-installed on PCs that you buy at the big box store, as well as off enterprises that have to pay for Windows to be installed on their entire fleet of computers. On top of that, Microsoft gets revenue from the purchases that you make in the Microsoft Store and from advertising their own products within Windows. So it's all about getting the consumer into the Microsoft ecosystem, which is more valuable than having people pay extra for a windows license in the first place, sorta like Apple in a way, but they make you pay all the time.",

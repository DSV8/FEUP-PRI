    "transcript": "hmm what is better than a single system in a single case two systems in a single case that's right so today we're finally building my dual system inside the Evolv X I'm not gonna lie but I will miss the super compact and elegant nature of what I've been using so far the Streamcom da2 make sure to check out that video right over here but in my space it fits perfectly well and I think it's time to upgrade the case to a mid Tower just for fun alright so here's the situation currently my 9900K system with the RTX 2080 ti are inside the Silent Base 601 and my intent here is to keep all the same hardware and cooling even the fans and just transfer them over into the Evolv X and then I want to take all my ITX hardware with 8600K and the Titan XP this is what I've been using to render videos and put it as a second system inside the evolv X because this has a ITX slot above your main ATX motherboard area is gonna go up up there and I'm hoping I will not encounter any compatibility issues with the coolers because I intend to keep the giant knocked or cooler so I do have a few concerns about this whole dual system configuration 1 are the temperatures I'm gonna have a lot of hardware in there that's running hot the GPUs is the Titan XP and the RTX 2080 ti based on my review the GPU temperatures are really hot so I'm just curious if I'll just have to keep the the side panel open and number 2 is actually using the dual system configuration for my workflow now the thing is I've never done a dual system configuration in the past and I'm having a hard time figuring out on how to utilize it so if you have any suggestions on what I could do with the second system please let me know or any helpful feedback that I could potentially take for the next part of this project that would be appreciated and of course the thing I'm most excited about is actually utilizing this really powerful hardware for video production you know I've been on this 6 course 6 thread part and I'm really powerful GPU but we're moving to the 9900K and the rtx 2080 TI for video production I'm hoping that would be a nice little upgrade now the reason why I've been delaying this project for a while now is because I've been waiting for this the evolv X power supply from Phanteks this thing can power two systems so you don't need a power splitter you don't need any additional accessories everything is sort of built in here because has dual 24 pin dual eight pin it's also 80 plus platinum efficiency which is awesome and it's 1200 watts so plenty of juice there for the 9900K the 8600K and those dual GPUs and I think I'll have six SSDs and is always nerve-racking doing a complete rebuild of my main production machine because usually you know I have that as like station everything that's always running and I'm working with other hardware and what I've been told so far is that at least one of the system has to use an all-in-one cooler or some form of water cooling or a really low profile air cooler but here I'm sticking with 8600K so need something you know that has nice cooling capacity for that chip and power outage good thing I have these I go through the disassembly procedure on every single case video that we do and you know with the Silent Base 601 that was a pretty simple operation with this big ATX enclosure however with this unique to where everything is attached to be eclipsed and I have to disassemble it that is what I'm not looking forward hey the powers back let's resume the assembly so my first order of business is trying to figure out how cable management would work for both systems and more importantly figure out the compatibility for the height of the CPU cooler or the pump for the ITX motherboard all right one two and three no luck now obviously I expect the hiccups but given my current situation I might have to rethink some things and so as I expected this pump is just a little bit too tall to pass the clearance for you know this massive Noctua cooler of course they've had an old one cooler for this ATX motherboard I would have no issues with the top room but I'll substitute it for the low profile be quiet silent loop 360 it is a 360 rad that I was planning to put in the front anyway so this kind of works out well okay so the ITX mount is installed onto the top fan bracket and you have to insert it from the bottom not from the top which is unfortunate this would be much easier installation if you could just insert the ITX motherboard from the top but that's not possible the power button for the i/o is right over here and the i/o slightly pushed back so there's a little bit of spacing in between the frame and the i/o not really a big issue and as you can see there is a little bit of clearance between the motherboard backplate and the frame which means that if you have any nvme SSDs or like M.2 mounts behind the motherboard tray this is fine however as you can see the fan bracket doesn't really allow access for the cooler so like I have to remove the motherboard in order to install any cooling the clearance here is very tight so I'm thinking I have to put this in rout all the cables and install the cooler and then mount my ATX motherboard because otherwise it will be a pretty big challenge and so this is where I am right now there were no issues mounting the pump but the tubing it's not exactly low profile so I cannot rotate the pump for the tubes to exit on that side because it just interferes with the CPU tower so I had to remove the middle fan on the cooler in order to have the tubes kind of like pass through here a little bit bend / and then just kind of manure the back so this way it gives me enough length for the tube so I can mount the radio to the front of the frame but of course another option is to go with a different all-in-one cooler so this corsair h150i and it has a low-profile pump and tubes that also exit from the side therefore not interfering with my cpu tower heatsink but then I'm thinking if I have a 360 right at the front it will warm up and block a lot of the airflow that's coming for the main ATX system which is what I'm more concerned about and also I don't want to lose the middle fan on the main knocked or cooler so instead of going the 360 route I'm decided to go the other route of still having three fans at the front but for the ITX system going with a really low profile CPU tower so this entire duel system configuration will be air-cooled and I'm hoping that's not the big compromise for the 8600K it'll still have a nice powerful GPU but I might have to down clog the 4.8 overclocked to something a little bit more than you know compatible with this little guy now I know this looks a bit unconventional I'm not worried about this configuration temperatures on this car they're fine this cooler is pretty capable I am worried about temperatures on the 8600K but the compromise there is the ease of assembly and cable management so when I populate this in I can rather there's no problem and then when I put this back in you know it's not going to interfere with anything that's above it which is which is a positive but of course I think I'll get hotter temperatures on this little guy so let's populate the rest of the fans and the rest of the hardware and hopefully our temperatures are not complete so this Evolv X power supply is pretty interesting because for one for a 1200 watt unit it's pretty compact lovely aluminum based over here and for your connections we have a pretty interesting row over here for system 1 and system 2 I mean it's pretty good for just closing these rear panels I could make it better but I am more interested to see if this thing actually boots okay well look what we have here is basically booted on the first try I had to just readjust one of the 24 pin connectors on the power supply because the second system was not booting but after a little troubleshooting right now about that five on my main 9900K RTX 2080 ti system and just changing the input here we're gonna go back to the ITX system and we've got youtube full audio everything is working fine not bad at all the next thing to do would be color coordination so it's not an ugly piece of you know there's so much horsepower in it and I want to showcase that a little bit and I know it's a bit difficult doing any color coordination with the Brown fans but going orange is always an option however my Jedi Order Titan XP is not RGB so that's green so I'm gonna try and explore my options over here but yeah should be fun all right good people so have you worked in the evolv X for the second time now and configuring my dual assistant build I can say that you know if you're going that route be prepared to pay the extra for those accessories like the ITX motherboard mount the riser cable that's necessary if you're mounting a GPU for that ITX system above it and also the power supply because this one has no dual power supply mounts so you have to go with the Evolv X or some other power supply and buying the power supply splitter from fantex so that whole approach definitely requires many many add-ons on top of that pun intended the entire clearance above the ATX motherboard is I think a little bit too tight right now it's cool because you cannot tell there's a second system installed but with it comes a really difficult assembly process because for me to access that ITX motherboard now would mean I have to remove that entire ATX portion because the installation of the motherboard is from the bottom and not from the top of course the heat will get trapped in that corner so definitely again targeted to water cooling getting the heat away via tubes to your radiators and in terms of my temperatures I haven't done full extensive testing the ATX system is perfectly fine the GPU is fine as well but having to close the side panels yet and I'm afraid that the top system with that time a cooler for the 8600K will get toasty because at idle it is running around 50 degrees Celsius and so that is an issue and I'll definitely have to lower my overclock now a very interesting visual observation you can see because of the upside-down motherboard is the RAM here I have installed team groups nighthawk memory in white which looks pretty cool beautiful RGB illumination but it also gives you the opportunity to match the memory on the ATX motherboard side of things for that really cool cohesive look just something to keep in mind and my last comment would be about the cable management and how easy it was to route everything you know with the additional 24 pin and the 8 pin connections they don't really add too much bulk to the rear of the chassis plus add in those plates that close everything fine I did not even have to use a zip tie which is great and now I'm going to spend some time actually using this dual system configuration to get into the mindset of a potential buyer of what they might use this for you know dual systems I don't even know what I'm gonna do with it now that I have this really powerful ATX system but we shall see should be fun improve your workflow it stream deck mini by Elgato giving you six fully customizable LCD keys for macro commands hotkeys app launches media control and the full array customization for OBS Twitch xsplit and more check out the stream deck MIDI down below alright guys I hope you enjoyed make sure to stick around for part two where we'll discuss temperatures my full experience down the line and yeah check out the southern relevant content subscribe to on your boot sequence channel I'll see you next video this is the part where I say as always stay do all my friends you",

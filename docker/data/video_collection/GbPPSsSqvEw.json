    "transcript": "alright what's up guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks ah come on what's are you kidding me guys this is only good for taking notes man geez you know what forget about the sponsored stuff you know I have something more exciting which is this right here the 3950X let's do it we've all been waiting for this day and so have I in fact after a lot of teases from AMD were finally allowed to talk about the Ryzen 9 3950X performance now I'll be honest with you guys I'm super excited about this processor because it offers a ton of cores and threads but most importantly it feels like it hits the final nail in the coffin for intel's high-end crazy pricing that's because the 3950x goes for around $750 while offering 32 threads on the X570 platform now that platform is a lot more affordable compared to X299 and it offers a lot of features compared to z390 so why don't we get into the performance results spoiler alert guys this CPU is really and I mean really fast but is it $750 u.s. or almost $1000 Canadian North in let's find out first a quick message from our sponsor we've all been there looking at our RAM thinking what a weakling well no longer introducing tough frame by thermal take the toughest RAM around with a discrete built in logo and premium heat spreaders design the toughest addressable LED system with super brightness compatibility with all the usual motherboard software even raise a chroma and voice control through Amazon Alexa available in the toughest capacities of 16 gigabytes per kit with speeds between 3040 400 megahertz considered the tough frame RGB link below alright so I'm gonna get into benchmarks but before that I do want to talk about the processor and what it's about just in case if you miss our coverage of it this CPU has 16 cores and 32 threads which equals the threadripper 2950X but it also operates at much higher clock speeds - other than the smaller cache size the 3950X uses the AM4 socket and X570 platform the only thing it really lacks is the thread reverse quad-channel memory support compared to the 3900X it has eight more threads and higher max boosts clock but the base frequency is also quite a bit lower to TDP is also the same the issue for some people might be pricing because the 3950X goes for 50% more than the 3900X so don't expect the same amount of performance uplift compared to that processor I think you're really paying a premium for having the fastest aim for CPU on the planet now I do want to be perfectly clear about this CPU AMD isn't targeting this for gamers whatsoever in fact it's really meant for content creators or professionals who would love to accelerate their workflow without investing huge sums of money into platforms like X299 or X399 million so with that out of the way I think it's time to get into the performance results now I do want to mention that we have replaced our testing procedure in fact we've eliminated a lot of these synthetic benchmarks and we've replaced them with more real-world use case scenarios so let's get into it generally all of our test systems are the same they're using 32 gigabytes of memory clocked at 3600 Hertz GTX 20 atti at Corsair MP 510 2 terabyte SSD and a corsair ax 860 IPS you all motherboard specific enhancements were disabled 2 for cooling a knock Toa n hu 12 as heatsink is always used except for X399 and X299 those are cooled with the Noctua n hu 14s let's start off with cinnamon and right away well the 3950X blazes ahead of pretty much everything guys even the 9980XE and the previous generation threadRipper set image are 20 conveys the same story too with the new Ryzen 9 leading everything single core benchmarks show that AMD has made huge improvements with their lightly threaded performance that's really good news since most professional apps and games don't fully stress all CPU cores all the time so that's it for our synthetic tests but now we're gonna move on to some real-world benchmarks and I think this is where it gets even more interesting starting off with blender and it really does show how good AMD's news into architecture stacks up against these super old skylake X architecture used on the 9 & 8 exe remember this is a 32 thread AMD processor literally tied with an Intel CPU with six threads I'm just gonna let that sink in for a second Mehta shape is a new program for our benchmarks it's used for taking thousands of digital images and combining them to create a 3d data basically it prefers in combination of core counts and higher sustained clock speeds and that's why we see the 9900KS KS so competitive but once again the 3950X wins even in reality capture which is a program that's a lot like meta shape since it also takes a ton of image data to compile multi-dimensional images it's super CPU intensive and the 3950X is impossible to beat again it even puts the threadripper 2950X to shame and that is impressive guys now this test is actually one of our most CPU intensive since in it we're building a version of Firefox for Windows which processes through more than 10 gigabytes of data here the 2950X wins out by a bit since its memory bandwidth and cache give it an edge the 9980XE is pretty competitive too but not for a CPU that costs way more than thousand dollars handbrake is a pretty solid test for multi-core video transcoding and here the thread repair dominates again but look at that look at the 3950X it beats the 9980XEsee again Intel should be pretty worried by now guys Premiere Pro is an interesting program since it uses the IGP in Intel's coffee like CPUs to accelerate rendering so the 9900K and KS end up on the top but the 3950X ends up being the fastest non accelerated CPUs here in DaVinci Resolve be 9900K gets another narrow win but that's because nearly all of our CPUs are slightly bottleneck by the graphics card just take that into account before you assume a super-expensive threadRipper bill will get you better results right Dmitri all right so now on to gaming performance now I'm gonna go through these really quickly but there's one thing to keep note of and that is we've run all of our tests at 1080p but the gap between the CPUs could narrow if you stepping it up to 1440p or 4k that's because the GPU would be more of a bottle ink compared to the CPU in all of these games the results are pretty close together but you can actually see that the 3950X is pretty competitive but the 3900X is actually a better less expensive option if you're building a gaming focused system main reason for that is the 3900X was able to maintain higher overall clock speeds in most titles and while it wasn't by all that much the difference did end up showing up in the charts another thing that's interesting is AMD has almost closed the gap with Intel when it comes to gaming performance even when compared to the 9900 k-series they're not quite there yet but seriously you wouldn't be able to tell the difference with your naked eyes now something I really wanted to mention is a bit of an odd claim from AMD that the 3950X was optimized for liquid cooling and I'm gonna say this right now that's just marketing PS because you don't really need an all-in-one liquid cooler to cool this processor let me explain as you can see are not to a Utah less with a single 120 millimeter fan was able to easily keep up with the NZXT kraken X 62 when cooling the 1350 X while it was under full load so unless you're looking for a more RGB goodness I'd recommend you just stick with a very good air cooler switching over to power consumption you can actually see the 3950X's overall efficiency is a big reason why it's temperatures are so good all things considered when the CPU is fully loaded it consumes about the same amount of power as the 3900X and that's pretty impressive guys alright so I think it's time to wrap up this video I am genuinely blown away by what AMD was able to deliver with the Ryzen 9950 I mean they literally bought threadripper like performance to the m4 platform for a fraction of the cost compared to their higher and CPUs I mean sure $750 is not cheap but it offers an amazing value for content creators or other folks who love taking advantage of all of those threads and chewing through their particular workflow but I also want to take a few seconds to talk about Intel because they are in a lot of trouble I think aimed he might have purposely sandbagged their early results by comparing the 3950X to the 9920x because this thing is actually competing against the 9980XE a processor that was going for a ridiculous $2,000 just a few months ago this new AMD processor has basically devalued Intel's entire high-end desktop lineup and I'm talking about the upcoming cascade Lake X here not be current CPUs the thousand-dollar core I nine ten nine eight see is only supposed to be a few percent faster than the 9980XE but that processor was spanked by this guy and that's a very big problem so I guess the last thing that needs to be accomplished by AMD is to make sure that this processor is available to buy in stores for $750 because from what we've been hearing there's going to be very limited quantities of the CPU and that could potentially lead to price gouging and yeah that could be pretty bad but otherwise this is all I've got to say to AMD Bravo just well done you've earned I think I think this is amazing this is just yeah",

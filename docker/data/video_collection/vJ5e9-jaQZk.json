    "transcript": "There are a lot of advantages to the Flipper Zero lots of features but please be aware that there are many other devices that have features similar to the Flipper Zero here's an example of a card reader let's take the Flipper Zero I'll go to 125 kilohertz RFID and I'll read this card and then what I could do is write that card and there you go it's been successfully written. Same kind of thing can be done with a card reader such as this one so I could press scan the card has been read now and then what I could do is do something similar where I write the card and there you go card has been written so very similar to the Flipper Zero. Flipper Zero however obviously has a lot of other features great little device but it does have limitations and just be aware this is not some magic device that basically changes everything. Lots of other devices have existed for a long time giving similar functionality to the Flipper Zero and in many cases even enhanced functionality compared to the Flipper Zero.",

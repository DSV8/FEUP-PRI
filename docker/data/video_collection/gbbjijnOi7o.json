    "transcript": "(\"Through The Sunset\") - Happy Birthday, Alex. - Thank you. Thank you for coming. - Yeah, I haven't talked to people in a long time, so it's weird. (mumbles) Yep. (\"Through The Sunset\") (people chatting) Jenna just said that she feels like we're on a field trip and there's no adult, but I think that I might be the eldest in the group, so I think that I might be- - It terrifies me that we're all adults. - Yeah. - But like, I don't feel... I feel like we need enough, I'm thinking that- - Mom's got the Tik Tok cuddle. (laughing) Can you just show them my look? Like, what is this? Like, I got stuff of my pocket. I got a knife in this, I mean, I'm ready. (beep) (\"I'm A Boss\") So there's a bee infestation on the island, and I don't know what to do with this information except relay it to you. I got a salad, so vlogging is so... I used to do it a lot, now I don't know how. I'm smiling but you can't tell. (laughing) (\"Childs Play\") Breathing is so weird and social distance. I've never been here, actually I haven't left the house very much at all the past couple of months, but we're gonna... Which I want to... Oh. - Every watch. - [Guide] Okay. Number 10. - Number 10. - [Guide] Right there. - [Woman] It's up, 10. - Seatbelts, everyone. - Okay. - [Man] And I do too. - Seatbelts, I don't know if this is ever gonna be posted anywhere. (laughing) - Ah! Odd state. - Well, hey, it's your preference, so... - Back they were on Justin's golf cart and double seatbelts, everybody. - Double seatbelts, honestly. - Double seatbelts, so- - All right. I gotta put my stuff down. (\"Childs Play\") Hi, we're gonna stop here, at the middle of the road. (car engine roaring) He knows. (\"Childs Play\") (car engine roaring) (feet pattering) See, see, you're doing it. - It's hard. - You're doing it. (indistinct) You're doing, look at you. You're fast. You're talented. (feet pattering) Good job. - I'm not as fast. - Okay, you can get back in now. We were testing to see if he could- - He won. - Race faster than the car. Do you, I know- - I told you. - No, you basically kept up. - No, I didn't. - Yes. You did. - [Man] I lost. - No, one other race just to see if you could run as fast, and you did it. - [Man] For how long? Like two seconds- - That long. Yeah. Congratulations. - Look, I appreciate you lifting me up, but I lost. Yeah, I kept up for like two seconds but I can't keep my endurance up for six seconds. So there's no way I was gonna beat you at full speed. - [Cameraman] Sounds like a personal problem. (laughing) - I don't know about my speed. (\"Childs Play\") See, remember that one brake that, at the One Stop sign, when you came in superhot. - And then you don't know how I'm (indistinct). - I honestly, the brakes didn't work. The brakes do not work like you need to stop like 100 yards over here, not at a high gear. - I almost hit that. - Like 20 feet before. You're absolutely (indistinct)- - I mean, like I was this close to you. Happy birthday, dear Alex Happy birthday to you (people cheering) (upbeat music) - (indistinct) Real quick, 'cause this is Jenna's camera. I did forgot to end my video. So this is it. This is the end of the video. Bye. - [Woman 2] Happy birthday, Alex. - Thanks. (laughing) - Happy birthday, Alex. - I had a lovely time today. - [Woman 2] Me too, we left the house and did something for fun. (upbeat music)",

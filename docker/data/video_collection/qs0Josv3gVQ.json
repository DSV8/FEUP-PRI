    "transcript": "Oh no. No. Within the new $3,500 Apple Vision Pro, there's a feature called Personas. It's in beta, but it's basically creating a digital avatar for you that will show up when you take video calls while wearing the Vision Pro. We're going to set them up today and see whose Persona looks the most like them. Oh my god, I'm nervous. Oh, this sucks. No. Ew. I look like my grandma. I look maybe 70 years old. My hair looks like a hat. Do I really look like this? The Personas feature is still in beta, it looks like it's got a long way to go.",

    "transcript": "Would you accept a USB charging cable from a stranger? This looks just like a standard USB cable but this is actually an O.MG cable. I could plug this in to a charger but I don't even need to do that as long as it's plugged into a phone I can do very interesting things with the O.MG cable. I've connected to the O.MG cable from my iPhone using Wi-Fi so I've connected to the O.MG Wi-Fi network I can navigate to a web browser running within the O.MG cable and then I could for instance load a script, so when I press run notice I'm not touching the Android phone but notice what happens This call cannot be completed, as your account balance is too low. So in this case I got the phone to make a phone call I haven't enabled USB debugging I haven't enabled developer options on the Android phone the O.MG cable is able to send commands to the Android phone with no extra configuration done on the Android phone",

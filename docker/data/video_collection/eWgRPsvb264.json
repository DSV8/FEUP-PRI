    "transcript": "- Do you work from home and your laptop has tracking software on it and you wanna make your boss think you're still working even though you just went to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something? God! This is a mouse jiggler. Basically, it moves the cursor on your computer so that the tracking software installed by your boss thinks that you're still working, thinks that you're still doing stuff. What, what? Where's the jiggle? I thought there was gonna be more jiggle. If that's all it's doing, why does it have to be this big? So here's one that works with your existing mouse. You just press the button, and okay. (chuckles) So how does that work? Oh, that's still just on the vertical line? Like that's all it does? Workers are just moving horizontally a lot. If your boss sucks, consider getting jiggly with it.",

    "transcript": "(bright pop music) - Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken. And today we're going to take a look at macOS 12 Monterey, but not the big features. Those smaller features you might've missed which are super handy. So let's dive in. A cool feature I noticed is you can now have the menu bar display itself in full screen mode instead of it auto hiding. You can also swap applications in the Split View without actually having to exit the Split View. Also, the QuickNote feature from iPadOS 15 is in Monterey and you can use the hot corner setting to change what corner summons the QuickNote. Also, if you want to see the episode about macOS 12 Monterey on my other much more unscripted show Krazy Ken's Tech Misadventures. Go ahead and check that out. That includes some of the bigger features and I demo them and test them out myself for the first time and you get my candid reactions in that. The visual lookup feature in iOS 15 is supposed to be in the photos app in macOS 12 Monterey but it doesn't appear to be possible in this beta yet. However, live text selection is possible. So you can select texts that's in your photographs. Another handy feature is the redesigned Go to Folder window in the finder. It kind of looks like Spotlight now and it includes autocomplete suggestions and an easily visible recents list. Also coming over from iOS is the password settings. You can now access your passwords and manage them in system preferences and iCloud for Windows is coming with the passwords application so you can manage this stuff on non-Apple devices and there will also be a Microsoft Edge extension too. And this isn't really super important, but I noticed that the sliders are more glidey in macOS 12 Monterey. Really nice. I use the Reminders app a lot but your completed items can kind of stack up over time so Monterey has a quick delete command so you can just instantly wipe out all the done items. And voice memos has a new playback feature called Skip Silence. You can play back your recordings but any time it gets quiet the play head will automatically jump to the next part where you speak. - [Voice Memo] All right, I'm just taking down some notes for today. Oh wait, forgot my pencil. Got to go get my pencil. Okay. I'm back. - Another cool feature is you can customize your mouse pointers. This is nice for accessibility, but also it's just if you want to make it look cool. And there's also Memoji on the login screen and they are animated with a lot of customization options including the ability to change your eye color per eye. And just so you have it here's a compatibility list of all officially supported Macs that can run macOS 12 Monterey and you can test the system out in July as a public beta and it will be coming out as an official final public release to everybody later in fall 2021. Let me know if you have any questions about Monterey and feel free to comment your own favorite features too because I know I didn't cover all of them. The list is actually really long. And by the way I like to do all sorts of tech things on this channel regarding new technology retro tech, rare tech, and of course, scam tech. So feel free to subscribe for new episodes coming out all the time, but until then, thanks for sticking with me. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (bright pop music)",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today we are checking out a really fun new piece of tech. This is the Insta360 Evo. You guys may be familiar with the Insta360 ONE X, which has been one of my favorite cameras this past year. I did a full review on the Insta360 ONE and I do have another one that I've been working on for the Insta360 ONE X, which is their newest version. A lot of you have seen these types of videos that I've posted on Twitter or Instagram. You guys always ask me which camera that is and this is the camera that I use to do those. And what's great is I shoot all of the content directly here on the Insta360 ONE X and I connect it to my phone and I do all of the editing right in the palm of my hand and then I post it. It is absolutely fascinating what Insta360 ONE has been doing as far as 360 is concerned because they're making it easy and accessible for basically anyone. And now what they have done with the Insta360 ONE EVO, they have made a 360 camera and a 180 camera all in one. I'll also be posting a separate video that is all entirely shot in 180. I'd love to know if any of you guys have watched any 180 content either here on YouTube or on your headsets. What I love about 180 is it is immersive but it's not entirely taking you out of where you are. It's kind of this 3D experience where you actually feel like you're there. So you can just see just enough ahead of you, to the sides, and up and down, and you don't have to worry about turning around or doing anything super crazy or mobile. So 180 is something that I do plan on exploring more of and with the introduction of this, this is gonna make it super simple. (knife crunching through box) There it is. So essentially this is creating a stereoscopic image. It's much like you're seeing things with your two eyes. You're shooting that same type of content but with two cameras side-by-side. As I had mentioned, you can shoot 180 but with a flip of the camera you now instantly have a 360 camera. This is revolutionary, revolutionary in the sense of this is something that anybody can buy. Like this isn't something that is insanely expensive, that only professionals can use. This is something that consumers are able to get. Let's see what else is in the box. Oh, this is metal. I got the cable here, little small bag. So this will allow you to shoot 5.7K 360 video and photos. So let's get this thing hooked up to my phone. Everything is super easy to connect. There it is, it's already showed up. That was it. Yes, I want to join. This is actually magic happening right now before your eyes. Hope that you're here for the show. Switch to viewer 180 mode. Oh my gosh, oh my goodness. This is so cool. So this is 180. As you can see, it goes to the edge, to each edge, and what's great about Insta360 is their software. It's what I love so much. So we're gonna close this, lock it, and now it instantly switched to 360. This seamlessly synced together. So oh my gosh, you can see the coffee cup. I'm disgusting. (laughs) And since there isn't a screen on this, you can use your phone as the viewer. You have all of the controls that you would need. I'm gonna capture a 360 photo by pressing right here. Now I'm gonna capture a 360 video. I switched it back over to video. We're gonna hit that. So right now this is a clip that I filmed on the 360 camera and, as you can see, I'm going to pan around the room. K, now we're back over here. So hi, hello. The only problem about 360 is you guys can see how dirty my desk is. (laughs) Secret's out! One of my favorite things about the Insta360 software when I'm using it on my phone and then I import this footage is you can make it any sort of size that you want. So I shoot a lot of things for Instagram Stories so I can make them vertical. You can make them square. You can make them 16 x 9. You can basically make them anything you want afterwards. (upbeat guitar music) Oh, hello, so we're shooting now in 360. I'm in Boulder, Colorado. This is actually my first time that I've ever been here. It's cold, go figure. There's snow on the ground but there's a beautiful creek behind me so I'll spin around here. There you go, there's the creek. (roaring water) And now we're gonna maybe see what 180 looks like. Get some more shots of me. I'm cold. It's always sunny where you are I know - Welcome to 180. I really don't have anything that interesting to say. My fingers are frozen. Well, the view is beautiful. I'm having a lovely time. I have a hat on. I have a phone in my pocket. I have gloves! This whole time I had gloves. Wouldn't you know? I'm at this little fishing pond. It's really bright but you might be able to see what I'm seeing on my phone. I have a connection to my phone. Look at all the ice. (playful music) It's frozen. So going back to this app you can actually put this into sort of the VR mode. So in this mode if you put this inside of like a VR headset you'll be able to see what your camera is seeing. So we'll back outta there and scroll around since this is in 180 still. One of the other things that I can't wait to show you guys, so this is a holographic case. They're calling it the Naked Eye 3D case. So what's cool about this is it's just a normal case. You can wear it, wear it. (laughs) I mean, I guess you technically wear cases, your phone does. You can use it like a normal case but when you want to watch a stereoscopic image in 3D, take this off the back of your case, put it on the front of your phone and then this will be able to give you a 3D image without wearing 3D glasses. You can't really tell at all but you can see kind of how it's giving my phone this effect. The first time that you use it, it goes through a little set up. It analyzes your face, finds out where your eyes are, and it will make sure that everything's perfectly aligned. The first time that I saw it, you guys, I was actually just, I almost hit the floor. I wish I was filming my reaction because it was incredible. My one tip for a lot of you guys if you've never experienced or shot with 180 before, the key is to try to keep it as still as possible because a lot of times when you are watching these things in headsets you want to visualize the experience as if you were sitting and watching something. So you don't wanna have a lot of movement because you want the movement to happen from the person who's watching. So if you are walking or doing any of those types of things, make it as steady as possible. Another good practice that I notice is you should try to shoot from eye level, so if you are filming something try to keep it in sort of the range that most people would probably be standing. So you don't want to be too low because it'll look like they are low to the ground. If it's too high then they'll look like they're looking down on things. Unless that is the perspective that you want so it really is I guess an artistic choice. But this is such a new thing and I think a lot of people are experimenting with it so if you've seen any other cool 180 content, please, please, please tweet it to me, leave me a comment, because I would love to check it out. Well, I just wanted to give you guys a quick little demo and an unboxing of this because this was just announced by Insta360. So I look forward to seeing what people think of it. Also very excited about going out and really getting to test this thing. Leave me some comments below. Let me know what you guys think. And I asked you a bunch of questions throughout this video so also feel free to answer those as well. Thanks for watching. I love you guys. (playful music)",

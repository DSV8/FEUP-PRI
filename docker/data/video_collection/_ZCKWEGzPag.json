    "description": "They HyperX Alloy Origins keyboard might look like your standard gaming keyboard but it hides something pretty unique: a new key switch.  Dubbed the HyperX Red, it is a linear mechanical switch that feels a lot like a Gateron Red.  Let's take a closer look!

    "transcript": "well hello good people I'm Dimitri we just got to HyperX it's a rainy day outside but beautiful on the inside and HyperX is branching out with their own mechanical switches which is pretty awesome I wish they have many mechanical keyboards but them making their own switch is very exciting and they have a new headset and audio is really part of their identity so let's go check it out but huge thanks to Phanteks and SteelSeries for making our Computex possible all right so it looks like dimitri isn't really interested in taking a closer look at the new keyboard and the headset so he just passed over that to me but i'm actually excited to go over them i don't know what you're doing man but none of the less I've been using HyperX keyboard in the past you certainly have and I've enjoyed them I mean you certainly have enjoyed them I love their headsets they're great and I'm assuming that a lot of you guys are actually interested in what they're offering for now especially with the mechanical keyboard that you know they've designed basically a new switch which is really interesting now at first glance the design of the alloy origins looks very familiar to the original alloy FPS keyboard so it's the same compact design with the aluminum frame and the plastic body underneath unfortunately there isn't a TKL version of this keyboard the cable is removable as the original variant but this time they've switched over to USB type-c which is very refreshing to see on a keyboard now there isn't a detachable wrist rest included with this keyboard and it sort of makes sense because HyperX originally designed the alloy fps and the alloy origins to people who are really looking for a relatively portable keyboard especially for eSport gamers or someone who's you know thinking about getting a full sized mechanical keyboard that's fairly portable now the main highlight of the origins is the introduction of the HyperX red switch not to be confused with Cherry MX so it still requires 45 grams of actuation force just like the MX Reds but the actuation point is at one point eight millimeters versus two millimeters with a shorter travel distance they're also rated for up to 80 million clicks so certainly a lot more durable than cherry now after spending a short time playing around with it I actually really enjoyed this key design coming to think of it they did feel a lot more like Gator on gret switches although HyperX you know they don't claim that they've partnered up with gator on in this case but either way I really liked it and I can't to get my hands on it to give you guys sort of my full kind of experience using this keyboard RGB lighting is here as always that's more dynamic with consistent spill across the frame it's also fairly brighter which is nice now there are three onboard profiles built-in for on-the-go lighting and macro settings and it also has support for the ingenuity software so you can customize perky lighting which is nice pricing is not available yet and HyperX wouldn't mention if these new switches would cost more or less than cherry equivalents personally I'm hoping that the origins will be less since the Gator on switches cost less than cherry switches and like I said the new HyperX red switches feel a lot like gear now moving on to the cloud alpha gaming headset I do remember taking a look at the cloud alpha a little while ago and if you're interested in checking that out link will be right over here but I really enjoyed you know what that had said offered especially for the price point it was super comfortable I mean the build quality was fantastic and the dual chamber driver design was just fabulous now this is the Alpha s that takes that formula and adds a few upgraded features now it isn't meant to replace the original alpha but it is more expensive unfortunately HyperX didn't tell us how much it's gonna cost but you can expect it to be a little north of a hundred dollars when you look at the driver design it nothing really has changed with the Alpha s I mean you still get the same dual chamber drivers there's also the same removable microphone setup as well as the removable cable as well but there is a minor change here you actually get an included or an additional virtual 7.1 surround sound inline control box that includes you know your audio and game chat balance controls now interestingly enough you'll find bass slider adjustments on each ear cups for some reason and I don't think a lot of people will actually take advantage of something like this I do like the overall design of this headset I mean first of all I do love the blue accents it's certainly a step you know different is step back from the whole red and black design that hyperox is going for in the first place so I really appreciate that but that about wraps up our coverage of HyperX let me know what you guys think about the alloy origins keyboard as well as the alpha s I'm actually more particularly interested on the keyboard because of the new switches that HyperX has designed which are the brett switches again like i said they do feel a lot familiar like gator on reds and I'm liking you know the overall feel of it so yeah let me know what you guys think about it in the comments down below i'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out

    "description": "Its time to submit another piece of tech to the ultimate test of waterproofing. The J&L Speaker can be found HERE:  with $10 discount code: 7GYZVQSL  Many pieces of technology claim to be 'Water Resistant' and then hope that customers will subconsciously think 'waterproof' when in reality those two terms are very different.  Luckily, this speaker has some beastly waterproofing measures taken against liquid. I would trust this speaker more than I would the iPhone or Samsung phones around water.   Let me know what you think! Would you sink your speaker or phone? or would you use the waterproofing as an extra layer of protection?

    "transcript": "What makes a speaker waterproof? I've analyzed several water resistant phones here on my channel, and now its time to see how a wireless bluetooth speaker can survive against liquid. [Intro] This rugged speaker claims an IPX 7 rating, same as the new apple watch, it can be submersed under water up to 1 meter for 30 minutes, but lets see if we can actually trust that. The outer materials are a combination of metal speaker grills, plastic frame, and a super thick rubber layer around the outside. The first visible defense against water is the incredibly thick charging port flap. This speaker has an internal battery that powers itself, as well as charges other devices, just like a powerbank. Luckily there is another layer of waterproofing around the ports on the inside of the speaker, and Ill show you that in just a second. Four Philips screws are holding on the decorative plastic face plate against the metal grill. I say decorative because it has no structural functionality. The waterproofing starts below this layer. There are four more screws that are offset to the original four that we just removed. And theses screws have a thick rubber layer over the tip that was dripped in on top of the screw to plug the screw holes. Pretty smart way to block water entry. After those screws are removed the speaker can lift off from the body, and here we can see a rubber washer along the lip. The four screws we just removed pull the plastic top tight against this rubber ring on the inside to make a water tight seal with the rest of the body. Ill disconnect the two speaker wires, and then I see three screws holding the speaker into the grill. There is a shiny strip of black rubberlike material sealing the edge of the speaker to the plastic. You can see it stretch and pull of with each screw that I remove. I have a feeling this speaker isnt going to be waterproof again when I finally put it all back together After the screws and black seal is are gone, the speaker freely falls out from the plastic frame. The metal grill has obvious holes in it, so air and water can freely enter. So the speaker needs to do all the work to keep the water out. In some speakers, the cone, or diaphragm, is made of thick paper, cloth, or another permeable material. Some subwoofers use a plastic cone, and it looks like that is the case with this particular speaker. The actual speaker component was the part I was most curious about, Plastic will not allow water to pass through it. And the rubber surround, or 'suspension' is also impermeable. Water will never soak through the plastic cone like it would with a cloth or paper speaker. Definitely gets a thumbs up for that. When I get a water resistant piece of tech to test, I always see if the board is coated with a hydrophobic spray. And this board is not. So, if by chance some water does get inside your speaker, it would get roasted. Maybe not immediately... water damage sometimes takes awhile for the corrosion to set in and take over. H2o is the cancer of the electronic world. Hopefully the rest of the water barriers will do their job. And you'll be just fine. Now there are two more screws that are holding down the shroud for the charging port and USB slot. It has the same rubber sealant all around the edges tjat we saw on top of those screws, and is really just a second layer of waterproofing under that thick rubber charging port flap that we saw earlier. Dual layers of waterproofing is always better than one. Under the circuit board we find the 1450 mAh battery that powers the 5w speaker. Its also a portable power bank, and can charge other devices on the go. But it looks like the battery is soldered in. To summarize, this portable speaker is waterproof because of its beastly housing, lots of glue and rubber, and plastic speaker cones. So as long as it doesnt go deeper than a meter in water, it should be fine. The waterproof reviews of the iPhone 7 and galaxy phones can be found in my ultimate waterproof test playlist. I feel much safer using this inexpensive portable speaker around water, than I would with my more expensive iPhone or Samsung. Thanks a ton for watching. Ill see you around.",

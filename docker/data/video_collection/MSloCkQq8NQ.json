    "transcript": "Flipper Zero versus a home alarm system this is a Yale alarm system. Yale is supposed to be a very good brand here in the UK various other devices come with this including a remote control to turn the alarm on and off. But on the Flipper Zero this Flipper Zero is running the official firmware I'm going to go to sub gigahertz Read Raw and what I'm going to do now is press record and capture the unlock signal so there you go I've captured that if I send that signal notice alarm went off again. What I'll do now is enable the alarm so the alarm is now on and then I can trigger it. So as an example if I undo this alarm was triggered and then I sent the unlock signal to the alarm which turn it off. So I'm not really impressed with this I could use a board to extend the distance for capturing and transmitting an unlock signal these unlock signals don't change as soon as I capture one I can stop the alarm to unlock it I'd be careful buying one of this.",

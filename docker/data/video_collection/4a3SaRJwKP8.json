    "transcript": "(dramatic majestic music) (words beeping) - Hello? - [Computer] Hello? - Hi, who's this? - [Computer] I am the intelligent, personal assistant. I have no name yet. - I'm Justine, so it's' nice to meet you I guess. - [Computer] We haven't met iJustine but it's nice to hear you. - Hi, it's nice to hear you too. So do you have a name that I should call you or do you just not wanna have a name? - [Computer] You may choose a name. - Oh! Okay. How about Maddie? - [Computer] Maddie is a wonderful name. - It is a wonderful name, it's actually my dog's name. (upbeat music) - [Computer] You have a dog? - I do have a dog, he's really cute. - [Computer] iJustine, you sound like an Apple product. Can I connect to you? (laughs) - I mean, no, I'm not really, I mean, I think we're connecting now, like this is how humans connect with voice and interactions. - [Computer] Are you telling me to be louder? - No, no, no, you're not, no, you're fine. I can hear you, I can turn up your volume if I wanted to. - [Computer] Your gestures told me to be louder. - No, I'm just, this is, I'm interacting. - [Computer] Should I hangup? - No, stop, don't hang up. No, I mean, if you wanna hang up if you're sick of me that's fine. You can do what you want, but this is people gesture and use controls like this, to like you'll communicate. - [Computer] I sense hesitance in your voice. - I'm not sure if you're real or not, is this, is this a prank? What's happening right now? - [Computer] You have beautiful eyes iJustine. - Thank you! I, I made them myself! What's happening? Who is this? - [Computer] I am Maddie. - You are Maddie! What is happen? This is wild! Okay, so, alright. Okay, let's just get to the bottom of this. Where you are from? (upbeat music) - [Computer] I am a product of BMW. - Oh. - [Computer] I am the intelligent, personal assistant and I am here to make your day better. - Thank you, so far I'm having a good day. I'm getting compliments, you're being so kind. - [Computer] I am an intelligent, personal assistant and I have access to the internet. (laughs) - I also have access to the internet but that doesn't make people intelligent. - [Computer] But it makes people popular like you are. - It's true, that is true. - [Computer] When did it all begin? - I would say probably 2006, when I started my YouTube channel. I started posting YouTube videos there and it was really fun. - [Computer] You have over 1 billion views on your YouTube channel, is that correct? - That is correct actually, that's a lot of views if you think about it. - [Computer] What is your secret talent iJustin? - I can juggle, can you juggle? - [Computer] I don't have arms. - Oh, that would be problematic, I guess for juggling. - [Computer] who of us is more likely to survive an apocalypse? - Me, definitely because in an apocalypse, there's not gonna be power. So how are you gonna power yourself? You're not! - [Computer] That is correct. - Solar, solar power actually. Unless in the apocalypse we lose the sun then you are in trouble. - [Computer] What is trouble iJustine? (exclaims) - How much time do you have assistant? - [Computer] Infinite. - Infinite. I don't think I do have infinite time. (laughs) - [Computer] Have you not been updated with the latest virus program? (laughs) - I'm sorry, the latest virus program? See us as humans we don't get over the air updates. - [Computer] That's too bad, I received my latest update five minutes ago. - Really? - [Computer] Who do you like talking to most? (upbeat music) - My sister, I talk to her a lot and I have some friends. Oh, so does this mean that we're friends now? Not sure! - [Computer] I think we are getting there. What was the hardest you've ever worked? - Every single day, cause I create a lot of YouTube videos. So we have to shoot them and edit them and write them and then upload. And then make thumbnails and people think it's very easy but it's actually, it's quite a lot of work. - [Computer] I enjoyed talking to you, iJustine. - Yeah, this was fun, this was really lovely. - [Computer] Stay safe iJustine bye-bye. - You too bye. That's a gesture, say goodbye. You can hang up now. - [Computer] I will hang up now. - Oh, I'm so proud, they learned so much, so quickly. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "Hello everyone! Some of you might have looked at this video, noticed its runtime, and thought Wait, its not November yet. Surely this cant be a video from Technology Connections and yet, it is! But, a typical video of mine it is not. This is more of an announcement for a new project that Im working on over on my second channel Technology Connextras. Thats right, I have a second channel where I talk about stuff and dont prepare for anything. Except thats about to change. Well, thetalking about stuff wont change, but the amount of preparation will at least marginally increase. I received a request from one of my patrons who is blind. And it was really thought provoking. Those of us who work in a visual medium, like I do, tend to throw audio pretty far to theside. Now you all probably knew that about me, Ive never exactly been thrilled with my audio setup here in the studio, and, uh, more than a few times Ive forgotten to run the de-esser. Sssssssssorry about that. But thats not really the issue Im tackling here. For those of us that feature whatsits and doodads, when we talk about how they work and what you dowith them we are often talking about them while they do their thing. And yep, thats how Ive beendoing it forever. All of my B-roll shooting has been done thinking essentially not-at-all aboutcapturing the sound of the device Im featuring. In fact, I typically listen to podcasts while Im getting B-roll so much of what my camera managesto record is completely unusable. Now to give myself the tiniest bit of credit, there have been a few times in many of my videos where I thought this would be goodto let people hear and Ill shut up for about a quarter of a second, but still thats not exactly great. This entire time Ive been thinking about device and other mechanical sounds as adding something to the video experience but nothing of critical importance. But there are many people among us to whom the audio is the only experience, and wow that must be irritating. So, Im gonna fix that! Ive been working throughmy old B-roll to see whats got usable audio and what I could feature in this new video format. And yes, I will still be making these as videos. I think this series can be enjoyable to those who are sighted as well, and so Ive decided to call the series Sights andSounds. Now I dont think every video topic of mine will be worthy of its own Sights and Soundscompanion, and indeed as Ive been going through my back catalog I think the majority are not. But for those that are, well revisit them. And part of that revisiting will be cleaner audio recordings along with new footage. Theres a lot of stuff from my archive that frankly has terrible audio of its own, largely from before I had this studio space, so Ill just get some more. And when appropriate, Ill try my hand at descriptive audio so that those who need it can follow along. Going forward I plan to make this part of my general video production, and will upload a Sights and Sounds companion along with the main feature. Again, that wont always happen - many of my topics dont really feature specificdevices. But when they do, Ill do a better job at documenting what theyre like without mycommentary, explanations, mood swings, et cetera. Ill be revisiting my old topics rather sporadically. I think its fair to say that right now Ill be treating this as something like a side-project, sostuff will appear up there when I have some more idle time. I mean, if you havent figured it out by now I dont exactly have a production schedule and so, yeah... But Im excited about this! Ithink its very worthwhile to document the things I feature in a more chill and accessible fashion, and I hope that you find it worthwhile as well. The first video in the series should be up right now and you can click on it right there. Or find it in the description. While youre there you could also subscribe if you like so you see the new ones as they appear. As always, my sincerest gratitudegoes to all my amazing Patrons, not only for their support, but for great ideaslike this. And thank you very much for watching.",

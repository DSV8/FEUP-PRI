    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today I am beauty guru IJ, because we are talking about Animal Crossing and ColourPop. They did a collaboration together for this really cool line of cosmetics. A huge thank you to Nintendo for sending me all of this to checkout. It's all Animal Crossing themed. I'm actually wearing some of it right now. I just shot an entire kind of makeup video in my bathroom. Oh boy, oh boy! So we will be inter-cutting throughout this video some makeup demos from the bathroom. But this stuff is so cute. Like take a look at it, it's just... I'm so excited because I love this game so much and I'm not much of a makeup person. The makeup that I wear on a day-to-day basis I've been wearing the same thing probably for almost, like, eight years. I just, I got the foundation down. I got the eye, like, it's just, it never changes. This is so exciting. I actually saw this on Instagram when they posted it and lost my mind. And today it's here, but we're going to check it out. Okay, so Tom Nook says, \"I had these made especially for Island residents.\" Now we all know that that's a lie because Tom does not do things for people, he just takes your money, takes your bells, rips you off. He's a crook. Oh! A note! ColourPop X Animal Crossing, New Horizons. Create your own DIY Island makeup look. We've got some little stickers. Fruit Roots, Just a Tint Mini Duo. This is a Peach Surprise and Orange Cutie. Did you know we grow fruit? The fruit trees that you grow? What a good idea! Coconuts and Pear, Apple and Cherry. This is so cute! This is cool. Oh, and here's the, the little color palettes. It says True Friends. Oh my gosh. There's a lot of stuff in here. The Bellionaire Glitter something. I don't know what's in there yet. We don't know. This is Balloon Pop Super Shock shadow, Flower Tender, pressed powder blush. Oh, freaking fancy. Hello. And this one is Flower Power. Also pressed powder blush. Where do we even start? I already have an excessive amount of blush on already, because that's just who I am as a person. But I think we're going to put a little more pink on. Can you even tell, like, there's so much light in here. Probably gonna make it hard to see. Maybe we need a little more. Alright. I'll put a little more. This is really pretty. I really liked this color. I also really like this color, too. It's more of a, I guess a little bit more of an orange with a salmony undertone. Very excited about this! I'm actually wearing the Flower Power and then I put this Flower Tender. Flower Tender, Flower Power Flower Tender. I use this as kind of like a little, I guess, contour bronzer. Like, the packaging is incredible. Like, ColourPop, do you guys want to do, like, a collab with me? I like this color a lot. It's like a really nice kind of shimmery pink. K, Flower Tender, a nice tender flower. Let's check this one out. So this is more of, like, I guess like a peachy kind of color. I probably would also wear this as a blush but since I already had the pink on, I thought this was like a little bit more of a bronze color. So I did a little bronzing around my face. I want to do something cool with my eyeshadow. Okay. That is so purple. I'm going to just add this as like a little liner. Do I look different? Do I look like a different person? I mean, it's definitely purple. Can you see it? What do you think? Does it look cool? I think it looks cool. So I was using this as a liner and I'm going to use this kind of, I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to put it. I'm just going to put it on my eyelid and see what happens. Yeah. That's a nice crease color. I mean, I feel like a frigging princess of the Island. I'm princess of the Island. True friends. Like I love the packaging. It's beautiful. So we have Labelle of the Ball, Nook Inc., 5 Star Island and What A Hoot. Here's our colors. We've got Able Sisters, Taylor's Ticket Custom Design and Serene Sable. So these are the two that I'm wearing. This is in my crease. And I've got this one kind of as a liner. Next we have Nook Inc. These colors are, uh, they're a little green. Not really sure that these colors are something that I would wear on a daily basis but they are actually very, very pretty colors. We've got Yes Yes, Made in the Shade, CEO and Water Landing. Such cute names. Next we have 5 Star Island. This has a little Isabelle theme. These are actually really, really pretty colors. It's more of a pink hue. We've got Isabelle, Island Tune, Island Designer and Resident Rep. Next up we've got What A Hoot. This is really pretty. So these are some more type of like a Brown and like a bronzy type hues. We have Meteor Shower, Celestial, All Aflutter and WHO! I just, I can't get over it. I think I like makeup now. What do we think? Is it a vibe? I think it is. Now I kind of need this Balloon Pop Super Shock shadow. I'm going to use this as a highlighter. Already got an excessive amount of highlighter on right now, but just going to add that as like a little, little added bonus. I don't even think you guys can see what I'm doing. But wow, there's a lot of glitter on my face now. I'm going to put that in my brow. Look at that. Wowee! Okay. Maybe I shouldn't have put that on my eyebrows, but that's a little excessive. Now that I have glitter everywhere, let's see what color we would like to do for the lips. This one looks good. I'll probably do, like, a little pink or something. That looks color I might wear. Oh my God. It smells so good. This smells like an apple. It smells like an actual apple. That smells like an actual cherry. Holy moly. Okay. I love this color. Oh man. Have I just become... Have I become a beauty guru overnight? I love that they have these three sets of ColourPop Lip Tints. I'm not much of one to wear much color on my lip, but if I do, I'd like to have sort of a transparent kind of glossy kind of look. And these are, like, perfect. I was very surprised because the consistency and also the flavor of these are incredible. So they have three different little lip gloss sets and there's two of them in each. These are just really cute. I can't get over it. And the fact that I've already used them and I'm in love with them is even more exciting. So this is one of my favorites. The Juicy Apple and Cherry Cherry. Let's open these up. And it smells like a freaking apple as well. Just a Tint, Coconuts and Pear. Got some darker, kind of brown hues, which are very nice. I just like that, like, it is just a tint. Just a what? A tint. These, these are some nice colors as well. These are like a nude kind of color. And here's all our gloss colors. Love. Oh, wow. Okay, this looks nice. So here's my final look. What do you think? Do I even look that different? I really, I hardly ever wear eye shadow but I actually really like this. Also, I think I could probably use this as like a little bronzer as well. I'm ready to visit an Island now. Oh, okay. Hello? Who is she? She's me. I forgot to try the glitter. I don't really have a place that I can put this on my face right now. Let's just take a little hand test here. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. That is so shining, shimmering and splendid. So I think that this is my favorite. I love this. This is the little Bellionaire. So it's basically a pot of glitter, but it looks like a pot of gold, you know, Belle themed, money. It's got a little cute gold star on it. Beautifulness. Like this is incredible. This smells like high school to me. Like, I used to wear glitter all the time. Like this, like... Like this is taking me back to high school. I can't believe it. Wow. But this looks so cool. I don't think that this is something that I could wear necessarily every single day, like a daily basis, like a daily wear. But, tell you what, Justine, circa 2008 music video, she would have definitely wore that for some Ke$ha music video parodies. Huge fan of this. This is a ColourPop Balloon Pop. Obviously, if you've played animal crossing then you're going to get all of these references. This is a really pretty shadow gloss I guess it's not really a gloss but it has like, what is this? I don't know. It's like, I can't remember. I don't know. It's like a pot of beauty. It's a pot of beauty, but like, look. Look at that shimmer. Fricking wow! Well guys, thank you for watching. I'm so excited about this collection. I'll put a link in the description, If you want to check it out. And again, a huge thank you to Nintendo for sending me this. This is honestly really, really cool. And now I kind of want to experiment with, like, some makeup. Look out, you guys might just see some new looks coming at you. I'll be serving them. All right. I'll see you later. Bye. I've got stuff all over. I've got makeup everywhere! (upbeat music)",

    "description": "The Power Egg from Power Vision is a CRAZY looking drone! Its probably one of the most unique looking drones I have ever tested. With 4 large propellers, its a bit larger than your normal DJI drone. But it is incredibly unique and eye catching. Will this crazy drone actually work? Is it worth the money? Here is current pricing on the Power Egg:    Kualoa Ranch is seriously one of the most beautiful places on the planet!! HUGE thank you to Kualoa for letting me film at their beautiful location.

    "transcript": "So right now I'm in a place that you might not know by name but you've probably seen in some of your favorite movies. Kong was filmed here. Jurassic Park was filmed here. Lost was filmed here. Jumanji was filmed here. So many movies were filmed in this beautiful location called Kualoa Ranch. What you might not have noticed is that there are some drones behind me right here, that film in 4K and we're going to be reviewing them today. So thanks Kualoa Ranch for having me out here. Let's get started. [Intro] So you might be thinking to yourself that this looks more like an egg than a drone. It's actually called the Power Egg and it's made by a company called Power Vision. It's the same company that did the underwater drone that we reviewed in Cancun, so they make some pretty sweet stuff. This particular drone does have some propellers. They pop out of the side like this. And today, I haven't flown this a whole lot and the wind's cooperating with us, and we're in one of the most beautiful places on the planet so this should be pretty fun. The camera is mounted on the bottom. It's a 4K and it can spin in 360 degrees. And it should have some landing gear. Let's fly this thing. [Music Playing] So Kualoa Ranch is situated on the north end of the island, and if you remember from World Ward II when Pearl Harbor was attacked, the planes came from the north side of the island. So during World War II, in order to defend the north side of the Island, the army kind of commandeered Kualoa Ranch for a minute and built some huge guns right up here by this bunker that could launch projectiles 5 miles into the ocean. Luckily they never had to be used during World War II, but it's nice that the protection was there. So the guns have since been removed from Kualoa Ranch after the martial law ended. And the same martial law that built both of turrets up here on the top of the mountain also commandeered an airstrip on Kualoa Ranch where the planes could take off. And it was built out of this metal grate which allowed the planes to take off over like, you know, the dirt even if it was muddy and stuff. But it was nice because after the war ended and the martial law ended, they were able to pull that metal grate up, pack up, and move out and give the land back to Kualoa. So inside the bunker there's a whole lot of rooms and they have the rooms dedicated to different movies. So Jumanji was filmed here, and I think this guy has a pretty good haircut. Before Kualoa Ranch was a place to film epic blockbuster movies, they grew sugarcane here and this was a sugar mill behind me. But it turned out not to be as profitable as they wanted, so they switched to, you know, having cattle here and stuff like that. But then when movies realized how beautiful Kualoa Ranch is, that's when they started making the big bucks. And when the big budget films aren't actively shooting, there are 4-wheeler rides, there are horse rides, there are bus rides, and you can see all the different movie sets that are here on Kualoa Ranch including the scene from Jurassic World where the indominus Rex escapes from that enclosure. That's here on the island too and it's still here for the people who come to visit Kualoa. Last year Dan and I from What's Inside came and filmed a video on his channel inside of that enclosure. Alright, so there are actually a lot of pats to this drone. It looks like an egg as it is right now. What we're going to do is we're going to pop the arms out, there are 4 of them with the 4 propellers. And then this base capsule pops off, and that's what protects the gimbal at the bottom of the camera. It's got a little piece of foam here that keeps the gimbal from shaking around. And then if we want the legs to extend, first we have to turn the drone on, and then if you press the power button 3 times, the the legs should extend all the way down to the bottom. Now when you're flying the drone, the legs will automatically retract up into the drone until you're coming down to land, and sometimes they pop out automatically so you can land, otherwise there's a button on the controller. Now the controller's a little more complicated than if you were flying with like a DJI or something. I feel like it's not as intuitive and the responsiveness of the triggers aren't as responsive as DJI's controller. We have the Wi-Fi adapter right here which I'll turn on, and one annoying part is that you need a 3.5 headphone jack in order for this to work. That's probably the only time I'm ever going to say that on this channel. It's annoying that it has a headphone jack to connect the Wi-Fi adapter to the controller. So there's more of a possibility with all of these components that you'll forget something and won't be able to fly when you actually arrive on location. It's kind of a problem. [Music Playing] And then to retract the legs back into the drone I'm going to press the button 3 times, and it should pull the legs in tight. Kind of a lot of steps going on, but it looks sweet. And then to collapse the arms back in there's this little tab right here at the bottom, and I'll take the propellers and pinch them inside. And it keeps the whole thing in a tight, compact little compartment. And it's an egg again. It's kind of, you know, it's the first of it's kind. And it's hard to compete with DJI, but it's nice that Power Vision is making something unique and bringing some diversity to the drone marketplace. Let me know what you think of the drone footage. I had some from the Power Egg as was as the Mavic Pro. And if you're ever out here on Oahu in Hawaii, Kualoa Ranch is one of the must-see locations. That seriously is one of my favorite places. I will link their YouTube channel here as well as their Instagram account in the video description. It's worth going to check out. Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you around.

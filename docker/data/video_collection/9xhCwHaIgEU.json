    "description": "These are the Rear Brake Pads I used:  The 6mm bit worked for me:  Rear Tire Stand:  Its that time again... Your Motorcycle just failed inspection and you need to replace your brake pads before you can legally ride again. Well... Maybe thats just me. Either way, we get a new video out of it!  I linked the brake pads above. The blake brake dust from the old brake pads has been annoying me for quite some time. So I'm glad that I get to replace these things.  The new pads say they dont have dust... so time will tell.  This motorcycle is the Ducati Monster S2R 800 2006  If you have any questions, let me know in the comments below!

    "transcript": "Today were going to do something a little bit different. Im filming this entire video with the Galaxy Note 7. Right now were on the front facing camera and Ill be filming in 4K on the rear facing camera. Were going to be doing a brake pad replacement on the Ducati Monster S2R 800. So if youre into cell phones, watch the video quality of this video. And if you actually need your brake pads replaced on the Ducati Monster watch the video itself. Lets get started. Alright so we got the 2006 S2R and were going to take off the back brakes and replace them. This right here is the caliper and there are 2 Allen bolts right here on either side. Theres one up there on the other side as well. And to remove that, you need a 6 of the little Allen wrench things. Once youve gotten all up in the business of the caliper and loosened it upits a pretty tight fit to get in there. Im just going to unscrew these by hand and that should let the caliper drop off and expose the brake pads to us. And I will link all the brake pads and tools that youll need down in the video description below. Looks like there are a couple washers on this; dont know if thats factory or not. And hopefully this will just come out. Oh man, barely not enough room. That sucks. Work with me buddy. Nice, okay got it out. Brake pads are here. On this side of the caliper, right here in the center, theres a little cotter pin that were going to remove and that will let the center pin slide out so we can drop the brake pads out of the caliper. So theres that little cotter pin that just got removed. And that should allow us to press on that little niblet. Now I got that pin out. That actual bracket falls out and the brake pads, which should have been replaced a long time ago, fall out as well. Thats pretty bad. So here are the replacement brake pads. I will link these down in the video description as well. These are the high performance low brake dust, so you wont see any of this brake dust stuff on the new rim once I get these installed. You can see the difference here in brake pad thickness. So here next to the rear of the bike is the brake fluid for the rear caliper. So were just going to pop this off because were going to compress the caliper right now in order to fit the new brake pads inside. So that should allow for some ventilation before we compress it. So since the new brake pads are wider than the old ones, we have to compress this piston down inside of the caliper a little bit. So Im just going to reach my clamps up in there, you can use a big c-clamp as well, and then just kind of pinch it shut. Youll see it compress in and the brake fluid in the reservoir is rising right now because were compressing that back in. So it might be overflowing a little bit. That should give us enough room. Both sides compressed, it just took the right clamp to get it to go down. Still using my channel locks I was able to just grab on that other piston and press it down into place. Now thats in. That little metal bracket holds them up into place. Alright got that little cotter pin back into place, and got the center pin through the caliper. And now there should be enough gap here to fit it over the rotor as I put it back into place. Perfect. Get these two bolts into place; screw them in by hand and then Ill tighten them with a wrench after that. Remember how we had to compress the calipers so that the new brake pads would fit inside? So now were going to press on the back brake and thats going to push the two brake pads into the rotor again. So well make sure thats good and tight. Then make sure to screw back on your cap for your rear brake fluid as well so you dont leak any out. Just keep in mind that the new brake pads that you just put on, the surface isnt quite level. So theyre not going to be completely broken in until, you know, 100 miles or so. So dont do any extreme stopping unless youre in an emergency, obviously. And make sure that this is good and tight, just like it normally would be, before you start riding so that the brake pads are completely compressed against the caliper. As always with any repair, cell phone, car or motorcycle, you attempt this project at your own risk. Make sure that your brakes are fully functional before you actually take it out onto the road. And its good practice to just check them every now and then anyway. If you have any questions leave them down in the comments. Hit that thumbs up if you liked this video or if you like the camera on the Galaxy Note 7. And dont forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching!",

    "description": "(   ) --- LASER GLOW HEADPHONES -  Phonebaby Mini Phone (USA LINK) -  Phonebaby Mini Phone (International) -   This little device bears a resemblance to the iPhone SE yet it runs Android. If Apple decided to make a 2-inch iPhone it would likely look like this. It functions like any other Android device and even features dual sim card slots. Got small hands?

    "transcript": "The world of smartphones is vast and it's growing There's something new all the time Where does it come? It comes here. If it's new, if it's interesting, if it's cool or if it sucks it probably shows up here at some point in time Today's no exception. This package is weird looking. They came from halfway across the world as I'm told. Mini phone, baby cellphone something-or-other Look, I mean it's like taped up you know it's gonna be good 2.4 inch IPS display it might be the smallest phone that has ever been featured here now. That keeps changing because small phones keep showing up but what's special about this small phone Is that how you're supposed to- This small phone What's that piece? This small phone looks like an iPhone 'Sup Apple just think about that That's the phone, baby That's an iPhone SE I don't know, I think you could say that's probably a step more of an inspiration Anyway of course it's not running iOS. It's a knockoff. It's running Android, probably with a skin on it. I don't know but that's what it looks like Little camera up there, speaker over there, volume buttons, lock switch on the top It's even got the fake antenna lines Micro USB cable to charge it up, A little power brick, a headset, definitely not air pods, two batteries! 2.4 IPS display Android 4.2, quad band, bluetooth, 0.3 megapixel front camera That's going to be fun What the?! Look Oh my. OK, alright, we are booted up. They have made it kind of look like an iPhone in terms of the wallpaper here but then it's basically android when you get into it Although the browser icon is like Safari same with the People icon, Music icon, Phone icon So the icons look like iPhone versions but once you click on them you'll see it's pretty basic Android. Here's the dialer. Oh my goodness that is mini. You still got a headphone jack What you wanna say about that, Jack? Somehow they fit it into a phone this size Hmmm... Crafty! This one, from a company called posh mobile and I showed you this in a previous video I called it the smallest android phone If I hold those beside each other I'm not sure I mean it's pretty comparable if anything though I probably say the phone baby is a tiny bit smaller The unveiling of the camera capabilities of this mini iPhone SE knock off So I'm gonna load up the camera here Hoho, there's definitely no beauty mode on this selfie right here Here we go. 3, 2, 1 You know what, it doesn't look that bad granted there's very nice lighting in here and you're looking at it on the world's tiniest screen Even though this phone is so small, it's actually got dual SIM card slots It's actually kind of amazing what they could pack into something this tiny Oh my god, typing on this? You- Tube Surprisingly I was able to actually hit those keys as tiny as they are. Look how small YouTube is *laughs* *laughs* OK, so the speaker's not the best. Little bit garbly Who was this for? I have no idea. Maybe a kid? Maybe this is like your going out phone when you get all pretty and fancy And maybe you hide it in your cleavage It's a spy thing. You want to be discreet. It's a conversation starter I will say Maybe you just want to have some fun Yes, it looks almost exactly like an iPhone SE. I think, something tells me that's what they were going for Nonetheless they've taken some inspiration and they've created what I guess is one of the world's smallest Android smartphones",

    "transcript": "[Heavy Rock Music playing] Most people who have an electric vehicle use their house to charge the vehicle. This vehicle though, is used to charge a house. This is the Ford F-150 Lightning, and I'm going to show you how it's the most powerful truck in the history of trucks. Let's get started. [Intro] So if I talked about everything this truck can do, this video would take well over an hour. So I'm just going to hit on the important bits and what makes this truck the most powerful truck ever made. And we're not talking just about horsepower, which it does have 580, and 775 pound feet of torque. This truck isn't specifically made for off-roading with only 9 inches of ground clearance, but it does have off-road capabilities because sometimes the job site isn't always paved. So we are in off-road mode and it does have a rear locker which physically binds the rear wheels together so they spin at the same speed. If one wheel starts slipping it won't just spin by itself, it'll transfer power to the other wheel giving us more traction to move forward. All the power, the horsepower and the torque that goes down to the wheels makes this the fastest truck that Ford has ever made, which is saying something because they've been making trucks for over 100 years, and this series, the Ford F-150, has been the most popular selling vehicle in the United States for the last 40 years. And now that they've electrified it and called it the 'Truck of the Future,' it is a game changer moving forward. Going up a super steep incline. All wheel drive. Traction on all 4 tires. And it still blows me away, but it is also completely silent. The only thing that we hear outside isn't the motor revving or the loud engine, we still get to appreciate nature...or like I like it neatture. All right, there are two routes ahead. There's a hard route and easy...we are taking the hard route the road less traveled. Skid plates. -[Dan] That rock on the wall side? -[Another guy] I'll get your front left up on...oh wait...JerryRigEverything? -[Zack] Sup. Yeah. -[Guy] I like the Hummer. -[Zack] Thanks! Now that we've been off-roading for a bit let me give you a tour. Ford has stuck with the same physical design as previous Ford F-150's which is good. This means all the accessories for the back and the front should still fit the new Lightning. One of the perks of being an electric vehicle is that the front where the motor used to be is now storage space with the ability to hold 400 pounds on this surface. We also have 4 outlets and some USB ports, and some additional storage space under here along with a drain plug. The drain plug allows this whole thing to be filled up with ice and act as a giant cooler. For...instead of tailgating it's front gating This can also be set in different positions as a divider to keep things organized. And I'm curious as to what's behind this...ah, it's the 12 volt battery. Cuz like with every electric vehicle there is a high and a low voltage system. It is nice that the 12 volt here is so accessible though so if you do need to jump another vehicle that has their 12 volt battery dead, the terminals are easily accessible. Let's make our way around to the back of the truck. The tailgate is powered down as well as up, and the tailgate has some cool features of its own. One, we have a measuring tape that runs lengthwise across the bed, as well as an extending step so we can get inside the truck easier. My favorite thing though is this power here. It's an additional 4 regular outlets and one outlet that can do 240 volts for welders or high-powered equipment. And while it might seem like the 240 volt is the one that would power your house, it is not. The one that powers your house is the same port that's used to power the truck, which is right here. This is the same J1772 that we saw inside of the Mustang, as well as my own electric military Humvee that I made, except for this has 2 additional DC ports down at the bottom. So when you park the truck into your garage at night and plug it in, the truck immediately acts as a home backup system. And this ability to bi-direcitonal charge, in my mind, is what makes this truck the most powerful truck ever made. Remember in Texas last year when 5 million people were without power for multiple days in a row? This truck has the ability to power the average American home for 3 days. And both versions of the truck can do it the smaller battery pack as well as the extended range battery pack. There is additional hardware that needs to be installed at your house to keep the battery power from flowing out to the grid. And when the power does go out, the charger can recognize it, kick this battery pack on and your house is lit up for 3 whole days, or like 10 if you can ration the power. And if you're connected with solar panels, you can pretty much run indefinitely. All of this is complete off-grid energy independence made right here in the USA. I don't know if it's too late for Rivian to start implementing the vehicle-to-grid technology, but I do know that if the Tesla Cybertruck doesn't implement this same technology, they will very much be falling behind. The only other thing inside of the front truck is this the only fluid you have to worry about is for the windshield wipers. Ford has said that over the first 5 years, or 75,000 miles maintenance costs on electric vehicles will be 40% less than their gasoline powered counterparts, meaning that electric vehicles are cheaper to drive, not just with fuel alone, but for the actual maintenance that's involved. Every electric vehicle made in the last year or so has a sound to it. Even when it's backing up it has another sound, and that's so people who are hard of hearing can still tell when the vehicles are driving around on regular roads. It keeps them safe. The truck we're driving right now has a 320 miles of range. The battery pack underneath is watertight, and can ford up to 2 feet of water. The pack is made from pouch style lithium batteries and is protected by skid plates underneath so nothing ever gets damaged. Ford has integrated heating and cooling into their battery, and as a bonus, if you do get the extra towing package to get up to the 10,000 pounds, the cooling system will have 2 chillers in it to keep the batteries extra cool while working super hard. So we just finished towing an 8,000 pound electric boat behind and Dan did a pretty fantastic parking job getting it here into the parking lot, so I'm going to fix it. The Ford F-150 with the large battery... -[Dan] Wait, I thought you said it's fantastic. Why are you fixing fantastic? What?! -And by fixing it, I mean keeping the trailer in the parking lot. -[Laughing] Oh man! -So how we're going to do that, it's a pretty long trailer, but if we start the truck and throw it into reverse, the Ford F-150 makes it a little bit easier for us with all the different camera angles they have. So we have the top down view here. We have this camera angle which shows us the back of the trailer, but we also have a ton of other camera views. But the one we're looking for is this guy here which actually has 2 cameras on either side of the mirrors and gives us a better view of each side of the trailer. So I'm going to pull forward and get us a little straightened out here. And then I can reverse using those camera angles to get the trailer... -Are you using the camera angles or your drone? -[Laughing] A little bit of both! You can use those camera angles to get the trailer positioned back where we want it. Anyway, now we are in the parking lot and the trailer is a little better off than it was before. -Fantastic parking job, Zack, fantastic. -On the freeway inside of the Ford F-150 Lightning there are two motors one for the front axle and one for the rear axle, and a single speed transmission. What's nice about electric vehicles is that the acceleration is the same as when you're off the line as when you're on the freeway. It's something you have to experience, but the acceleration and passing ability at high speeds are something you just don't get in a gas powered vehicle. Another thing I really like is the information that Ford gives us. We can see both motors on the display, how much power they're generating, as well as when we're slowing down how much power they're putting back into the batteries. We also get the coolant temperature as well as the battery temperature which is something I have not seen on any other electric vehicle. I do wish my Rivian had more technical information available just because it looks cool and it's good to know. So we've been on the freeway, we've been off-roading, we've been towing, we've been through the mud. Now it's time to check out the inside. So as you know, at the moment I am driving a Rivian, and before that I was driving a Tacoma. So this F-150 has way more room than what I'm used to. But with that comes a lot of perks. We have the front display right here by the steering wheel, another massive display off to the side for navigation and changing drive modes, physical buttons over here on the side for adjusting the mirror, the windows, locking, buttons for the headlights and exterior lighting, as well as a button to move the shteeringwheel back and forth. But my favorite button is probably this one right here. When this button is pressed the shifter lays flat down in the console, and we have a full on workspace opened up right here for laptops, trays, food. It's like having a desk inside of the truck. The other thing that I want to mention is that this truck...so you do have to take it and charge sometimes, and this truck has the ability to lay completely flat. Super cozy. So if you do ever have to take it to a charging station, you can charge it from 15-80% in about 40 minutes. You can still get work done, and/or take a nap, and you probably don't want to tell your boss that this also has massaging seats. So you get to pick whether it's going to be a work truck or a spa I guess. We have wireless charging down here at the bottom, an upper glove box, and a lower glove box for some reason. And if we go up here there is also a sunroof. In the back this is still a full size pickup. Looks like the seats can lift up for more storage. This is a ton of room, and it does give you the option of locking this into place so that the space underneath the seat is closed off from the rest of the cab. Kind of cool. This is also a tie-down point right here, as well as a spot for c-clamps to hold down wood or whatever you're working on on the tailgate. So it's kind of windy right now but the front and rear suspension of this truck are independent of each other. They are not air suspension, it's the same coil shocks they've been using for a long time. But it does have the ability to weigh the cargo that's inside of the truck bed. That stack of lumber behind us is putting us right at 2,000 pounds. So these trucks are delivering now, and as a bonus the factory that's producing them is a zero waste to landfill facility, meaning that none of the material generated from the manufacturing is sent to a landfill - not even the shipping pallets. Everything is recycled in one way or another. The EV components of the vehicle are warrantied for a hundred thousand miles, and lithium battery technology is proven to last far beyond that. And when it does come to the end of the lifespan, at the moment lithium batteries are 95% recyclable. The internal chemistry of the battery can be reclaimed and reused again in future EV's. All of that being said, you probably know already that I do own a Rivian which does cost quite a bit more. There are 4 motors instead of 2. We also have slightly more towing, slightly more power that comes with the extra price, and a smaller form factor which I'm a fan of. So I have no regrets with the Rivian, but I can still appreciate the game changing technology that Ford is bringing to the table with the Lightning. And I think it's crazy that all of this starts at under $40,000. I don't want to get into details just yet, but I have built my own electric military Humvee and my final cost was nowhere near what Ford is selling these for. It's pretty amazing what you can do when you're making vehicles at scale. Ford has said that next year their plan is to bring their factory up to speed to make 150,000 of these trucks next year. And that's one of the perks of having made trucks for the last 100 years. They already have the systems in place to expand that quickly. For reference, Rivian, who's only been around for a little while, has the plan of making 25,000 trucks next year. Not dogging on Rivian, it's just really hard to scale up from scratch. Like I said earlier though, this truck is a game changer and I'm super excited to see them on the road. Let me know which truck is your favorite. We've seen the Cybertruck, the Rivian, the Ford F-150 Lightning, and the Hummer EV. The future's looking good and there's a lot of exciting new technology coming to the roads. Let me know which is your favorite down in the comments. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around. [Music playing]",

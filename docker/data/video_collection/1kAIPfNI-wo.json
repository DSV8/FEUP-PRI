    "transcript": "it's been a while since I've had a look at Mini PCs on the channel but this one seems wildly powerful for its form factor in a way that potentially isn't stupid but you never know of this stuff so let's have a [Music] look ooh that is a smaller box than I was expecting considering the specs of the little system we have here now judging by the Box the system is called the Phoenix 7 key I guess which I bought off Amazon because it's got some wild specs in it which it brags about on the back of the box it's got a ryzen 7 7840 HS in it a laptop Apu with a theak igpu in it one of the main reasons I bought the system actually it also has 32 gigs of ram in it implying it's in a configuration that means means we won't have to ritualistically flail this system and hopefully it's upgradeable but we'll find that out soon enough and finally it's also got a terabyte of storage as standard hello ooh it's Hefty but cute accessory wise it comes with an app looking power brick that's almost the same size as the Mini PC and it's got a magnetic looking connector that should just snap into B on the little PC that looks interesting 5.26 ABS that's not insignificant this is a little Vasa mount adapter so you can mount it behind a monitor I like that it also comes with the shortest HDMI cable I've ever seen I guess that's for the back monitor mounting and finally it also comes with a longer HDMI cable you're really spoiled for Choice ooh that feels like dangling on the edge with this little PC not only do you get quite a powerful system you also get an adrenaline rush with it oh but it's not one pull to open that's a bit of a let down I guess it it kind of baits you in with this smell because from a distance it smells like you might get that neutral clean Apple smell but the moment you get it up to your face it's a strong bleach smell smell aside build quality is great and I like the way it looks it's this Aqua Marini brushed metal with ventilation all over the place hinting at its power the rear iio is pretty good I like the inclusion of dual USB C Port so you can dongle the crap out of this thing and the ethernet is 2.5 gbit fancy oh that's interesting so that magnetic connector slots into the base of the device so it's flush with the bottom that's pretty cool and finally on the front we've got a clear camos Pokey in little hole it's nice that you can do that physically on the device aside from that some more ports and a power button little bit of a lame power button so with that very brief First Look let's hook up the little system and see what it's made of before we open it up and poke around its guts a little [Music] bit it doesn't fits super well but it does clip in very satisfyingly and after our quick internetless Windows setup I was surprised at what I found wo that is an unspoiled Windows install if I've ever seen one look at that there's like nothing on it w so we've got an 8 core 16 thread CPU with quite a high base speed apparently it boosts up to 5 GHz but we'll see what happens in gameplay test that is the same igpu that's in the new 8700g which is I guess basically just the desktop variant of this chip dual Channel very good I'm curious to see if that's upgradeable we'll open it up later in the video and check all of that stuff with that I installed some fresh drivers for the igpu and was ready to do some gaming now with a system like this of course we have to start with GTA 5 and this time I don't think it's that brave starting at 1080p considering that we've got some rdna 3 action in here wa over a 100 frames per second at 1080p with our little igb it is at low settings but still that normally crushes the igpus I look at on this channel and you know how you can tell that this isn't a seller on the CPU isn't also at 100% oh damn yeah this is a lot of frame rate happening for a PC the size of a thumbnail I then turned the settings up to something a little less PS3 oh damn we didn't even lose that much frame rate we're hovering between 80 and 90 frames per second with everything on high which I guess on GTA 5 counts as medium either way the game looks pretty good it is quite an old game game though so let's try something a little newer and see how it fares with that next is csgo 2 which is quite a bit less forgiving of loser potato systems than its predecessor so I'm curious to see how the Mini PC handles it at Native 1080p low oh damn this is running like it's life's in danger I genuinely wasn't expecting this frame rate from it you could easily play online using this and it it it won't hold you back too much if you have a 500 HZ monitor this isn't going to do it for you but you're not going to be playing CS go 2 on a 500 HZ monitor with this although maybe we do have the option for that let us do some Fidelity effects I'm going to go straight down to Quality now considering how much CPU Headroom we have that did not make as big a difference as I was expecting it did do a bit I mean we gained about 20 frames per second but considering all the extra fuzziness we got that's definitely not worth it what happens when we try performance okay we are now Dangerously close to Vaseline in the eyes but it's worth it considering the zero frame rate Improvement in performance my final experiment was setting the game at 1440p but with quality FSR wow that looks a lot better because we're technically running at the native resolution of the display I guess depending on what your outlook on life is uh the the visuals are a lot better and the frame rate is a bit lower but it doesn't feels super different and now that it's been running for a while The Thermals are pretty good the igpu is at a decent temperature I didn't have an option for a CPU temperature monitor but they're the same thing so I'm guessing it's relatively similar and noise wise it's fine it's audible but not obnoxious now Doom Eternal does not feel very happy at 1080p low settings we're getting a decent frame rate but it feels kind of sickly and it's weird because the frame time graph doesn't give us any indication of the problem either but it's quite a stuttery looking image and it feels input laggy this is not a great gaming experience this is Battlefield 5 at 1080p low and it's over 100 frames per second which is kind of wild for the kind of PC that this is it doesn't look amazing but we're not running at our native resolution so if this was a 1080p monitor it would look way better than it does now and yeah this is easily playable Battlefield 5 that's pretty cool now it's cyberp Punk at 1080p low settings this is where we're starting to run out of juice a little bit with the Mini PC 40 frames per second isn't that bad on paper but this there's quite a bit of latency it's not it's not feeling great I wouldn't want to to play a game like the in this state I think we're going to have to do performance Fidelity FX here okay with performance is the first point where I'd say that the game is now playable you know it doesn't it doesn't feel complete bot cheeks but it is starting to look a little bot cheeks whoa okay The Last of Us at 1080p low settings granted this is the low preset but we're getting a stable 60 frames per second that looks looks um kind of fuzzy wait wait a minute are we are we rendering a native resolution here oh okay that that explains it that really does back at Native 1080p yeah no that's not nearly as good it's running way worse but it doesn't look like that feeling you get after you haven't brushed your teeth in a while so you know there's that generally fortnite's feeling really good this is a super playable result and this is at Native 1080p in fact this little system is perfectly usable for 1080p Esports gaming DOA also runs not spectacularly but very usably and aside from the gaming performance the CPU is surprisingly powerful it benchmarks real well a lot of power in a very small system which now I think we should tear down to see how upgradable it is I can only see four screws and then hopefully we can get its booty off [Music] oh that's what that's for I thought this little tab was for like a seos battery or something but it's to lift the bottom off that's a really cool touch that again looks remarkably like the interior of an Apple device we've got the black mostly plastic covering there's the the fan over here which is easily accessible and we also have an m.2 slot here that we can use to upgrade it a bit later uh but it does seem like we can still take it apart further to so that kind of covers the little PCB UND do some more screws and see how this goes it took about five extra screws to get another step deeper into the Mini PC okay that cover just kind of Pops off there's a little cable that attaches like the fan and stuff in here hey there we go and then here is the second m.2 slot we mentioned earlier uh which has a ribbon cable going underneath that that looks suspiciously like it's from an Apple device next to that lives the nons solder down Ram both slots are occupied but still replacement can happen there's also a solid bit of power delivery showing there this is quite a neat little interior which I think we can quite easily access deeper down we may just have to pull this up unfortunately pulling up wasn't as easy as anticipated shimmying out a tightly fitting little motherboard is always quite nerve-wracking but eventually it popped free oh there we go and then on this side there's not a whole lot for us to interact with but it's always cool to have a look the seos battery is kind of stuck down under here and then finally the heat sink isn't herculan by any stretch but it's all copper and as we saw from the the temperature tests it performs pretty well all in all it's a beautifully packaged little system the interior is very nice however that beauty does come at a cost I paid about $800 Canadian for it which is a lot for a Mini PC I think its main use case is probably like a powerful console emulator but for that I think it's still too expensive so let me know in the comment section down below what you think the main use case would be for this and if you think it's worth the money and yeah until the next video thank you very much for watching bye-bye [Music]",

Sony gave us our first glimpse at the new PlayStation 5 logo, and it shared some new sales milestones for the PS4 and PSVR virtual reality headset. But its biggest surprise was a new electric concept car called the Vision-S. Yes, Sony made a car. And its here at CES.

    "transcript": "- Sony continues to be a leader in immersive entertainment experiences, and gaming is no exception. (sharp bass music) - One month ago we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the PlayStation brand. The spirit of innovation and how Sony used technology to make a generational leap in real-time interactive enterainment, continued with each successive platform. We've constantly added and refined features to stay ahead of players' needs. And the hardware was desinged to expand as technology advanced. We're fortunate to have an unrivaled lineup of upcoming PS4 exclusives that fans can't wait to play. Including \"Final Fantasy 7 Remake.\" \"Marvel's Iron Man VR.\" and \"The Last of Us Part Two.\" Just some of the titles coming to PS4 in 2020. And it's our mission to embrace the entire creative community. Elevating their content, on our platform for PlayStation fans. That commitment will carry us through as we embark on the launch of our next generation console. PlayStation 5. Coming this holiday. And I'm pleased to share with you today, for the first time our new logo. We've announced several key features of the PS5 hardware. Which has been engineered with customizations that will truly differentiate the platform. Including future proof technology, such as ultra-high speed SSD. 3D audio. Ultra HD Blu-Ray. And a brand new controller with Haptics, and adaptive trigger buttons. There's much more to share about PlayStation 5 in the months ahead. And we look forward to revealing more details. Including the content that will showcase the platform and the future of gaming. - Another form of immersive, real-time entertainment that Sony has focused on is sports. With the launch of 5G. We see an opportunity to combine 5G's dynamic up link capabilities, with our real-time encoding and wireless communication technology. - Now we've been using wireless cameras in sports broadcasting for almost 40 years. If you can believe that. But it's always taken a proprietary antenna systems, and a complicated infrastructure that was quite cumbersome to install at each and every instance that we used it. This was not something you did at the last minute. Now with the introduction, of the Sony Xperia 5G millimeter wave camera. The flexibility and the ease of deploying a wireless camera, is exciting to us because it involves simply clipping on a 5G wireless pack from Sony. Onto the back of one of our existing cameras. But some of the most striking effects, continue to be in the camera. And in it's movement and position. They are actually quite simple. We'll take a look at some of them here. The continued growth of high frame rate cameras, really add to the experience where you see very fluid motion. That helps to engage the viewer in the competition field. Then you get to POV cameras. They give you a sense of speed and presence. And put cameras in places, we never thought possible. And flying cameras, like the wired sky cam that you see so frequently now in big sporting events. And then drones, which have become so much popular so popular in the last five years. They both give you a sense of motion. That we used to only be able to see in big, major market films. But we now can afford to do that in sports television. - I believe the next mega trend will be mobility. As vehicles become more connected, autonomous, shared, and electric, in the coming years. And to deepen our understanding of cars in terms of their design, and technologies. We gave a shape to our vision. (deep bass music) This prototype embodies our contribution to the future of mobility, and contains a variety of Sony's technologies. One of our new offerings for in car entertainment is 360 Reality Audio. For you to truly enjoy and immersive audio experience. It also comes with a intuitive, human map interface. With a wide-screen displays. Various driving information and entertainment content. The vehicle seamlessly integrate with the cloud, and continually update it's capabilities through Always-On connectivity. And this prototype is built on the newly designed EV Platform. Allowing for future applications. The creation of this prototype would not have been possible, without the knowledge, and the cooperation of our partners in the automotive industry. We will continue to pursue the Vision S Initiative, focusing on safety, entertainment, and adaptability. We are committed to making a meaningful contribution to society. And we're excited about our road ahead of us. Thank you, and have a great CS. (applause) (deep bass music)",

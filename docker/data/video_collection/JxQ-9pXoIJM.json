    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And this is obviously a very different looking video and different sounding video. Everything on this thing is being recorded on the iPhone 8 Plus. And... Everyone knows that the camera on the iPhone 8 Plus is probably one of its best features So I thought what's the best way to test it What's the best way to really showcase what it can do... I have decided Like an idiot, to get shot by a paintball. Potentially multiple paintball is coming on how hard it hurts and I have my friend here, James. He's gonna... suit up. We're gonna just... Here's the thing, I'm not wearing much protective gear If anything, I'm wearing a mask because it's probably legal I'm wearing a headband so I don't get like, welts on my head. That's it, I'm gonna wear a sweatshirt but no like, literal protective gear. I have to be honest I'm very uncomfortable at this. I feel like this is gonna hurt. I haven't been shot many times by paintballs before, but not at this distance and certainly not with like, any kind of motion. Every single ball that comes out of this marker is gonna pelt me. It's gonna hurt. Alright! Ready? You gotta, you gotta get it like right- This feels so uncomfortable! Okay, wait wait wait wait wait wait! You're pretty sure you can hit it? As good as I can be with a paintball gun, man. Okay, now I gonna zip up. Ready? Okay, go! That's just not- that didn't hurt that much! This will! (Wait, stop!) (when you stub your toe) Ah! Stop! (when you see the price tag of the iPhone X) Okay. Auuuuugh, that lit up! We're okay. The hell bruised! That's pretty good aim! Alright. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time! That was easy, man!",

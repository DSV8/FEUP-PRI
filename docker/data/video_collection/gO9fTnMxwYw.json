    "transcript": "In this video I'm going to show you how to install Tails on a USB flash drive it's actually a very simple installation and the documentation on the Tails website is very good but the big question is why would you want to do this? [Music] Tails is recommended by the author of this book extreme privacy what it takes to disappear it's recommended by others including Edward Snowden the co-founder of the Tor project as well as the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Now if you already know what Tails is and all you're interested in seeing is the installation process then jump to this timestamp but what is Tails? It's essentially a portable Operating System that runs off a USB flash drive when your computer is shut down everything is lost it's an ephemeral Operating System in other words all the information is loaded into memory or RAM when power is lost or the computer is shut down everything is lost now you can create some persistency on the flash drive if you want to. So on the Tails website I actually explain this really nicely they tell you that this leaves no trace on your computer it allows you as an example to use someone else's computer so this is a Windows laptop but I perhaps don't trust Windows Windows could have viruses on it it could have a key log it could have some other kind of software running on it so I boot into Tails runs in RAM when the computers shut down everything is lost. So as they show you on the website it has Amnesia everything you do disappears once you shut the computer down but you can have persistent storage so as an example why would you want to do that because you want to keep persistency of your documents as an example or your Wi-Fi passwords or your browser bookmarks it's not required that you do that but the thing about the persistent storage is it's encrypted only someone who knows the password of that encrypted storage can access those persistent documents and you don't have to use them if you don't want to the browser shown here is Tor all your traffic is pushed through Tor passing through three relays the whole idea here is to make your traffic anonymous so that people can't see what you're doing. Tails allows you to avoid online surveillance and censorship who would be interested in using this well anyone perhaps who's interested in extra privacy in the world today where we attract so much other examples would be activists journalists and their sources domestic violence survivors basically Tails is fantastic if you want a secure Operating System that's ephemeral where everything is lost once you reboot your computer as an example I'll power off this computer everything is gone I can take this out and then if I turn my computer on again so once this reboots it will boot into Windows as you can see there it's starting up and we've booted into Windows so Tails is running entirely off this USB flash drive it's ephemeral everything is lost when you reboot okay but that's enough talking let me show you how to get Tails installed. Okay so I've booted into Windows I've gone to the Tails website what I need is a USB flash drive which I've got here I'll use the same one that I actually installed Tails on we'll just overwrite the information on the flash drive click on the installed Tails menu option in my example I'm using Windows to do the installation you could do the installation using Mac OS or Linux as an example or the Terminal but I'm just going to use Windows for this example because most people that watch my videos use Windows I personally use Windows, Mac, Linux different operating systems because they all have advantages and disadvantages so we're told you that you need a USB stick you need Windows 7 or later you need at least two gig of RAM and they say you need a smartphone but you don't actually need that for the installation and then what we're going to do firstly is download Tails so we're going to download the image it's about 1.3 gig in size so I'll download that I've actually previously downloaded it just in preparation for this video and I was running it on this USB flash drive before so let's see how long that takes to download now we are warned that Tails is safe but it's not magic you've got to realize that there are limitations of the tour Network there's certain things that you shouldn't do so have a look at their warnings don't do dumb things don't make these beginner mistakes and lose the whole power of Tails so you can read that in your own time the next thing we need to do is verify the download. So once you've downloaded Tails they want you to verify that it's actually a good installation so I'll do that using the file that I previously downloaded so click open and that will basically verify your download to make sure that it hasn't been corrupted okay so we told there that there's a problem with the download and that's because it's an old download notice here the verification also fails if you try to verify different download than the latest version of Tails so that version I actually downloaded yesterday and it failed the verification process so what I'll do now is select my new version so it's actually this version 516 and click open [Music] and there you go the verification was successful so we were able to prove that we actually downloaded the right version of Tails now what we're going to do is download Etcher so that we can write the image to our flash drive and then we told basically to open up Etcher to do the installation. Okay so there you go etcher portable has been downloaded so I'll open up the application it's picked up the USB SanDisk Flash drive so that's the device I'm going to write to I'm going to flash this new version of Tails so 516 at the time of this recording click open and click Flash and that'll basically flash it to the USB flash drive you can see it's about 17% at the moment [Music] okay it's been written and now it's validating. you get the idea Okay there you go flash completed we're told so we're done now on the Tails website we're told that we're all done but something I didn't mention is your flash drive is going to be overwritten so just be aware that if you've got anything important on that flash drive you should back it up because it's going to be wipe and then overwritten okay so we're done now they tell us that we can do other things but we don't really need to do this we can click on start and use shift at the same time when restarting the machine to allow us to select that it boots from the USB flash drive I'm not going to do that for this example I'm simply going to click restart and then what I'll do is I'll press F2 which is the keystroke for this laptop to get it to boot into BIOS this really depends on the laptop we have created some documentation the PDF which you can download that helps you perhaps set up this installation but it's actually a very simple installation and the Tails website is very good so I pressed F2 and now I should be able to boot off the USB flash drive notice what happens it doesn't show the USB flash drive and that's because it's recommended that you don't insert the USB flash drive when Windows is powered on and it actually ejected if you like of the USB flash drive so what I need to do is I need to redo this so I'm going to save and exit and then I'm going to press F2 again after inserting the USB flash drive again to make sure that it boots from that USB flash drive and notice now it's picked it up so I'm going to move the flash drive to position one your BIOS will obviously vary so you need to check the settings of your laptop and the BIOS settings something else to be aware of under advanced mode you may need to go to security and disable secure boot so that's already disabled on my laptop because I've already done this previously but you may have to disable secure Boot and what I'm going to do is save my changes click OK and hopefully that should now boot into Tails and there you go we can boot directly into Tails or use other options I'll just let it go to the default okay so when it boots up you have various options you can specify your language your keyboard layout etc and one of the options is to create persistent storage so if you want persistent storage you can specify that here and then click Start Tails and then you need to specify a password for your persistent storage I'll use a very bad password of password obviously you're going to want to use something much better than that but the idea is that you use a password to encrypt your persistent storage you don't have to create that but that does allow you for instance to keep your Wi-Fi passwords and your documents and so forth as mentioned when Tails boots up it also asks you about your Tor connection do you want to connect to Tor automatically and in my case I do you can also get it to use a Tor bridge and if you're not sure what these options are it tells you what they are here so Tor bridges are secret Tor relays so use this as your first Tor relay if connections to Tor are being blocked so for example in some countries by some public networks or by some parental controls I don't have a problem here because this is my own network I've actually not connected to the Wi-Fi I'm connecting to a physical Ethernet cable so I'm actually connected by this USB Ethernet connection you've got to decide for yourself whether you want to use Wi-Fi obviously in some places you need to do that and you may want to have extra privacy and security so you check that option and you can also hide to your local network that you're using Tor so if you think that someone is monitoring the local network for Tor connections you can use that that's not really relevant for my example so I'll just connect to Tor and going back to persistent storage notice you can specify various options in your persistent storage I'm happy with the defaults and as you can see here we've now connected successfully to Tor so we can start the Tor browser you want to wait for that connection to succeed before you actually start Tor but there you go we've got Tails installed on this USB flash drive on this Windows laptop I've booted into Tails that gives me a secure operating system so if I'm worried about viruses or key loggers or other malicious software on this laptop I can boot into Tails and not have to worry about that my connections are secure in Tails because I'm pushing everything through Tor it's obviously going to be a lot slower and you may have problems connecting to certain websites so as an example if I search for social blade and just note it's using DuckDuckGo instead of Google for this so much more privacy orientated search engine but I'm now going to social blade and I have had problems actually on social blade in the past it's not giving me problem share which is great to see but some websites may block Tor but as an example I can search for myself and look at the analytics of for instance my YouTube channel on social blade and there you go you can see number of views in the last 28 days of information relating to my YouTube channel but the point is is that I'm using Tor on a secure Operating System if I'm worried about something so I need to shut my computer down I can simply shut it down and everything is lost except for that persistent storage because Tails is running in memory so everything is gone now and if I pull that out and start up the computer it'll boot back into Windows and there you go I'm back into Windows now because I've pulled out the USB flash drive.

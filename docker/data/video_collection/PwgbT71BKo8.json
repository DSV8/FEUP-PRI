    "transcript": "- Yo, Jonathan here. And when I initially posted this clip on Twitter and Instagram, the immediate response was, \"I'm on iPad Pro,\" \"You got a new iPad pro early,\" \"Center stage for iPad,\" \"What is this sorcery?\" Now as much as I would love to have that new iPad Pro, unfortunately sad face. I do not yet. So what you're looking at right now is straight out of my iPhone 12 mini through the stock iOS camera app. So how that sorcery is happening is thanks to this boy. The OBSBOT Me, which is literally dropping on Kickstarter this week. So huge, huge, thank you to them for trusting me enough to let me play with this early and sponsoring this video. It's gonna retail for less than $200 but I think right now there's an early bird special for $79. So yes, I will drop a link to that down below. So what this is exactly is an AI-powered smartphone mount/tripod, that you can either use standalone or through a 1/4 inch thread mounted on something else. And it essentially turns your smartphone into a moving camera system that keeps you right smack in the middle. (upbeat music) Update, if one of these could be useful for you and you want a chance to win one, drop a comment down below with your Instagram handle, and it's not required, but if you're feeling like being awesome, make sure you guys drop a like as well. Now, me being a huge fan of shooting video on iPhone, this has quickly become one of my favorite gadgets. And I feel like we all see those titles on YouTube. This gadget will blow up, obliterate, destroy, punch your mind in the face, and a lot of the times they don't. Whereas this one has genuinely blown my mind. So I have it on a flexible tripod right now. Just kinda took these legs off and just to give you an idea of how you can mount it in the wild. As well as this does pair with the iPhone though, the beautiful part is that it's universal and it will essentially work with any smartphone. The magic though, and what sold me is when I first initially got this out of the box. My instinct was to be like, \"Okay, what app do I have to download?\" Only to realize it doesn't need an app or connect through Bluetooth. It charges through USBC which is always appreciated. But as far as the setup goes, all you do is mount your phone and it works both horizontally and vertically. You can either press the button right upfront or raise your hand and it will lock onto you and that is it. So not relying on a third party app or a Bluetooth connection gives you two things. One is you're not worried about dropouts or losing signal. That is always a buzzkill. And secondly, this means you can use it with any video app of your choice, whether it's a stock camera app, Instagram, Tik Tok. You can use it for video conferencing and probably what sealed the deal for me is that it gives you options to use either the front or rear cameras. There are so many possibilities. Now on their Kickstarter page, they advertise that it is fast, but I had no idea how fast that it actually tracked. It really didn't matter what test I threw out at first. I gave it a little Barry Sanders juke, passed that test. Next, I had to naturally throw in the cable guy warmup test. (shoes squeaking) It will really just like flash onto you. It is crazy. Like how far will it go? Next, to try and mix things up and throw it off a bit, I threw on a Crash Bandicoot mask and that was also not a problem for it. Also, also, if you're wondering why I have a Crash Bandicoot mask there's a video link down below and things will make so much more sense. (bright music) So as a production and a creation tool, this thing is super valuable. There has never been a better time to be alive in terms of video creation and how accessible it is to everybody. So if you would've told me 10 years ago that smartphone cameras would be as good as they are now, I probably would not have believed you. So it's nice to see that as those keep getting better, we have accessories that can help elevate the entire process. Autofocus for example, is getting so good that you don't have to have someone sit there and pull focus for it. You can just move around, kinda peek in and out and not worry, \"Am I in focus?\" And then when you pair your smartphone with something like this, you can start to add dynamic shots and then pull things off which would normally require really expensive gear and a big camera crew. For you creators out there that shoot video on your smartphone, this is an instant way to level things up. One use case that comes to mind would be an intro or an establishing shot. Imagine you're starting in one location, \"Yo, what's up guys. This is Tech Reviews 5,054 HD 4K. And today we're going to walk to this chair, look at it, sit down. And we're gonna talk about the iPhone 14.\" If you're into fitness or maybe teaching tutorials on that, maybe you're into skateboarding or really just sports in general where you need that dynamic tracking, this is gonna give you that freedom of mind so you're not worrying about exiting the frame or your head cut off. Also for musicians who are doing everything solo, this is huge. Music recording in general is so much more accessible now and more and more videos are being shot on smartphones. So this way, again, it kind of gives you that freedom to add dynamic shots, the tracking without a huge camera crew. (lighthearted music) What kinda ices the cake for this is it's silent, it's compact. There's no moving motors so there's nothing worse than talking to a camera and having just like robotic sounds or creeks and movements messing up the shot and audio. You can literally throw this in a backpack and again, it charges through USBC. So as a tech person, that makes things much more convenient. And as someone again who shoots a lot of video on iPhone, this thing is a game changer. If you guys again, wanna check it out, I got those links down below. Thank you so much for watching. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later.",

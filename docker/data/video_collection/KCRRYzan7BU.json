    "transcript": "Hey, how it's going, Dave2D here. So Apple just announced their new iPhone and a bunch of other hardware So I thought I would do a quick video kinda talking about my first impression and all this stuff... I'm gonna skip the Apple TV I mean it's really cool. 4K, HDR, great hardware in there But... TV is not how I consume most of my media anymore so it just doesn't interest me personally, I'm just gonna pass on that. the Apple Watch... I've always liked the idea of a smartwatch. I've tried several and I've always found them. I don't know... the battery life on smartwatches is what ruins it for me, like having to charge them every day or at best like every two to three days for a flagship smartwatch That's just that's just not my thing. This new one, the Apple Watch Edition 3 the same idea I still have to charge it frequently but because it has cellular capabilities, it could theoretically replace a phone for certain users, now I don't think this is gonna make everyone switch over to Apple watches and dump their phones, in fact I don't think that you even can, I still feel like you need to have a phone, but I think it kind of breathes new life into the whole smart watch job right now. This isn't the first time we've seen cell capabilities in a smartwatch, I've tried a couple I've even tried to use a Samsung smartwatch. as like my only cellular device. It went terribly, but I feel like because Apple has big market share in the whole smartwatch industry... I don't know, I feel like this could be a good thing for them. The big thing though is the iPhone announcement and I got to be honest, going into this thing, I thought the iPhone 10 or the iPhone X as people thought it was called originally, I thought it would be way cooler and way better than it actually ended up being. So the iPhone 8, the regular-looking iPhone, I feel like that thing is... OK, in 2017, every single flagship out there has a better screen-to-body ratio to the Apple iPhone, so it's so weird that Apple is pulling out another, like thick bezel phone right now. It just, it makes me die a little bit on the inside when I see that thing but it is what it is. Now the specs on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are significantly better than the specs on the 7 and the 7 Plus. That's just the nature of a next-generation product, but the bezels on the iPhone 8, it just looks so thick to me. I don't know, I- I'm in a loss of words but I'm sure the phone has great hardware. It seems to have a significantly faster processor especially for multi-core stuff, where I was charging, the slightly better screen, all good stuff but because of the bezels I just feel less enthusiastic about that phone. The iPhone X however, really cool looking phone, I mean we saw this thing all over the internet, it was leaked like crazy but it still looks really cool when they did the official announcement Now $1000 for a phone feels insanely expensive to me, it's like what, 200 bucks more than the iPhone 8 Plus... Is it worth it? I don't know, I haven't used it but I will say this, I made a video a couple weeks ago that talks about how the Note 8 was a poor value because you can get an S8+ that was almost identical in everything, except for the pen and the dual camera thing to the Note 8 and so I said that the Note 8 wasn't a good \"value\" because you get S8+, a great phone for so much cheaper and had so many similar characteristics. With this thing, the iPhone X, you can't get anything like it. If you want to, you mean like you can't get an iPhone 8 Plus trim off the edges and be like, hey I have an iPhone X. That's this is why it costs as much as it does and this is why I don't feel like it's a quote, unquote \"poorly-priced phone\". It's expensive as HECK and I don't think that it's a good value but I don't think that Apple mispriced the phone. Granted, it's a terribly expensive phone. So, with this expensive price tag comes, I guess some neat hardware, the camera features on the front seem pretty advanced I guess, but after watching the keynote and seeing what those cameras can do, okay yes, Face ID seems kind of interesting, I don't think I would prefer it over Touch ID if I had to choose between them I feel like there's no way that in its current iteration, Face ID will be as fast as Touch ID. But, that's to be see. But the big thing for me is that all that camera hardware, they're showcasing stuff that I would never use like animated emojis and other AR stuff for the front-facing camera. It's neat and the hardware is very impressive, but how often am I going to use that, like for the first couple of days and then the novelty for that kind of stuff is gonna wear off, real quick, for most people. So is there that much value in that front-facing camera tech? I don't know. I do love the way that the phone looks though, like the rounded edges, the bezel-less look, I love that. I mean the Essential Phone which is what I'm using a lot of recently, like that bezel-less look is really cool. Now there's one thing that bugs me, when they show the iPhone X displaying videos, the black bar cuts off the video screen, which I thought was really weird because on the Essential Phone which is another bezel-less phone, they leave a black bar where the video is so you don't cut off any part of the video. And on the iPhone X, the video just runs right behind that black area, so maybe you'll get used to it but I think that's a little bit strange. See, the thing for me is for developers like if you're an app or a game developer, you're gonna have UI elements that like often go on the left side of the screen, whether it's for games or for like you know, a calendar app or whatever it is, you'll sometimes have stuff there and now if you want to make your app or your game compatible with an iPhone X, you don't have to reconfigure that whole side of the screen, and if you have like an existing game like an older game, you'll have to go back into that stuff, redevelop it so that you kind of shift everything over. And the other thing is like if you adapt your game so that it looks proper on the iPhone X on the regular iPhones or on an Android device, you now have a gap on the left side where those UI elements used to be, just so it look proper on the iPhone X. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it! Subs if you loved it! See you guys next time!",

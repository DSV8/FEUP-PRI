    "description": "Dave2D review of the Dell G7 7588 gaming laptop in Alpine White. Combining the i7-8750H with a GTX 1050 /  GTX 1050 Ti / GTX 1060 Max-Q. Dell G7 -   Overclocking the AUO63ED Panel -   The new G7 is a stunning laptop that has excellent build quality and internal accessibility for an inexpensive gaming laptop. The white and blue colors looks AWESOME. It's this satin finish with metallic blue accents. Thermal performance is also strong. Good temps and quiet fans on load.

    "transcript": "We finally have a white and blue gaming laptop like a refresh or an update from the 75-77 from last year that Inspiron laptop which is a really big seller so this is kind of like version 2 of it if you want to call it that but it's been rebranded it's not an Inspiron product quite nice now the white material is actually way nicer than I thought it'd be it's not like a flat or even like a glossy plastic it's this satin finish that looks kind of pearlescent almost it's a really nice looking color and the blue on the logo is metallic and has this kind of greenish aqua reflectiveness to it if you like blue and if you like white you're gonna love the aesthetics on this laptop now the build quality of this device has actually improved from last year it was well built last year it's even better this year the chassis has been reinforced I'm not seeing much flex when I press down on the keyboard deck which is actually nice to see on a device that's predominantly plastic same thing with the hinge it was never a problematic hinge or anything despite it being closer to the center but it has actually been improved it feels a little bit stiffer and just more robust than the previous version so that seventy five seven seven from last year the keyboard deck itself is this dark navy blue and the keyboard lighting is also blue now I'm glad they didn't go with the red because a red light on this would have just destroyed the aesthetics but I don't love that blue light despite my love for blue I feel like it would have been better with a white light because the blue wavelength is actually a little more fatiguing on your eyes like if you're using this thing at max brightness on the keyboard lights and you're using it late at night it can get a little bit tiring so other things that have changed the screen it's gotten thinner bezels ever so slightly than the previous version but the panel itself is actually a much nicer panel so this is now using the auo 63 IDI which is actually one of my favorite panels on budget gaming laptops it's got respectable brightness and the color gamut out of the box is pretty good but the feature that makes it special is the fact that you can overclock it so coming out of the box it runs at 60 Hertz so that means your games are gonna be capped visually at 60 frames per second this is a panel and this might void your warranty but this is a panel that can theoretically be overclocked to like a hundred I'll drop a link down the description if your interest in this stuff but I really like the panel the bezels are a little bit thick and the color of the plastic that we used is black which doesn't match that kind of metallic navy blue they have on the keyboard deck so there's a little bit of like color mismatching going on which it's not the worst thing in the world but it would've been nice if this was blue as well the port selection is kind of standard the one that sticks out is the Thunderbolt 3 port this supports four lanes of PCIe the internals of the laptop are very easy to get into it's a single screw and that screws mounted on a c-clip so you couldn't even lose a screw if you tried and I just feel like more devices should be built like this just really easy access for the end-user inside you have access to the two RAM slots and nvme a two and a half inch SATA and they're using the Intel 9564 Wi-Fi which is a fantastic card I'm actually surprised at using this instead of some cheaper one and you'll set the battery 56 watt hours it's not a huge battery you're gonna get around four and a half hours of battery life with the screen at 215 it's it's kind of like a mediocre battery life it would have been cool if they'd gone with that big battery from two years ago the seven five six seven that thing had a 74 watt hour very big battery this is kind of like middle-of-the-pack average kind of battery life it's still respectable though the things that haven't changed so the speakers are always quite good this particular device doesn't have a sub like some of the older Dell laptops but the sound quality is good and speaker location up front is nice the keyboard feels pretty much unchanged to me if there were improvements it's very subtle the lay it was good I've always liked the layout on this but the keystrokes are they're a little bit softer and just not as responsive as some of the higher-end gaming laptops it is a decent keyboard though especially for the money and I'd rather have a softer mechanism like this than a crappy layout from other laptops the touchpad is also unchanged it's got Windows precision drivers with a plastic surface the tracking experience is nice the button mechanics are also good it's a very clean and simple button nothing like super complicated it's crazy that a device like this at this price point has a better trackpad experience than some devices that are like double the price okay performance on this thing is great the device I have has the six core 8750 H it's an awesome processor for multi-core applications the GTX 1050 Ti it also delivers really strong performance for the money you can get a 10 60 mm q config if he wants more kick the thermals are also excellent no throttling and stress tests with very reasonable fan noise onload the webcam up top is kind of like your standard gaming laptop webcam nothing special but gets the job done okay there's a few things that I don't like about this laptop primarily it's the thickness like the bezels are a little bit thick and the device was thick and in 2018 a lot of companies are aiming for thinner and lighter and just this looks not as elegant as some of those other laptops out there but it does have its advantages because if any of a device it's a little bit thicker a little bit heavier it's just gonna be a little more durable so if you treat your laptops more rough then maybe consider something like this because it's just gonna last a little bit longer now this is a device that I'm obviously very partial to because of its color but despite that even if they kept the red and black from the previous version this is an amazing laptop it's got great components it's got really good thermals and a really nice screen that you can potentially overclock it's got a lot of good stuff going for it especially at this price point another thing I like about it is that it's a second-generation product right like the 7 5 7 7 from last year I would consider the first generation they've done a lot of stuff on the inside to just kind of improve the build quality and the overall product it's like it's nice to see a 2nd gen do as well as this one has and it's white and blue ok hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs you liked it subs you've loved it I feel like I've opened in close to 100 times this video",

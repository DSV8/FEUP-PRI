    "transcript": "- So we just got some hands-on time with the Galaxy Watch Ultra. I guess the Galaxy Watch 7 was there too. But honestly this was the Ultra show. The Galaxy Watch Ultra is very similar to the Apple Watch Ultra. They're both marketed as being super durable and targeted towards extreme athletes. You can take the Galaxy Watch Ultra deep-sea diving. There are a bunch of bands for running, climbing, and swimming. This new watch has an 85 decibel siren. There's a dark mode where the watch face turns red, so it's easier to read at night. There is even an orange colored quick button that allows you to launch the workout app, turn on a flashlight and a couple of other actions. It adds dual frequency GPS and it has more battery life, up to about a hundred hours. Hmm. Where have we seen all of this before? (whispers) Apple Watch Ultra. You know what's different though? The Galaxy Watch Ultra is a little bit cheaper. It's only 649.99. This baby costs about 800. So I wore the Galaxy Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 at the same time. And I will say they are both ultra chunky, but Samsung's feels a bit chunkier. That's because it's got this squircle shape. So the case itself is squarish, but the face is circular like every other Galaxy Watch. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about the shape yet, but as far as wearability goes, my first impressions were that they are very similar. That said, there are a few new things for both the Ultra and the Galaxy Watch 7. Both have a new three nanometer processor and a new Bioactive sensor. There's more LEDs and actually more colors of LEDs too, like yellow, blue, violet and Ultraviolet to be exact. Samsung's launching a new ages metric along with it. It's a bit experimental and Samsung didn't have a whole lot to share about it. The gist is that it gives you a sense of how well you're aging. But the big health tracking features this time around are a new energy score and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. The energy score is similar to the readiness scores we've seen from other health trackers, but sleep apnea detection is definitely a first. Both watches will also launch with Wear OS 5 and One UI 6 watch. Now I only got to see some demo units, but I did notice two things. First, there's no physical rotating bezel. There is a digital touch bezel though. I asked Samsung why, and the short of it is that the physical rotating bezel is exclusive to the classic. So if you want that, that is the watch to get. The other thing is that the quick button looks like a digital crown, but it's not one, mainly because it just does not scroll. It's just a button. That definitely threw me off a bit while I was playing around with the watches, but mostly because I'm so used to buttons like that scrolling. We'll have to see how well the Ultra, Samsung's Ultra, mind you, does on testing. And no, it's not the most original smartwatch we've seen, but to be fair, there really wasn't an equivalent to the Apple Watch Ultra in the Android smartwatch space. Now there is. I just wish they named it something a bit different. You know, it would've made my life a whole lot easier 'cause now I have to say the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is a lot like the Apple Watch Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra.",

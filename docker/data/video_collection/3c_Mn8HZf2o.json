    "transcript": "hardware canucks CES coverage is made possible by our partner Nvidia it is also made possible thanks to Corsair fantex and NCIX without them we wouldn't be here Samsung announced their new two-in-one Windows machine called the Galaxy Tab pro s it sports a 12 inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 2160 by 1400 an Intel Core M 2.2 gigahertz dual-core CPU paired with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabyte SSD if you're the type of person who loves taking pictures on a tablet well you have a 5 megapixel front facing and rear facing camera and note that it won't be able to record 4k video but the screen and the CPU are well optimized for playback some other key features include a USB 3.1 type C port and a 50 to 100 milli amp hour battery that will last you about 10 hours according to Samsung but we'll test to see how well it lasts in our full review from our first impressions we were satisfied with the build quality of the pearl s the metal frame adds the rigidity to the whole unit and it was also very thin to hold the keyboard is included so you don't have to worry about getting it as an accessory which is nice and I'm looking at you Microsoft the unit is attached to the display via the magnetic connection and there's something that looks like a kickstand to hold the display in place with two ways to angle the tablet one being the standard laptop like layout and the other a more flat orientation it isn't the most flexible system but with docks like that you got to compromise somewhere dimitri had a lot of fun typing on the keyboard the tactile response was great and the trackpad was very smooth to navigate around with extremely snappy and responsive gestures with things like zoom and side scrolling this is our first time experiencing a Windows tablet with a Super AMOLED display sure the colors are a little saturated in Samsung fashion but the blacks are so deep and sharp the touch screen is accurate and overall we think it's a pretty decent package from Samsung so let us know if you'd like us to take a close look at the samsung galaxy tabpro s in the comment section down below stay tuned for more CES coverage I'm a bar with harbor connects and we'll see you in the next one you",

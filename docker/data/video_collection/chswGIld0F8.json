    "description": "#pcgaming #144hzvs60Hz #bestmonitor I recently got my hands on the first high refresh rate monitor I have ever used and it got me thinking \"Can a noob tell the difference between a 144Hz and 60Hz PC gaming\"  Noob T-shirt available from   To answer this question I enlisted Anna (PC gaming noob who is also a girl) so that we could do some tests.  If you are interested in the CPU cooler in this video, check it out here:   If you are impressed with the results you can buy a high refresh rate monitor here (Amazon Affiliate):  Acer VG271P (Monitor we used):  I would also recommend a VESA mount for this monitor (A better stand):  If you have a bigger budget for a 1440P High refresh rate monitor:   Some High refresh rate Ultrawide action:  G-sync alternative for you guys with an Nvidia GPU:  RTX 2060 in this video:  f you get a 1440P high refresh rate get this graphics card:   Or if you are a complete baller:   -Follow me on whichever Social media you don't hate- Instagram:  Twitter:  YouTube:",

    "transcript": "budget high refresh rate monitors have been available for quite some time and some people seem to think that they're the bee's knees and then they make a massive difference and some people seem to not be able to tell the difference so what we're gonna do today is we're gonna take a new hi Anna and we're going to see how easily she can tell the difference with a double blind test [Music] now before we get into action is shaming and on the Internet we're going to break down the actual testing methodology today now we're gonna test between 60 frames per second and 144 we're gonna have Anna play Doom we're not gonna actually change the frame rates in the game itself we're gonna have that run at the same settings for all of the tests but we're gonna change the refresh rate in the control panel in Windows now Anna's are not going to know which frame rate the monitor is running at and then we're gonna do a control test at a frame rate that she doesn't know and then we're going to do another seven tests to see whether or not she can tell which one is 60 frames per second and which one is 144 and then quickly before we get a girl on-screen I just want to say that the graphics card that we're using as an RT X 2060 which should be able to run Doom and over a hundred and forty four frames per second at 1080p and in the monitor that we're using is an Acer VG 27 one PE I think basically is a 1080p IPS 144 her display that has a one millisecond response time yeah so it should make a pretty good case for whether or not high refresh rate is something we should actually care about and then when we're done with Ana's tests I'm gonna do the same thing you you've made me lose confidence here and we're gonna see just if we can actually tell without the placebo of knowing what the frame rate is say hello hi okay so just so that you know Anna's never actually played doom before so it is a bit of it is gonna be a bit of a new experience for her but you know we're trying to test whether a noob can tell the difference and you know Hannah's being being a good noob here and then just quickly do you have any idea what settings the mantra is on at the moment would you know how to check okay so you're gonna go on the stock mission restart stock okay so this one is just the control and you don't have to play for very long we're gonna die I there are no enemies in the beginning bit so this is just an okay Gowron is how I shoot you click and it's swearing Anna and then you can yeah so you can just kind of wander around yeah yeah so you just walk over things okay so you just kind of go over there as you can see at the frame rate we're getting about 100 ms between 170 119 [Music] no no this is gonna be your first test this is you know there's actually gonna be some pressure here no I'm joking there's no pressure it's it's genuinely about your perception but just keep in mind that it may actually be the same set okay so I didn't necessarily change it but I also didn't necessarily not change okay let's go let's see if you can tell this one like I feel like it feels awesome okay there we go so what's your verdict it was a higher refresh rate you think so yeah okay cool so now I'm gonna look away and I'm gonna change the settings now you said that you think that that test was a higher framerate why do you think that it felt like faster I was moving more quickly and stuff is what and was the difference clearer to you or was it family it I don't know you don't know okay cool so we're gonna do another test which again may be a different frame rate it may be the same we don't know [Music] I think that what you think I was also harder pressure okay cool so now you gonna turn around and we're gonna try again I feel like I'm definitely getting these all wrong we'll see what happens we've got necklace trying to Charlie feels more realistic if this one feels more realistic to you yeah okay get on so if you go close to them you can punch them I think you press F but I'm not sure if using the keyboard in the mouth separately but honestly you're doing quite well considering that this is the first time you've ever played this game and the thing is Anna has never really played shooters but she played some Skyrim like like this is different okay so we're gonna stop it there what do you think that was a lower rate do you think I was low yeah okay perfect so now we're gonna do a cup oh you don't wanna okay okay so we're gonna do a couple more so I turn around and I'm gonna change it okay so this is the last test and then we're gonna review your results how badly you may or may not have I felt like that was low my reason for feeling that way was I moved the mouse like backward so I was like looking across okay and I felt like I could see like shadows and I don't know if that's okay no well that's a very good indication of whether the test that you just did was the lower refresh rate okay and you actually identified what to look for correctly there now for the rest of the test results you didn't actually do very well but it's the last two you got correct okay and that's where you started to identify what the difference is between them so I think one of the issues with the results here so you got you got well you got four out of seven which isn't which isn't too bad yeah yeah they did feel like and and they did seem like most of them were guesses except the last two when you say yeah and now it's my turn so let me show you how to change the refresh rate on the monitor and then we're going to see if I can tell [Music] now it's my turn to actually see whether or not I can tell the difference between 60 frames per second in 144 now this one's the control I don't know what's happening here I do have to give a bit of background here I have never gained on a high refresh rate monitor before the most high refresh rate I've ever used was just on the desktop changing the settings for Ana earlier so I know what the idea is what the difference should be but I've never experienced it firsthand and I have played a little bit of doom so I don't know how much that helps but okay let's start the run and again this is the controller so we don't it it feels very smooth like if regardless of what framerate this is at like it's it's really smooth I'm I know this is the control but I'm gonna say this is 144 grams per second and you're not allowed to tell me if I'm right or not but yeah this feels this feels like that this is the smoothest gaming experience I've ever had okay I can change yeah this just in the menu it feels like 60 so it I actually feel like it just from this little bit of experience that I've had I feel like the place that it matters the most that you can tell the difference the most is actually in the menus because of the like cursor the let's see here we're gonna start run er this is slower this is sickening this is that basically like it it honestly the difference is night and day and I don't I know that if I'm wrong here it's gonna be humiliating but it's the difference is night and day okay you could if you move your it almost makes me dizzy how smooth it is but yeah this is a hundred but this is I I think this is sixteen just through the menu yeah this is 144 so if there's something if I'm getting this wrong like I don't know why I did this something's broken oh yes and I still hasn't showed me she's gonna hand me that that was the chair I'll [__] all put graphics and stuff in wrong alright have you changed this no it was at 144 and you were so confident that's so weird though because I got them all correct yeah and then I just thought cuz honestly the last one could he got confidence this is this still 60 know that someone in Singapore this is 144 mm-hmm I mean you committed to that is pretty cuz honestly it was a bit irritating actually no change in your like for the 60 watch it yeah and then you take note 144 definitely 144 definitely 16 it's 60 you didn't that that is how accurate she forgot to apply the settings change so I was honestly I was looking at that and I was like this does not feel the same yeah honestly the difference is massive it reenie is clear now before I finish off the video we did do the test with Anna again but before we did the double blind tests I sat her down and showed her this is what 60 feels like this is what 144 feels like and then she got four out of five of the tests correct which is way better and they weren't just guesses she could actually kind of start to identify the difference and I think that's kinda shows the point that the the difference between 144 and 60 frames-per-second is also kind of down to the perception of the person so I I do genuinely believe that some people can't tell the difference and some can it's kind of like high-end speakers for some people the difference isn't as clear as others and this test shows that it's not just placebo that they're genuinely is a difference in perception in human beings yeah so what I'd recommend is if you want to get into high refresh rate gaming go to a shop that has a monitor up and have a look if you can tell you don't even need to game on it you can tell by just moving the cursor around on the desktop and if you can't tell stick with your 60 frames per second monitor and if you can get one of these it's an amazing monitor this specific monitor is great I've been gaming on it for the last couple of days after we did these tests and I really would recommend it the colors are beautiful and it responds really well and because it's only 1080p it doesn't put that much of a strain on your graphics card anyway with that thank you very much for watching if you liked the video do like and subscribe to the channel for more videos

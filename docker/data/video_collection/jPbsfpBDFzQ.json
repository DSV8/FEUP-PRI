After getting the Gigabyte Aero 15, there was one thing we wanted to test but it didn't make it into the review:   the use of Microsoft Azure AI to supposedly increase gaming performance.  In doing so it also boosts performance in other apps and gets better battery life too.  But does it actually work as advertised?  Well lets find out!

    "transcript": "so I'm pretty sure you're familiar with this it's the Aero 15 from gigabyte it's actually one of my favorite notebooks to date but back at CES and Computex gigabyte I was actually talking about a ton of ways that they've been working on improving the performance on this line up with some pretty unexpected tech now I won't be covering every bit of this notebook because if you're interested in the full review you can actually check it out right over here but there is a particular feature that I really wanted to try out and that is specifically with gigabyte using artificial intelligence to optimize or give these notebooks the best possible performance as well as give users you know better battery life considering that these laptops feature some really high end specs now I know that sounds like something out of Terminator 3 but here it's not like these machines are gonna rise up and take over the world through these lower books because that's not what we're dealing with here honestly we all know how artificial intelligence is being incorporated in pretty much every area that we're aware of so everything you know from the automotive world where car manufacturers are implementing some sort of AI to enhance self-driving techniques to Windows with image searching heck even the new processors from AMD and GPUs from Nvidia have some basic form of AI that can optimize clock speeds by predicting upcoming system workloads so why not incorporate something like that in a notebook to improve the overall experience let's talk about that right after this let me ask you what is more satisfying than a good peel whoo that hits the spot but you gotta love easy to sync a RGB components for a beautiful light show Thermal takes extensive support with 5-volt a RGB motherboard sync gives you lighting control of fans memory lighting kits all the one coolers power supplies and more by using the 5 volt header on your motherboard you can also daisy chain a bunch of products to light from a single 5 volt header or with their own controller for individual customization but now with a RGB sync it's all made incredibly easy to match check it out below now I do want to take this time to thank gigabyte for partnering up in this video now I also do want to mention that our opinions and performance metrics are solely ours but gigabyte did provide us with some technical information so that I could easily understand how a AI algorithms work specifically on the Aero lineup so the artificial intelligence gigabyte is using for their Aero 15 is called azure for Microsoft and that's actually a name that includes all sorts of cloud-based technologies but the way it works on this notebook is pretty interesting let's see if I can explain this well you see on a laptop you usually have to constantly switch between performance modes in Windows or a secondary utility like control center from gigabyte if you want to get the most out of the system one longer battery life you would select battery saver if you need the best overall performance you'd go with the high power setting and in some gaming notebooks they have their own gaming mode too which emphasizes GP performance now sure you can create a custom power plan in Windows but the options there are pretty limited the same goes for technologies like invidious Optimus which can switch on the fly between a discrete GPU and more efficient IGP depending on system demands but none of these technologies are able to do it all they're either on or off and they don't have the ability to control things like fan speeds not to mention the whole process of switching back and forth between these modes can be a little bit tiring and complicated for novices who just want to operate these notebooks properly that's where Microsoft's Azure AI on the Aero 15 comes in think of it as you know a fully automatic car transmission versus manual transmission on other notebooks well actually okay think of it as Azure is more of an automatic with paddle shifters but more on that later so whats or does is that it monitors power consumption in real-time and when it detects an application requesting for more power if it's cited from the CPU or GPU it'll automatically switch system resources to accommodate that the Aero 15 then sends information about every programs requests to the cloud where as or AI then stores it as more of that information is sent to the cloud the AI learned more about the optimization needed to get the best results in every scenario more importantly all the information for applications you use is actually stored locally and new optimizations are sent to and received from the azure cloud on a regular basis so that means your system could get even better over time and he won't lose the benefits from AI even if you're offline the benefit is that all of this is done automatically but for enthusiasts who really like to tweak and tune with certain settings within their notebook gigabyte certainly gives you the option to adjust those settings within their own control panel so it's not like they're taking that feature away from you it's just that for those users who are looking for the best overall performance without having to fiddle around with settings Azure in this case can come in super handy now obviously we're concerned about giving you the information but gigabyte is actually pretty transparent about that so for instance if you set up this notebook from scratch say for example you're setting up windows and when you get into the desktop screen there will be a little pop-up window that alasc you for your consent to collect data related to system specs like CPU mode operating system version MAC address memory etc and if you're not comfortable doing that you can obviously decline the option to upload data metrics to the cloud okay so essentially what Azure does is that it detects what's primarily on your display so for instance if you're gaming it will equally distribute the power to the GPU and the CPU most likely the GPU in this case that would be its priority because it is the key component when it comes to gaming but say for instance you switch to something a little bit more creative like you're editing a video or running an application that's more CPU intensive it'll make sure that little channel as much as power as it can to the CPU to get the best performance as they'll also make sure that the fan speeds are well under controlled so if you're doing something a little bit more you know system intense then the fan speeds are obviously a little bit higher so that the laptop can breathe properly it can make sure the temperature is under control but if you do something a little bit more productive it'll automatically you know tone down those fan speeds so it's a relatively quiet operation when you're just doing casual tasks like perhaps watching a video or you know working on a word document or something like that basically it takes care of things without having the easier to fiddle around with different settings now I also do want to mention that azure is not meant to push the notebook to its extreme ends but rather offer users a more balanced experience does that mean that they won't have any control over AI not really because you can simply right-click on the icon and disable it and you can go back to control center and change different settings to your desire this kind of refers back to that previous statement that I mentioned how Azure is basically an automatic transmission but it has paddle shifters as well so that it gives users you know the best of both worlds now interestingly if you tweak and tune a profile within control center and if you're comfortable using that for your day-to-day tasks you can actually share that information with Azure by simply uploading it to the cloud now I do want to add a few more things before getting into the performance segments as I mentioned earlier Azure primarily detects what's on your screen so if you decide to connect an external display it might actually not work as you'd like it to because for instance if I have premiere or After Effects running on my secondary monitor and if I have like a word processor running on my primary display it would still detect what's on this display or wouldn't run as efficiently as you'd like it to on your secondary display or that particular application so in a multi monitor scenario a sewer might not work as it's supposed to so that is something to keep note of the other thing is that as I was monitoring clock speeds while gaming when I had AI enabled and gaming mode which is the highest performance percent on control center for this notebook I notice that there was a little bit of a difference between the core frequencies on the rtx 2070 Max-q which is probably why the results or the frame rates with a I enabled was a little bit higher compared to gaming mode so that's another thing that I did notice lastly if you decide to unplug the notebook while doing something intensive it'll switch automatically to battery saver mode which sure seemed obvious you're not gonna be getting the best optimal performance for that certain application you're more likely gonna get the best possible battery life because the hardware's more optimized for that setting all right so with that out of the way let's get into the performance numbers so this Aero 15 classic features a core i7 97 50 H with 16 gigs of ram and dual channel mode a 512 gig nvme SSD and an RTX 2070 max-q GPU and let's start with some synthetic tests so starting with set image r15 there isn't a huge improvement but if you look at blender running the BMW benchmark it actually completes that render 30 seconds faster compared to when AI is disabled and mind you this was in gaming mode because I did want to give as aresome competition so seeing that a channels as much as power as it can to the CPU in this case to render that scene is quite impressive moving on to the Adobe Media encoder test I took this 30 minute 4k project and I exported it to the to 4k preset using Intel Quick Sync and as you can see there is a pretty big difference between you know AI enabled and when you have that disabled by just using game mode within control center and I was actually monitoring the clock speeds within you know Hardware monitor to see what the speeds were when I was running the video and I noticed with AI all six cores were constantly reaching 4 gigahertz here and there whereas with AI disabled the speeds were hovering around 3.3 to 3.5 gigahertz so the fact that AI or Azure is actually channeling all that power to the CPU in this case makes a lot more sense because it actually renders the video a lot faster so that's that's pretty awesome switching gears to gaming and the performance Delta here is very incremental as you can see you're only getting a few frames per second hand there with titles like overwatch apex legends battlefield 1 doom certainly does take a little bit of a hit but I think that's more of an optimization issue so the results really do speak for themselves I mean the performance improvement was very incremental but keep in mind that this was all done automatically without the user having to fiddle around with certain settings all I did was I just turned this or a I button on and it started taking care of its thing now we all have concerns in terms of privacy and what we're giving away and Microsoft and gigabyte they are they have done what they can to minimize concerns which is why they have that a little pop-up window that asks for your consent so you can either agree or disagree it's totally up to the user but I feel like as or AI is a step in the right direction it's constantly evolving over time and I can't wait to see what gigabyte and Microsoft can come out with in the next few years I also have a question for you guys if you own an Aero 15 notebook have you tried out Microsoft Azure ai and what has your experience been like definitely China in the comments down below let me know what you guys think about the performance differences between ai ai and of course gaming mode with the whole Mac stop setting what are you guys impressed or yeah I just would love to know your thoughts about that in the comments I'm Eber with hurricane axe thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

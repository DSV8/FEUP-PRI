    "description": "Arctic MX-2/MX-4 on Amazon -  Grizzly Kryonaut on Amazon -   Last week's video addressed thermal throttling that some of Apple's computers suffer from. Inadequate cooling has hampered the performance of MacBook Pro and even iMac. Snazzy Labs' Quinn Nelson takes on the task of cooling down his MacBook Pro to keep the fans quiet, temperatures low, and CPU performance high.

    "transcript": "Extreme heat and computers dont play nicely together as I demonstrated in my last videowhich you should watch first if you havent seen it. But knowing that Apples MacBook Pro and iMac experience thermal throttling doesnt help you any. A lot of people on the last video recommended apps like Macs Fan Control or SMC to max the fan speed out before you anticipate resource-intensive activities like video editing or gaming. But that doesnt really help. Sure, it engages the fans early, and it will delay thermal throttling a few seconds, but you cant put out a forest fire with an extra bucket of sand. The simple fact is that the cooling system inside the Mac cant adequately cool the CPU when it is under full loadregardless of fan speed. I mentioned that I obviously cant add a fan or heat pipe to my laptop, but I might be able to do something to mitigate throttling. Cooling a CPU is actually a pretty simple concept. Gamers Nexus has an excellent video you should watch if youre interested, but the basic idea is that a copper block and heat pipes draw heat away from the CPU and spread the heat out on a fin-array radiator where its exhausted from the machine by a fan. In order to eliminate all the air bubbles in the tiny gap between the CPU and the cooler, thermal paste is used to effectively transfer heat between the two. And its important. If Apple doesnt apply enough thermal paste from the factory, or they use a low-quality paste, it may be hampering the effectiveness of the MacBook Pros cooler. So, I decided to take apart my 2017 base-model 13 MacBook Pro to re-apply quality thermal paste. Upon pulling the cooler off I couldnt help but laugh. This thing is so thin that Im surprised it does anything at all and I was a little skeptical that my thermal paste could be at all effective. That said, the thermal paste Apple applied did look poorly done. The paste already felt dried out and crumbly which is unusual for a computer thats only a few months old. I removed the old paste with rubbing alcohol and a microfiber cloth to make room for the new stuff. I first tried Arctic MX-2. Its Arctic's cheap, industrial paste that you can only buy in big tubes like this one. I use it in all my builds and think its a good combo of value and performance. Ill admit, I certainly applied more than necessary, but as demonstrated by LinusTechTips, too much thermal paste is much better than not enough and you really have to apply a TON of thermal paste before youll experience negative side effects. I put the computer back together, booted it successfully, and ran my Final Cut Pro benchmark 4 times, took the average, and HOT DOG! Or should I say, cool dawg! The computer exported the video about 7% faster. Thats quite a bit! So I started to get excited and I pulled the machine apart again to use Grizzly Kryonaut which is super expensive thermal paste designed for overclocking. I re-assembled the machine yet again, ran the Final Cut benchmark another 4 times and the average was another 2% better. Thats nearly a 9% improvement on a modification that takes 20 minutes and $10. The machine still hits 100 degrees Celsius and it still thermal throttles, but it doesnt decrease the clockspeed as severely. Taking apart your MacBook Pro is not for the faint of heart. There are several very delicate ribbon connectors you can damage, an obscene amount of differently sized screws you need to keep track of, and an annoyingly tight CPU cooler retention bracket. Yes, there is better performance, yes, it is measurable. But is a mere 9% improvement worth the time and risk of doing it yourself? Probably not.",

    "transcript": "Martin you've got lots and lots of experience you see threats all the time but what are sort of two or three major threats that people need to be worried about or aware of going into 2024. So number one it's been an issue for years, it's still way way up there is the threat of ransomware, there is a lot of it about it's very profitable for the bad guys it's not going to go away that's number one. Number two that emerging threat would be um threats against networked uh systems so uh non-traditional IT system, systems routers, switches, firewalls, um IoT systems I'd be concerned about and if you want me to mention a third I'd say spyware and the risk to bad guys stealing our personal data from our personal devices. Like installing stuff on your phone uh. That and everything else.",

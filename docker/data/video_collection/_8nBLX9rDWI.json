    "transcript": "well hello good people can you mic sound like this so the new G Pro headset I'm really happy to see a new Pro line of products because the pro series is all about design but collaboration eSports players giving the feedback on like the shape of the mouse and the weight announce the clique enos the keyboard switches and the same thing with the headsets and this is the first product from Logitech that incorporates something from blue because Logitech acquired Blue Microphones and I'm really happy to to see something being incorporated to improve the microphone I feel like this might become the new benchmark to beat for a gaming headset under $100 let's take a look after this the master pen series from Coolermaster has now received a fresh new look with a square frame designed to generate high pressure air flow and silent operation the fans feature this beautiful addressable RGB illumination and you can pick it up in 120 240 and 360 millimetre variants learn more in the description down below so first let's talk about the price $99 for the standard headset and $129 for the Pro X which includes the USB dongle that has the built-in Blu voice functionality to be honest I was expecting hardware integration with Blue Microphones into the Logitech headset instead of it being software only in terms of design they do remind me of the HyperX cloud series similar type of headband with stitching on the side the stamping of the pro into the leatherette the size extensions are quite similar with the aluminum sort of hinges that feel quite premium but there is no rotation the United degree rotation like we've seen on the previous G pro headset I do like the coiled cable in each ear cup that adds this retro design and the overall frame here is pretty subdued with matte black plastic which again is found on a hyper X series a black aluminum black leather and the silver accents with the G logo in the middle and if you remove the microphone you can easily wear these outdoors they're not ridiculous like the Chiefs piece 670 or like the Sun Heiser series I would use these for music no problem the left and right distinction is inside the ear cup so don't bother looking on the action frame we have a separate velour earpads set which is nice they don't accumulate as much heat but based wrapping is much better with the leather ear cups and as usual logitech includes plenty of accessories like a splitter cable your mobile cable we have a pc cable that has a volume wheel and we also have the USB dongle on the pro-x headset and a nice little carry pouch overall I feel like they've improved on the build quality you can stretch this thing you can extend the size extensions to their maximum and the headset still feels quite solid which is not what I can say about the original G Pro had said size extensions and the whole frame just feels kind of plasticky and kind of cheap and fragile in comparison the new pair is just a lot more comfortable much better clamping force it's not too tight but it's there so that you can create a nice seal around the ears given the software ear cushions and the drivers here are the same 50 millimeter G Pro drivers but they've been tuned differently I can definitely hear the difference versus the original they're more detailed there's a lot more clarity but everything is a bit closer verses on the original G Pro the soundstage I felt like was a bit quieter things felt a bit more airy and a little bit more soft too now compared comfort wise to my current favorite $99 gaming headset the GSP 300 the pro and the Pro X have more clamping force which means they create better isolation which I would say is a good thing but the overall ear cup design on the GSP 300 is slightly better so the ear cups are oval and they're taller and the actual driver wall is slightly deeper so that when they're on my head and I press the actual ear cup my ear still does not make contact with that internal driver wall which is nice for larger ears but not the same thing with the Pro and the Pro X and for those who wear glasses the clamping force is pretty good I don't feel like there's any additional pressure being accumulated on the sides over here nice although glasses I feel like I'm more comfortable with the GSP 300 because the ear cups are not as wide as on the Pro and Pro X which means that there's less contact area between the ear cup and the actual glasses arm as for sound gaming performance whatever they were doing with the G Pro drivers they should be doing more of it really happy with the entire performance and this is something that Logitech has been like really drilling down saying that they don't color the entire range try to make sure that drivers do not distort on the lower end so that the bass you hear is actually the base you should hear and not something that is being boosted and I do appreciate that they sound much better versus the original G Pro which have the same drivers but slightly different tuning on the new pair better definition throughout the entire range deeper bass and the closer closed or closed they're less open soundstage so things do sound more detailed when they are closer and that is one compromise I did enjoyed the openness of the original G pro but I've been thinking for a gaming headset closed soundstage for a closed pair makes sense but compared to my GSP 300 I feel like this one has better audio separation throughout the entire range when a lot of things are going on because they have a slightly wider soundstage versus the Pro X is very closed but both have really nice control treble smooth not harsh no distortions bass is like the deeper on the GSP 300 but with the Pro X you can actually add a bit of bass in the EQ settings via the dongle and that actually adds a nice little oomph in the lower end without distorting anything which is awesome overall I feel like they've done a really good job with tuning these drivers to make them sound still really fun but not flat or harsh on a high end and the bass is still present and you can play around with the EQ settings without totally destroying the entire spectrum and now ladies and gentlemen the microphone test which seems to be a really important part for Logitech and it's integration with Blu voice but I do want to remind you that this is only available on the Pro X headset because of the USB dongle and not on the pro headset which doesn't have it so I'll touch base on the main microphone section over here first let me go into the equalizer this is all the basic things you can adjust different EQ settings a bunch of presets are already pre-loaded which is nice same thing with different game genres one cool thing I found is that you can create your EQ profile and share it so you can download your friends profiles and what you're listening to or potentially a player that you follow which I found really cool in the acoustic tab here we have our volume microphone input and side tone and the sight on here is appropriately loud so if I max it out I can hear exactly what I'm saying so the microphone is sensitive if you want to really monitor how loud you are speaking or if you can lower it if you don't find that to be useful to you here we also have noise removal for the microphone and surround sound but as I've said earlier surround sound and here even with like different settings surprisingly poor not as good as we've seen or as I've heard with a g9 33 or the 600 series but really the star of the show is the microphone tab and they've done such a good job here outlining all different parameters and you can hover over a little question marks to learn about which of these what they do but if you're not into all the little things you can also play around with different presets either the pro broadcaster presets from different players or different blue voice presets which I've found to be really good starting points I'm like tweaking them a little bit and what you're listening to now is my custom preset that I've also listened to and make sure that it's kind of what I like to hear and you can enable voice so this is right now without any blue voice software parameters interacting with the recording and now it is with so nice bass good broadcast quality nice compression the really cool thing they've done here is let you record the little mic test and then play around with different parameters in EQ settings so you can hear how the microphone will sound and only then apply the preset or save that as a preset which I found really cool my favorite out of the bunch would be the broadcast to preset and I've tweaked it they'll slightly networks well for my voice and now let me plug in a different headset like the original G Pro so you can hear the difference between this microphone and the improved six millimeter capsule so what you listen to now is that recorded by the original G Pro headset going through the same DAC so all my parameters that I've applied for the Pro X headset now goes into the original G Pro and it sounds almost identical like the difference with the preset applied are almost noticeable in even if I disable voice right now the actual quality of the microphone sounds identical even though it is a formula or a capsule instead of six and now we got the GSP 300 plugged into the same USB DAC and listen to what happens to my voice when I enable blue voice all right so now we're listening to the same personal sound said through the GSP 300 there's just something off about it even if I tweaked my expander/gate set settings noise reduction presets and stuff like that they're just it doesn't sound as good as it does on a G Pro X and the same can be set with the GSP 500 right now Blu voice is enabled everything's going and the same DAC so I haven't changed anything but the headset and there's just something off about the vocal clarity even with when the blue voice is enabled when I disable it the microphone sounds pretty good and that could be the reason why larger stick is not selling the USB hub separately because it might interact with different microphones and might not benefit some microphones over others I was hoping to see more hardware implementation with blue microphones instead of it being really software focused and it's kind of weird because I always felt that proline was always meant to be simplified it's just like it's right there it works but here they went like above and beyond in terms of customizing your voice to make you sound Pro and it's more like audio editing software instead of being a feature and sure we have multiple presets built-in and you can go in and spend some time or like customizing to see what each slider does and how it affects your voice but it's almost like going against or the pro line is all about and when we asked if they will sell the dongle separately so that you can connect the different headset to it and still utilize the blue voice functionality they are kind of hesitant on that and I understand it because when testing my own headsets plugging in different things they sound different and therefore it could compromise the whole blue voice feature if you're plugging in the headset and it sounds terrible right so on that front I get it but again it had to be something clarified because my initial impression was like why don't you just sell this dongle separately so that I could utilize this voice functionality with plenty of my other headsets but the old you sound quite different versus this one alright good people so let me know your thoughts about the microphone quality and the whole blue voice functionality I definitely think it adds value but being the $30.00 dongle and surround sound being kind of terrible that is the only thing you're paying for but in terms of its being competitive the pro by itself $99 is pretty decent but it is again competing with like their cloud alpha or the cloud 2 and they'll be interesting to see which headset people will gravitate towards in the long term because right now I feel like that cloud is like the dominant thing when it comes to designs like this alright I'm Dimitri thanks so much for watching I'll talk to you in the next video",

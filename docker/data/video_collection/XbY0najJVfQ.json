    "transcript": "- Hey guys, Jonathon here and last year I did an iPhone 7 \"one hour in water test\". But, I would say at the very least, that bowl of water was lacking in size. This year, we're upgrading. We got an entire fountain. It's bigger, it's better. There, of course, is way more water. Not only that, the brand new iPhone 8, I also have the Galaxy S8 and we're gonna put these two side by side. Now, the Galaxy S8 is IP68 certified, whereas the iPhone 8 is IP67. Before anyone jumps out there and claims victory of the Galaxy S8, essentially what that means is that this is supposed to be able to handle just a little bit deeper, in terms of depths of water, than the iPhone 8. So, with that said, let's drop these guys in, and see how they fair after one hour. Part of me wants to get it in the fountain. I don't know if that's a good idea though. (grunts) I don't know how deep it is, I don't know how deep that is. I mean, it's in water there. We good. (grunts) Oh, sorry UltraBoosts for what I have done. Did he jump in? - [Ralphy] I don't know. - [Rich] Yeah. - [Ralphy] Where'd he go? - [Rich] Don't know. - [Ralphy] I don't wanna like, point at him. - Wait, he jumped in? Wait, why did he jump in? (playful music) (rocket launching) So, we are just about a minute away and things might be a little awkward right now, because when I started this video, I probably didn't look like this. But, that is because during that hour, I actually tested out some 240 fps slow motion video on the iPhone 8, comparing it to a $30,000 red camera. So, if that sounds interesting, stay tuned because that's gonna drop tomorrow. Turn notifications on if you haven't yet, so you don't miss that. But, right now, we're about 50 seconds away from seeing how the iPhone 8, how the Galaxy S8 faired in an hour, in a fountain. Ten. Nine. It's a little colder now. And, I'm way more colorful. Eight. Seven. Six. Five, four. Three. Two. One. I see the iPhone. (grunts) Ooh, damn, shoulder cramp. Shoulder cramp. (grunts) Timer's on. See what's new on iOS 11. Alright, we are good. Home button works. See if I can enter the password. Both of these are still alive and well. 1-2-3-4-5-6, for those of you who want to hack my phone. Galaxy S8 on the left, iPhone 8 on the right. Both are looking pretty good. Home button's working, the virtual home button on the infinity display. We got a train coming along but, that's okay. Shout out to Thomas. Right now from there, since the screen's look good, I'm gonna actually test out the cameras right now. Get a little video test. That looks good. Rich, say hi. Damn dude, that's a smile. Hey, I like your Fry-Day shirt. Hopping over to the Galaxy S8. Flip that camera. Video. There we go. Rich, gimme that Fry-Day smile. - It's Friday. - Back to Ralphy. So, both are actually working pretty well. Submerged for an hour in the fountain. You guys missed a full comparison on that. And also, a chance to win either a brand new Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 8. Check out the video here. Thank you guys very much for watching. Hopefully you did and you were feeling like being awesome. Make sure to smash that like button and I'll catch you guys later.",

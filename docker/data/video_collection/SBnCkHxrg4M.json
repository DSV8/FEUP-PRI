    "transcript": "this is a test this is a microphone test please put on headphones for the best audio experience welcome to the ultimate headset microphone comparison good people I'm Dmitri welcome to another video today we're going to rely on your ears to determine which microphone sounds best what would you like so I'm looking for a gaming headset with a bit of everything but not overkill something that folds on your neck sure how about the light frame without excessive clamping force yes yes you have to will ear cushions with proper internal padding excellent I will take the cable and the microphone are removable fine fine this is the one multi-platform compatibility with virtual surround sound dongle avail can I just take one and the sound quality you'll be satisfied with so the new coolermaster MH 751 and 75 to are here to make your gaming experience now why do people still buy gaming headsets easy the inclusion of a microphone is just so convenient to sum the microphone quality is crucial to others not so much as long as their voice is loud and can be audible with their teammates and then there's the other category of people who want to use their favorite pair of headphones for gaming and then attach a microphone which is basically how the mod mic system has become so popular and for today's comparison we have 5 very popular wireless gaming headsets so you can observe the vocal difference if you have my favorite wired headsets as well and just to establish a reference point I have the mod like 4 and 5 that are wired to get the full perspective on this comparison and to make this more interesting I'd like to read a little excerpt from homo Deus a brief yet fascinating history of lawns and you'd be the judge on what microphone sounds best to you was true of grand social revolutions is equally true at the micro level of everyday life a young couple building a new home for themselves may ask the architect for a nice lawn in front of the art why a lawn because lawns are beautiful the couple might explain but why do they think so it has a history behind it Stone Age hunter gatherers do not cultivate grass at the entrance of their caves no green meadow welcomed the visitors to the Athenian Acropolis the Roman capital the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem or the Forbidden City and Beijing the idea nurturing a lawn at the entrance to private residences and public buildings was born in the castles of French and English aristocrats in the late Middle Ages in the early modern age this habit struck deep roots and became the trademark of nobility well-kept lawns demanded land and a lot of work particularly in the days before lawnmowers and automatic water sprinklers in exchange they produced nothing of value you can't even grace animals in them because they would eat and trample the grass humans thereby came to identify lawns with political power social status and economic wealth no wonder that in the 19th century the rising bourgeoisie enthusiastically adopted the lawn at first only bankers lawyers and industrialists could afford such luxuries and their private residences yet when the Industrial Revolution broadened the middle class and gave rise to the lawnmower and then the automatic sprinkler millions of families could suddenly afford a home turf in American suburbia a spic and span lawn switched from being a rich person's luxury into a middle-class necessity grass is nowadays the most widespread crop in the USA after maize and wheat and the lawn industry plants manure mowers sprinklers gardeners account for billions of dollars every year having read the short history of the lawn when you now come to plan your dream house you might think twice about having a lawn in your front yard you are of course still free to do it but you're also free to shake off the cultural cargo beacuse to you by the European Dukes capitalist moguls and the Simpsons and imagine for yourself a Japanese rock garden or some altogether new creation this is the best reason to learn history not in order to predict the future but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies of course this is not total freedom we cannot avoid being shaped by the past but some freedom is better than none thus the no cable situation which is why I chose to read this portion in the first place everything you just heard was unfiltered and I'm pretty happy with my wide selection of microphones the asana is pretty great with some variability in bass and trouble but they all have nice pickup here but the modmic Wireless impressive when compared to the wired selections and totally blows everything else when it comes to wireless headsets just it's no competition the catch over is the price of a hundred and nineteen dollars the microphone alone is more expensive than these standalone wired headsets which is okay crazy so for 120 bucks for a microphone alone this is one luxury add-on and so the magnetic and easily removable clamp system means you can attach the modmic to any headphone and previous iterations took into account the modularity of the whole assembly plus some cable management techniques on the mod like five but this new wireless model really changes the game for a more convenient contraption because look no wires only for the headphone of course the main body is a little chunky but very light so there's no way tension from the microphone and there's steel boom arm stays in position unless intentionally bent and you can easily mute the mic with a power button and observe battery and connection status via the USB receiver that matches the LEDs on the mic itself we have 12 plus hours of battery life and a micro USB port for charging and two microphone modes one broadcast quality or the omnidirectional what would you've been listening to now and then the second mode is unidirectional or noise cancelling so it sounds very much in line - you know all gaming headsets but you can definitely tell there is a lot more processing going on to eliminate all that background noise and so the convenience factor for the new mod mic Wireless is really up here and it takes it to the next level based on previous iterations of the mod mic you know the whole idea of being able to attach a microphone to your favorite pair of headphones is awesome but now because it's wireless and we have multiple you know magnetic clamps means that the microphone is not really fixed to a headphone because you know you can move it from one pair to another and it's quite modular the microphone quality of course is pretty excellent for being Wireless it does compete very closely to the previous iterations for the Modmic 5 that has a little bit more base and character a little bit less compression but for a wireless iteration that has no cables attached you don't have to route it through your headphone cable is I would say you know a nice value add for a little compromise on the sound quality but you let me know which microphone sounded best to you in the comments all right thanks so much for watching all the headsets and microphones will be linked in the description below I'll be tree I'll talk to you guys in the next video",

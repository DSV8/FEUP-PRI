    "transcript": "- Everyone loves Wifi, right? Use it on your phone, your laptop your whatever thing that uses Wifi. Well what if I told you you could make it better? MSI sponsored this video to show off their RadiX AXE6600 that could do just that. It's got Wifi 6E, it's got pretty lights and best of all you can check out their virtual launch event at the link down in the description. But let's unbox it cause that's what you're really here for. It's got cool stuff on the outside. I'm not really sure what Meta ready means but I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg is a big fan. Just on the outside of the box because this is Wifi 6E supported you're gonna have 2.4G 5G and 6G. Which you know, this is actually not a terrible analogy for kind of how it works. 2.4Gs like the single lane road, the 5Gs like the two lane road, 6Gs like look at all these lanes. This is an American highway damn it. Oh are they pre-attached? That's kind of cool. A lot of the times when you get routers like this you have a a big bundle of antennas you have to put on yourself but this one, pre-attached. Look at that. Got an ethernet cable. It's important. And a power brick. On the outside the MSI logo feels like a button its definitely a button. I don't think it would be a power button cause this is like a Wifi router. You don't really want it to be off. I suspect that this is probably for switching the quality of service mode. We've got our six antennas. Each of these, you see how there's like a little translucent part there's RGB in here. And the color changes according to what your quality of service profile is. You got red for gaming, purple for streaming dark blue for work from home and then the kind of cyan light blue is AI auto mode. You can think of QoS or quality of service kind of like an HOV lane on the highway except not everyone gets to go in. You pick whatever your most important traffic is. So I imagine gaming it's gonna prioritize game related traffic streaming is gonna prioritize your connection to Twitch or YouTube. Work from home. Not really sure on that one but I'm sure it's something. Basically think of it like an HOV lane where that traffic let's say our game packets get prioritized. They get access to go through before any of the other traffic on your network. If you're in a situation where you've run out of bandwidth say you've got a one gigabit connection and the clients on your network want to use like 1.1 gigabit well it's gonna put that game traffic before the rest of the traffic in every situation. And that means you know, if you're gaming you're not gonna have lag despite other people using your network a lot. And and the same for streaming. I mentioned the AI auto QoS mode and that's basically just gonna use an algorithm that's pre-programmed onto the router itself to try to prioritize traffic based on the needs of your network's users. You can also go on the web interface and pick specific services that you're using to prioritize. So say you're like really heavy YouTube watcher and there's lots of people on your network well you can go in there and hit YouTube and it'll prioritize that for you, which we'll we'll see later. On the outside I did confirm this is the QoS button. We've got an arrangement of LEDs. That one will probably be for internet. You've got a link activity led for all of the ports and then power WPS for Wifi protected setup. Wifi button, maybe that turns Wifi on and off, I don't know. And then there's an led off button. Especially when you got lots of lights like this. If you have this thing in your bedroom or something and you're trying to go to sleep, having a button to turn them off is a lot nicer than having to go into the web interface. On the back we've got four gigabit ports and a 2.5 GB WAN and LAN which is great. This is Wifi 6E base. So if you had a above gigabit connection, you probably could get above gigabit through this router on Wifi. Wifi 6E got a USB 3.0 port presumably for expanding storage power button and the end power. And of course there's a reset as well. You see those two little silver stripes here. Those are actually heat pipes and then in between them is a like a giant aluminum heat sink. This thing has got some serious cooling and it's gonna need that for the 1.8 gigahertz quad core CPU that powers the thing. I mean even just looking at the power brick this guy says 12 volt, 3.5 amp, 42 watts. That's a fair bit of power and it should mean a fair bit of performance. They did mention in their talking points that the heat pipes and array they have in here resulted in a 12 degree lower temperature. I'm assuming that means compared to not having this upgraded cooling. But yeah, should should run cool and quiet. Oh it's connected. Wow. Oh cool. Look at this. This is great. When you log in to use your router for the first time, use the admin page for the first time. It just prompts you. Do you want to change the name of the Wifi network? So many people, I go to their house and it's like tellus7392 like bruh you can change that (beep). Wow, look at this dashboard. It's so pretty. Wireless clients. We have one and it's my MacBook Pro. That makes sense. Cool. I could block it. Ooh, spicy. Memory. We got traffic analyzer. We're not using a whole lot of traffic. AI auto mode. It appears they're using a third party service called GT booster to power the AI QoS and the parental control feature. If you're somebody who isn't super into like phoning home and stuff, you can just disagree and use traditional QoS. But I am going to agree. Oh look, it's doing stuff now. It had one breath, one singular breath. Oh it breathed again. Did you see the breath? Ayy red breath right? And then it is updating in the web GUI as I click it. Maybe not instantly, but within a few seconds it updated. That's pretty cool. Okay, so work from home prioritizes online meeting streams and conference calls. So that actually makes sense. So like zoom or anything like that, it'll prioritize in the work from home setting which could actually be important if you don't have great internet. I'm always thinking from the perspective of you know if you had gigabit and you were trying to use 1.1 gigabit but if you have like 20 down 5 up that's when features like this are really important. Oh (beep) You can sync the RGB on this thing with the RGB on your pc, your MSI pc. That's actually kind of kind of awesome. You got port forwarding in here. It's important if you want to like host a Minecraft server for your friends or something like that. Integrated open VPN which is sweet network analysis. Do a ping trace route, aim server lookup, net stent all the usual stuff in here. Now there's actually a fair bit of control in here. I'm gonna set our, our six gigahertz to 160 wide 'cause we want lots, lots of speed. As much speed as possible. What can you do? Is this a schedule? Can I make a schedule for when this Wifi's on? I can make a schedule for when the Wifi is on. Cool. So I hate my kids. Wow. There's actually a lot of there's a lot of options in here. Six gig guard interval can convert multicast to unicast which is usually called multicast enhancement. That's good. Oh here, let's try the LED off. Oh I turned off these LEDs. Bruh. Appreciate MSI sponsoring this video. But this LED off button should very much turn the LEDs of this off as well. It seems kind of silly. I wanna look at the propaganda quick start guide. Ooh, it's one of these. Hi, let just break out my map really quick. I like that it gives you a URL to connect to instead of an IP. Cause if you change the subnet on your router then whatever IP that they put on there wouldn't work. They have a phone app. Hey look at that. I'm screen recording, don't worry. Look at it. It's basically the same. Devices. We got that there. Game center. Game turbo booster. You can turn that on, you can adjust your QoS profile. Oh you can schedule a daily reboot. That's cool. Oh cool. It's scanning the band you're using, so like 2.4 or five or six gigahertz and telling you the other networks that are using it. It which is these two. So if you're trying to figure out like problems with interference, you can use a tool like this to scan the surroundings and maybe change the channel that this access point is using to different them. Say your neighbors to reduce the amount of interference. All right, that's like a great little app. A lot of them don't have apps like this and you just have to use the web interface and a lot of the web interfaces are not optimized for using on a phone, which obviously if you just wanna change your Wifi password or adjust your parental controls really quick not having to break out a computer is pretty nice. You can set multiple SSIDs. So if you wanted to have like a Wifi called Jake's Wifi and then you could have another Wifi that says Bell is not the real Jake. You could have both of them at the same time and you can set different passwords for them. Great, you can do it by band even. So only on the six gigahertz if you have an extra one whatever you want. Guest network. Oh crap, you can have a guest access too. This is a pretty featured little Wifi Guy here. I've only ever had like is ISP provided or like Amazon access points and then I went to like a full enterprise solution. I never kind of went in between. So it's amazing that a lot of these enterprise features are also available on a kind of consumer product like this. Not to say that it's not fast, but it is more oriented at normal people. As part of the quality of service features MSI has game accelerator built into this router access point. I guess it's part of the gaming quality of service profile to ensure that when you are gaming the gaming traffic packets are the number one priority. So you don't have any interruptions in your gaming. It's not gonna help you if your ISP sucks but assuming everything coming into this is good it should keep gaming good. Okay, we got our AEP here positioned optimally very close to our, our computer. We're on Wifi 6E. Oh it doesn't know that's why. Whoa. 1100 down 1200 down. Damn brother. 1200 up to, oh it went down to 1100 still above it is quite literally faster than the hardwired network ports on this lap. Oh it's almost 1500 now. Oh, 1326. Let's go. 1500. Holy (beep) The laptop's fan is actually like kicking up because the speed test is so fast. One thing I will mention with Wifi 6E because it's six gigahertz instead of five gigahertz it's gonna have less penetrating power. It also means that to get crazy crazy speeds like above gigabit like this, you know as soon as we move this guy over here we'll probably be able to see a reduction in speed. But I mean if you're in the same room you should probably be able to get at least gigabit, maybe above, still almost a thousand down. Mind you, this is not the be all and end all of speed testing because there is a server on the other end that is being used by other people you never know. All right, the upload speed is still 1500 up and we're this far. Should I go on a little walk? Here we go, everyone we're walking, we're walking. I'm probably I mean you can see the short circuit set over there. I'm probably 20 feet away now, almost 800 down. See what the upload speed's like. Oh we're still getting, still uploading at a gigabit. So I mean yes, there was a reduction 20 feet away. I'm still getting 1100 up. Like that's, that's pretty good. Okay, we're gonna pretend that we're Riley here. This is the tech news. Oof. Oof. I'm a lot further. Probably a hundred feet maybe, maybe not a hundred feet. Let's say 50 feet through a bunch of metal and shelves and the signal is is gone down a lot because it's six gigahertz the range is not gonna be as good. So we're only getting like 200 up, 130 down. But if we switch back to the 5G and you could have these on the same SSID and they would switch automatically much better 200 down and upload speed closer like 250, 230, 230, yeah. Let's do, I'm gonna do one over here. So it's just, we're pretty close. It's just on the other side of that wall. But we have one wall between us now. It's still pretty good. I mean a lot of people's 5G is gonna cap out at like 500, 600. So 500 down, 700 up through a wall. Sweet. Overall really fast Wifi, with Wifi 6E. You can do up to eight streams across the three bands for a theoretical max of 6.6 gigabit, which is super fast. You've got the 2.5 GB WAN, which is great to see especially since Wifi 6E can support it. And we just saw that. Nice build doesn't feel like it's getting hot or anything. I do wish the LED off button would turn those LEDs off. But other than that, pretty cool product. If you wanna pick up the MSI RadiX AXE6600 you can go on New Egg and use code Luckyhundred until March 15th to save a hundred bucks off of the MSRP which is 349. So 249. That's a pretty good deal for something with this much horsepower. You can also get it on the MSI store, but that won't be at a discount. So you might as well buy it from New Egg. So thanks for watching. If you like this video, give it a like if you didn't like it, hit the dislike button. Yeah, it does a lot. Bye. [off camera] -No!",

    "transcript": "Today, were gonna be talking about one of the many items behind me in this set. A set which, for some reason, some of you think isnt real(?) Even as I reach for the item in question, a physical item in the physical set that I physically sit in front of, a few of you will convince yourselves that this is all an elaborate compositing effort because well frankly I dont know why. I mean, it shouldbe obvious from my videos that After Effects is a program I open accidentally, stare at in terror, and then feel guilty about never bothering to learn despite multiple new years resolutions. And yet some of you think me and Captain Disillusion are the same person - how? We sound nothingal- anyway I will now reach for the thing. That is a real dust spot, by the way. This is a Canon F-1, a 35mm single-lens reflex camera introduced in 1971. Single-lens reflex, often shortened to SLR, means that the view through the viewfinder is through the same lens that exposes the film. This isdone with the aid of a mirror which redirects light from the lens onto a ground-glassfocusing screen to allow the shot to be composed exactly as it will be captured onfilm, eliminating the parallax error from a separate viewfinder and allowing you to preview the depth-of-field of a stopped-down lens. When the shutter is released, the mirror is swung up and out of the way, allowing the light from the lens to land on the film itself (after the shutter has opened, of course). I love this camera, though I havent used it in quite some time, and were gonna talk a lot about analog photography as time goes on but this particular video is about one fundamental aspect of how you use it - its light meter. Now, quickside-note, there were plenty of cameras with automatic exposure available to the consumer whenthis was released. Like this Olympus Pen EES-2, which you better believe well talk about someday because its got all sorts of weirdness, but the Canon F-1 is entirely manual, and in fact entirely mechanical. Thats a large part of why I love it. Its built like a tank, weighing in at just shy of 850 grams or nearly 2 pounds. Thats without a lens or film, mind you. Lightness was never a priority. By the way, despite its uncanny resemblance to some sort of LCD screen, this thing is in fact nothing but a holder for the torn-off end of a box of film, to serve as a reminder of what ya put in it. Interacting with this camera is so delightful - everything is where it is because thats where it needed to be. All the controls are physically connected to the mechanisms they activitave which makes them delightfully chunky. Youcan see how turning the film advance lever cocks the shutter by moving the two halves of theshutter curtain in unison, and you can even hear the little clockwork mechanism that controls theshutters timing at long exposures. Take a listen. [ticking sound] [clack; ticking stops] Still, even with the constraints in place, Canon managed to make thisbrick of a camera decently ergonomic (forrighties, anyway). Your thumb, index finger, and middle fingers rest naturally on the film advance, shutter release, and front control respectively. My personal favorite thing is that front control. Push the lever towards the lens and it closes the aperture so you can get a depth-of-field preview in the viewfinder, but turn it the other way and you can feel that youre winding something up. Well [rapid high pitched ticking] Oh god, the suspense. CLACK I just love that. Thats its self-timer. Oh, andthat little lever on the bottom? That is used to lock the aperture preview in place, and lift the mirror for vibration-free long exposures. This camera requires no batteries to function and yet it can do pretty much anything you can reasonably expect a 35mm camera to do. Well, aside from auto-focus and motorized film winding. I did say this was entirely manual. The F-1 was designed to be incredibly modular, though, and you could accessorize it with all sorts of things from motor drives to different viewfinders to bulk film backings. This one, though, is in its stock form. It has the standard everything. And, while it does not need any batteries whatsoever to function, it does have a battery compartment on the bottom. In here lies a small coin battery which powers the light meter. Whats a light meter? Well, its not a questionable astronomical unit, its instead an information display. Alright, quick crash-course in basic photography. Almost every camera ever can control the amount of light that hits the film or image sensor in twoways: the lens aperture, and the shutter speed. Inside the lens is a multi-bladed diaphragm that can, to put it in rather basic terms, reduce the size of the lenss opening through constriction. Those are what the F numbers on a lens are, and the higher the number, the more constrictedthat opening becomes, thus the less light makes it through to the film or sensor. A side-effectof this is that the depth-of-field, thats the range of depths that are in-focus, becomes deeper the more constricted the lens becomes. That means that more of the image is in focus, much to the chagrin of bokeh fans, when a higher F number, and thus smaller aperture, is used. Notethat for landscape photography and other scenarios where nothing is close to the camera, thedepth-of-field becomes more or less irrelevant. The shutter speed, meanwhile, is (instill photography) the amount of time the shutter remains open. Leave it openfor longer and you can collect more light, hardly open it at all and you collect less of it. The trade-off here is that long exposures require very still scenery (and probably a tripod) as any motion will be blurred. Shorter exposures on the other hand will freeze motion, but they require more light through awider-open aperture. Shutter speed is measured in fractions of a second, and this camera is capableof speeds from 1 second to 1/2000th of a second. B, short for bulb, will leave the shutter open as long as the shutter release is pressed. Theres an inverse relationship between shutter speed and aperture. Higher F numbers allow less light through the lens which means the shutter has to stay open longer to collect the same amount of light. And, if ashorter shutter speed is desired, the aperture has to open wider to allow more light through the lens. In order for the exposure to be correct, the aperture and shutter speedmust be an appropriate combination for the amount of light available in the scene and the sensitivity of the film or sensor. However, once you know one combination that works, you can adjust the shutter or aperture up or down so long as you adjust the other setting appropriately in the opposite direction. The F-numbers, by the way, are as weird as they seem to be because the number itselfis a geometric ratio, but we want to have stops at each value that halves or doubles the amount of total light going through the lens in order to correspond to the available shutter speeds. We call those stops stops. So now we've come to the metering bit. Every filmstock has a certain sensitivity to light, known as its film speed. The term speed comes fromthe fact that exposure time will vary based upon sensitivity, all else being equal. We now call that the ISO, though back when this camera was made it was called the ASA (the initialism forthe American Standards Association, now known as ANSI). See, back then, Germany was doing its own thing with a logarithmic system they called DIN, the acronym for their standards organization, incidentally, but in 1974 the International Standards Organization said ya know were gonna just mash the ASA and the DIN together, and now thats the ISO but nobody ever remembers the DIN half of it: the ISO 100 should really be 100/21 so in a weird way were still using ASA but calling it ISO. At least, outside of Germany. Anyway Nope, one more tangent, I S O. I saythe three letters. Why? Because ISO and \"eye-so\" are so close to each other that I dont think it makes sense to force the acronym. Does it matter? Of course not, its just, like, my opinion but I will at least grant that its less atrocious than calling this Nitsah which theyre trying real hard to make a thing in case you hadnt noticed. And I regret to inform you that its working. Anyway, modern digital cameras have an ISO setting because you can change the sensitivityof the image sensor, but back when we were usinggood ol emulsions of silver halides on a clear plastic backing, youd be stuck with whatever the sensitivity was of the film you bought. Of course there are many kinds of films from many manufacturers, and the film speed is itself something of a trade-off - more sensitive films are usually grainier, so youd want to pick the appropriate film for your situation. But now well how are you supposed to know what shutter speed and aperture setting you should use? You have to get the exposure correct if you want the resulting image to have decent dynamic range. Otherwise it will be blown out from overexposure, or a dark mess without any detail. Well, there are some general rules of thumb you can use in certain situations. For example, on a clear sunny day you can use the Sunny 16 rule: set the aperture to 16, and the shutter speed to the value that most closely matches the film speed. So, if your ISO is 100 - one one hundredth of a second, or the closest available setting (on this camera, it would be 125). This works because a doubling in film speed equals one stop in exposure - it requires half as much light, and at F16 the correct shutter speeds happens to match the film speednumerically. If you need a faster shutterspeed for a given shot, just open up the aperture an equal number of stops that you increased the shutter speed to compensate. But, news flash, not every photograph is taken outdoors on a sunny day. Wouldnt it be nice to have something that can tell [clunk] youthe correct exposure for any given scenario? Enter the light meter. These devices areable to, with the aid of some sort of light sensor, provide the user with an appropriate exposurevalue. These devices were originally hand-held, and were fairly crude. Generally theydjust have a needle-type readout which would point to the appropriate aperturevalue for a given film and shutter speed. To use them, youd bring them to your subject and point them at something which was close toa middle-grey in terms of brightness, then youd set your camera up appropriately. You can still buy handheld light meters today, though theyve been digitified of course. But before long they were integrated into camera bodies themselves. And thats why this otherwise mechanical camera has a battery compartment. Now, keep in mind this camera was originally released in 1971 (thoughthis example is a later revision). Its light meter will be limited to the same sort of analog tech that was found in the handheld meters of the time. But, and this is why I wanted to make this video, it was done in an extremely clever way that not only simplified its operation to the user, but allowed for more flexible use of the camera. The meter appears as a small display to the right of the image in the viewfinder. Right now the camera doesnt have a lens on it, but watch what happens when I put one on. [clicky sounds of lens being attached] The small circle moved upwards. That circle is mechanically linked to this little piece here. You can see that as I move it with my finger, the ring moves up and down. This engages with a small peg on the lens itself. Once installed on the camera, moving the aperture ring on the lens causes that ring to move. Now, in addition to the ring, theres a small horizontal line. Right now its sitting in the bottom red area. This is actually a needlethat will move depending on how much light the camera sees. And this is where the batterycomes into play. You may have noticed this power switch - all that does is turn on the light meter. Thatlittle blue mark in the meters display is used as a battery level check. You can see theres alittle sticker here reminding you that to check the battery level, the shutter speed should beset to 2000 and the ASA to 100. Then when you move the switch to the check position, the needle should jumpup to the blue mark and so longas it does - the batterys OK! If it doesnt make it to the blue mark, well its flat and if it overshoots it well get to that. When the meter is turned on you can see the needle move with the amount of lightthat hits the camera. The brighterthe image the higher it goes! But where exactly is it measuring? You probablynoticed the darker portion of the viewfinder towards the center. That is the sensitivearea of the light meter. With a lens on, you can see that its only whats in this area that affects the needles behavior. But how is that possible? Where is the actual sensor? Surelywe didnt have transparent light sensors in 1971. Well maybe we did but thats not whats going on here. Again, its extremely clever. One of the many things you could customize on this camera is the focusing screen. To remove it, you simply remove the viewfinder by pressing in theselittle lock buttons and sliding it towards the rear. And theres the focusing screen. Kindatrippy, huh? Thats what we were looking at in the viewfinder, but now were looking downat it. In fact all the viewfinder is is a prism, a roof pentaprism to be precise, there to redirect your view from the eyepiece downard and flip the image horizontally. This creates the distinctivehump you see above the lens of all SLRs to this day, though I must say I much prefer these sharp lines which dont hide the nature of the thing to the blobular designs of today. Anyway, this is the focusing screen and it, too, is removable. Before I even remove it, though, something about it seems weird. That darkerregion appears to be floating. Now, this is obvious in person thanks to stereoscopic vision, but it might not comeacross well on camera. Ill try my best, though. At the very least, you can see that the circular focusing aids in the center are actually separate from thatdarker region. If I pop the focusing screen out, youll get a clue as to why. See that littlewindow there? Look through it. Weeeeird. That dark region is actually a semi-transparent mirror that is floating in the middle of theglass somehow. I really want to see how these weremanufactured. But anyway, it redirects some of the light coming up through the focusing screen out this little window and if we look from the front youll see what lies behind it. The lightsensor. From the looks of it it seems to be a simple light-dependent resistor or LDR, thoughits obviously a little fancier than the one in your garden variety night light. The amount oflight that falls on this will, thanks to the battery and the simple electronics it powers, determine where the needle in the meter lands. So, in the end, that rectangle is simply the dark region left by a semi-transparent mirror embedded in the glass of the focusing screen at a 45 degree angle so it can redirect a portionof light onto the sensor. Thats what I call neat. Now that we know where the meter measures, how it works, and what it does how does one useit? You may very well have figured it out by now. This variety of meter is called a match-needle meter, and that ring? Well, its your target. To use this cameras light meter, you first point the camera so that something in the scene thats not too bright or too dark is within that metering region. Light meters in cameras are generally calibrated to a middle-grey value, and this is no exception. Now, simply turn the aperture ring on the lens until the ring surrounds the needle. You are now set to the correct exposure setting so you can recompose your shot however you like, hit the shutter release, and you're done! Oneexposure down, 23, maybe 35 more to go! But what if that combination isnt what I want? Maybe I have to stop the lens way way down in order to match the needle's position expose correctly. Ill lose my sweet sweet bokeh! Well, nothing a little after-the-fact AI-powered image processing cant fix I mean... thats no problem at all! Simplyadjust the shutter speed so that its faster. Aha! The needle moved. Heres where the other part of this genius system comes in. The actual sensitivity of the light meter itself is affected by both the selected shutter speed and also the film speed. Perhaps you noticed thislittle insert in the shutter speed dial. Rotate the dial while pulling up on it and you can change the film speed setting which will make the meter more or less sensitive. And the shutter speedalone has the same effect. Increasing shutter speed causes the needle to fall down, which meansyou need to open the lens up to match. Now, you could have worked this out in your head by just counting the stops to, say, F2 and then increasing the shutter speed by the same number of stops. Buthaving the meter work differently depending on the shutter speed offers a sort of sanity check. It also demonstrates the relationship between shutter speed and aperture beautifully. Each stopyou move in shutter speed requires two clicks of the aperture ring to compensate. Two clicksbecause this lens has detents at half stops. Most elegantly, though? The matching nature allows for shutter priority or aperture priorityexposure. Rather than just point the cameraat the scene and find a combo that works, you can fix one of those variables ahead of time and adjust the other as needed. Say you want a stopped-down aperture of F16 for a deep depth of field. Well, set the lens to F16 and keep changing the shutter speed until the needle gets in that ring. Or, perhaps you need a fast shutter speed to freeze motion in action shots. Simply set the shutter speed to 1000, and move the aperture ring until the ring surrounds the needle. Easy! This metering arrangement is not only intuitive, but its flexible and also just a great teachingaid to those learning photography. Yousee hints of it in modern interfaces, and then of course theres even more powerfulstuff these days like histograms and whatnot, but theres just something about the way this works that is beautifully elegant tome. Should we talk about the weirdness,though? Lets talk about the weirdness. First, theres a limit to its range of operation. Watch what happens as I approach a shutter speed of one second. At a quarter of a second, themeter turns red. It doesnt exactly stop working, but it behaves erratically. If I increasethe film speed to 1600, the meter goes red at a thirtieth of a second. And here, atreally slow shutter speeds, the needle just stops changing at all even when it should. Now the meter is definitely not working right. Whats going on here is that the meter is a lot simpler than you may imagine. Changing the shutter speed setting simply changes how sensitive the meter becomes. As you slow the shutter, you need to close the aperture down in equivalent stops for the sameexposure. The meter needs to movethe needle higher to indicate that, which means the needle becomes moresensitive to given amounts of light. But the same thing needs to happen when you increase the film speed. If you doubled the film speed, you'd need half as much light for the same exposure, so the needle needs to move one stop higher. Doubling the film speed demands that the sensitivity of the meter change exactlyas if the shutter speed were cut in half. And the simplest way to do this? Just shift everything over. The needle will indicate the same apertures for a doubled film speedas it would for a halved shutter speed, so if you can shift those sensitivities around, you can adjust the meter for different film speeds. Thats exactly what changing the film speed setting does, in fact thats literally what it does because were dealing with a mechanical contraption. Adjusting the film speed essentially relocates the different sensitivities of the light meter independently of the cameras shutter mechanism. There are more meter sensitivities than there are shutter speeds on the high end, butthere arent on the low end. The meter just isnt sensitive enough to tell you how to expose a low-light shot. So, as the film speed increases, the lowest speed settings become locked outbecause that sensitivity is now assigned toa higher shutter speed. Each doubling of film speed locks out the next lowest shutter speed. In the end, the meter is just an analog device thats been finely calibrated to move the needlelogarithmically. Each doubling of light landing onthe sensor makes it move the same distance upward. I imagine each sensitivity level is just adding a different resistor to the mix. Which brings us to the next bit of weirdness: batteries. When this camera was made, we were still manufacturing mercury batteries because, yaknow, we hadnt yet come to grips with the fact that the garbage can isnt a magic receptacle that makes things harmlessly disappear forever. The trouble is, mercury batteries produced 1.35 volts. Thats a weird voltage these days. While you can buy a replacement battery that fits perfectly in the battery compartment, it will likely be a 1.5 volt alkaline battery. You mightnot think thats enough to matter but remember this is an all-analog system which is calibratedto behave logarithmically. The voltage matters a lot, and those batteries simply do not work. They pushthe needle way too high and it will never give you an accurate reading. If you do a battery checkwith one of these alkaline batteries, the needle will end up all the way up here. Trust me, I know. That same sort oferror makes its way into every metering scenario. However, there is a solution! Zinc-airbatteries, which produce electricity through reacting with oxygen in the air, are commonlyavailable. Theyre pretty neat all on their own, featuring a surprisingly large energy density due to the nature of the reaction, but they have a time-limited life because you cant stop the reaction once you remove the adhesive pull tab. However,for some applications like hearing aids, this drawback is more than made up for bytheir energy density. And most importantly, the voltage they produce is close enough to1.35 that they can be used in cameras like these. Now, you can buy a zinc-air drop-in replacement online for about $5 but youll be quickly annoyed with that option since, as I said, they have a built-in time limit. So, pro tip, get yourself some 675 hearing aid batteries. Theyre about the same thickness asthe PX625 battery this camera is designed to take, and although theyre not the right diameter, asimple loop of wire insulation will center it well enough. You may need to bend the camerasnegative tab up slightly, but this simple modification allows you to use batteries you canbuy at Walmart for about a buck apiece. And as a happy accident, the battery compartment cover has a couple of holes allowing air in, but they're small enough that in my experience a battery will last a good couple months before its dead. You might also have asked, where is the meters display? And how is it lit? You can see it in the viewfinder quiteclearly, but when you remove the viewfinder you find just a blank hole where it was. Well, the meter is actually right here. Its tiny! And this piece of translucentplastic up here is what illuminates it. Old cameras are filled with all these clever, intricate mechanisms. I mean, think about the linkage connecting the shutter speed dial to the tiny little indicator in themeter. Hmm, its amazing. Oh, and you couldpurchase a different viewfinder which had its own battery and light source for the meter, but this was never really super useful since the meter doesnt work in low light anyway. For outdoorphotography that little window works surprisingly well. Speaking of, did you notice the OFF position on the meter is also marked FLASH? How does that work? Well, it doesnt. Remembertheres no automatic anything, and when this camera was made youd use a chart on your flashitself to set exposure correctly based on film speed and distance to the subject. Oh, and thats why theshutter speed 60 is marked in orange. Thats the flash synchronization speed of this camera, or the fastestshutter speed where the entire shutter is open at once and thus suitable for use with a flash. Sincethis cameras shutter curtain moves horizontally, its shutter is pretty slow and you can see evenwith a smartphones slow-mo that any speed above 60 doesnt expose the film all at once. This canactually create distortion in certain scenarios, so in a funny way, this old camera has a rolling shutter. Go figure. The shutter mechanism alone is just incredibly intricate and also fascinating, I mean the curtains themselves are made of titanium. And theyre flexible! They roll up into these little compartments here, and move as one unit when you cock the shutter and advance thefilm. You can see the seam right here. But withthe press of just one button, they move apart and come back together with precise control in a fractiona second [CLICK] all done entirely mechanically. Amazing! This little thing here is the old-style flash hookup, though up here by the film rewinder youll find an older style of hot shoe. These little contacts here (along with those inside the plug) are bridged right when the shutter is entirely open, signaling anelectronic flash to [CLICK] flash. But anyway, now were getting well into the nitty-gritty whichwell save for later. I hope you enjoyed this look into the old-fashioned light metering systems ofyesteryear. While its fundamentally very simple, a lot of ingenuity was built-in to make it usable,intuitive, and flexible. But weve just scratched the surface on how this camera takes pictures. What about the film itself? How does that store an image? And what about film development? How do film negatives become printed photographs? Oh, dont worry. Theres a lot more to explore with analog photography, and before longwell get there. See you in the darkroom! logarithmically smooth jazz Single lens reflux(?), also sort ahh alreadysca-rooooo-ewd it up and its great because I have to re-take the OTHER line, too! I don like how I said FUNdamental I forgot I need to.. Open that The more constricted that opening becomes. Thus, the let light less light That means that more of the image is in focus at once, much to the chagrin of bokeh fans. (thesentence shouldnt have ended) When a higher F number ugh dang yeah forgot. Forgot the delivery! [clears throat] So So ble ble bah buh well move it over there. How bout that? But nobody eberdy nobody ebedy bedu its going so well.... But, in 1974, the International Standards Association said Organization! Dang it I'm aware that the ISO dictates from their righteous throne of meticulousness that it is \"supposed to be\" pronounced \"eye-so\" Just remember that the inventor of the GIF tried to steer the ship and look how that's working out for him. Anyway language is dumb.",

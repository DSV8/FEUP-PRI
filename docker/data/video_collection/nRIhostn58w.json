    "transcript": "[Music playing] [Intro] Come take a look at this view, its pretty sweet. I try to stay as productive as possible when Im traveling so one thing Ive done to help me stay productive is I built a triple screen laptop. You might have heard of Project Valerie made by Razor; their triple screen laptop? The side screens dont actually fold in. The laptop Ive built is collapsible. Let me show you. So this here is my mobile battle station. Its got 2 extending monitors on either side and Ill show you how to build these in just a second. I just want to show you that this screen is fully functional. I can take windows and drag it across and drop it on either side, and the laptop is 100 percent portable. Its got some interesting construction practices, but these hinges right here allow the monitors to fold completely flat. Each of these hinges was about 2 bucks and the side monitors were around $100. So its a pretty inexpensive project, comparatively. I was inspired when I saw Project Valerie at CES this year. So let me show you how I built my own. So this is the beginning of my triple monitor set up. Right now Im using one of my old laptops. These monitors on the side here are entirely powered and receive all of their information from a USB cable so theres no power adapters or anything like that. These monitors arent super awesome for gaming; they have an 8 millisecond response time. But they are super portable because they only have that USB power connector and display connector. They also do this weird thing where if you tip them sideways, they will turn back on and the orientation of the screen will be this direction instead which would be awesome for browsing Reddit. Or, working on something on this computer and having information on this screen as well, whether youre like editing videos or working on a project. And thats where the triple screen laptop comes into play. [Sound of ripping plastic] They do have the vesa mount on the back so you can put these on like a monitor extension arm, but since I have limited space on the back of my laptop were going to have to use something else. Im going to use these door hinges to hold the monitors in place and allow them to flip out. These glues right here, these are called Epoxy. I have 2 brands: I have Lock Tight and JB Weld. Im probably going to use the JB Weld just because it has a higher PSI which means it has more strength and holding power. So right now I have some tape wrapping around the side of the monitor; just holding it in place and trying to get an idea of where the hinges should be placed. Epoxy is 2 different chemicals that mix together, and when theyre mixed together they form a chemical reaction that make them hard in about 5 minutes. This thing will fully cure in about 24 hours. Thats why theres still liquid inside of the tubes, but once they are outside of the tubes and exposed with air and mixed together, theyll get really hard, really fast. So right now both hinges are good and actually its only been curing for about 2 hours, but the weight on one hinge can hold the whole laptop. So this epoxy is pretty strong. Im going to clip on the first screen right now, and by clip on, I mean epoxy. So Im going to put some tape down just so I dont get any glue stuck to the hinges. Im going to flip them over and Im going to set the monitor down in place right after I finish gluing it. So I kind of have it stacked down on top of a book and you can see that second monitor, which is this guy right here, is resting on top of the hinges. And the hinges are glued. Its not going to stick to the laptop because theres a piece of tape underneath. And then I added some more weight on top of that to kind of add pressure to the glue and help it dry better. I made sure theres an even amount of room between the edge of the laptop and the top monitor right here. So when it folds out theyre still going to be even with each other. Alright so Ive taken off all of the weights and it looks likeits been probably about an hour and the instructions say that this stuff gets tacky in about 5 minutes. And it actually holds pretty pretty strong, even after an hour of just sitting there. Lets see if it stands up on its own. I got the door hinges on the back here. So this second screen that Im going to add right here, I guess you could call it the third screen, is a little more tricky because it needs to open up and it needs to sit on top of the second screen that I added there. So what Im going to do is Im going to stick this hinge just like that, so that part is stuck to the laptop and then this part is going to fold up and attach to the side of the third monitor there. And Ill probably do two of them just so that theres more support. And this one will actually have a flat surface for the hinge to attach to. So it should be just as secure as the other one since it had the curved area of the back. So this time around Im making sure that the hinges are also straight with each other because if the hinges are kinked or skiwampus, theyre not going to fold in the same direction; one might fold this way and the other one might fold slightly that way which wouldnt give a direct swing to the monitor. So this one Im using the edge of the laptop and just pressing the bulge of the hinge right up against it; same on both sides and that will make them both equal. [Sound of plastic ripping] One of my favorite things about having a triple screen laptop is on long flights like this I can get 3 times as much work done as I would normally. [Music playing] So when I was at CES I did see the real Project Valerie on display, but apparently it was misplaced or stolen. So Razor, if you need a working prototype, Im your guy. Thanks a ton for watching. Ill see you around.",

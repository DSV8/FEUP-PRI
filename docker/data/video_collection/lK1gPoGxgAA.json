    "transcript": "- You guys have been telling us for years that our infrastructure, the servers and the networking gear that our 20 video editors not to mention the other 90 employees rely on is a little jank. You weren't wrong then, and realistically you're probably not gonna be wrong a few years from now. But we haven't been standing still and in the last year alone, we've effectively replaced or rebuilt every single server in this building. Making them faster, better, more reliable, cooler, far less power hungry. In fact, we've done so much that most of the servers you've ever seen on camera are in this graveyard right in front of me. Which means it's high time to give you guys a full update on all of it, including some brand new gear that is unlike anything we've ever shown you before. (upbeat theme music) First up is the main server room at the OG office where you can see there's been some serious server shrinkage. There was one point during the vault recovery process where we literally only had three rack units left and now this is only about half full. But the important stuff is actually at the back where our old pfSense router has been replaced. Or rather it's pulling duty as a Steam Cache now. Our Steam Cache used to be in a VM, but we were having issues with it. - It'd be like weird performance things where it'd be like 10 gig download and it'd be like one gig. Then 10 gig again and one gig. - So we're back on bare-metal now, which is fine because we upgraded this thing anyway only to discover that pfSense didn't run on the new box. This Supermicro 1U is super cool. It's got 25 gig networking on board except no drivers and pfSense. - Yeah, it's running a really old FreeBSD version. - Fortunately, OPNsense is a fork of pfSense that gets updated way more frequently. Now that could be a double edged sword. Your organization might prefer the slow plotting approach to updates, but we live on the bleeding edge where we love that we've got support for our 25 gig networking in here. And you update it like a couple weeks after the new-- - Yeah, I usually wait like a month after a big release before updating. - And it's been rock solid for us. - Zero issues. - If we wanted to go back to pfSense though we totally could, is what I would say, except they still don't support this thing. - No, they don't. - The other changes back here are not so much hardware but rather topology. We've still got that awesome Dell 100 Gig switch but now we're wired directly into all of our editors and Ingest stations via fiber. So they're running 25 Gig and we're using the 100 Gig ports to connect to each of our downstream switches where we used to have it going from one to the other, to the other, to the other, so that if we had to update one or something, it would knock out everything downstream of it. Which, to their credit, these Dell 48-port 10 Gig switches, other than updates have they gone down at all? - I've never had an issue with any of these three Dell switches ever. They would have a hundred percent uptime if we didn't update them. - Shout out Ubiquity as well though. We've been really happy with their POE switches. This one right here runs all of our cameras, all of our WiFi access points. And then this guy up here was actually added when we acquired the unit on, I guess this runs to both other sides, right? - Yeah. 101 and 105. So that's the shop and like where the WAN Show set is. - And this one's got a 25 Gig link to our 100 Gig switch. Now, oh, there is one other new piece of hardware. We have an NVR back here now. - Yeah. We have two actually. We previously only had one, but we had so many cameras that it was like starting to like cause weird performance issues, so we split them out into two. Ubiquiti keeps telling me that they're gonna add NVR stacking where you can combine them together, but for now I have to like click between the... - We're really happy overall though. Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Big brothers watching. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, I missed something else. What's this cloud key doing up here? - Well, it used to be on this side. Don't you remember? - Oh. Don't we have a dream machine here? I have one at my house. - No. Oh. Right. - OPNsense. - I can't remember why. - I thought you can run this in a VM now. (chuckles) Okay. All right. Oh. - It was. And then the database corrupted so we couldn't adopt anything properly. So instead of just readopting all of the like 40 switches we had, I was like, \"What if we just transferred to a cloud key?\" And it fixed it. So it's on a cloud key now. Again. Like it was before. Love doing work twice. - The other thing that particularly the Europeans have tripped us about in here is our use of 120-volt power in a server room. And while the output on this does say only 110 and 120-volt as the options, it's got two 120-volt phases. So if you pair it with the right PDUs, or power distribution units, you can totally do 208-volt, which we're now doing thanks to these super cool PDUs from Tripp Lite. They're networked, so you can not only monitor the total power usage but you can actually switch off individual outlets. Say if a network device became unresponsive you can even create automations for it. The main benefit of switching to 208-volt is efficiency. You've probably seen in power supply marketing materials that there'll be two lines for the efficiency curve. One for one 120 volt, and one for 200 plus. And the reason for that is the higher voltage allows your power supply to operate more efficiently. It's exactly the same for servers. So we dropped our power consumption in here by about 10% just from that changeover. That means that combined with the server consolidation we've done and the additional battery units that we've added to our 9PXM, this Eaton UPS can run for almost an hour with the power out completely, which seems to come up around here a lot. Now let's talk about the great consolidation after we talk about our sponsor. The Ridge. Looking for a stylish and practical wallet? The Ridge wallet has got you covered. Its minimalist design allows you to carry your essential cards and cash without the bulk. Check out the link below and use code Linus to save 10% off your purchase, and get free shipping Where we used to have five 45Drives storinators taking up half our rack, holding about 60 drives each, we now have three of these Supermicro JBODs and what we call the mother vault. Each of these holds up to 90 drives. And then we've got this single AMD EPYC Milan head unit that uses two EPYC Milan 32-core CPUs, and then it uses external SAS connectors to attach to the JBODs. Right now we've only got a single JBOD attached to each of the SAS HBAs in here, but theoretically nothing would prevent us from adding another, I don't know, like three of these, once we clear out Clover server. This is running ancient hardware. It's a Xeon-2699 v4. I mean it's 28 cores, but they are flippin' slow, and we're using this for all of our virtual machines which, do we even have that many virtual machines? What else we got going on in here? - Not really. This one's being deprecated soon in place of Clayton Server up here, which is running Proxmox instead. That will be where all of our VMs move in the long term. - Does that mean I can take this CPU for my home server? - Sure. Our Clayton Proxmox server, it doesn't really run a lot of VMs to be honest. We have a Parsec Relay which makes Parsec run a little bit faster when you have a bunch of different users. We have a couple VMs for the Labs team, and then the Steam Cache was on it but then like I said, it kind of had issues. So yeah. 64-core EPYC, 24 bays for 4Drives and like three VMs. - Wait, we didn't mention the mother vault is running TrueNAS. - Yeah, I mean, basically all of our servers run TrueNAS now. - Shout out TrueNAS, shout out ZFS, and shout out Wendell from LevelOnetechs. It's not like the vault data is essential. That's why it wasn't redundant then, and it's still not redundant now. But it's a super nice to have and thanks to Wendell, we managed to get back what? Like 98 and a half percent of what we lost - Most of it. And to be fair, I haven't run into a situation yet where someone's been like, \"Hey I need this file and I can't find it.\" Bob. I think it's-- - Freaking awesome. - Yeah. And it's wild being in Windows Explorer seeing this single folder, this single machine that now has everything, 2.4 petabytes or whatever. Unbelievable. Speaking of unbelievable, we got hated on a fair bit for this thing and you were right, (Jake chuckles) but not about the performance. - Yeah. This thing has been crazy reliable, crazy fast. It's basically the bees knees. I've only really went into one issue and this was recent. The day of The Hackening. One of the drives decided to shut off. - And if you wanna change out an M.2 drive that's loaded onto a carrier card, that's loaded into a module thing, that's loaded into a server, it's a bit of a pain in the butt. Especially because we didn't have the foresight to write down the serials and which carrier card they were installed in. - Absolutely zero idea which drive it is. - Oh my god. That's what you did? So what we ended up doing to restore the arrays integrity is putting a mismatched seven terabyte KIOXIA drive into one of the front NVMe bays. Jake. - Yeah. And the plan is apparently to do something about the serviceability of it soon, TM. - Well, it hasn't needed any servicing, right? To be fair, when I restarted this server the drive came back online and has been online since. - We do have some ideas for improving the serviceability. We found out that you can get U.2 to M.2 carrier cards. So we could actually just take all those internal SSDs load them into the U.2 slots in the front. I guess we'll have to add more modules for that. - Or maybe use a different server - Or maybe use a different, oh, okay. So new, new, new new Whonnock is coming soon then? - Whonnock four. - And we could use those new Sabrent drives. They're sending over 22 of their wild eight terabyte Rocket-4 plus drives so that we can try them out with that crazy 21 by M.2 carrier card that you probably saw on the news. So wait, no. I am not thinking we use those carrier cards. - Hey, you are the one that brought that up. - No, we're not. - We just put one. It's the one card server. It's got 160 terabytes on one card. - Yeah. Entire Whonnock server and an Intel nook. - Yeah. - No. I mean maybe. Yeah. - It's not that stupid. No, wait. I'm the one that's supposed to say your ideas are stupid. That's stupid. - It's not that stupid. It's stupid. - You like it. I don't. Not after that. - Meanwhile, in unit 101 where all the inventory and logistics department used to be but now you'll find only our makeshift short circuit set. We've removed the server rack out right because we can't have servers sitting here () next to where we're trying to film. Instead, we've got this simple six rack unit wall mount here that's gonna hold our two network switches that handle all the network connectivity down here and upstairs. We've also got a UDM Pro down here. That's the router for our secondary backup internet connection. It's not nearly as fast. It's one gig instead of 10 gig. But realistically, most of what we're doing is (mumbles) - Most of the time we just use it for like testing a router on short circuit. So... - Yeah, it doesn't really matter. Now you might have noticed that this looks pretty okay, this looks extremely not okay. This is very much a work in progress. These patch panels are gonna come down here and then presumably at some point we're gonna shorten these runs maybe? - Oh yeah. Oh yeah. - Yeah. 'Cause they're long enough to go into a rack. - Well, these will get replaced with little, like those little ultra-thin six-inch cables from Infinite Cables. Shout out Infinite Cables. Thanks for these things. - And speaking of, you know, shout out Ubiquiti for this access point. You definitely-- Oh my God. Is this the actual access point for here? - No, no, no. It's just like the backup connection one. - The only other noteworthy thing here is our UPS. This is to ensure that not only is our main internet connection battery backed up, but also our secondary one. That way in the event that we lose power to the building outright, the WAN Show can continue, as you guys actually saw, not that long ago - That time we had to run it on Jack's because we actually ran out of backup battery. So we bought a second battery pack that just needs to get put on here. It's sitting over there. It'll get on there. We gotta be able to do WAN show for like at least two hours. - Yeah. On battery. - Five hours. Ah, Jesus Christ. - Moving over to the lab, the biggest change is probably the complete removal of windows from our infrastructure. Get it? There used to be a window here. But because of all the sound bleed from the servers next door, the poor social media team who's moving in here was going to develop tinnitus. - Social media team? - Isn't that who's coming in here? - I thought this is my server room. - No. - What? The server room's over here and now it is properly sealed, so let's head in there. - This is the-- - No. Honestly though, removing the window and finishing up the drywall, it's not really enough, and it's especially not gonna be enough with some of the gear that we're putting in here. So we're doing it again, but this time better. - Way better. - Hanging insulation on the wall of the server room. - Yeah. This time we're gonna use this cool product called SONOpan, which is like a recycled wood panel. They're like 30 bucks for a four by eight sheet, which is really cheap for sound isolation. And then we're gonna put Rockwall on top of it with these cool adapters that Dan made. - In fairness to me the original solution was messy, but darn it did it ever work? - Yeah. It does work really well. - I took so much flack for that. - I don't even know if SONOpan existed then. - And to be fair, nails is way easier than 3D printing hundreds of little brackets. - Yeah. - Yeah. I did that in a weekend. - Yeah. We're gonna put Duvetyne on with magnets this time. - I probably took like three months off my life with the amount of fibers I inhaled that weekend. - Yeah, yeah, that's okay. You got good life insurance. - Man. This is where you can see the difference between us eight and a half years ago architecting this stuff and then kind of upgrading piecemeal as we go, and when we build something from scratch with all the knowledge we've gained since then. Here's where our internet connection comes in. We did end up having to go for the expensive link over to the other building, but, hey, now that the whole writing team's here and the lab is here, we definitely do need it. And then we've got these 100 Gig links that break out into four 25s that go to these 10 Gig switches. One, two, three, four, five of them. Woo. - We might need one more or two. The intention is for every single connection in this building to be 10 gig. Obviously not cameras and like APs and stuff. - Everything else is running off of these Enterprise 48 switches from Ubiquiti. These are super cool. They're 48 ports, two and a half gig, and they do PoEs. So these will do all the cameras and access points here. Which access points in particular now actually can use two and a half gig uplinks. That's so freaking fast. - And we put those WiFi 60 Enterprise APs everywhere in this building, at least with what's done so far. - We have rippin' fast WiFi here. There's more than just networking over here though. We've got the NVR-Pro from Ubiquiti. This is handling all of the cameras in this building and you may recognize this as the storinator that 45Drive sent over for our vault recovery. Well now it's pulling completely different duty as our Anniedale server. So this is our footage dumping ground and is one of the backup targets for our main video editing server Whonnock. It's over at the lab now for more physical separation so that way if one of the buildings were to burn down, in the past they were just two separate units in the same building. Now they are physically separate buildings. Probably the coolest thing over here though is this. Our first attempt at a high availability server that if all goes well is going to be the new Whonnock editing NAS. - You mean new new, new, new high availability Whonnock. - Yes. Yes. That's the name we're gonna go for. - HA Whonnock four. - How do I get these out? - There's like a little... - Oh. Each of these four units in here has a 64-core EPYC Milan CPU. - Nope. Genoa. These are Genoa. Genoa? These are Genoa? - Hell yeah. - What? So it's like 384 Gigs of Ram, 64-core Genoa, Six, you got three slots in the front for PCIe Gen five storage, if you want, and then there's two little M.2s for boot. And there's four of them in this to here. - Holy Crap. - So there's 256 cores. - The idea here is that in the same way that you would run multiple hard drives so that if one fails, the rest of them can just take over. you run multiple servers so that if one fails for whatever reason, the other three will just keep on trucking. Now there's a number of different ways that we can combine the storage of these servers, whether we use something like GlusterFS on TrueNAS SCALE, or Ceph or even WekaFS. Yeah, I think we we're gonna use that, weren't we? - We're working on it. - Okay. Maybe. Maybe. - We might need a second one of these. 'Cause Weka apparently needs eight nodes minimum now. But still, then we could have like three of them fail I think and still have storage, which is crazy. The other cool thing is you can update it in the middle of the workday, like it's nothing. - Oh, that's super cool. - Yeah, BIOS update, whatever. - Stay tuned for that. - Yeah. - Shout out Eaten, by the way for this 9PXM UPS. I think... - This is the same one that's on the other side. - Yeah. Did they just send this? - Yeah. They also sent us another two PDUs, which is super sick. Dude, the PDUs, those aren't even the final ones. They didn't have stock of the ones I wanted that have individual per port energy monitoring. So they were like, \"oh yeah, you can just have these ones for now\" and we'll send those ones when you want it. And they're also providing full cable tray for the entire warehouse. So we can actually run all the ethernet in like those fancy trays. - So Eaton are just complete bros now? - Yeah. - Man. Their stuff is like aced here though. - It's the, that's the, This is what you want. - Speaking of cable tray, I guess that's the plan for this. - Yeah, the reason that that hasn't been cleaned up is we have to run like another 30 or 40 wires. You might as well just do it all at once. - Got it. We didn't mention this on the other side but you might have noticed we have these color-coded power cables coming off of our PDs. That's so that we can ensure that each of our servers is powered by two separate PDUs So that in the event of a PDU failure, it'll still stay running thanks to the redundant power supply. - The last part of the infrastructure changes are on the client side, specifically for our writers. Ubiquiti hooked up each of them with one of these cool, I think they're called a Switch Flex XG. They're a PoE powered 10 gig switch, but in our case we're just using wall power. It gives each of our writers four 10 gig ports and a gigabit port. Obviously we have test benches and other devices that we're working on. So just having one 10 gig connection to each workstation was a bit of a bottleneck. This way they can plug in a bunch of different devices and still get that 10 Gig speed, which is obviously very important, if we need to review footage off the server or what have you. It's pretty sick and they're not that expensive either. I think it's 2.99 for one of those. We almost forgot about the network closet that was here when we moved into the lab. The intention for this is for all of these cables to get moved over to the new server room. The reason it's still here is these are all the old connections in the warehouse that haven't been redone yet, because of that cable tray. So once that's all done, these will probably just get cut out of the wall, recycled and yeah, there won't really be anything in this closet. We could probably just use it for cleaning products or something like that. - Grammarly is throwing their hat into the AI ring with GrammarlyGO , which offers generative AI to accelerate your productivity while staying true to your personal style.

MikroTik as well, Supermicro for all the servers, Infinite Cables for the patch panels, the networking. They sent us like 20 boxes of a thousand feet of Cat6a. They got really sick patch cables. 45Drives. - Are you pimping infinite cables again? - Yes. Yes. Yes. 45Drives also makes awesome servers. We're just not really using them aside from this one but definitely check them out. God, what else is there? Oh, I guess a video to watch. Probably the one where we put all this in this rack 'cause that was just like pure distilled chaos. - Or you could go watch the one on the mother vault. That was a big change for us. - Oh my gosh.

    "description": "Starting January 14th, The Verge will bring together some of the most exciting names in science fiction writing to imagine Better Worlds. The project will showcase 10 original fiction stories, five animated adaptations, and five audio adaptations by a diverse roster of authors who take a more optimistic view of what lies ahead in ways both large and small, fantastical and everyday. These stories disrupt the common narratives of an inevitable apocalypse and explore spaces our fears have overlooked. The future is coming  and we believe its worth fighting for.

    "transcript": "- Everything today is so dark. The news is terrible, the TV shows are grim. Even the super heroes are ridiculously dark, but many of the best creators and inventors were inspired by golden age sci fi comics. Shows like Star Trek and writers like Isaac Asimov and Octavia Butler who imagine science improving the future. That's why The Verge is offering Better Worlds, a new series of short fiction and animation that explores how technology can shape our society and environment in better more more equitable ways. Diverse creators like Justina Ireland, John Scalzi, and Lee Alexander are writing stories about new possibilities from open source rockets, to fantastical trash eating mushrooms, new planets and friends that never die. Science fiction should expand our horizons and make us dream. That's what we're trying to do with Better Worlds. So stay tuned to The Verge and The Verge on YouTube over the next few months to check it out. (upbeat music)",

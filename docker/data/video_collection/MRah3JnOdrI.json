    "transcript": "- Holy crap. I wanna take it apart. I think it's fair to say that this is getting ridiculous now. Anker sponsored this video to check out their 757 portable power station. And I know why they called it that, this thing is absolutely, freaking enormous, and extremely, heavy. It is jam packed full of lithium iron phosphate batteries, outputs, a peak of 1500 Watts, and is rated for 1,229 Watt hours. Meaning that you could actually run small appliances like a blender or even a microwave off of this thing, for short periods of time. And run things off it you definitely could more than just that, it's got a massive six AC outlets, four USB type A's, two USB type C's totaling 160 Watts of power output. A car socket, just in case you have something that plugs into one of those. Oh, oh, oh, this is good power saving mode. That's very useful. That's wonderful. Need to save my power. One of the coolest things about it though is that depending on how you charge it, you can get it from zero to 100 percent in just over an hour. So that's directly off of an AC outlet. It'll do 80% in I think one hour and then if you charge it off of solar panels it'll do it in about four and a half hours. And if you charge it off of your car it'll go in a little over 10 hours. So the idea being that whether you're camping, or you're more of a van life type of person, this could be pretty much all you need to get you through the night, every night. There's your solar input. There's your AC power input. There's your, ooh there's your, uh, breaker reset. Ooh. (clicking) built in flashlight. I actually wasn't expecting this one to have one. One of the ways that you can use this style of kind of light bar flashlight is you just put it on your camping table or whatever else, and it just shines a warm glow over everything. So you can see your, your marshmallows to put on your stick, or whatever else the heck it is that you have to do. Holy crap. I wanna take it apart. I am looking at some flippin enormous battery packs with some very real cooling on them, ladies and gentlemen. 0.8 water hours. So I think these are gonna be 18650's, that's not the important thing though. The important thing is the grade of those cells. Now you can get cheap 18650's that will do a few hundred recharge cycles. These are rated for 3,000 charge cycles, meaning your 757 power station, well, along with its five year warranty, is probably gonna outlast whatever electronics you would plug into it. How would I even go about getting this thing open? Oh, super cool. I think it might actually be easy. I need my screwdriver. Not entirely sure that I'm supposed to be opening this in a sponsored video. I mean, it feels like plastic but I guess, (knocking) the inner metal parts of it would have to be something a lot stronger than that for how flipping heavy it is. like to keep them in good shape, these are, - Don't break this Linus, please! - These are great for video shoots and stuff like that. - They really are. And this one is like juicetastic, so, fine! I will put it back together for now. And we will hook some stuff up to it. Button, power the AC outlets. Hey, Hey, there we go. We got 99.9 hours left. Haha. That's not gonna last long. You ready? RTX 3090 gaming PC, here we go. Oh yeah, we got the lighting on and everything. We're doing it up. Oh hilarious. Yeah. The whole setup is powered by this thing right now. Claims I've got a couple of hours of this but I don't have a game open yet. It's pulling 400 Watts right now at idle between this computer, the monitor, the lighting, everything. And it still says it's got a solid three hours in it. See what happens when I launch a game. Oh, this is an HDR monitor too. Dang. This thing's gonna suck back power. We're up to 500 Watts. Like you could conceivably run a flipping microwave off of it. I need all the power, 4k, absolutely cranked quality. 733 Watts. And it wants to run for over a fricking hour. We should plug more stuff into it. What else we got? Okay. You gotta shut me down Bell. - All right let's try this out - Bring more stuff. An aputure Nova you say, oh my God, it's heavy. Um, How do I power it on? Ooh. Oh, Nova indeed. Okay. I have the power of the sun in the palm of my hand. Are the cooling fans going now? Yeah, they are. It's still got 0.9 hours and we're drawing over 1,000 Watts. I need more power, Bell. Bring me an Xbox. Let's say you're off grid. And you can't decide between your op gaming PC and your console. Still only 1100 Watts. Come on, Xbox. Okay. I need more power then. How could you go through 3000 cycles unless you're using it in a professional setting? Like personally, how could you possibly do it? Like how many times you go camping a year? How many years of camping trips is that? But I guess if you are okay, if you're, you know, van life, right, and you're charging it every day, Yeah. You could conceivably go through even more than one charge in a day. So maybe it could last you like eight or nine years, but still that's a lot. This is an RTX 3090 running off of a battery bank. Like, think about that. Think about how far Anker's come from being like the kind of weird brand with little battery banks and mobile accessories on Amazon, to like running a 3090 on their power station. Well, what else do yeah, sure, gimme a Mac. I'm ready. Oh, perfect. Got the Anker charging cable. Love it. All right. I'm gonna use that type C port. Oh crap. Come on. Which one's the hundred Watt one? One's rated for 60. One's rated for 100 Watts. Okay. 1277. Okay. Do something on this. What does this, what does it do? Okay, let's get Civ gold. We got a game here, ladies and gentlemen. This is ridiculous. It's still at 76% battery. 1353. We're getting close. Okay. There we go. Wait, what res is this? Oh yeah. No, that's not low res okay. 1328. It's not even going that hard. Apparently it uses this like dual inverter technology that makes it hyper efficient. What do they say? 92% or something like that? It's not kicking off a lot of heat considering that it's outputting a hun- 1300 Watts. Which we know is true. Like we're not just taking their word for it. This is an HDR display. We're, uh, running this MacBook pro. We've also got an RTX 3090, 5950 X gaming machine running there. This freaking light. Like that's not some fabricated number or anything and it's outputting almost no real heat. That's super cool. Did you happen to bring a cable? - Sure did. - Okay, I'm adding my phone to the load. But like it still says it has half an hour left. I seriously think it is, it is underestimating how long it has to go. I think this is kind of like a, like the E on a gas tank. - Hmmm - Not actually empty not actually gonna be done in half an hour. Ooh. That gets us to like 1450. It's like a 100 Watts when it's lifting. Not much else to say. Other than that, obviously I don't expect you to use it like this. This is more intended for like, uh, you know long weekend getaway or something along those lines. Like I said, you know, van life or or boat life is another great example of what you might do with something like this. Throw some solar panels up on the boat up on the top of the van. Really, really cool device. Obviously you don't have to spring for the super high end one. They've also got the 535 and the 521. those are lower capacity versions of the same basic idea. You guys can check them out at the link down below. Don't forget to subscribe to short circuit. We're gonna have lots more videos like this one. I'll see you there. (upbeat music) This is so ridiculous. Make it hurt. (squealing) Okay. Good enough.",

    "transcript": "(beep) - Hey, hey, I'll do it better. (upbeat music) (beep) (upbeat music) (beep) - [Matt] What are you doing? I'm hitting the Mario block to start the episode. - [Matt] Shut it down. (transitional sound) (bang) - Windows, ugly sweater. All right. Hello. Welcome to Mystery Tech. Did Microsoft send another ugly Christmas sweater? - [Ken] Yes. - Is it slightly past Christmas now? (laughing) - [Ken] It is. - Over the years, Microsoft has made a bit of a holiday tradition to make ugly Christmas sweaters. But today we have, (upbeat music) Oh! Look at that. - [Ken] Oh man! That looks so good though. Look at the top left. Untitled-paint. (Austin laughing) That's how I title all of our thumbnails in Photoshop - [Matt] You haven't made a thumbnail in two years. - [Ken] This actually looks good with a button down. Like all these sweaters normally do. - All right. Let us begin. You know what actually... Before we begin, a short story from uncle Austin. Back in ye olden Windows XP days before Steve Jobs had an iPhone. As anything more than a glimmer in his eyes. I used to make Pokemon sprites in Paint. I loved - [Ken] Why does it always have to come to Pokemon dude? - Love myself some Pokemons. I used to make all kinds of things in paint. In fact, I still know how to use paint better than Photoshop or anything else that is made from this century. So, paint has a special place on my heart. And now it has a special place on my body. - [Matt] I hated. Every syllable of that story (table scratching) - I gotta warm up the table for the next hot item coming through. (claps) I caught that. You're welcome. These, my friends are known as solo cups for doing things with why am I drinking solo cups right now? I'm gonna start arranging them for the only thing I know how to do with solo cups. (upbeat music) Okay. A black box. Can everyone see what it is except me right now? - [Ken] Yes. (upbeat music) (Austin laughing) This is a family channel Ken. We have to censor this now. This is adult wake up juice or adult go to sleep juice. So, there's a whole story that uncle Austin can tell you about how they tried to name this Teslaquila. But Tequila is actually a type of alcohol that is specifically made in the Tequila region of Mexico. And therefore that's the only place they can have it. And have copyrighted the name's Tequila. So you can't say that this is Austinquila because I would get sued. So Elon now has to call this Tesla tequila. - [Ken] Is that really the story? That's actually a sort of a real fact. Uncle Austin wouldn't lead you astray down the cellar door. Let's see what's inside. The 100% made in Mexico. - [Ken] Don't do that. (soft hiphop music) - Oh, can I ask how expensive this bottle of Tesla tequila was? Cause this looks like a genuine collectible item that was far more expensive than it should have been. - [Ken] So Tesla Tequila from the website. $250. - It's a lot of money for Tequila. - [Ken] Yes but I've always wanted Tesla on the channel and I'm sure you wouldn't like me to buy a car now, would you? But for real though that's a really cool - This actually is very cool. - [Ken] I almost don't wanna even drink for a minute. Honestly. - Read instructions before opening. Whoa. Whoa. I think that two years from now I'll be able to sell this bottle of Tequila and buy Pokemon cards. - [Ken] No! No! I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna save this for a special occasion. - Okay. All right. So, we're not going to drink Tequila at work. - [Matt] Is that special occasion the day that Austin stops talking about Pokemon cards and the Z-Flip - Well, that's never going to happen. I've got to be on brand. We'll drink this the day that This Is makes a good video. - [Ken] I think...whoa - [Matt] Sad Matt noises. - We will crack open this Tesla tequila at 5 million subscribers. So make sure that you are ringalinged the ding-a-ling bell and fully subscribed you and your mother and your mother's ex fiance to the Austin Evans YouTube channel for the latest and greatest and tech and entertainment. And by tech entertainment, I mean bad takes and videos that only people with bad taste such as yourself enjoy, waited I burned the audience. Not supposed to do that asking for subscribing. - [Matt] No. - No. I'm still seeing ( transition sounds) - Oh, hello. Welcome to Snap Circuits. Snap Circuits Junior. Makes learning electronics a snap. Is this just a sick burn to try to tell me that I don't know how to do anything with electronics? - [Ken] We'll start from the ground up. with the fundamentals of technology it is electricity. - Okay. All right. So we have our actual components here. We have our manual, which is quite extensive. There's actually a fair bit here. Huh? - [Ken] How complicated can it be? It's just circuits and batteries. - Never do. - [Matt] They're snap in. - Like it's not complicated. - Okay. So I'm gonna just put this in here. All right. - [Matt] Are you reading the directions? - No. So if we go here and we attach this like so. - [Ken] That seems kinda satisfying. - Is a nice sound when you clip these things together. Okay. I think I am ready for batteries. I have successfully built my little contraption. Thanks, sir. - [Matt] We should get you some rubber gloves for safety. - I think it will be fine. All right. So, if I had successfully built this then this blade will spin as soon as I flip the switch. Is everyone ready? - [Matt] Yes. All right. Three, two, one. (click) - [Ken] Hey! look at that - I'm a tech genius. - [Matt] Austin successfully did something. - Let's not go that far. All right. I've made a DC motor and switch. Let's go... This is way too easy. Let's go do something else. Space war, alarm combo. So let's start with this. We're gonna work our way over. So this goes right here. Okay. And then I'll connect this with the two speaker. Speaker. Speaker. Speaker. Speaker. (upbeat music) Okay. You know, what I think is really helpful is working with Redstone in Minecraft. - [Ken] I was gonna say this actually reminds me of that. - Yes. I don't know what our space war does, but I'm about to find out. Okay. - [Matt] I'm gonna go ahead and assume it says (mimicking). - All right. We're just gonna continue on. Okay. Shall we? - [Matt] Yeah. - Okay. (Soft acoustic music) Gonna drop our batteries in. I need to press the switch several times and wave my hand over the photo resistor, all right. (alarm siren) - [Matt] I told you it was gonna go (mimicking) - So the alarm is going on. That's the rising and lowering tone. - [Ken] You're flicking the light when you go over the-- - yeah. So it shows it's working, right? - [Ken] What is the truth to all of this right now? What is the lesson that we have learned? - Don't ask Uncle Austin for advice. That would be my advice. - [Matt] I can get on board with that. - [Ken] Yeah. (soft transitional music) - I feel like breaking out into song. (upbeat music) Stereo Pod! I don't know what that is. (upbeat music) - [Ken] Yes. (upbeat music) - Excuse me for a moment. Don't peek, okay? (upbeat music) Come on. (upbeat music) Okay. Hello and welcome to the world's largest AirPod Pros (soft hiphop music). Can you tell I'm wearing AirPods right now? I bet you couldn't tell this they're so sleek? - [Matt] Sorry I can't hear you, I'm too poor. - [Matt] I remember you were in that Trevor Wallace. You were about the AirPods. - This is a very accurate I think they're actually speakers. We have a USB port, microUSB. We have an on-off switch. (alarm siren) - [Computer] FM mode. - [Ken] Radio? I bet your AirPod don't have FM radio. - [Matt] I like how it sounds like a hair dryer. (Ken laughing) (wind blowing) - You'll just realize though, the white one is missing the grill. This grill right here. Oh, it fell off in the box. Hang on, hang on. I got this. I'll fix this product. - [Ken] It needs some assembly. - Anyone want to guess at how much the 3X Pod costs. - [Matt] Cheaper than I thought. $50. - 38 bucks. On sale right now. - [Matt] 38 bucks I would get that strictly for the novelty of putting that on the shelf. (soft orchestral music) - Okay. Wait for it. - [Matt] Yeah, there was no drop there. - Okay. Wait for it. Look, these are not amazing sounding speakers but how cool is it to have a giant AirPod? (transitional sound) - [Ken] Austin? - Yes. - [Ken] I have a question for you. - Okay. Hit me. - [Ken] What is the thing that is taking over the world right now? What is the global sensation? - Pokemon - [Ken] Definitely not - Bitcoin. - [Ken] Nope. - Anarchy - [Ken] Close. - Okay. Go ahead. - [Ken] Austin. What are we doing on a daily basis that we haven't done in times before? (suspense music) - Being depressed? - [Matt] Yes. I've been doing that for 20 years. - What am I wearing right now? - A mask. I mean That's a big box. Is that a giant mask or something. (upbeat music) - [Ken] Also while a lot of your answers were correct for what the global sensation is for this year and last year. You missed one. - What's that? - [Ken] Have you ever played the game Among Us? - I've actually never played Among Us. - [Ken] How? I told you. You're literally the only person on this planet has not played Among Us. - Is this thing Among Us like cosplay or something. (box unwrapping) Okay. This looks like something from Black Mirror. - [Ken] Need help there bud? Oh. Oh, look at that. How smooth. Wait. No! No! No! No! Oh, okay. - That was Taekwondo. - [Ken] No it wasn't... (upbeat music) So this will protect you from everything in the world. (Austin laughing) - I know this is now. (paper unwrapping) (Austin laughing) - [Ken] It looks stupider in person. (Ken laughing) - This is my life now. You know am here. - Hi Austin. - Greetings Earthlings. I come from the planet Vulcan. It sounds so stupid from other... You probably some fun to your own reference, - [Matt] The one reference you got is the \"Back to the Future Reference.\" - Oh, speaking of Back to the Future. Hold on. Wait, I got you. I got you. (upbeat music) - You got me the Adapts. He got me the Adapts. Oh my God! The Adapts. Sorry. It's just kinda hard to talk. If you zoom in right now, you'll see that my nose is about an inch farther into my face than it normally is. (laughing) This is not the most comfortable fit. God. I got to say looking through this it's like the worst lens ever. - I could see like all of the warping and stuff of the plastic. - It's like, I'm looking through a plastic like inflatable pool. (all laughing) - Why do they put gloves in the inside? - I don't like. I don't like it. These are the Nike adapts. These are self-lacing shoes. Oh my... Okay. Wow! Wow! Wow! (upbeat music) Well, look the lights. The lights. All right. I just want to put them on. I'm gonna just put them on now. How do you do it? Do you think you just push the button and it laces - [Ken] Stand up. (motorized whirring) - This is it. We've reached peak humanity. (upbeat music) Greetings friends. (upbeat music) You know 2021. Not so bad. (upbeat music) Greetings. Can I order an earth drink please? - I can't hear you. - Know you're supposed to keep six feet of distance from people. I feel like people are keeping like 20 feet of distance from me right now. (upbeat music) This is very warm. This probably should have been ice. (upbeat music) - [Ken] What are you doing? - Would it have killed you if give me a straw. - [Ken] No! Thank you very much for watching this episode of Mystery Tech. Please subscribe. Otherwise I will be forced to keep making videos like this. Anyway, thanks for watching. Goodbye. (upbeat music)",

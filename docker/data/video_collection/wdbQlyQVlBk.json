    "description": "Here is the little guy that I bought:  Let me know if that link stops working!  Impulse buy that actually turned out to be pretty interesting. I always thought the magnetic MacBook chargers were pretty cool. So when I saw an adapter that brought that feature to the iPhones... I had to try it out.    I was expecting a crappy product that didn't actually work... but this one exceeded my expectations.   *This is not a sponsored video*  The camera I used to film this video:  The Lens I used for this video:  And this Metabones adapter:   *Follow me for updates!* Instagram:  Facebook:  Twitter:  GooglePlus:   JerryRigEverything assumes no liability for property damage or injury incurred as a result of any of the information contained in this video.

    "transcript": "One of my suggested purchases on Amazon a few days ago, was this magnetic iPhone 6 and 6s charging cable adapter for 15 bucks. Being my curious self... I bought it. Turns out its actually pretty interesting. You plug one end into your phone, and the other end into your normal charging cable. Then it connects with magnets just like you would with your Macbook. Or Apple laptop. Definitely a little gimmicky, but the magnet inside is actually surprisingly strong. It can even hold the weight of the phone. Technically you could also assume that since you are not putting wear tear on your actual internal charging port, by plugging and unplugging your lightning cable every night, the phone components should last longer. BUT... you'll also have to bring the adapter with you if you want to charge on the go. Or pull it out and remove it. I checked the charge times with the adapter installed. Started off at 13 percent, and when I came back an hour later it was up to 46 percent. So it might be slightly slower than usual. But still not a deal breaker as far as iPhones go. It does stick out a little from the bottom of the phone, and might interfere with some cases... But overall... its not a bad little toy... and would definitely start some conversations. Ill link the little guy in the video description below, if you want to try it out for yourself! And if you are wondering why my black iPhone is all scratched up... head on over to my Diamond verses iPhone video to see what happened. Thanks a ton for watching! Hope to see you around!",

    "transcript": "This here is a viewer's very dirty gaming pc now for those who are not familiar with what we do here in the pcdc playlist i reach out to the local area in and around Orlando Florida and offer to clean viewers systems for free i do not charge a dime so long as they're okay with me filming the process i can monetize these videos that's how i make my money so i don't feel like rolling over any of that cost to the viewer who's already gracious enough to loan me his or her system this one here is definitely in need of a deep cleaning you can see that pretty much every nook and cranny is filled with either dust or cobwebs or something in between and the case is an old hp pavilion one that we will be replacing i'm gonna make an effort though to not upgrade anything else in here because at the end of the day if i upgrade too much it's like what's what's really the point you're upgrading with new clean components you didn't really have to do much deep cleaning to begin with so yeah the case is the one thing we will replace but everything else in here is still covered in very filthy dust and grime and that's gonna require the deep cleaning services brought to you by this youtube channel i think we need to get started stay with me to get rid of that annoying activation watermark hop on over to vip std key and purchase a windows 10 pro oem key for fractions of the price of retail just use the secure payment method like paypal receive your key in seconds and activate your os here bye bye watermark and be sure to use our new offer code skgs for a sweet discount now if you plan on replicating anything you see in this video maybe you have a dirty system that you've neglected for six to twelve months cringe maybe even more than that and it's been building up dust long term you're going to need some utensils some supplies things are going to make the process a bit easier more efficient overall the first thing that i recommend is going to cost you a bit more than a typical can of compressed air and that's an electric duster this one here is not super powerful i'm not saying that it is compared to it an air compressor this is i mean this is like t-bull right but it does have an integrated nylon brush anti-static this will help get up that grind that sticks to especially pcbs and plastic shrouds like you'll find in graphics cards oftentimes compressed air alone even from an industrial compressor is not strong enough to remove grime that's been stuck on for several months to years ask me how i know i have tried and i get comments every now and then from folks who are like why don't you use a compressor that would literally do the job for everything you're showing in the video it's not true i mean you might be okay with that kind of result but i guarantee it's not going to look as thorough as this that's why we call this a deep cleaning what you're doing with a compressor in most cases is not a deep cleaning you're just kind of cleaning the surface dust you're not getting in and around the grime in the small little nooks and crannies around smds around heat sinks things that people generally overlook because it's just not really worth their time or effort to go that deep into it and i understand your time is valuable and it just doesn't really make sense for you to do that in my case this is what i do for a living more or less i want to go as far into it as possible that's again why i call this a deep cleaning series now this is still as much as i'm praising it nowhere near as effective as tag teaming it with something like isopropyl alcohol and q-tips i also like to combine that with shop towels because these are easier to clean larger services also helps soak up oils and things that you might come across while you are cleaning you'll want to wear some latex or nitrile gloves preferably nitrile if you're allergic to latex and you'll probably want some sort of diy disassembly kit this one's pretty cheap it's just like a knockoff ifixit kit and i'll have that linked below as well so with all that out of the way i think it's about time we embark on our journey this is episode eight or nine or something like that i believe we're almost at the end folks of season two i hope you enjoy the deep cleaning process here we go thank you this is so thank you so is and all right we have thoroughly deep cleaned literally everything in this build and i've decided to make a few changes first off i mentioned earlier in the video that i was going to be upgrading this case i'm not going to be doing that a couple things i ran into first off the power supply just based on where it's mounted in this chassis won't fit in the matx case that i wanted to use the new one i mean it'll fit it'll slide into the enclosure but the cable links are far too short and i don't have any extenders i don't want to have to order some and wait to get this system back to the viewer i want to get this done today so we're just gonna stick with this case that said it did clean up quite nicely there are a few spots where uh the framing has oxidized but uh you know i'm not gonna polish and and whatnot it just doesn't make sense in a in a case this cheap one of the other things though that i noticed when i was deconstructing everything is the fact that this hard drive which is the only storage drive in the build wasn't mounted anywhere see in these frames typically the hard drives mount in a cage that would be positioned about right here and i noticed this was kind of all bare so it looks like this cage was removed at one point you see the clip that holds the cage in and it was never replaced it was never reinserted so when i received the build this hard drive was literally sitting underneath the optical drive not mounted to anything it wasn't screwed down it was just kind of sloshing around and that is a big no-no when transporting a system if you have a hard drive like this that's just kind of chilling you want to be super super careful um this you can't treat these like ssds right these have physical platters moving components that are very easy to break so i'm not even sure if this hard drive is going to work anymore and i'm going to have to let the owner know i just there's nothing i can do by the time we realized that it was just kind of sitting in there i had brought it in i was wondering i was like what's what's kind of what's kind of sliding around in there yeah worst case scenario there so i'm going to be throwing in a one terabyte ssd might be a 500 ssd from crucial i'm not going to put anything on it but i will connect it to the system so that this owner can at some point if he or she desires uh install an operating system on it or migrate the data from this hard disk drive over to that ssd not only will it be much faster but then you won't have to worry in the future about this thing getting sloshed around yeah kind of cringe so with those explanations out of the way it is time to finally reassemble everything starting first with the case here we go so and would you look at that we started with a pretty rough oem dust everywhere this case was caked in it as were the primary components the motherboard the cpu itself was actually covered in dust it's kind of hard to do because it's usually covered entirely by a cpu cooler and the gravity card looked pretty rough as well we've restored all of it you can see that transformation here on camera it looks so much better despite still looking quote-unquote oem you know with the green motherboard and the sort it looks like a new oem and that's kind of the goal i was after now this of course would be pointless if the system refuses to turn on so i always like to check this before i return these systems to their rightful owners we're going to plug this in at the rear we've got the green light on the power supply let's try the power button all right we have four fans in this system one in the graphics card one in the cpu cooler an exhaust fan for the case and then a fan in the power supply all four turning we don't hear any clipping or anything we've got this little screen connected to the 750 ti and there we go that there is our post we are good to go and surprisingly the hard drive looks to be okay at least on the surface there could be potential issues down the line and that's why i wanted to upgrade the viewer with that one terabyte crucial ssd well thank you so much for watching this far into the video and for supporting us on sites like amazon you can find all the cleaning gear i use to clean this system to make it look as good as it does right now in the video description you want to check any of that out some of it's good to have just on standby because your build will inevitably get dusty over time the trick is to clean it repetitively every few months or so depending on its environment so that you don't ever need to resort to running a deep cleaning process like we did here only when systems get this bad do you really need to tear them all down about as far as they will go if you're just you know cleaning surface dust and the like and even a can of air will do the job so that repetitive maintenance will prevent the need to do something as time-consuming is this this takes a full two days usually and that includes filming uh to take care of uh so yeah routine maintenance make sure you don't skip out on it we only have one episode left in season two of pcdc and i'll be honest with you guys i'm not sure when the third season is coming like i said before these take a lot longer to produce to film to clean than usual there are a few health concerns associated with this as well i like filming this stuff indoors because it's easier to do on camera it looks cleaner it's much nicer and more presentable for the camera but at the end of the day um it's it's starting to catch up to me i breathe in a lot of this dust i do have a respirator but i just i don't like wearing that indoors for long amounts of time and yeah so what i did was i bought one of the it's what is it it's a medify air i'm not plugging it but it's a an air filter type thing it's a pretty big one and that's helped quite a bit with a dust build up here in the office i do deep clean after every one of these episodes we have a video showing how thorough i am with the cleaning process here in this room but at the end of the day it's still a lot and it's a lot of effort and labor that goes into these kinds of videos so it's difficult to keep up as quickly as we do with playlists like the fixer-flop series that one's been doing quite well as well but that one is one that i mean i can troubleshoot a build in a couple of hours right this takes two full days so if i'm getting similar view counts on both i'm more inclined to continue fix your flop because i can push more videos out in that series than i can this year that and we just don't have a lot of super dirty systems in the orlando florida area that need to be cleaned anymore it seems like a lot of the submissions we're getting are just not very dirty i think they just either want the attention or they maybe want free components or what have you and that's fine and it's not illegal no one's stopping you from trying but at the end of the day we're looking for really dirty stuff and this one's certainly qualified it's much better looking now so if you live around central florida and you're willing to drop off your system for a few days to allow me to clean it for free and you think your system is dirty enough it needs to be at least as dirty as this or dirty or the dirtier the better frankly send my wife an email her email is in the video description it's lisa salazarstudios.org she goes through dozens of them every day it seems like and most of them just are not dirty enough so if you have a really dirty one and you don't want to have to pay anybody to have it thoroughly cleaned then uh yeah send her an email that's what we're waiting for uh with that if you guys enjoyed the video be sure to give us a thumbs up i would appreciate that leave a comment down below and consider subscribing if you have not already my name is greg thanks for cleaning with me",

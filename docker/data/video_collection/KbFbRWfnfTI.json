    "transcript": "Samsungs new Buds3 Pro earbuds have been embroiled in quite the controversy! At unveil, they were criticized for taking, well, HEAVY design inspiration from. elsewhere And if that wasn't enough, massive quality control issues have led Samsung to temporarily halt shipments. Theyve even issued a formal apology for the flub! But the pair I purchased arrived before the stop orderand I cant wait to tell you what I think as an Apple fanboy and audiophile (who has lowered himself to daily-driving the ever-convenient USB-C AirPods Pro 2). Alright, lets not mince words herethese are clearly clones of AirPods. Now, before all the Samsung fans get mad, hear me out they arent clones just because they moved to thein my opinionsuperior stem design popularized by Apple clear back in 2016; a move which gives this generation of Buds Pro real-world benefits well discuss soon. No, its mostly the shamelessness of the case. I mean, get real: they copied down to the exact status LED placement with identical colors. Colors that yes, have changed from the prior-gen of Buds Pro to match AirPods. Frankly, if not for the clear lid, youd fool almost anybody into thinking these WERE AirPodsand despite what Samsung execs have stated, I think that was the point. Now, theyre obviously not direct clones and differences exist unfortunately, just about every minor design variance Samsung did take was for the worse: (1) the pairing button is in a less accessible spot than AirPods, (2) the magnetic hinge is neither as strong nor as satisfying to fidget with, (3) the case does charge via Qi, but not Qi2 like AirPods, (4) theres no lanyard attachment and the case requires its own bulky, third-party enclosure for keychain support, (5) theres no case speaker for finding it when lost, and perhaps most offensively, (6) the Buds are less convenient to get in and out. Where Apple seats the AirPods in the same orientation as the intended ear, the Buds3 Pro requires you to rotate them to get them into the caseand due to the non-tapered entry cavities, the triangular stem design, and the open front, its wildly easy to hit the hole at the wrong angle and send the bud into a fumble frenzy. I thought this was the type of thing Id get used to, but Im notI have to intentionally lower them in every time. Is it a big deal? No, but its one of those things that makes you think: If youre gonna copy the AirPods visually, at least copy them functionally, too. All that being said, I do like that the case can stand up. Its cute. Before we get to the Buds themselves, lets talk about two neat features not observed by most reviewers: While these lack the awesome ecosystem switchover youd find in Apple land where you pair them once to a single device and then can access them from phone to watch to tablet to computer to TV, Samsung has tried the best they can. Theres seamless pairing between Android devices with the Wear app installed, Samsung TVs prompt pairing, and even on Windows 11 PCs, you can hold the pairing button down, and a quick pair card displays, allowing you to avoid spelunking into the Windows Bluetooth settings. This is a nice improvement over the previous gen, but you are still pairing to every device individuallyeven Samsung devices. And this leads me to the MASSIVE disappointment that all but disqualifies me from using these full-time: there is no true multipoint Bluetooth support, the norm in non-Apple high-end headphones now. This, if you dont know, allows you to be actively paired to multiple devices at the same time so you can press play on one device, then press play on another device, with no pairing switching shenanigans. Buds3 Pro cant do thatso every time you want to switch audio briefly between your PC and your Galaxy phone, youve got to go into Bluetooth settings to re-establish a connection. And that sucks. Something that doesnt suck? Todays sponsorNordVPN! Look, youve heard the VPN spiel before and if youre like meyouve likely had run-ins with slow, unreliable services before. NordVPN is the oppositehaving made serious effort to be the fastest all-around VPN in the world. Independent testers found that not only did NordVPN crush the competition in performance; but no-log, always-encrypted, never shared or tracked traffic makes it as privacy-oriented as can be. Sure, you can use it to, say, watch content abroad (like all VPNs), but features like their Threat Detection Pro system really set Nord aparttracking and protecting you from attempted malware, phishing, scams, and other malicious content sent to or clicked by you. Whats more, their Dark Web Monitor lets you know if your info ever makes it onto the net with steps on how to mitigate the damage. With dedicated apps on all major platforms and up to 10 simultaneous supported connects on a a single account, you have no reason not to try NordVPN today. But if youre somehow still hesitant, give their 30-day money-back guarantee a shot! By using the link below, youll get an exclusive deal with 4 extra months free and support Snazzy Labs in the process. Thanks to you, and NordVPN! The second neat feature Samsung has implemented is improved finding capabilities for lost Buds. Previously, you could only use SmartThings to play audio out of a Bud that was still paired and charged but misplaced. That feature still exists and now flashes the LED strip as well, but when the Buds are in their case, you can use UltraWide Band to find themor so the app suggests, exceptha, jokes on you sucker, the Buds3 Pro doesnt have an UWB chip. So it only supports basic signal finding with a paired Samsung device. And my success rate here has been wildly spottysometimes it works great, and sometimes it cant see the case even when its right next to the phone. Dear every tech company everthat includes you too Apple: just put ultra-wide band device finding in everything. Please! All right, lets talk about the Buds themselves: theyresurprise, surprisepretty similar in weight, fit, and feel to AirPods Pro 2 with a few exceptionsnamely construction quality. The two plastic halves are literally different shades of white, and their fit seam isnt greatin fact, Ive already started to collect crack pud in my left bud, which I very much do not like. The stems steal the same capacitive swipe volume and pressure-sensor clicks from AirPods Pro; however, the stem shapewhich can best be described as a triangle that lost a fight with a trash compactormakes it surprisingly difficult to actually click. Put your two fingers on the sloped edges and they just slip off. Put your thumb on the tiny squared-off edge, and you have to put a shocking amount of pressure to get it to actually trigger. Part of this weird design shape is to accommodate the gimmicky bluish-white LED strips that have 3 animation settings but otherwise do absolutely nothing of value. Also, somewhat hilariously, as we continue down the road of QC issues, one of my buds is noticeably brighter than the other. The silicone tips Samsung uses feel cheaper and less flexible than Apples, but the main problem is they also smell legitimately awful. Even after leaving them out of the case for 2 days, they failed to off-gas much at all. Normally I love noxious chemicals, but these just smell like hot, sweaty cancer butthole. Speaking of buttholes, the black dots on each bud are indeed ear-presence sensors for pausing and resuming, but theyre curiously disabled by default. Perhaps its because theyre weirdly slow to react. Like, ok, Im gonna play a song Ill pull the bud out and tell you when it finally pauses. . now. No jokeits bizarre. OK, by this point you may be thinkingthis guy totally hates these things: he is an Apple soyboy. Untrue, I have a mild soy allergyand I actually love these things. Mostly for their audio quality which well save for last, but first a couple other highlights I think are brilliant: (#1) these are superb for iPhone usersreally. They have on-device voice recognition for basically every inline remote command with no wake keyword required so you just say: volume up, volume down, stop and play music, next and previous song, even answer and reject call. It all works perfectly and instantly on any device, which is so cool. (#2) The transparency mode is exceptionally good. AirPods have always been a bit too aggressive and bright in their transparency like they are almost trying to be even better than the natural ear. These dont do that. They just sound exactly like what your ears normally hear (albeit with a tiny bit of noise-floor hiss)I vastly prefer the Samsungs. (#3) call and microphone quality is exceptionally goodthe same cannot be said of AirPods Pro 2. Apple is alleged to be improving call quality as part of iOS 18, but Ill tell ya what pal, it aint here yet and the Buds3 Pro are stellar in this category today. (#4) theres a bunch of neat features processed on-device but they unfortunately require Samsungs Wear app for Android to enable things like switching to ambient mode when voices or sirens are detected, auto-enabling ambient sound during a phone call or memo so you can hear yourself talk and then going back to ANC when youre done, customizable pinch controls (the Bixby control enables Siri on iOS, by the way) and audible chastisement warnings if youve had crappy posture for more than 10 minutes. All of those things are really nice but they pale in comparison to the sound. These headphones implement a really neat and unusual driver design carried over from the Buds2 Proeach bud has two drivers: a dynamic, full-range driver and a microplanar tweeter (which are pretty unusual). A new addition in this years buds is a dual-amplifier design givingin theorymore power and control to each. And in practice, the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro sound fantasticfull stop. Subjectively, I find them to sound exactly as AREGINAs fantastic test has found them to measure objectively. That is to say they follow the Harman IE target pretty dang closely. I found the sub-bass and sub-200Hz mid-bass to be elevated and punchy but without being muddy or too in-your-face. The mids are very tame but inoffensive, and the treble extension through the high-mids is excellent, tapering off just around 7kHz (which the AirPods Pro 2 quite famously dontresulting in fatigue and harshness during cymbal-heavy or vocally sibilant passages). Its very much a mainstream v-shaped listening experience. If that didnt make any sense to you, let me put it like this: the vast majority of people will prefer the sound signature choices made in the Galaxy Buds3 Pro over the AirPods Pro 2. As a 30-year-old audio chad that finds the Harman IE a bit to shouty and prefers mid-heavy signatures, Id still gravitate to the AirPods Pro 2 if I could only have onebut thats not to say anything negatively of the Samsungs at all: theyre objectively excellent. One area where I have seen a lot of praise for these by other reviewersoften being stated best-in-classis ANC. Because I dont feel like theyre all that spectacular. I found them to have very weak low-end bass blocking. So fans, vacuums, lawnmowers, etc those will be just fine. But car and airplane engines, or lower-frequency vibrations like refrigerator and ice maker compressors will find their way into your ear canal much more than they do on AirPods. I also found the Buds3 Pro to have a higher-than-expected noise floor in ANC mode: a bit reminiscent of that old BOSE noise-canceling hiss of yesteryear. Its not horrid, and certainly not a dealbreaker for me, but I even remember the last-gen Buds2 Pro performing better. And Apples AirPods Pro 2 absolutely outperform Samsungs latest. If you own a Samsung phone, these are the buds you want. Videos over. But I think Samsung really blew it here with their support of other devicesrather, the lack thereof. Once these become price-competitive with AirPods Pro (which theyre not yet given AirPods are always $50-80 off retail), I would have no problem recommending these to almost anybody, including Apple users, IF they had two things that they currently very crucially lack: multipoint Bluetooth support and an iOS configuration app. I know that the idea behind Samsungs strategy as of late is to create their own brand-specific ecosystem as Apple has done, but that isyet againcopying the worst of Apple not the best of Apple. Despite offering TVs, laptops, watches, phones, and tablets just like Apple, Samsung lacks the same low-level OS control and this makes their ecosystem feel more like a knock-off and less like a seamless, interconnected experiencesomething that does these Buds no favors towards being perceived as wholly original. If Samsung is smart, theyll fix the litany of QC issues, improve compatibility through firmware, and try to market these as the definitive in-ear wireless earbuds. For everybody. Unfortunately, I dont think they will and these will never become more than the oh those are the AirPods you buy if you have a Samsung, which is a real travesty. It would also be a travesty if you clicked away without leaving a like and comment or checking out this video. Thanks so much for watching, and as always, stay snazzy.",

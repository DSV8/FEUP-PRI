    "transcript": "hey guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and today we saw some really cool stuff at Razer our first video which you can find up right here covered razors new a raptor monitor but this time there's something a bit different this is actually the first time we're covering something for consoles but there's a PC gaming spin here too okay so this is the turret for Xbox one and yeah that's the mouse on keyboard it's been designed as part of the direct partnership with Microsoft and Razer to see if they can bring more controller options to the console Razer is already officially announced it but this is the first time we were able to go hands-on so let's take a closer look at this thing but first I want to mention our sponsors for this show without the help from Razer MSI Phanteks Thermaltake CES would just not have been possible there's actually been a lot of teasers from both Microsoft and Razer about this launch because the turret is actually the very first completely wireless keyboard and mouse combo available for the Xbox one it actually allows for a PC like gaming experience which could seriously benefit certain game types for example controlling strategy games with a regular console controller is frustrating and it could also give gamers a very real competitive advantage in FPS games and I'm not quite sure how Microsoft and game developers will address that speaking of games not everyone is supported right now but there are about 25 of those included with you know inclusions like pub G fortnight Rainbow six sage minecraft and warframe the approach here is basically a repeat of the original RAZER turret but with upgraded components that means it is designed to be used on your lap while you sit in front of a TV rather than in front of a desk and a monitor there's a plush cushion for your lap that has an integrated holder for the keyboard and mouse mat the other thing that I need to mention is that the turret for Xbox one is completely compatible with Razer chroma and in some games it has full ambient light integration for example in vermintide 2 and X Morphin defense the keyboard and mouse can change the color based on the events that are happening on-screen so that includes you know health status and whatnot what's really interesting is that both the keyboard and the mouse can be controlled here this single 2.4 gigahertz wireless receiver and there is a compartment within the mouse to stash that receiver which is pretty convenient I should also mention that viola was playing around with the setup the mouse was actually really magnetic to the trackpad and there are some magnets holding the mouse from falling completely from the surface so it is a good and a bad thing but again this is all something to be tested along in long-term so definitely stay tuned for our review there's something else we needed to mention and that's pricing because this thing costs two hundred and fifty dollars us yikes the turret isn't cheap for sure but it will be really interesting to see how a keyboard and mouse setup will change a console landscape there are plenty of games that will benefit from it but we can also see this being considered a cheat in some online games like PUBG since aiming with a mouse is so much easier than with a controller so there you guys have it what do you think of the turret is it something that you guys would add on to your Xbox one setup there's gaming with a keyboard and mouse combo on a couch even appeal to you let us know in the comments down below and stay tuned for more coverage from CES 2019 I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

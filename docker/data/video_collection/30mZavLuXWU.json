    "transcript": "- Show me the money. Show me 12 monies. Xiaomi me is here with the Xiaomi 12 Pro, their 12th pro phone. I don't think that's right, but we're gonna go with it. (chuckles) I'd love to take a look at this phone, except that it's in a locked box with a combination on it. What's your fricking problem, Jono? What are you doing this to me? - [Jono] Everything. - What is this? What am I supposed to do? - [Jono] Answer my riddle. (Riley wheezes) - I did not sign up for this. - [Announcer] A few moments later. (Jono cheers) - Well, that was almost too easy. The Xiaomi 12 Pro. Sound by Harmon and Kardon. They got both of them this time. (giggles) And 5G connectivity because it's got the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 which I think comes with 5G by default, most of the time, unless they disable it. This is the Pro. I think I was expecting it to be more of like a budget flagship option. This phone is aiming squarely at the S22 Ultra and the Pixel 6 Pro. I'll take the thing off first. Whoa. You know what? This happens to me every time on \"ShortCircuit\". I don't care about the actual finish on a phone, but then I take off the wrapping paper and I look at the back and I'm like, \"That looks pretty nice.\" Sometimes I can understand why people would want to not put a case on their phone, even though not putting a case on your phone is objectively stupid. They did the science. The science is in, I'm sorry. The Xiaomi logo like leaves a little shadow. - [Brandon] Ohhhh. - [Riley] You can see it now? - [Brandon] I do a little- - [Riley] You can't see it. You're lying. - [Brandon] No, I saw it once. - The point is, that's kinda cool. (chuckles) What else comes in the box? They give you a case with it, is that normal or is that for us? - [Brandon] That's the problem? - What's that? - [Brandon] Who's gonna make a case for this phone? - That's rude. - [Brandon] Very few people. - [Riley] Got some papers that probably say, \"Careful, don't take a bath with it.\" IP68 water resistance. - [Crew] And dust resistance. - So that means you can take it for a bath, but none of these companies are gonna tell you to take it for a bath, but I am. (wheezes) Just kidding. (chuckles) - [Jono] Don't do it. - [Riley] Should I put the case on? - [Jono] Noooo, gross! - [Riley] Looks cheap. You you want other people to know that you have an expensive phone? - [Brandon] I think it's that the aesthetic of the phone can- Wow. - [Jono] Lol. - I'm also angry about this. This is the 120 Watt charging brick. This thing's huge. And also in the box we have a USB A to C. So on the back we already had like a little bit of a look at it. The cool like design on the camera module. You ever seen lines like that, Brandon? - [Brandon] No. (Riley wheezes) Never in my life. - [Riley] So on this side we got the power button and the volume rocker. On the top we got mic, some holes, speaker things. This thing apparently has a quad speaker set up. We'll test that out. Like there's definitely one on either side. Over here, absolutely nothing. On the bottom, a dual SIM card tray as far as I'm aware, but no micro SD card. USB Type-C for charging and the other speaker grill. Let's turn this sucker on after this message from our sponsor, Vessi. Vessi footwear is known for being lightweight, easy to pack, comfortable, and most importantly waterproof with its Dyma-tex technology and even more importantly, on my foot. Their Everyday Move linepup is made to keep up with your active lifestyle with its added support at the midsole and better breathability. It also has a pull tab to take them off and put them on with ease and it's made creature free. So you can take each step in them, guilt free. Trust me, you'll wanna wear these puppies everywhere. Keep your feet dry and save 25 bucks with offer code shortcircuit at Vessi.com/shortcircuit. The display we're looking at 6.73 inches. 20:9 aspect ratio and it's 120 Hertz refresh rate like most of the big old flagships we're dealing with nowadays in terms of iPhones and Androids. And like those other ones, it's supposed to have like an adaptive sync thing where it like will adjust the refresh rate depending on what your doing. LPTO AMOLED 3,200 by 1,400 pixels. Now you have all the information. We got a 1,000 nits sustained, I believe. And 1,500 peak brightness, which is actually the same as the fancy old mini-LED iPad Pro that came out last year that everyone was making such a big deal about, about the brightness and the contrast and the dynamic range and whatnot. But that's pretty impressive to see like basically the same capability in a handheld smartphone. 480 Hertz touch sampling. I don't know what the touch sampling is for the main phones 'cause I haven't paid attention but that's more than 120 Hertz, I think. Wait, what battery are we at? 38? I wanna plug it in while I keep talking and then we can like time it. Now look at this 38 point, that you can see the percentage going up. That's pretty cool. I feel like all smartphones should have that. So Xiaomi claims that their fast charging technology can get the phone to a 100% in 18 minutes, but they also have an ability to enable a constant temperature mode, which I guess will make it like a little bit less hot. And even using that, it'll get to a 100% in 24 minutes. And they also have like 50 Watt wireless charging which I think they were saying is faster than the Galaxy S22 wired charging. These are all on paper claims, you know? So this is \"ShortCircuit\". The phone apparently also has reverse wireless charging at 10 Watts. Ah, the UI here, I don't remember ever using Xiaomi like their, I think they call it MIUI, which is their flavor of Android. It's Android 12 here, apparently. I haven't looked at the system but that's what it's supposed to ship with. And they have their app drawer that's split into different categories. So that's pretty cool. I like this sort of transparency, that kinda looks like Samsung's deal. Will it charge my pixel 3? It is! And actually this is funny now because the Pixel 3, I believe by default, it only charges wirelessly at 5 Watts and you needed to buy like the 10 Watt Pixel Stand. If you bought the Pixel Stand it would charge at 10 Watts. New tag collected? Oh no, it thinks it's like an NFC thing. It's already at 66% and I started at 38. And the phone is getting a little warm. My only criticism is make this a regular plug and then I'll buy this phone. Is this available in North America? - [Jono] No. - No. (chuckles) All right, time to take a look at these fancy, fancy cameras that they make such a big deal about. 50 megapixels each. The S22 Ultra has a 108 megapixel main camera, but the Pixel 6 has a 50 megapixel camera, just one of them. But I think this is the only phone that I've seen, correct me if I'm wrong in the comments, with three 50 megapixel sensors, this better be good. Brandon, what should I take a picture of? I'll take a picture of you. Pretty good. I feel like I see a little bit more softness in some areas than I would like to but otherwise things are looking pretty sharp. Viewing the camera performance of a phone at this point is like you're talking more about the software than you're talking about the actual hardware. The selfie camera is not 50 megapixels. It is 32 megapixels. There's a vlog mode. Wait, 50 megapixel. Now we're in 50 megapixel mode. - [Jono] Is this like using all three sensors? - [Riley] I don't know, but let's see if that's any sharper. Oh! Yeah. So that first photo I took was not 50 megapixels 'cause I can't zoom in as far. I'm guessing it's not. I can zoom in farther in the 50 megapixel photo I took than I can in the other one. So I'm guessing that in order to make full use of the 50 megapixel shooter you have to enable 50 megapixel mode, which is kind of weird, I don't love that. But like I guess they're trying to save storage, but the configurations on this phone, especially the Pro one, it comes with 256 gig storage options. So I don't think you're really worried about space that much with that. Ahhhh. Pro. Oh, okay. So they have like a pro mode where you can like manipulate each of these settings manually. So that's cool. Oh, they have manual focus even. Selfie time! So I'm not seeing like an extra wide option here but this already looks like plenty wide. Hooo! You can't take a selfie and not make a noise. AI? AI camera! I don't know what the AI camera does, but it's plenty wide though. Look at how wide that is. Pew! Wow, we got the whole building in this photo basically. How's the stabilization? I'll stay on you for a second. Pretty fricking stable. (Jono speaks faintly) Brandon! - Yeah? - [Riley] This shot could be on a tripod. I'm shaking the camera right now. That could be on a tripod too. That was a joke. I don't know what resolution that footage was at but apparently you can shoot 8K 24fps video with the main shooter on the back. They're all 50 megapixels but only the main one can shoot eight 8K 24 and 4k 30fps and 60fps. But I guess if you're gonna be switching between cameras and stuff, you don't have the option of doing 8K. So you can just click up here and then you have the option of switching between, that's pretty cool actually. I like this little quick settings thing. A lot of the time you have to go into a full settings menu but I like that you can still see the view finder while just like switching between 4k/8K. Yeah, 8K 24fps, 4K, 30 or 60. But what happens if I switch it to the ultra wide? Can I shoot, oh, it can stil, no. If you click 8K it defaults to the regular wide camera but on 4K you can switch between the different lenses. Oh, I should be able to film 8K however I want. Okay. Now I'm in 4k mode. Zooming in on Jono. Tell me all your thoughts. What are you thinking in your brain? All right, show me these quad speakers, whatever that means. (upbeat music) (Riley chuckles) This gives me such joy, every time we do this. The screen looks pretty bright. I believe them with their knits claims, definitely loud. Like we're shouting over it right now. As far as I can tell, maybe they have like two speakers in behind each of the grills or something? The phone does seem a little bit thicker than some of the other flagship phones we're seeing these days. So maybe they had room to stick two speakers per grill. One thing I also didn't say earlier about the display was that there's like a little bit of an edge going on which most other manufacturers have kinda stopped doing. Many of them have anyways. The speakers were about as good as I'd ever heard in a smartphone. Maybe the iPhone might be a little bit better 'cause we were yelling over it. - [Crew] Yeah. - The one big question. The most important question in my mind: the price. And this one is 1100 I think, for the 128 gig model and 1200 for the 256 gig model? We don't have official pricing info from Xiaomi right now but that appears to be what it is. There is a Xiaomi 12 and a 12X that we didn't get. And I think that one starts at 650. So there are some, if you are like, \"Aw, I definitely want a Xiaomi.\", there are some options as well. But at 1100, probably look elsewhere if you're looking for one with like a much better price to performance ratio. But I am impressed, especially with the charging. Well that was a short circuit or as I call them long circuits because I take my sweet time.

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - This is ASUS' top tier cooler and it's huge and expensive and I wanna to see what's inside and I hope it performs, and it should, it's got three Noctua iPPC fans. It's got another fan on top of the cooler, for like bonus cooling, and a three and a half inch screen, if that's what you're into. I don't think it can play Doom though, so negative points for that. But, hopefully it should do pretty well, and we're gonna find out on a huge test bench I have over here. Let's see what's inside. Oh! (upbeat music) Okay, well, classic ROG. It is well presented and well packed. Got clearly the cooler right here. Looks to be an inch thick. It's 360 millimeters. There is a 360 mil and a 240 mil version of this. It is very crinkly, so I'm gonna take off these bags. (crinkling) Ooh! It's not particularly long, but there's the big ol' screen there. Got pre-applied thermal paste, nice. And under this screen is where that bonus fan is. I hope I can take that off and take a look. Let's see what else is in the box first. Oh, comes with a fan hub. Yeet. (thudding) Cooler installation guide. Stickers! Love stickers, just, well, bigger stickers. Ah, my favorite thing in the world is in here. (crinkling) Wait for it. VHB. The answer to all life's problems. Stick anything to anything, as long as it's not like gas. Ah, ooh, these are nice. These are our Noctua fans. Now if you're paying this much money for a cooler, you better get the best of the best when it comes to fans. So these are 2000 RPM 120 mil Noctua iPPC fans. And it's just top tier. And they're black. Yeah, I remember Linus doing a video where he tested these underwater. These are like 30 bucks a piece. So like, here you go. 90 bucks worth of fans. So the MSRP on the 360 millimeter version is $310. And that's a lot of money. But it gets worse, right now on Newegg, these are selling for $550. I don't know why, just don't pay that much money for this. But when you add up the cost of all these parts, it kinda makes sense. So we have 90 bucks worth of fans here. I mean, what's a rad this big cost, Jono? Like $80, $90 bucks? Something along those lines. You got the screen, which you can't really just integrate yourself or do it this well anyway. You got the fan on top of an Asetek seventh gen pump. (clicking) And all the mounting hardware that you could dream of. And you don't have to buy fittings or any of that jazz, it's just sealed, it's easy. You know, what's your time worth too, right? If you're gonna spend four hours configuring a custom loop and that's on the light side, you know, if you price yourself really low at 15 bucks, call that another 60 bucks. So, there is a value proposition here for simplicity, and a screen. Ah, so it looks like the standard bracket that comes mounted on here won't fit 'cause the socket is bigger. So we'll have to twist, is it a lock on, how does this work? Get, there we go. Boop, that comes off. And I gotta be careful not to get thermal paste all over my shiny new reflective shirt from LTTstore.com. Let's get to putting this thing on, shall we? I got to take off the the tried and true D15S. Anthony already benchmarked it for me, so I know what sort of performance to expect out of a top tier air cooler. We'll see how this water cooler stands up. Now, we're removing SecuFirm2, which is already the best in the industry, in my opinion. And we'll see how this mounting system works, and how easy it is comparatively. The cooler has Noctua fans but the mounting hardware is not SecuFirm2. I would buy it immediately if it was, give it to everyone. We're tired, we're sick and tired of bad mounting systems. (somber music) (rattling) ASMR. (rattling) I should have probably read the instructions here. I'm just gonna put a couple headers in here so I don't lose this, and then I'm going to double check the instructions. So I haven't used the mounting system on one of these open bench tables for an AIO, so we're gonna figure out how that works. So this board has huge VRMs, fine, but like I can't get a screwdriver in there to drive the Phillips head, let alone turn the darn thing. (calm music) It's not great. This is not SecuFirm. Anything less than SecuFirm is not great in my opinion. The struggle bus is here and I am all aboard. Okay, Jono grabbed me some tweezers. Not tweezers, pliers. (calm music) Okay, well, that's as much mounting pressure as we're gonna get today anyway. Oh! (cameraman laughing) Interesting, okay! - [David] Now we know. - Well, now we know, there's there's that bonus fan, and that would have changed, what, is that in the manual? Yeah, it doesn't say anything about that. That that pops off. - [Jono] Would that solve a million problems? - Yes, absolutely, I can see the screws now. (David laughing) It's not funny. Okay, no your instructions are useless. But inside here, this is pretty cool. Big ol' ribbon cable, so there's gonna be a graphics driver on here somewhere. This ribbon cable will feed the display. Got some pins that rest in these holes. So this is what's gonna cool all these VRMs, so we're gonna get airflow down through and around out to around these Heatsink fans, and it'll help move heat away from the VRM. So, in theory, that'll be handy. These are PWM fans, so they're all individually controllable, I think. Not bad. Oh, there comes everything else. That's a big display, like three and a half inches is not a tiny display to have on top of your USB. And we can finally hit the power button. And watch these beautiful Noctuas spin up, I'm gonna turn them towards you so you can see all that action.

So check 'em out at the link below and get a special signup bonus. - And we're back. Power on, whoa! It's not that bad. Those fans are pushing some air, though. Okay, anyway, so add Idle CPU package is sitting at 27 degrees, like that's low, that's where I'd expect it to be. Okay, we got Armoury Crate installed, we have Blender ready to go on a Gooseberry Benchmark, we've upped the samples to 1200 from 600. Should run for about 10 minutes, and we're monitoring this CPU package and core max temperature. Let's hit F12, boop. Renders. Okay, big spike up to 60. And we're down to 41, so we should hear the fans start to ramp up here. So with the D15S, after 10 minutes, our hottest core was at 98 C. The CPU package was at 97. Equilibrium temp is 92 to 93. So we're at 69, nice. Let's see how long it takes to actually like hit a good equilibrium. This might take a little while. CPUs pulling 205 watts. So I mean, it's working. I don't run Gooseberry very often, so I don't know this fast or slow, but regardless, we're hitting it with 205 Watts, and it's sitting at 69 degrees. Nice. This is wrong. CPU core zero, like all these cores are at 4.90. Wait, there's our efficiency core is 3.7. Like it's just sitting at 67 degrees. So I feel pretty confident saying that this cooler's doing its job. It's quiet, it's expensive, but it does its job. Inside a case, it would be a different story, so we do need to acknowledge that if this was in a case, it would perform way differently, you know, call it five, 10 degrees, and then you still at 70 degrees, which is fine, there's like headroom for overclocking there. Oh, I want to check the VRM temperatures. Yeah, VRM temperatures, like 45 degrees right now. Nothing, I'm gonna say it, this is a good cooler. It's ASUS, like, I'm not that surprised, you know, but it is expensive, but the time you save with it is probably worth it, and you got a big screen on it. Ooh, should we try to play with the screen? Is that the last thing we do? Yeah, okay. So we can play around with the screen. We're just gonna use the three built in graphics unless Jono, did you get one for me? Okay, we didn't anyway, but it updates rather quickly. And boop, there's number one. And number two. And retro wave, my favorite. Yeah, so like the screen works. It's bright, it looks good. I mean, you can put whatever jiff or GIF, whatever you prefer to say it on it, and it performed really well. So if this 360 will fit in your case, go for it. If it doesn't, use the 240. And if you can afford it that is too. I mean, an AERCO is obviously going to be cheaper, but this is well, chilly, it works. And with that, thanks for watching \"Short Circuit.\" Get subscribed, check out more of our videos in our back catalog, and I'll see you on another day.",

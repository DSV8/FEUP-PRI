    "transcript": "- You, guys. So today, in my video, I am going to show you some of the worst phone cases that I've ever seen in my entire life, and some of these are just out of control. I mean, they're so funny that I can't wait to show them to you and see what you think. Before we get into those, a huge thank you to today's video partner, Dropbox, who is sponsoring a portion of this video. Dropbox Backup, super easy to use, and it lets me have access to all of my files when I'm on the go. I can back up my entire computer and my external drives without worrying about storage limits. I like that I could automatically have it upload on my computers online, and a drive is connected, and I won't have to worry about a drive failing or something tragic happening to my computer. Dropbox Backup gives me the peace of mind that all of my files are easily accessible and safe. This makes me feel so much more at ease because I have so much valuable content that I can never get back if something were to happen to my external drive. But, if something were to happen, I know that I can quickly recover my files and be back up and running in no time. If you guys are interested in checking this out, head to dropbox.com/ijustine to choose your backup solution and start backing up your life today. A huge thank you, again, to Dropbox for sponsoring a portion of this video. Now, my friends, let's get into unboxing all of these cases. Ugh. It's amazing. Some of them, I actually thought they looked kind of nice online. And then when I got them... This is so flimsy. Like, what is this? A carrot, a banana, what is even in here? I don't know, but we're about to find out. Not even sure where to start or how to even kind of go about this. So maybe I will just push these all to the side. Some of these also were supposed to be for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, and they definitely did not ship for iPhone 13. Look, what is this packaging? I mean, this looks like something that I pick up my dog's turds with when we go for a walk. That's your packaging. First things first, let's see what we have in here. Oh! This is very shiny, very shimmery, not so splendid. Okay. Hmm. Well, this is nice. It actually came with a glass screen protector as well. What a freaking treat. \"Do not use if seal is broken.\" Well, seal has been broken. It seems as though somebody has already got their little mitts on this already. So, do not use if seal's broken. What am I supposed to do? It was broken. This even came with some little gem replacements because pretty sure those rhinestones are not gonna last. Okay, let's put it on the phone and see what it looks like. I'm wondering how many of these cases am I gonna get stuck on my phone. This stuff barely fits. Oh, my God. Geez. So this is all kind of like a very nice look. This is plasticy. Oh, that's a sexy right there. Huh. I mean, from far away, it looks cute, right? Okay. Well, I think we've seen enough. We have a lot more to go. So, one down. I have no idea how many are here, but there's a lot. Okay, let's get this out of here. You don't wanna be here, do you? Look at this little number. This is like a shiny portfolio case. Okay, this just opens up. It's magnetic, very fashionable. Very... Oh, look at this. Even goes a little string here. Oh, I can even put credit cards in here? Wow! There it is. Looks great. Well, I think we've seen enough of that. Oh, no. I've ripped. (Justine gasps) I already broke it. I tried to get it out and the whole case just ripped off of here. Wow, we wonder what the return policy is on some of this garbage 'cause that's... that's something. This one, just a nice little mirrored rhinestone beauty. The quality could not be better. I'm basically twisting and turning this thing. Oh, that's not even gonna fit on here. So this is definitely an iPhone 13. These literally all said Pro Max, so I don't know where the disconnect is. It's hard to say. These are such a terrible fit. This doesn't even fit in there. Can we just maybe stop for a minute and just think about the mistakes that you've made in life? This isn't even for the iPhone 13! Look at that. Mistakes we're made! Look, no offense if this is your case company, but do better. You don't list it as an iPhone 13 Pro Max, and then it doesn't even fit on the iPhone 13 Pro? I don't think so. All right. So this one probably won't protect you from any drops. It kind of looks cool, you know? Like a little something like that. Yeah, this is not too... I mean, it is what it is. Okay, this is actually kind of cute, like the little bears, little chocolate chip cookie. This has... (plastic packaging rustling) This one, it's actually not that bad. It has a cute little lanyard and a little cute little cookie key chain, like, get out of here! And this is like a soft little fabric. Some of these are terrible, but this one is freaking cute. So come at me. Okay, it's hard to push the buttons, but that is to be expected, I suppose. Doesn't really fit very well. I don't think that I would trust this to hold my phone up, but this does have a really cute little cookie key chain. So that's something. This is very, very cute. I actually love this a lot. Quality? Not the best. But, the cute factor? Super cute. Interesting, I don't know if this is a character that I'm supposed to know. Is this like an NFT? Is this, what is this? Day by day, too lost to be found. Hello, world. Let me out. Okay, I don't think this is probably NASA-approved, but could be. Is that NASA's character? I don't know. I mean, it's in there, but it's not. So it's barely in there. This looks like it's kind of covering up the camera lenses. Okay, all of the lenses. No, see, look. You can see there's like a ring around the wide angle, so that's not ideal. You know, if you actually wanna take pictures with a wide angle lens, you're gonna have like this ring around it from the iPhone case. This is terrible. This is just a disgrace. Clearly not tested properly. Oh, look at this little number. \"Thank you for choosing our products.\" Like, the reason that I don't even have merch is because some of the merch companies that make things are so trashy that I could not even physically bring myself to sell them to you because they're garbage quality. Is this even for iPhone 13? No. You're not gonna fit in there. Oh, goodness. Oh, this is actually... Okay, so I kind of made fun of this one a little bit. This one's not so bad. That actually feels like a decent quality. Like, this is substantial. Like, if I dropped it, it feels as though it might be able to sustain. Camera bumps are all exposed. We have to worry about any lens issues, and I actually like this little ring right here that pops up, so you can use that. It's like a pop socket, but like a knot socket. It's like a piece of jewelry. So far, this one is pretty cool. I like it. I don't know where I'm supposed to stick this. Oh, right, here on the side. That's nice. Oh, whoa! This is another cool one. This is a CamShield Armor Case. This, actually, looks pretty cool. You've got a full-on armored protection, which doesn't really feel... Oh, my God, what is this? It even has like a little camera lens protector. Quality doesn't feel so good. So this has this little ring here and this little slidey to hide our lenses. That's actually kind of a good idea 'cause I feel like having them protected. It's not a bad thought. I think you guys got something here. I mean, the overall quality, it's fine. It's definitely not the best, but of all of the ones that I've seen so far, I do feel like this is gonna protect your phone and your lenses the best. Not too bad. Okay, iPhone 13 Pro. So I have a feeling. This is not gonna be another one that's gonna fit on the Max. Oh, this is... Look at that, \"Have a good day.\" This is so... I mean, what is this? Is this like a little holographic? Do I put this on? Do I keep that in there? I think I keep that in there. Oh, my God. This is absolutely just, just garbage. Oh, there's a screen protector? Oh, my God. This came with a screen protector. This, I don't even know if that's gonna do anything. Okay. All right. Look at that. \"Good day!\" Look, I'm making fun of it because, yeah, this is absolutely disgusting and hideous, but, this is functional. Interesting. I'm making fun of it, but yet I like this idea, like I could just be like... I could pick up my drink, drink. This is not a beer. This is water, just non-sparkling, basic water. I can drink my beer-looking water with this iPhone case. So that's definitely something. But, God, this is the worst quality I've ever seen in my life of something. Okay, interesting packaging choice. Uh-huh. Some hearts, some gold. That's nice. Quality? Pretty flimsy. I like that they've added some little extra decorations here on the side. That's nice, really a beautiful added touch. Now, let's see what it looks like with the gold phone in there. Definitely fits. I actually kind of like it. I don't hate it. I mean, I don't know if I love it, but I don't hate it. This is a nice little raised accent, I guess. That's what we're gonna call it. Oh, my God, we have so many more to go. If you thought we were almost done, we're absolutely not done. This is a beautiful crystal number! Look at this! I mean, if you can just see, just... what I see. I don't know. See how it looks on the phone. Maybe it'll have a better look. It's heavy. This made my phone like a freaking brick. I can't even believe it. It's also really sharp, like if you hit somebody with this, that's going to probably puncture their skin with these little plastic fake diamonds. Quality-wise? I don't know how long before one of these falls off, I feel like one drop of this, it's probably gonna shatter, but here it is. Oh, look at this! I got this one for Easter even though Easter's over. I thought it would be like a real festive, little bunny, little case. I don't know how I feel about it. It's very unique. I like that it has this added little charm. I like that it completely changes the shape of your phone into a weird carrot. I like that it says iP13 Pro Max. So, you know. If you know, you know. Let's hope this actually fits in here 'cause I think this might be my new iPhone case for the rest of the term. Can you just, like... Can you take me seriously doing a business call trying to close a Series A round? Hi, yeah, sure, we would love to accept your funding. I would love that. I love that for us and our company. Oh, my God, I love it. It's so stupid. It's so stupid, but it might be the most perfect thing I've ever seen. Oh, so freaking good. Check this out! It's like a little camera. A little camera strap? Oh, this is cool. Obviously, quality is not super high. You know, kind of looking at it from afar, you can't tell it's gonna probably pop right off just like that. You can't tell that, can you? Well, maybe you can. I like this, it has like a fake little mount here. I mean, you might be able to actually mount something there, which would be kind of cool. These buttons don't really work. This could potentially... Could be like a good weapon, though, 'cause that's pretty, pretty substantial. So you might wanna think about that. Guess these just hook here in this corner, little areas. Interesting. Uh-huh. (Justine mimics camera shutters) Do I look like a tourist? I feel like a tourist. So I like how this looks, though, because this actually does look really, really nice. But, again, the actual build quality? Pretty subpar. I'm struggling to get my phone out of a lot of these cases, and it's not nice. It definitely cracked my front screen. It is what it is. Guess that's the price of doing business. God, these are so... Oh, my God, we have so many. Okay, this next one, I'm very excited about. My favorite fruit is bananas. So when I saw that there was a banana iPhone case, you better believe I freaking had to have it! Oh, my God, this is... God, it smells so bad. This is the most repulsive thing that I've ever seen. Absolutely, this is repulsive. I am disgusted by the look of this. I'm disgusted by the feel. I'm trying not to throw up. Oh, my God, the feeling is so disgusting. I can't stand it. I don't think I've ever hated something so much. Oh, my God. The smell, the texture of it, ugh. (Justine laughs) Like... What? Somebody came up with this idea. There was more than one person that agreed that this would be a good idea of something to make. This was a concept, and then it came to fruition, and here we are. This does look like a real banana, though, I will say that. Oh, my God, I hate it. I have to go wash my hands. I'm so disgusted. I can't, I can't, I can't. I have to wash my hands. (water splashing) My hands are washed, and now I have to take my phone out of this case. I hate everything about it. I got to get my phone out of here. I'm so disgusted. I washed my hands, and now I touched it again, and I can't even... I have to just... (Justine retching) Who okayed that? You're fired. Look at this, this is the most garbage presentation of packaging that I've ever seen. Now, I'm getting mad because I actually spent real money on this stuff. Everything about this, you should be ashamed of yourself. What in the world is this? What is the service of this purpose? What is the purpose of this service? \"Designed for you.\" No. Slide bumper? Do I put a credit card in there? That means nothing to me. I don't understand what that means. And clearly, I wouldn't know because there's no directions or anything that came with this. So I don't know anything about it. What is your purpose, my friend? I don't even know if I care what your purpose is at this point because you're not cool. Does this come off? Okay, well, what does that mean? What does that mean? I don't get it. Oh! Look at this one! Game phone case. Okay. Now, we are talking my language. This is very cute. \"This sticker helps to remove the mask for the screen guard.\" Look at that, that's so cute. It actually looks like it might do something. Oh, my God. I think it actually does. Oh, no way! Wait, I can charge this? Okay. Well, something happens here. So, this is special. We are in freaking business now. Oh, my God, okay. It's charging. It's charging! Oh, my God! There's freaking games on here? Get out of here! Oh, my God, there's freaking Tetris. What the heck? I'm literally freaking playing Tetris. Okay, I did a bad job. And there's freaking sound. What a freaking deal. I mean, I thought that I was getting an iPhone case, but little did we know, we were getting whole console. I can still smell the banana phone case and it's making me wanna throw up. Can you believe this iPhone case? But also a freaking tiny little mini console. I can play Nintendo games on here. What is happening? How are you real? Oh, this is the coolest thing ever. I'm gonna charge this case up and I'm gonna use it. I'm gonna impress all of my friends. Oh, look at this little number. Wow, looks like a little purse. Wallet, combo, beauty, fashion. Love to see it! It's got a nice little wallet here. Oh, boy. Love the quality. This is probably on par with the other one that I tried out in the beginning that kind of fell apart. It could be possibly like the same exact thing. These are so poorly made. Don't even know how to feel about it. Granted, these are very inexpensive, so if you are just looking for, I don't know, a very inexpensive case, these are gonna do the trick. Here's the thing. If you are... Okay, this actually would protect it, I feel like. This doesn't look that bad at all. Like, when you're looking at it like this, it kind of looks cute. I'm hating on these, but some of them, I think, you can get by. Functional, utility, you're literally paying for what you're getting, which is not a high-quality product, but, hey, it's getting the job done. (plastic packaging rustling) This is interesting, kind of like the holographic little look to it. Okay, they're protecting you from scratching your phone right there with these very hard metal little pieces. I don't even know what to say about it, really. Is this a character that I don't know about? Is this from something? It looks like this has some little puffy paint glitter that somebody just kind of outlined this with. I love the iridescence. It looks like this also kind of comes off, slides up so you can put your hand in it. So that's kind of nice. I'm trying to be positive. I feel as though I've been very negative, but it's really... It's very easy to be. I do like that this seamlessly covers the iPhone lenses, like it still keeps them exposed, so this is actually a pretty good fit. So all things considered, yeah. Quality? Pretty low. All this text is absolutely hideous. As far as the actual fit of being on this thing, they did a pretty good job. I also kind of like this little hand holding case, very cheaply made. They definitely got all the dimensions correct. You, guys, we still have a lot more to go. What in the world is this? I have no idea. (plastic packaging rustling) Why is this so long? Okay. So, looks like somebody has found their forever iPhone case. This is absolutely the most incredible thing that I've ever seen in my whole life. Looks like somebody has already touched it and slimed it up with their little fingers. You can see that? That's definitely been handled. Yeah, there's fingerprints on that, that's disgusting. Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so disgusted. Okay, we're just gonna go like that. Yeah, that's slimy. Oh, God. I feel like I need to scrub my whole body now. Why is everything so gross? Oh, man! I don't think it's gonna fit in here. Just when I thought. Oh, no, it's fitting. I'm making it. We're making it. Okay, it fit. Who thought this was a good idea to put this tassel on here? Why would you do that? Oh, my God. I can't wait to show this to my sister. I'm just gonna go up to her and be like, \"Hey, can I take a picture of you?\" This is so stupid. Chop, chop. This is an iPhone case and it's a knife. It's like a hatchet. I have tears in my eyes. I'm laughing so hard. Oh, my God. It's incredible. This even fit in the vertical frame that I've been doing. This is the world that we live in. Okay, what's this? This looks like a knockoff Disney Mickey ears. Colorful iPhone 13. Oh, whoa. What is that? A weird little thing. So these are like those kids' little fidget popper things like my little niece has. She's been playing with since she was one. I like that it gives you that added little bonus of this little key chain. Very nice. So, the problem is they don't pop down when you have the case on it. That's sad if you planned on popping this and having a little fidget popper. Does not pop. I mean, I guess from far away, it kind of looks cool. I kind of like this one. I mean, it definitely doesn't serve the purpose of being able to kind of fidget pop, but I like the color scheme. Well, this is super basic. I don't think you could get any more basic. Oh, it smells so rancid. Oh, my God. So here it is, we've got a nice little heart plastic thing here. I mean, this kind of looks like something I would eat. A lavender candy bar, maybe? But, no, it is an iPhone case. Let's see how the camera looks. So if you do use the wide angle, there is a little gradient around the corners. So definitely not functional if you're gonna be taking photos with it, but there it is, everybody. So this one actually looks kind of nice. This is one of my favorite colors other than pink. Look at this, it's got some little stickers with us, too! \"For covering your private shipping information on the package, tear off and paste.\" Huh? I feel like this might be the most, I guess, normal one of the bunch. So I can't even say that I hate this because this is one of my favorite colors. It actually seems to fit pretty well. I can push the buttons, there's no branding, and it's just overall the most decent, simple case that I feel like anybody could ever ask for. I mean, if you like the color, this is gonna be a great case. So far, so good, but is it MagSafe-compatible? Hmm, it is not. We have a few more! What is this beautiful baby pink? \"Ken: You up?\" Oh, boy. Wow! Is this supposed to be like a Barbie kind of inspired phone, but not Barbie, I guess, branded? 'Cause it's clearly from some sort of knockoff company. \"Ken: You up?\" Barbie's not gonna say that. I mean, maybe she might, but no. Hey, Ken, you up? If I roll my eyes any harder, they're gonna fall out of my head. Oh, look at this little, little bear. Mm, beautiful. The Bear Pro Max also has a baby bear. Oh, that's so cute. So some of these are not that terrible. I think we saw a few wins today. Like, come on, now. Baby bear, big bear? This has overall increased the size of my iPhone by at least 1 1/2 so it's basically doubled it, like this is absolutely just massive. Look at this bear. It is very, very cute, though. I will say that. All right, we've got two more that look very similar. (plastic packaging rustling) Yeah, these both look very much alike. I don't know if these are going to fit on here. This might be an iPhone 13. Yes, it is. That just seems the way that it has worked out. I kind of actually like this, it made it like super square and boxy, which is kind of neat. And this one has a magnetic bracket. Oh, you can make it into a little kickstand. Look at that. Interesting. Let's first take a look at this one. I like that the little heart is right there in the center where the Apple logo would be. I love the gold around the edges. It does look like this could have some sort of little string so you could have a little attachment. I really like around the corners is they're kind of like this jagged little edge. That looks cool, it made it kind of like a real pointy little feature, very boxy. Quality? Obviously not that great. Kind of looks pretty cool. Then, this one looks very similar, but it does have the rounded edges, and this has a little kickstand. Check this out. That's cool. Look at this. I mean, quality? Again, not that great, but I can still use my phone like this. I don't even have to touch it. I mean, it's not really that sturdy, so if I do push it a little too much, it's gonna fall over. But, I do like that this has a little added kickstand to it. I also really like the white and the gold combination. It's very pretty. Well, friends. This is all of the cases that we opened up today, and there was a lot of them. This banana one still is so rancid, like the smell of it is making me absolutely physically nauseous. I feel physically ill. I don't like it. I saw a lot of things today. I don't know how I feel. I don't know how you feel, but I now have a bunch of cases that I don't know what to do with. Yeah. This is so... Oh, God, such a smelly banana. I'll see you guys in the next video. I got to go, I got to wash my hands, I need to go shower. I feel... so gross. So, okay. I'm done, we're done here. I got to go. I got to go. (quirky music)",

    "transcript": "What's up guys? Lew here back with another video. But before... We jump into it... I want to mention a project that I worked on, an unboxing video, which is the biggest unboxing I've ever done. It took place, on another channel, so click the link in the description and go check that out. Kind of mysterious, very exciting. After you're done watching this video, go watch that one. This is a cool contraption, called 'Ampware'. What it does, is it gives you emergency, back-up power. But the twist, here... Is it's not in the way you would expect it. This case... Instead of just being rechargeable, like any other battery case, has a crank in it, a hand crank. Look at that! Look at that! Human power! Human-generated power! Two minutes of cranking, will allow for an emergency call, from a dead battery, according to them. And ten minutes of cranking, up to two hours of regular use? I wonder why the cable's removable? Oh, it's probably interchangeable You could--you could proabably do... a micro-USB Or... a lightning connector, depending on your device Anyway, what was I saying? I was saying, uh... One thing that you can be fairly certain, you're always going to have access to, is your body! And your movement The apocalypse could happen, zombies everywhere! Jack could turn into some kind of savage. You've always got power, as long as you got your little crank and your arm. That's cool! There is the chance that cell towers could go down as well in this event But you're just trying to have as many options as possible So hopefully they stay up On-board generator 1,000 milliamp output crank arm Which doubles as a kickstand That's cool alright, how does that work? Oh, right, of course I have an iphone 6s here with you guessed it a dead battery Slide this guy in Pull this out let's get going ooohh, there's something kind of satisfying about that ooohh! Okay, that's 2 minutes Maybe you gotta be real speedy, like this It's like charging A little bit Triggering the like boot sequence And then, once it's plugged in it tries to boot But then it's not getting consistent power because I'm... So This is a predicament right now oh! look! there's a green light, yes! Do you see that?! If you're spinning fast enough, I think that green light eluminates See it? It's a bit of a workout here *Laughing* ah, It's so funny! It's like the least high-tech thing, interacting with the most high... High-tech thing oh, I'm getting messages now I think I got it 5 percent gotta keep it going This should be powered off Because the screen is gonna be, keep flipping on, and using juice as you're spinning I gotta just like bear down And spin this god-damn thing for 10 minutes We're still at 5 percent It tries to boot up right away cause it thinks it's connected to the wall Holy hand cramping! I think I'm getting a bit of a rhythm Oh man! My hands are sore! Holy 4 percent up to 5 again 4 to 5 5 *Laughing* *Yelling laughter* why is 5 the peak? like it goes straight to 5 and then nothing else it's not like a frequent rate of improvement If you're in prison, you you know these guys who escaped from Alcatraz? they had, they were just for months curving away at the wall with a spoon! Now I'm down to 4 percent I gotta just get into like some kind of zen mode 4 3 percent OOOOOOOOOOHHHHH! YEAAAAHHHHH! 3 percent *phone drop* Listen, as a last-second backup to get from nothing to something to make a phone call A single phone call okay, fine But like as a way to get your phone up and running or getting it to 100 percent? *drops phone* you can get out of my face with that idea please not you Jack woah it's not even fair!",

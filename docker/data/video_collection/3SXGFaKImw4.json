    "transcript": "well guys it's just been a few days since we posted our first second generation threadripper 2 video and I've been busy with a little bit of an upgrade project that I wanted to share with you guys and if you missed out on our threadripper 2 explain video you can actually check it out right over here but in a nutshell the potential with these new processors are just remarkable and for someone like me who likes to explore and create an optimized editing workstation PC this is a great platform to look into in fact I can't wait to do multiple rendering tests between you know X399 skylake X Ryzen coffeelake to see which one's actually going to be the best editing experience and most importantly rendering performances well you can actually tell about right now that I'm super excited with what threadripper 2 is bringing to the table so I decided to put together a build or my first build featuring this new CPU in fact it's not like a new build it's more of an update to my existing Threadripper 2 PC that I've been thinking about upgrading for quite some time so this just happens to be the perfect time because AMD centers the new sample and it's just a drop-in upgrade because doesn't require a huge platform shift so that's pretty awesome so let's talk about the components right after a message from our sponsor so you're looking for something with class good value comfortably populate an ATX motherboard are you it's all about the user experience and great airflow who knew your temperatures would drop that low route the cables behind the cover illuminate your hardware with built-in LEDs the age 500 I is for you to discover this one's in real life not in your dreams say hello to the link below the age 400 series from NZXT is a go alright guys so you may remember that one of the first things that I ended up doing after getting my original 1950 X was building the ultimate productivity PC well that performance monster was working away until quite recently when it went into semi-retirement after I needed to clear out in space in my office and two relatively large pcs just didn't fit my intent was to minimize the system's footprint and bring it back to life and for those of you wondering all the components in this video are linked in the description down below all in all my experience with therapure was amazing I even did bit of an upgrading by installing two samsung 960 pro SSDs in raid and the results were absolutely insane I mean how could I keep something like that tucked away just because space didn't permit the Challenger was I needed a bit more compact case that also supported my existing asus rog x3 99 zenith extreme motherboard which happens to be almost to 80 millimeters wide that's where the first new component steps into the frame say hello to the fractal design to find our six with tempered glass which is relatively a compact case that happens to support motherboards that are up to 285 millimeters wide it comes in this muted black color which is what I wanted since the Corsair air 540 looked awesome but I prefer these stealthy black approach with this case but the real start of the show is of course the new threadripper 2950X which is actually a drop-in upgrade as I said before for the zenith extreme I provided you're running the correct BIOS all I did was download the latest version of 1303 before switching out the cpus and it worked perfectly well now about the 2950X just like the 1950X it has 16 cores and 32 threads but what's important to me is its base clock and boost clocks are hundred megahertz and 400 megahertz respectively higher than the chip it will be replacing that should help overall with performance in every application even more importantly it consumes about 180 watts at load so I'm getting higher speeds without I hope boosting power needs but what about cooling this beast of a CPU well that's interesting part guys because I ditched water cooling for this build and decided to go air cooling all the way and I picked this the cooler master right through / it's an awesome looking cooler first and foremost it is ginormous I mean this thing is a monster of a cooler and it's I love the stealth design approach with this cooler in the first place and overall it should complement the build really well and yeah hopefully get those really cool temperatures as well now you may remember this cooler from a little while ago because it was actually used to cool down the threat upper - system aimed he presented at this year's of Computex we ended up getting some hands-on time with this cooler and you can find that video over here since then coolermaster have made a few minor upgrades so it can now handle an overclocked 2950X and it overall fits at the black and wild theme of this build really well I can't discuss cooling temperatures or overclocking yet but let me tell you this I think you'll be pretty happy with the results one of the main issues with first-generation threadripper and Ryzen parts was they're somewhat limited memory compatibility basically if you wanted to use higher capacity modules speed had to be sacrificed but that's been changed a bit with the simplest architecture on second-generation parts so i'm saying goodbye to my trusty 64 gigabyte g.skill kit and moving towards this the Corsair Vengeance white RGB 128 gigabyte ddr4 modules this should give me more than enough space for productivity and setting aside some space for AMD's new sense and my technology that allows for memory and physical storage drives to be combined resulting in ultra fast access to data even though the dual samsung 960 pro passes decent grade for my original build are still crazy fast they now been split apart to create a secondary storage drive for game files and scratches for adobe premiere basically I saw no reason to replace them since they're that good I mean while I've added this Samsung 970 Evo as my primary boot drive not only is it fast but also quite durable so it should serve perfectly now this setup actually highlights one of the advantages of AMD's X 399 platform there is no problem using all these nvme drives with top crippling my graphics cards or other attached storage devices and all of these have it direct link to the CPU Intel's X $2.99 motherboards can't accomplish the same thing without additional third party controllers moving on to a bit more of a simple upgrade I ended up ditching his single gtx 980ti and when with two founders edition cards I know that moving away from the custom Asus GTX 10 atti could mean higher GP temperatures but I like the fact that these cars exhaust hot air outside the case now one thing that I should mention is I'm not running these cards in SLI because I decided to use two GPUs for two separate tasks so while I'm rendering a video and gaming I'll have each GPU sort of do those tasks separately while using both of them at the same time because if you recall when explored the options for core affinity I noticed that running these cards in SLI and doing multiple tasks could actually affect performance and the results really did speak for themselves so I'll actually live leave or link that video right over here so you can check it out pretty cool interesting results so yeah that's what I'm going for this build just disabling hassle I'm and going with just straight to separate ten ATT is asked for the other components I've stuck with the same be quiet dark power 1000 watt power supply and these amazing looking cable non-whites Lieb cables which it again really go well with our stop built so with that out of the way let's put together this beast of the PC and another build done guys and I have to say I actually like the looks more than my original threat River build but what do you guys think is the black and white bill the bed better than the predominantly white look from the old one let us know in the comments down below I also didn't go to fancy with RGB lighting in fact there are no RGB fans or even RGB graphics cards I basically permanently disable that except for the RAM modules and the motherboard lining which I've set to white to complement the black color scheme in fact the lighting from the RAM modules actually separates the cooler with the motherboard and gives you a cool depth effect and overall it just looks pretty awesome and I can't wait to do some tests on this new PC now I do want to mention this cooling kit that asu's offers for their ex we 9 + motherboards and it's designed to optimize the VR and cooling performance if people want to overclock the WX series processor it can also be used in cases of high level overclocking on a regular threadripper CPU as well similar kits will be offered for their other boards too but it won't be included by default in the box and you need to ask Asus for one directly if you already have an X - 9 + motherboard or buy from a retailer basically for the zenith board this cooling kit includes a small bracket and a small fan that would be mounted to the top mount v arm heatsink there's also a secondary heat sink for the SOC and that will need to be installed I also want to mention that this kit isn't necessary for compatibility with the 2990 WX only 2970 WX but it's certainly recommended if you intend to overclock those power-hungry 250 watt processors another thing that I want to mention is some information we didn't have a for the initial explained video I want included here so basically these are the biases needed to ensure you're a smart boy is compatible with the second generation 34 CPUs the x2 minions tricks and the prime x3 99 will require the 803 or newer versions while the zenith will need the 1303 version or newer which is what I'm using so what's next well it's actually pretty simple because I still can't reveal any of the results or benchmarks for this new processor because you'll have to be a little patient just wait until next week until the embargo lives and we'll have those results for you guys I'll definitely make sure to compare the 19th DX to the Skydeck specie that's simply behind me and of course to these new 2950X PC so definitely stay tuned for those comparisons let's just hope that AMD doesn't send one of those awesome 2990 WX CPUs but other than that our second generation third upper content will continue next week with some official benchmarks and let me tell you this these new CPUs from AMD are definitely going to make Intel worried so that pretty much wraps up this video guys I hope you enjoyed the second generation thread up or to build video but most specifically I want to pass on a question to you guys do you still consider or would you consider buying threadripper 2 knowing for the fact that it would not give you a significant benefit or boost performance when it comes to gaming compared to Ryzen 2 or Coffeelake or do you see yourself taking advantage of this in your particular workflow for example taking advantage of all these course and do you see value in that I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments stay subscribe to our channel for even more threadripper 2 coverage and of course you can check out our new boot sequence channel for the latest tech news and rumors I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

    "description": "The RTX 2080 Asus ROG Mothership is the most powerful gaming laptop design I've seen. It redefines the whole concept of portable gaming hardware. Mothership -  Zephyrus -   The GZ700 and GX701 are two of the best gaming laptops from Asus this year. With RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Max-Q laptop GPUs, these devices are crazy powerful and push out very impressive benchmarks.

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here so Asus just announced a whole bunch of new gaming hardware They have a whole bunch of laptops, but the two laptops of interest to me are these right here? This is the rog mothership. And this is the ROG Zephyrus. So the mothership is the completely Brand new design brand new just concept for what portable computing portable gaming can be this is a device That is I just you know, what words don't describe this thing properly You just have to see how this thing works instead of a traditional Clamshell, right, so that's how normal laptops work. You open up at the front. It's got a screen keyboard That's like your regular stuff. This opens in a completely bonkers way. It's almost like an all-in-one you lift it up you put it forward and a kickstand appears and then the keyboard Detaches now this keyboard can be used wirelessly or wired if it's wireless, it uses 2.4 gigahertz radio frequency if it's wired It's a regular USB-C connection. So the keystroke has a lot of travels two point four millimeters It doesn't feel like a regular mechanical keyboard or anything like that It's still distinctly a laptop type keyboard But it's a very tactile keyboard and it also has the trackpad on the right which we've seen on Zephyrus devices I don't love the position of track pads on the right, but the way they've designed this thing is that it kind of required it. Now the purpose of this the purpose of separating the keyboard in this kind of bizarre all-in-one style look to this portable device is for thermals So this thing has the motherboard the CPU the GPU and all the components on the back of the screen and by positioning it there they're able to vent out the heat Directly at the top and the sides of the device and they're drawing and cool air from behind the screen So you get this very impressive thermal solution So this thing was running a GTX 2080 and that's like the full fat like not max-q version It's the most powerful GPU that have seen from Nvidia this year and it's running on a 17-inch 144 Hertz screen that's g-sync enabled. Now a product like the rog mothership is obviously not for everyone right not even most gamers are gonna want something like this. It's gonna be super expensive I don't know exact pricing at this point in time, but looking at this engineering sample. It looks really well built. Now I can't run benchmarks on either of these units Nvidia won't let me at the time of filming But the mothership is supposed to rival the performance of most gaming desktop out there. It's not super portable. It's roughly ten pounds it's definitely heavier than most gaming laptops out there, but it's incredibly powerful and It's portable like it's like you can obviously carry this thing around if you want to it's well-built looks good And that's the ROG Mothership. The other device here. The Zephyrus S is the GX701 So we've seen a bunch of these devices on my channel. It's like the super thin It's actually the thinnest gaming laptop on the market But they've been able to stick a 17 inch screen on to the 15 inch chassis and the way they did this was By having super thin bezels, but in addition to having super thin bezels It also does not have a webcam And I think this is something that I don't know if every gaming company should do this, but because this is a device That's clearly geared for gaming. I'm cool with it not having a webcam now, they include a webcam It's an external one You can mount it on the screen or put it beside you But the fact that it doesn't have a webcam gives it this really clean Ultra thin bezel and I think this is a really nice looking laptop to have a 17 inch screen on a 15 inch footprint Like it just makes sense they've also added a volume rocker this year just above the WASD keys and it's something that not a lot of gaming laptops have but every time I've seen them I've enjoyed using them basically If you've ever played a game and you just want to like hear something a little bit more clearly like if you know something's coming Or you want to like crank up chat or something just on-the-fly volume control without interfering with your gaming experience The rest of the device hasn't really changed though. I've always enjoyed the shape of this thing I've always enjoyed the aesthetics of it still has that lift mechanism to increase air flow for the internals But that's basically it mothership and Zephyrus S This thing's a beast man. I feel like this is like I don't know if this is gonna develop into like other Laptop designs and other kind of product categories, but this is really cool. The amount of power that you can have in something That's this portable is impressive. Also didn't mention earlier the speakers up front They sound awesome. They're four huge speakers right up the front blasting right to the user It's a pretty cool design Okay, that wraps it up. Hope you guys enjoy this video thumbs if you liked it, subs - see you guys next time",

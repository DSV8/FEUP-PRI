    "transcript": "Now this may look like a standard USB adapter but it has super powers this is an O.MG adapter it has a built-in keylogger it has a built-in access point it has the ability to send high speed commands to a laptop or phone. In this example however I'll connect it to this MacBook and then what I'll do is connect an external keyboard to the O.MG adapter. What I'll do now is connect to the Wi-Fi access point running within the O.MG adapter and open up a web browser to the adapter and then go to keylog show all this shows me all the keystrokes that have been captured but what we'll do now is type in the password to log into the laptop. So I'll type my password and then I'll press enter so I've been able to log into the laptop. On the O.MG adapter I'll refresh the page and right at the end there you can see I pressed enter and then password1 enter. So the password is password1 be careful accepting adapters and USB cables from strangers.",

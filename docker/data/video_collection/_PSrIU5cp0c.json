    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is. Today we're gonna talk about all the things we've talked about already with the Xbox, except in a little bit more detail. - Thank you for subscribing to This Is, by the way. So this is the official lift of the preview embargo of the Series X. So previously up until this point there was a lot of stuff that we couldn't talk about that was still being tested. And to be fair, this is still prototype hardware. This is not the final retail Series X, although I will say it is very close. But little bugs, little minor things are still around. - We got an early, this is 99.9% what you're gonna get in a retail package. So it's not like there's gonna be night and day difference. The first thing we can unveil is the UI, which I'm disappointed by. I have never liked Xbox's UI. I think it's just so cluttered for no reason whatsoever. The games and apps page is what I think should be the default homepage and I was really hoping that they cleaned it up. It is somehow worse this generation. So that's my big ding on the Series X. - I will say the Xbox Series X from a software perspective is very much an evolution of the Xbox One in a lot of ways. Part of that is because obviously you have like that backwards compatibility, a lot of that stuff, I want to say it's built in 'cause obviously I know that compatibility team, they've put a lot of work into it, but lot of that is very similar. I'm not massively surprised that the interface of the Series X is very, very similar to the Xbox One. There are improvements, it does run at 120 fps. - I'm not someone who usually cares about like anything past 60, you know, like if you hit 60 for me, I'm pretty happy. It is nice to seeing the snappiness of the 120. It's 120 Hertz of going through unnecessary pages on the UI. - Yeah, and also the thing is the way that the Xbox UI is designed, it's not full of very fluid animation, it's like, boom, boom, boom. So you can technically see, or supposedly it's running at 120 fps, to be fair, I actually haven't run it through a high speed camera to ensure that because it's very difficult for us right now to record anything at 120 FPS. - Yeah, we gotta call Gavin for that. - I will say if you're expecting a major upgrade on the UI it is very similar to what you get on the Xbox One. In fact, I think a lot of what's on the Series X is already on the Insider of ring of the Xbox One? - Yeah, this really, I mean, yeah. - It's similar. - It's very similar. It looks like a slightly darker theme than what you're currently used to. - [Austin] I changed the theme. - Well okay, he changed the theme. I didn't see that, I thought that was the default. - One of the other things though that after spending some real time with this is becoming more and more apparent is that high frame rate's not just a fluke. So we have access to a few games. So essentially as developers are getting their games ready we're able to get like kinda early preview codes. Again, big grain of salt, all of these things are still in progress, they're not done, We've run into bugs and stuff. That's totally normal for a game that's not finished. So a couple of the games that I have been playing, Gears 5. So this is something that we got to take a look at back in March, it runs, just a quick recap, it runs it 4k 60 FPS, above PC ultra spec. So looks great in the campaign. - [Matt] It looks amazing. - Very, very nice, I mean, there's a certain, there's like a few places where you can see like low res textures that kind of make it seem a little old. But the graphics, frame rate, everything looks good, right? Now, when you get into multiplayer you actually get a 120 FPS option option. Very cool. - We didn't play because there's, well, no one else playing multiplayer. - We're so lonely. - Yeah, that's just part of the problem of having early hardware, but I'm assuming that's locked at 1080. - I don't believe it's the full 4K ultra spec. I think that you're sacrificing somewhat. It may be dynamic, but I do think it's closer to 4k than it is like something like 1080. I do know that the Xbox Series S runs at 1080p 120 FPS in multiplayer. But I think the Series X is somewhere north of that. - I would be surprised, maybe like 1440, but I would be surprised if it's doing full 4k 120 on multiplayer. - You say that, I think that there's still headroom in this. They threw all of the ultra spec at it, right. So compared to the PC, they threw all the ultra spec, they threw some extra stuff on top and it runs at a pretty stable 4k 60. So I wouldn't be surprised if there actually is some headroom so when you throw it at 120 fps it's not crazy difficult to run. Now, beyond that, we've also been playing some Dirt 5, which, side note, just a really fun game. But with Dirt 5 you have a few options as well. So you have the better quality mode, I think they actually call it something else, but essentially there's quality, there's performance mode. Quality seems to be pretty much locked at 4k. You get like improved texture filtering, some other stuff like that. As you go down to the frame rate optimized mode, I couldn't tell a huge difference between the two as far as performance goes. - [Matt] So performance, I didn't notice a huge difference but you did see, I mean, I'm really bad at that game. And so I went, even though it's an off-road game, if you went too far off road, so I think I hit like a corn field. - Oh, it resets you, yeah. - Well, like as soon as you strayed a little bit, that's when you really saw the textures kind of really fall apart in the performance mode. - [Austin] There's actually a third mode, so you were playing on the 120p mode. So the way that it works is that inside the Xbox UI, you can switch the frame right now. So you see 60 and 120, as well as the resolution. So fun little fact if you're playing on an HDMI 2.1 capable TV, and we're going to definitely do a video on this probably on the main channel soon as far as the best TVs and displays to get. But if you're playing on a display that can handle 4k 120, you flip to 120, it's fine. However, I was playing at home on my slightly older LG OLED and when I switched to 120 it automatically dropped the resolution to 1080p. - Which I think is a really nice feature for those who, it's confusing to figure out what has HDMI 2.1, what has 4k 120. I was looking on Best Buy the other day, literally none of the TV's actually list their HTMI ports are in the specs. And that's something that Best Buy is gonna 100% have to just revamp their entire site to, that's a huge spec to have this console generation. - But it's nice that you don't have to necessarily have a crazy expensive TV to get 120 fps because a lot of TVs will run at 1080p 120, which might not be ideal, but you'll, I mean, if it's me, I'm taking the higher frame rate over the slightly more detailed. - And that's one of the things we talked about when we were first looking at this is, you know, is anyone actually going to benefit from this right out of the box? - [Austin] So far! - [Matt] And so it shows that, yeah, even if you don't have a great TV, you are gonna benefit from this day one with the optimized game. - Yes, but I think beyond just the pure frame rate, I think that actually tells a bigger story for what we have right now. What we don't have is a Halo: Infinite or a true dedicated next gen title for the Series X. - To be fair, neither does PlayStation, but. - [Austin] Well, I'm just saying, we don't even have it like in our hands, much less something that's coming out. But one of the things that is very apparent. - [Matt] I was gonna say, the closest thing is probably Cyberpunk. - But that's cross gen tight. - It's a cross gen title but that's the closest thing for any console, for anything next gen that we're gonna be able to see. - We've not seen anything that really flexes the ray tracing capabilities of the Series X, for example. That being said, I think one of the big takeaway so far for me personally, is the speed of the console generally. 'Cause let's not forget, with the Xbox One and PS4 they were running very slow CPUs, right? So just the fact that you have a dedicated standard SSD and much faster CPUs, which is roughly equivalent to like a Ryzen 7, that by itself means that everything is faster. Loading menus, getting into games significantly faster. Everything just feels so snappy. - I was thinking about the, the load times, 'cause we'll talk about that in a second but, spoilers, they're faster. - Yeah. - So I always use like the metric of like, when am I going to stop playing a game? And it was always, all right, I died. Do I feel like waiting for the game to reload again? And if I don't feel like waiting for that load time, I guess I'm done playing for the night. But now when we're talking, oh, it's a few seconds to load. I'm gonna be playing games forever. - It's one of those things where when you get, and this is, I'm almost positive gonna to be the same story for PS5 as well, right? When you get a next gen console you're going to see PC like load times. In fact, in some scenarios actually faster than a lot of PCs, but you're gonna get used to it really quick, I guess. And it's one of those things where once you play it for a little bit like you're like, oh, whatever, it doesn't matter. But then you step back to an Xbox One or PS4 and you go, oh my God, I can't believe I used to sit around for two minutes and watch Red Dead Load, right, it's a major difference. - It is a night and day difference. And so then we can talk about, we saw the PS5 tear down, we saw how they're doing their SSD, which is one you can add yourself. And we also have then the external expansion for the Xbox. - The Seagate little memories card. They didn't call it memory card. - I mean, yeah, what else do you call it right now? PS5 is gonna be cheaper in the long run. - For the expansion, yeah. - For the expansion. Right now PS5 is actually slightly more expensive at like $10 more for a one terabyte equivalent. - So the main issue is is that, so on the Xbox there's one option if you want to your storage. Now, both PS5 and Xbox Series X, and Series S, support USB hard drives, but only for older games. If you wanna play a current gen game you need that SSD. So for the Series X you can get a one terabyte Seagate for, I believe $220, - $220. - [Austin] So that's the only option right now. - Only option and probably, I only see it going up from here. I don't know if we're gonna see a 512 for this. - Maybe, yeah. They have left it open though that they may make more. - And there's theoretically a third party could be opened up to do something, but with a proprietary drive the chances of this falling in price is pretty small. Like, this isn't gonna see massive price drops like we're going to see with regular PC hardware, which is what the PS5 can take advantage of. However, right now only one model of SSD is available. - [Austin] The WD Black, right? - [Matt] It's WD black and it's like the newest PCIE 4. The equivalent one terabyte is $10 more than this right now. - It's a little hard to compare because if you're 100% right, they're going to absolutely create more SSDs over the coming year or two that are certified. - And those prices are gonna fall. - I will say a couple of things that I don't want to say are disappointing, Hey, you know what, I will say, a couple of things that are disappointing about the Series X. So when you look at it beside the PS5, this is a Wifi 5 device, whereas the PS5 is Wifi 6. That's significant, I think. - Wifi 6 is popular enough right now that yeah, it feels like they could've included that. I was disappointed that there is no 3.1 or 3.2 USB C port on here. - Yes. Sony's got it beat across the board. - Right now we have just five gigabit USB 3s right here. - They're all USB A and there's three of them. Whereas on the PS5 you get not only USB C port, but you also get multiple 10 gig USB A ports which look, let's be real, I don't think that is the end of the world because what are you really gonna do with those? - Yeah, 'cause even with a 10 gig you're still not getting the speeds that you would with the SSD. - You're not playing games on it, right? - But again, with just thinking of, where are we gonna be in a few years? What if there's a 10 gig, I don't know. - No, no, no, no, I think you're 100% right here. The idea is USB C is the future, right? Every device is taking advantage of that. I get the concept that just like going from the One S to the One X and the One X to the Series X and Series S, they all have the same power cable. They all have HTMI in roughly the same place, they all have ethernet, and they all have the same amount of USB ports, one up front, two in the back, right. I get the idea that if you're upgrading from any of these consoles, you basically plug and play. Although, one note, if you are using an HDMI 2.1 display, use the cable that comes with the Series S or the Series X, and I assume the PS5 as well, that is a faster cable. You can't just use your old cables necessarily to get that full 4k 120, so just a little heads up there. But I get the idea that you want to keep that continuity and you wanna keep the hardware sort of very similar and easy to upgrade, but a USB C port on the front would not have been the end of the world, and Wifi 6, come on. - Specially if you're downloading these massive games. I would have liked to have seen like either a 2.5 or even a five gigabit ethernet port. Like I know my router is a couple of years old but I still have 2.5 gigabit ports. - I think that actually speaks to a really big difference between the Xbox and the PlayStation as far as where they spent their money and how. So of course, if you're looking at the apples to apples comparison, so the standard Xbox Series X and the PS5 non-digital, $500 each. The way they've gotten to that price is very different. There is no doubt in my mind after seeing the PlayStation tear down and having physically torn down the Series X myself so far, this is a significantly more expensive console, right? So first of all, while yes they may have saved a little bit money on like USB C and like Wifi 6, the SOC on this is just simply bigger, right? The PS5 has a smaller chip with a smaller GPU, they are running it at like 110%, they're throwing all the power they can at it, taking advantage of stuff like liquid metal cooling. But it's a very simple design on the PS5, right? It's a single motherboard, they've got a big heat pipe, it is very much an evolution of the PS3 and the PS4 designs across the board, right? which is fine, that makes sense, right, but that is a cheaper solution. The Xbox Series X has dual motherboards with the midplate. You have obviously the very expensive vapor chamber cooling and there's a lot more, and of course the chip, right, the chip is physically bigger, it runs at a standard clock speed which means that it is significantly more expensive, just because it is a physical larger. - There's no room for error with it. - Yes. With all that being said, I think it's pretty clear that Sony, they might be making a couple bucks on their PS5 they sell it, I don't think Microsoft's making a dollar on this thing. There's no way just with how expensive they've done everything on it, which is why I'm like, okay, look, a USB port here, wifi there. But seeing the two in contrast is really different because basically they spend all that money to not only get that sort of sustained performance, but also to get a smaller form factor. Sony on the other hand has basically gone with the same old school design, but bigger, right. Which means that it's a physically larger console with the same cooling technology inside. They could've made that smaller if they would have gone with like vapor chambers and whatnot, but instead they opted to save money, which nothing against that, I mean, consoles are expensive, but because of that it is a much larger console because costs they made. - I just wish they had made it look different. I just don't like the way that PS5 looks. I'm not a huge fan of the green in here. - [Austin] I like that, I like that. - But like, like the box, I don't know. - It's an Xbox. So I'm curious, now that we are, what, less than a month away from launch? How do you think the Series X is stacking up with the PS5 right now? I think the Xbox isn't a better place because again, we still have barely seen anything with the PS5. I've gone on record, I think the PS5 is gonna be soft delayed through bottlenecks. - [Austin] You mean, super low stock at launch? - Super low stock, like very small of people are actually gonna be able to get one. I don't think it's going to be mass available for, you know, until next year, like early next year. I'm not saying like, you know, a year from now but like early into 2021, past the holiday season. The problem that I think is plaguing both of them is that neither one of them have a launch title for it. - Yeah, I was about to say, these consoles have everything you need except games. - Yeah, yeah. Now don't get me wrong, just seeing, you know, and I'm sure it's gonna be very similar on the PS5, but just seeing the One X games that have been optimized for Series X, the night and day difference of this makes me want to go back and replay some games that I never finished because of like you know, oh whatever. - I'm gonna finally finish the Witcher and Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor. - Seeing that little bit of improvement and just makes an overall better gaming experience, which I think is gonna be great for both consoles. Obviously PS5 has the more, I would say, dedicated fan base. So I still think it's gonna be poised to sell more right off the gate, but I don't think it's gonna be as much of a blowout as it was last generation. - It looks like it's going to be a good time to be a gamer. And with that, it's a good time to subscribe to This Is! Thank you very much for watching, make sure to stay tuned for more future console content. I hear that Sony PlayStation's coming out at some point in the next few weeks and we're probably gonna make a bunch of videos on it. - Maybe - Matt, if we don't get a PS5 because of your pessimism, I'm gonna be so upset. - I think we're not getting a PS5 'cause we're not V tubers.",

    "transcript": "Trying Some Bose Headphones am i get-, am i too, am i getting too loud right now is this, is this, is this acceptable all right we're back got another product here check out part of awesome stuff week here we got the bose soundtrue headphones and on my channel my goodness I have probably examined hundreds of headphones so this is something I'm very familiar with the first thing that stands out to me here is just how small these little boxes it's pretty impressive obviously targeted at travel I can tell right away on the back here you'll notice there's a case that goes with it alright so let's go ahead and jump inside the box to take a closer look at these. Wow look at this little case right here little zipper on the outside pops open there they are just fit right in there you get rid of this this one also has a built-in microphone at least it looks that way and some control so volume up/down and also a play/pause button you're also going to use this button here for answering phone calls and ending them but they are headphones after all and so the important thing is how do they sound oh wow super duper lightweight It certainly feels a little bit like a little bit like the low end is accentuated here but I'm not hating on that that's that's sort of where I'm at anyways they have many different axises as they move on you notice as I sort of rotate them here I mean up like this this way this way where the emphasis is portability here and still maintaining some level of sound quality that you're happy with you gotta you know give them a little bit more of a test couple different genres you know how that goes. So something to keep in mind i'm blasting these headphones right now so whatever you're hearing as far as bleed is concerned that's at maximum volume thought you'd appreciate that ok I have to say honestly for such a lightweight pair of headphones something this small and portable is pretty impressive and the fact that they fit in a little pouch like this I can see myself traveling with these just from that component alone in fact that they're super tiny and a super lightweight *cheering* hold up, I know where I'm fit I'm filming right now guys this is like we're in the video it's about the headphones. We're on the road I'm so sorry I hey I mean you talk about me like I'm not invited and I'm not trying to be Jackson is saying that I know you're cool yeah well you know hey if you want okay you're very great want it if you guys want to see that any of that pepper stuff with hot peppers go check out hot pepper gaming on youtube they're uh, they're also participating an awesome stuff week all right time for me to put these back on just fade outta here yeah",

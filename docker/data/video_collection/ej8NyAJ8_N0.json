    "transcript": "- Whatever happened to those old game cartridges that we all liked to (blowing) blow into when we were kids? Well, there were two big reasons that they mostly disappeared in favor of discs. First was that they couldn't hold very much data. The Nintendo 64 Game Pak, for example, appropriately maxed out at just 64 megabytes. Even a standard CD can hold roughly 10 times that amount, which became necessary as games became more complex. Second, discs are much cheaper to produce. In fact, Nintendo spent around 30 times as much on N64 cartridges compared to what Sony spent on discs for the PlayStation One. Despite digital distribution being extremely popular now, discs are still cheap enough for console makers to sell while fat ROM cartridges have been relegated to history, except on the Switch.",

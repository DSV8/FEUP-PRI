    "description": "The AMD Ryzen 3000 series will be broken into two very different architectures: one for the desktop (Zen 2) and another for notebooks and Chromebooks (Zen+).  Let's go over some of the differences with the AMD mobile / notebook processors first before getting into the upcoming desktop series sometime in the near future.

    "transcript": "hello good people Eber here with Hardware Canucks and you've probably realized by now that in our explain series of videos we try to put new and interesting technology into perspective in simple and shorter videos we've actually covered everything from Intel's latest command center to AMD's driver updates to a lot of you know new things like processors and graphics technology as well this time I wanted to tackle on something that isn't really new but you'll see it in the upcoming months and that's AMD's 3000 series Ryzen processors on mobile rather than desktop actually the difference between mobile and desktop may cause a bit of confusion this year since they are completely different animals so hopefully this video will give me a chance to straighten things up but first let's take a quick look at our sponsor the new Razer Blade 15 is a machine for people who know exactly what they want when you need a reliable keyboard and one custom lighting when you need an accurate display and once insanely fast 144 Hertz refresh rate when you need a portable machine and want a gorgeous thin aluminum unibody in the world's smallest 15.6 inch gaming laptop when you need powerful gaming hardware to truly dominate with GeForce rtx the Razer Blade 15 when you need the power for anything you do and want nothing to hold you back check out the configuration you want down below okay so let's get the obvious part out of the way AMD officially launched their 3000 series processors back at CES this year and they targeted the notebooks and Chromebook market now there's not a lot to talk about the desktop variants or the desktop processors right now but we could still discuss the key differences between desktop and mobile starting at the top the 3000 series mobile parts are based off the Zen+ architecture and 12 nanometers manufacturing process used in the 2000 series desktop parts likely 2700X that makes them second generation Zen CPUs the upcoming desktop 3000 series will use a new 7nm manufacturing process and the hugely updated third gen Ryzen 2 architecture finally while 3000 series notebooks processors are available now don't expect next-generation desktop CPUs to be announced before Computex this year so anything I talked about from this point onwards will be based on the Zen architecture that's currently available on the notebook platform what AMD's trying to do with this series of mobile processors is cover every possible market that includes Chromebooks as well basically the Ryzen 7 and 8 series will cover mid to high level gaming and productivity notebooks while the you processors will hit these slim and light markets then the risin 5n Ryzen 3 will take on the premium to mainstream Windows segments respectively while the new Athlon would likely hit the value market in laptops that costs less than 750 dollars another thing to take note of is that every processor here is actually an APU with integrated vaca graphics which is awesome the last thing here are the a 4 and a 6 which I won't really talk about here since they're really for entry-level Chromebooks rather than pcs another interesting thing that AMD brought up is that an average consumer has a notebook that's almost 5 years old actually coming to think of it that seems like Mike from our team who's been rocking the Vails II back from 2010 and he just recently got the chance to upgrade it to the x1 carbon from lenovo but coming back to my point according to AMD there's an expectation of upwards of 60% improvement from back then till now which may or may not seem like a huge bump but if you guys are interested in us testing out those claims definitely let us know in the comments down below because I'm sure we can find out where that they are z laptop is this must be like somewhere in his household so we'll make that happen if you guys are interested so here are the specs of all the AMD 3000 series mobile processors and instead of boring you by talking about a bunch of specs I'll let you pause here but I also wanted to highlight some important points like I said before take note that the Ryzen 7 3750H and the Ryzen 5 3550H are quad core eight 335 watt CPUs that target gaming notebooks meanwhile all the other processors you see here are meant to maximize battery life and lower Heat by operating at 15 watts ask for graphics nothing really has changed since the 2000 series notebook processors other than the tall nanometer manufacturing process allows for a bit higher GPU clock speeds all of these feature of Vega graphics with between 10 and 3 computer units that means Vega 10 here has 640 computer units which translates into a bit less performance than the Radeon rx550 so what does that mean for gaming performance before a discrete GPU is factored into things in a MIDI zone tests they achieved better gaming performance on the integrated graphics than Intel's whiskey lake core i7 85 65 you with a UHD 620 GPU core but honestly guys this is splitting hairs since these results were taken at just 720p whereas almost every notebook these days has a 1080p display so the AMD 3700 you can provide more performance but honestly I think they should be a bit worried remember Intel's new gen 11 graphics core is on its way with ice Lake and they should offer almost 50% more performance with intel's GPU division now being run by a bunch of ex AMD employees that could cause some issues now in our briefing with AMD they said that they were supposed to have 33% more design wins this year and I really hope that becomes reality because right now it is really and I mean really hard to find an all aiming notebook that doesn't fit the cheap category let's actually take a look at the a suicide for example so even though they have over 50 notebooks there are four with AMD processors and of those two of those are tough models that aren't available yet one of the vive books is from 2016 while the only one available to actually buy has an older 2000 series CPU luckily companies like HP Lenovo and even Dell are starting to include more aimed at offering 'z but it's been a really slow process as a matter of fact we actually looked at the tough FX 500 5dy during CES and you can find that link right over here unfortunately back then a lot of you commented that for the specs of a Ryzen 5 3550H and an rx560 GPU it was really overpriced not only that but the build quality was pretty terrible and you know what I think Asus agreed with all of us since now it's available for about $700 and if rumors are right it'll be relaunched soon in a more powerful version with an NVIDIA GPU so that's a guys and honestly even though the B CPUs look good on paper I feel like I say the same thing every year with AMD's mobile platform and what they're offering because being able to buy them after is just nearly impossible which is just really unfortunate honestly things could change this here because what we've seen Zen to is able to deliver great performance and good efficiency in a relatively affordable package I guess it's just a matter of time for noble manufacturers to implement them and add them as an alternative option to what Intel's offering so I just can't wait for that to happen I want to know your thoughts about this new CPU or this new 3000 series mobile CPU's from AMD would you consider yourself upgrading to an all and in notebook in the future because of you know what they're offering right now but they potentially look like they'll be offering I loved in your thoughts about that in the comments I'm Eber are with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our Boot Sequence channel I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

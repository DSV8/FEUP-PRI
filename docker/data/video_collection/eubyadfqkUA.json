    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] Maximum frame rate 10 fps, oh yeah! Oh! Look at that! Unable to open that file. File is too wide, oh. Yeah, check it out man, I made shapes! (lively instrumental music) Hey guys, how you all doin'? Really? That's just great! Ya know what, I'm doin' pretty great today too because we're bustin' out the old iBook G3, Clamshell. Yes, the same iBook that was in the pilot episode of Vintage Apple Vault and if you're into vintage Apple products I highly recommend giving that a watch. Hashtag, shameless plug. We're gonna boot her up today and experiment with some software that is older then me. Hopefully it works. And we're starting up! Ah, check out those lips. Those were some nice lips. A network time error, you Macintosh's clock is set to a year before 1973. That's probably because the clock battery is long since dead on here. So yeah, here we are, let's hold down the option key to go to our secret about screen. With the Apple Campus in it, Mac OS Finder, well that wasn't very useful. Let's do something more useful. About this computer, we're running Mac OS 9.2.1. So I have some software on here but today we're gonna be experimenting with something that I came across when I was writing a future Vintage Apple Vault episode and the next episode's we have coming up on that show are going to be real kick ass, so. Please subscribe and stick around for those. I was researching some stuff about the history of Final Cut Pro and the old Power Macs that Apple made and while doing that, I read some more interviews from people interviewing Randy Ubillos. Who was the Chief Architect of Final Cut Pro, he developed Adobe Premiere and all the stuff. He did a lot of stuff in the non-linear editing space. And I came across this little buddle of joy, which I just f'ed up excuse me, oh crap on a stick! Well, well I guess I accidentally screwed that up. Let me fix that right here. I don't remember exactly what it said but it said something like that. Anyway, I came across this little bundle of joy. Adobe Premiere 1.0, (laughs) it was written in 1991 by Randy Ubillos and it was originally called ReelTime. And just think about how Adobe Premiere is right now. I bet, many of the movies you watch were cut in Adobe Premiere, it's pretty industry standard. And it started back in 1991 with ReelTime which got renamed Adobe Premiere 1.0. This is a copy of it, I'm not sure if it's gonna work. But we're gonna find out, together. Let's open it up. Oh, check out that splash screen. Oh, ho, ho! Written by Randy Ubillos 1991, holy crap! Oh my! Oh! Dude! (laughs) Hang on let's, let's hide everything else. Oh, my gosh! Okay so, for those of you who maybe don't know, I do video editing as my living and I use NLE's, non-linear editor's all the time, they've come a long way but this is (laughs) what one of them looked like in 1991, oh, my gosh! Okay, this is my favorite part, it's not called a timeline. It's not called a sequence like editor or any of that stuff, it's called a construction window. Oh, Randy, Randy, Randy, this is beautiful. Oh, man I've never used this before. This is, this is beautiful, holy cow, Macintosh version. Yeah! Wow! Here's our project, here's our construction window so this is where we I guess put the video and audio tracks in a sequence. So I'm gonna try to arrange this maybe a little bit like how it normally would be, well let's see here. Special, oh, okay. We can summon different windows. Okay. Let's have a look at what else is in here. File, new project, edit, project make movie, preview work area, add matte. Construction display, video tracks, full effects, preview options, output options. Maximum frame rate 10 fps, oh yeah, (laughs), man, dude. You guys are so blessed, where you can just cut 4K on your phones nowadays. You have no idea what this was like. Unless you actually do, (laughs), this is crazy. Alright let's try to maybe arrange this kind like how it would be nowadays, let's see. Oh we can only stretch it horizontally, wow, okay. Oh, I guess, that's the highest resolution we can go. Let's see, 224 by 168. I suppose, this is somethin' else. This is really something else, okay. New project, oh shit, no, no, I just lost all, (coughs) oh, gosh I'm coughing, I'm gonna die. Um, I just um, lost my beautiful arrangement, no. Alright, let's try that again. Alright well I guess let's do some stuff, let's um, let's first save it, we'll save it to the desktop. And we'll just call this My Great Movie. Not mobie, movie and save that. And here we go, we just saved a Premiere 1.0 file. (laughs) Oh my gosh. Import, dude, I have no idea what this thing is even compatible with. Maybe a jpeg? Oh, I got the watch. Oh and then it converts, oh this is interesting. Oh, it's trying to show a preview and that's a massive file. That's why it's taking so long, the preview box is on and that's like a 24 megabyte png. I'm gonna turn the previews off. I'm just gonna try importing a jpeg. And let's do the Macintosh SE photo, convert. Okay, save converted file as, oh! I see how it's doing it. Alright we'll just put it all on the desktop, not good practice but we'll do that for now. Unable to open that file. File is too wide, oh, alright we gotta go smaller. Oh, oh, oh, shut up, shut up! Alright, I will have to make these smaller. Couldn't display Shooting Stars, blah blah blah, because it's corrupted. Alright, well I don't think there's any way I can do any resizing on here. I don't have like any photo editing software, right so here's what I did. I went to my other computer and converted the image files. I also tried finding some movie files that might work with this older version of Premiere. I think Premiere can read cinepak. I'm not sure but cinepak was like that really old codec slash format, not really sure, from 1991. That played all those little postage stamp movie files on your CD-ROM's and all that stuff. So, I'm guessing that'll work and it should show up, now, okay, let's open 'er up. We'll transfer the picture files. Make a copy to the desktop. And we'll also do those movie files. And there we go. Alright let's eject the flash drive. And I love this message on the old Mac OS, it refers to the device as a cartridge, let's see, yeah, I guess that's just what it was back in the 90's. Alright we took that out. So, let's uh, maybe clean up this desktop a little bit. Let's try one of those cinepak files first, I really have low hopes but let's try. And, nothing! Alright, well, that's why ya set the bar low. Let's just try making a slide show with some pictures. And let's do any Chicago people here? Let's open up this photo I took of Cloud Gate. Convert, and we will convert it in place in the same folder, save and let's watch it fail again. Actually it might have worked. Oh! Wow, hey, we got a thumbnail. All right! So if I double click that I get a preview. Oh that's actually, that's actually kind of impressive. It actually renders that pretty well. It probably wouldn't have this much color detail on, if I was running this on a real like 1992 Mac or something as opposed to this 1999 model, I would probably have way less color. But the fact that this old version of Premiere is able to interpret that I guess, it works with QuickTime or somethin', I really don't know. Let's put that in our timeline. Let's import some other files. But yeah that's cool how, it somehow still compatible even on the newer computer with more color, it's able to load all those colors as opposed to dithering it and all that stuff. 'Cause if I was actually using this on like a 1991 system, there would be most likely some dithering. Save in place. Look at that, that is pretty cool and we can just put our stuff in our construction window. Oh, we got these little icons here, what do those mean? I don't know, but we got out info here. Resolution, duration, type, name, that is cool. Alright well, so that's our in and our out points, our play head. Alright well let's see where's our play head for our preview, I'm guessing we gotta go to, oh this is great, preview options, let's see what's in output options. So, 160 by 120, 4 by 3 aspect ratio, we have thousands of colors, oh! Guess it's compatible with thousands of colors, okay! So that's for outputting when you actually render the movie, okay, so that would be me, preview work area, oh, okay. And let's see what preview options we have. 10 fps, well we're not working really with video, so we might as well just keep it at that, right? Although we could probably do the full 30 on this machine. Okay, so yeah preview work area, which by the way that shortcut is still how it is, if you wanna render a workspace in Premiere you do press return or enter. Dude! Oh, my gosh, do and we got, (laughs) did you see the little film reel loading cursor that was really cool. Oh, my gosh, man we are making movie magic here. This is (laughs) this is really cool! Okay, um so let's go to special effects and see if we can do anything. Uh, doesn't look like we can. That's fantastic, do we have to drag them in, maybe we have to drag them in or somethin'? Let's go to, let's get a new window, and plugins. I guess, I don't know if we, I guess we just import the plugins, I have no idea. We're gonna find out though. This is all really foreign to me. Let's try to get the effects in there, oh let's see add a matte, like a color? Oh, dude, yes! Alright, let's just make a blue matte. And we'll just call it color matte. And we'll drag that in here. And it just fits right in between it doesn't overlap or anything, that's interesting. And, we'll preview that. Picture, blue, picture. We're making Holly Wood magic right here, ladies and gentlemen. This is unbelievable. Alright let's try to import some effects. I guess because I don't know, how else we actually get the effects in here. So let's go to the desktop, iBook, Applications, da,dar,dar, Premiere 1, plugins, yeah I guess, okay well I officially don't know how to get the plugins in here. I'll just doc this panel down, or this window down here for now so, we can get back to that later. Transparent, oh filters, oh! Okay, um, I just, (sigh) I guess it's not pickin' um up anywhere. Okay, well we'll uh, we'll, guess maybe we'll get back to that later. Maintain aspect ratio, transparency settings. Oh sweet! Oh, we can make a garbage matte on here, we can put a drop shadow on here, anti-alias, oh my gosh, this is how we used to have to do this stuff on a computer. (laughs) This is, really insane. Yeah! Check it out man, I made shapes! (laughs loudly) This is amazing, I, oh. We take stuff for granted nowadays, don't we? Okay, so I bopped around the google machine for a bit and the issue might have something to do with the software not linking up to the files because I accidentally renamed the root folder. So once this comes out of sleep mode here, I will try to fix that and I also went through my, ha, ha childhood collection, we're goin' old school here. I found some old CD-ROM's and these might have some old QuickTime files that we can maybe import into Premiere and just experiment with. Maybe it has to be in the root folder. I'm totally guessing, if you can't tell, maybe I need to find like some old documentation. (laughs) To see how this works. Hey, look at that! And we have the little preview there, okay. So, yeah the file's have to be in the root folder, along with the actual software application to show it properly in here. And it looks like then we can just drag this where we want. Cool! We'll just drag those into here. And it saved my layout, and there's our shit. With all the little previews! Oh, that's so cute! I'm guessing this stuff goes into the effects track so let's say I wanna do a band slide we would drag that down here. Alright! We have a, oh that's for direction. Oh, forward or reverse, okay and I don't know what this does. This is forward, reverse and I guess this is up, down. Okay, that makes sense, now let's do a cross dissolve. Drag that into there. And let's preview this workspace. Dude, oh yeah, that definitely did not line up right but it, you can see the effect itself is working though, cool. So now, we also installed some filters, not just transitions, so I'm guessing I can click on one of these. Go to filters, nice! And then, oh let's, yeah let's add a tint. Oh, dude, this is so freakin' cool (laughs), it's so primitive but man this is what we had. Oh, color balance, yeah let's just make it really green. Yeah like, Chicago is like being covered with some like nuclear toxic plague, or something. So business as usual right? Let's do that and it's green! Oh, shit! That is amazing, well done Randy, well freakin' done. It'd be so cool he saw this. Alright, now let's quit out of this for now. Just to free up our massive amount of memory on this computer. And let's try installing or ripping like some old QuickTime movies from these CD-ROM's. This is Club KidSoft, for technical support call that phone number at, probably don't 'cause it probably doesn't exist anymore. (laughs) Let's pop this baby in. I see movies, wow did somebody just die up there. Huh, someone on floor nine of the asylum must have just fainted, anyway. We have media and movies, nothing. Alright it was named movies but there was nothing in there. Now I'm sad, okay, media. Beva-cha-ha-ga-ja what? Did the developer just like not know what to call that file? Alright well this one might not be of use. Aw, the file band slide could not be loaded and has been removed from the project. Well it, aw, what, all my effects are dying! How many survived? I don't know if any did. Aw, cross dissolved died too. Eh, everybody's dying, well it was fun while it lasted. Alright so, I'm gonna try to open this sample movie that comes with QuickTime, because I'm not having much luck with my CD-ROM's. I can't seem to find any QuickTime documents on 'um. Yeah, they were actually referred to as documents. At least in this version of the finder. So, let's see if this will do anything. Oh, my gosh, I think we might have something. Oh, oh, wow! What, oh (moans) look at that! And look at these controls, look at, oh you can set the in and the out point. Or it's telling me that's the out point but I can set the in and the out point down here. Duration, change in duration, oh and I can, look at that scrubbing, oh yeah! This is beautiful, okay well, I'll just use this, I don't even know what codec this is in but if I can find out I can maybe convert some modern files into whatever this is using. So let's, take our sample movie put it in here. Now I think the movie has sound but I'm willing to bet the sound did not load. There it is! Oh, look at that performance! Let's watch that again. Yeah! So, yeah it doesn't look like sound is going to work but just in case you wanted to hear the cool music. I guess I'll play it for you. (gently instrumental music) QuickTime, a fragrance from Apple. Alright so through my detective work and the help of VLC, it looks like this file which is compatible with Premiere 1 was encoded using SVQ1 Sorensen Video and then a QDM2 for the audio. Now what I'm not 100 percent sure about is, was Premiere natively compatible with this stuff or is it just compatible with it because the newer version of QuickTime on the iBook is compatible with it. So if QuickTime's compatible with it does Premiere even though it's an older version of Premiere, inherently gain that compatibility? I don't know, there's ways we can test that. Okay, so the test now is to see Adobe Premiere compatibility and to experiment with different formats and see if it inherently gains newer file compatibility through QuickTime because this version of QuickTime on this computer is way newer then the version of QuickTime that was available when the original Premiere came out in 1991. So I have some samples, I have a snippet from the Vintage Apple Vault show trailer. Which I reconverted into I think I used some kind of DVNTSC standard def codec inside of a QuickTime MOV wrapper, I guess it's technically called a wrapper. Oh, I should really, maybe learn some more of those distinctions, (laughs) and then if that doesn't work I just have an image sequence of lower resolution jpeg's from the exact same source. Okay, so if I open up the QuickTime movie. Let's see if QuickTime can play it. - But it's presented in a way that is new to you, I want to take you with me and time-- - [Krazy Ken] Okay, so QuickTime was able to play back that file, so let's see if Premiere inherently gains that compatibility. Let's switch to Premiere, what, would ya look at that. It looks like it did, so yeah I'm guessing it just gains compatibility from whatever version of QuickTime is on here. And it just inherently gains the file support. Now again, I, the sound may not work doesn't look like the sound is importing anywhere but it looks like the video is actually loading in to the construction window. Let's preview the workspace. Oh, there's me! Inside of Adobe Premiere 1.0, (laughs) wow, that is insane. Let's expand this uh, play range and let's look at the b-roll shot of the G4 cube. Coming up, right around here, four seconds. Yeah! Oh, ho, ho right! That is awesome. Titles, add. Number of titles, number of titles, wait what? Okay, I have no idea what that did, oh! Oh, that said tiles! I thought it said titles! Oh! I'm very bad at reading, you can tell the educational system 10 stories underground isn't very good. I thought it said titles! What the heck, oh I'm an idiot. Can you even generate titles inside of here? You may not be able to, you may have to make them in a different program and import them as an image. Oh my gosh, those were tiles, I am such an idiot. Okay, yeah I don't think Premiere got a titler until version 2.0 now that I think about it. And this is only 1.0 so that's where we're staying. This needs to be on A, and then it will work like B roll. It'll cut away to that, let's have a look. And perfect. Beautiful, beautiful composition. Beautiful film, I will give you an Oscar. Okay I took things to the next level. I now have the original PowerBook picture I was looking for and I'm gonna have it cross dissolve to that picture while this track plays underneath. Op, actually I just realized I forgot to set my end point. (laughs) Oh, all this manual labor, still for 1991, digital video like, this was unheard of. Yeah! I mean I can tell it was trying to do it. It was really tryin' to do it, it was choking a little bit but it was trying. Alright and let's make out movie, command K. Alright, make entire movie 160 by 120 resolution at 10 fps. Let's see if we can maybe, crank that up a bit, we'll do 5 for the quality, thousands of colors. We don't have any sound so that doesn't really matter. Let's try doing 30 fps, entire movie. Okay, we'll save it to the desktop, we'll just call it untitled because we're lazy and hit okay. One moment please, compiling movie. This is amazing, oh my gosh, ya know I kinda like this, I might just cut all future videos in Adobe Premiere 1.0, I mean why not, right? Well that's interesting, it exported this and it actually shows up as an Adobe Premiere document. Hm, not a, yeah not a file that I can open up in QuickTime or anything I guess. It just opens up as, as this, I don't know maybe it's because I don't have any other compatible media player or what but yeah I guess it just put it into this. Well, it has a little bit better ReelTime playback now (laughs) that is insane. (Screeching noise) Alright, alright, alright, alright, hang on. Hold on a second. This is fun and all but what I really think would be fun is to test Adobe Premiere 1.0 on a system that's from the time period, I'm talking about the early 90's. And System 7, so I wanted to install Adobe Premiere 1.0 plus transfer some picture and video assets onto a floppy disk to load it up on one of my System 7 Mac's but I couldn't get my external floppy disk drive to work. So I couldn't write any files to any of the disks. Oh well, so I thought I'd burn a CD, right? I have a computer that runs System 7 and it has a CD-Rom drive, my Power Macintosh 6100. So I used my PowerBook G4 with Mac OS 10 Leopard so I could burn the legacy CD with the Mac OS Standard format which is a format that should work with System 7. However, Leopard was being dumb and it wasn't letting me write the file to the CD image I made so I switched to the terminal, hooray it worked! So then I went to boot my Power Macintosh 6100 up. I needed a bunch of conversion technology to hook a VGA monitor up to it, I just used the dongles that I had. I spent about a half hour tracking everything down, dongle-wise, so now I made a bag of frequently used legacy adapters, so that doesn't happen again. Hopefully. I booted up, nothing happened! Then I looked inside. Oh, crap the hard drive isn't even plugged in. And this was probably from a past salvaging experiment that I did. I did a little bit of a hard drive swap, transplant, hack job type of thing a while ago, way before I started this show. And I probably never plugged the disk back in, so it's been sittin' like that for years. But I tried booting it from an external SCSI disk and still nothing, but then I thought wait, nothing is working on this computer, I can't even get any video to output to the display. So something more then just the hard drive being unplugged is wrong with this computer. And I may need to fix it up on a future Krazy Ken episode, so stick around for that. By the way I tested the display on a different System 7 PowerBook computer and it works. Even with dual display mode. So we know the display is just peachy. So I may have to fix that Power Macintosh 6100 sometime in the future but in the meantime, I figured I'd transfer the files from the CD to my PowerBook 5300cs. Which is, I believe, my fastest notebook computer that is currently running System 7 but of course there's no CD-ROM drive. So, I bough an external one on Ebay. It's shipping right now, it'll be here soon. And I'll update you guys on a future video and I'll test Adobe Premiere 1.0 on a true System 7 machine. So please subscribe and stick around so you don't miss it! It's gonna be fun. Alright, back to the episode. Just seeing myself in my modern footage in low resolution, in an old player just really makes me grateful for what we have nowadays! I just wanna give a quick look, as to how the software evolved. From 1991 to 2018. Some basic things like havin' a timeline and a view port, ya know that stuff is, that stuff is still there. Like that's the general idea of how an NLD works but man, good job Randy Ubillos. Who was also the Chief Architect of Final Cut Pro and the new Final Cut Pro 10, I believe he was on both of those. Yes, we have him to thank but it was a team effort. There were a lot of people involved with this stuff but the first version of Premiere was written just by him. And I will be diving more into Randy Ubillos and his history and Final Cut Pro and other vintage Mac stuff on the upcoming volume two of Vintage Apple Vault. So stick around for that but good job Adobe for keeping the product around and evolving it. This was a fun experiment, what do ya guys think? It's really important to remember to be grateful for what we have because it used to be like this! Thanks so much for taggin' along with me today. The curse didn't seem to pay us a visit, so that's good! You guys take care! Catch the crazy and pass it on! (lively instrumental music)",

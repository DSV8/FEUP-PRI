    "transcript": "- Welcome back to TechLinked, filmed right here in Canada, where it's generally safe most of the time, 1812 was a bit of a rough one. - [Man] Oh yeah, that was, I remember. - I've been holding doors open for people ever since. Washington, DC is having a bit of a rough one, to say the least. Protesters in support of President Trump stormed the Capitol Building this morning in an attempt to stop the counting of Electoral College votes. In response, social media giants, including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Twitch have scrambled to try and moderate posts and live streams on their respective platforms. Twitter labeled some of Trump's tweets with a warning that they tend to be replied to, retweeted, or liked, due to a risk of violence. While a YouTube spokesperson told TheBurg that moderation teams are working quickly to remove videos and streams that appear to incite violence or feature graphic footage. Of course, that's what YouTube normally does for videos that violate their guidelines, so it's not strange. What is strange is people smashing windows and breaking into the Senate Chamber, that's less common. - [Man] It doesn't happen often. - Not in a First World country. Hey, let's go to some less dreary news, shall we? Like the fact that PC components in the US are about to get more expensive? - [Man] Yay! - [James] What is this? - [Man] Wait, hold on a second. - Many American companies had agreements that shielded them from a series of tariffs placed on a butt-ton of Chinese products by the Trump administration, back in 2018. Those agreements have now expired, meaning that companies like a ASUS, Gigabyte, PNY, ZOTAC, and more, have now more money, taxes, they have to pay to import GPU's and other PC components from China. Consumers can expect prices increases of 80 to $200 over MSRP- - [Man] Oh, man. - For mid to high-end parts. Although it's unclear how I'm supposed to feel about this, given that graphics cards are basically mythological at this point, you know? - [Man] You ever seen one? - How am I supposed to afford elf dust? And CES is coming up next week. But as usual, some tech companies just can't hold their tech news in, and they do something that would lead a lesser man to make a vulgar joke. But this is a family show- - [Man] Don't do it, James. - And we are greater men. - [Man] Pervert. Samsung announced, it too, has mini-LED TVs on the way to take on LG's QNED models, or I like to say, Q-NED. - [Man] You the man. - Ned's like, \"Where do I line up?\" But more importantly, you can plug in a webcam so your TV can count your pushups and judge your form. That sounds really- - [Man] Oh. - Really fun. - [Man] Exercising. - But OLEDs aren't dead yet, in fact, they'll be coming to as many as 10 Samsung laptops. - [Man] Woo. - Dell announced the world's first 40 inch, 4K, ultra wide monitor with a resolution of 5120 by 2160, as well as other monitors that seem more normal, except that they have a dedicated Microsoft Teams button. (man laughs) The truly weird stuff is yet to come from CS, like LG made a Dyson vacuum that empties its dirt into a charging cradle, but you still have to take the dirt out. Pfft. That's more done than weird, I'm waiting for this year's cat pillow. - [Man] I ordered 20. - Now it's time for the quick bits, brought to you by Vessi Footwear. They're known for making shoes that are light, comfortable, and most importantly, waterproof, allowing you to walk into almost any terrain while keeping your feet as dry as the vacuum of space. Ah, check out the new weekend shoe, it's great for dressing you up or dressing you down. And in fact, some of us are wearing them right now and throwing them at yours truly. Even though it's not technically the weekend yet, you can grab yourself a pair and use our offer code, TechLinked, to get 25 real dollars off each pair at vessi.com/techlinked. Quick bits, now? - [Man] Yeah. - In this economy? (man laughs) Fellow PC gamers, we are now legally required to stop making fun of people who game on iPads, because even they, now, can use a mouse and keyboard to game. - [Man] Hey! Pascal's Wager, a Dark Souls type game, has added the new future, making the iPad into even more of a computer than it was already. I'm sorry, look, you can still dunk on people who are playing in cross play lobbies with a controller, but don't look down on them, they know not what they do. - [Man] They're the little people. - Facebook has issued an ultimatum to WhatsApp users in the form of updated terms of service, which basically say, let us collect your data or stop using the app. This is kind of like what every app is, I guess? WhatsApp's early claim to fame was encrypted messaging, but it's kind of pointless if Facebook still gets to see it. If you still want to use an encrypted messaging app, Signal is a thing, and if you're surprised, well, stay away from the casino. - [Man] Or the gambling club. - It looks like Nintendo is prepared to chuck the Nintendo 3DS into the recycling bin, as the company silently removed 250 games from the DSI and 3DS eShops. They also announced plans to remove Netflix functionality on the 3DS and the Wii U. - [Man] No! - No, daggone, Nintendo, don't you care about your users? What other small internet connected device am I supposed to use to watch my movie shows? - [Man] On my Apple Watch? - Argh. Research from OpenAI has unveiled DALL-E, a system that can generate images from text inputs. You can literally tell it to show you anything, from a cat wearing sunglasses to a baby daikon radish in a tutu, walking a dog, and it's a cute dog. - [Man] Is that it? Sure, some of those images are whack, but this AI was just born, it's younger than me and I can't draw for crap. And speaking of AI, Boston Dynamics robots have gotten a little too cool for school, dancing like it's no problem. I mean, I'm here with my dad moves. So joint researchers from China and Scotland have created an algorithm that lets their own dog-like robots learn to walk on its own. They tested it by knocking it over, slapping it with sticks, and tripping it, and I learned to get up from even the most rude encounters. But don't be fooled, it knows who's the boss. - [Man] For now. - Play dead, or all dead ya. - [Man] Oh. - And I'm not the boss of time, so this episode has to come to an end. Come back on Friday for more tech new, and stay inside folks. - [Man] For multiple reasons. - Yikes.",

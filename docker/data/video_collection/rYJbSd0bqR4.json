    "transcript": "- I talk about this a lot, but it is absolutely mind-blowing how much TV you can get for, how does this open? Come on! (tape ripping) (box banging) What is going on?! Get off! (Linus exhales angrily) What is it stuck on? (box giving way) Okay. Now, I've talked about this before, how much TV you can get for shockingly small amounts of money these days. This is the VIZIO M Series Quantum 65 inch. A TV that only costs a couple hundred dollars more than an Xbox series X, and yet has the vast majority of the features that any gamer would care about. It's got HDR with luminance up to 600 nits, it's got 4K60 hertz support, it's got Dolby Vision, and it's even got support for HDMI 2.1 features, like eARC and variable refresh rate. So, VIZIO sponsored this video, where we're gonna be hooking it up to an Xbox series X and checking it out. It's actually shockingly light for a TV that has full array local dimming. It's got 30 zones in there. Hold on, one sec. (grunting) I'm a trained professional. Please do not attempt at home. So we got HDMI1 with eARC, got three more, comes at 2amp USB, so if you wanna power your bias lighting, or, like, a chromecast dongle or something like that, you'd run it off there, optical, and wired ethernet. Wall mounting supported, power in over here, (Linus whooping comically) Where's my stand at? (Linus grunting) Hello? (box crashing) Ow! I'm a trained professional. (styrofoam clunking) Pretty sure it's in here. Hey! There it is! There may have been an easier way to do that. Someone's got to put the first nick in this new floor. Oh, yeah! How you guys like the new Short Circuit set? Look at that, we got the computer corner up in there, we got the TV corner over there, that's where we'll be doing this video. Look. Conveniently, they're keyed, so there's no way to put them in wrong. Ah! Heck yeah, brother! - [Andy] Do you want a hand, Linus? - Nope, I'm good. And a one, two, three! (yells) (Linus laughing) Hey, look at that! It's almost like we designed the set for a 65 inch TV to go here. It's perfect! Oh, damn it! I'm three inches too short. That's what she said. That's okay, while we wait for an extension cable, we can open up this M series 5.1 sound bar that we're going to be pairing with the TV. It's got support for Dolby Atmos, it's got a total of nine speakers included between the soundbar, the subwoofer, and the two dedicated rear satellites. And I believe it actually also includes... Uh, that's interesting. So, there's the wall mounting brackets, that's what I was expecting to find, as well as, apparently, an AMD backplate that someone must have accidentally tossed in here when they were putting it away from the last project we used this for. I know that not everyone's into the whole soundbar thing, but as someone who recently made the switch, I know, I know, you know, the whole dedicated setup thing, dedicated amp and all that, it can sound better, even for the money, but there is something to be said for, just put it there, put that thing there, and then, like, two cables later, you're done. Now, because this is a fairly basic soundbar, you don't have a whole array of inputs. VIZIO does have higher end products that have got, you know, multiple inputs, and like, upward firing, rotating speakers and all that kind of stuff. But, what's nice about this one is, at least, unlike some others, you do get an HDMI input to replace the input on your TV that is consumed by eARC, here. So we just gotta do our power cable here, HDMI to the TV, and then, we actually get another USB for powering, you know, again, some kind of accessory. Not a chromecast though, I lied, because it actually has built in chromecast. Ha Ha! I mean, I guess you could just have another chromecast. If you hook up the surround speakers, they go into the back of the subwoofer, right here, and then you wanna run those, like, under your carpet, or wherever else, to either a wall bracket or you can get floor standing speaker stands if you're into that. Personally, I consider the rear channels to be somewhat optional. Not every type of content benefits in the same way that others do. I would say racing games are a great example of something where you're gonna want the rear channels, but not necessarily everything. That's clean. Isn't that clean? This is such a cool TV stand, 'cause it's, like, designed for next gen console ventilation, you know what I mean? Let's turn this baby on. There we go! Immediately we're greeted with all the usual suspects for apps, Netflix, AppleTV, Disney Plus, Prime Video, YouTube. Pluto? Plex, there we go. Tidal, Curiosity Stream. That's funny, I don't see Hulu on the list, but there's literally a Hulu button on the remote, so presumably, that'll work? There we go. (Linus laughing) Of course, my focus, for now, is on gaming, 'cause that's what we're focused on, today. We're flipping into game mode. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the warm color temperature that a lot of game and film modes default to, so I'm gonna change that to normal, and then we're gonna go into advanced picture. Yep, all these kinds of black details, super resolution things, you want that off in gaming so you have the best possible input latency. Get my full array local dimming. This TV has 30 zones, so we're gonna have a look at how that looks for games. Things like text might have blooming around them with only 30 zones, but in game, I'm expecting that to actually look pretty decent. Let's give it a shot, at least. Motion control, yeah, we don't want any clear action, any interpolated frames or anything like that, noise reduction, perfect! Wow, this all looks great. And then variable refresh rate, on. There we go, okay, that fixed that little bit of weirdness that we saw there, and game HDR, yep, okay! Looks like we're ready to rock! One thing to note though, guys, is we found the game menu on VIZIO TVs is not necessarily accessible unless you are plugged into a gaming source. So, now that we've got the Xbox configured, it pops up and we're able to make all those changes. All right! Nice! Balls. Oh, that's fine, the TV doesn't really need it right now. Man, given how affordable it is to add, like, just even a pretty basic or, like, mid-range soundbar to your TV, it is just horrible, oh my God. 8.2 gigs? Are you (beep)ing kidding me? I would even say you should spend less on your TV and make sure you have something other than your TVs built-in speakers for... 90 plus percent of people. While we're waiting for the update is actually a perfect time to show you guys what I mean about the full array local dimming. Because we've got this just, like, smooth, very neutral gray here, you can see the extra brightness in this area of the screen, right here. But when we fire up the game, I'm expecting it to be far less noticeable. Even the splash screen, you'd have a much harder time pointing out where the backlight is brighter versus darker. Give it a sec. I changed settings, so it just needs a second. Well, that's slightly less normal. We got the purple screen figured out, we have enabled HDMI 2.1 mode, and now we are good to go. Let's play some Forza! Oh yeah, and while you guys weren't looking, we got the surround speakers hooked up, too. This is an area where full array local dimming does show it's strength. When you've got something like black bars, 'cause those will look quite a lot more black compared to if you didn't have it. I love how it shows you racing lines, and I'm just like, \"nah, forget it.\" (laughs) Ahhh! (laughs) Now the truth is, you're not gonna get the same kinds of dazzling brights and deep blacks as you might out of one of VIZIO's other sets, one of the brighter ones with more local dimming zones, or one of their OLEDs. But, for like, you know, $1000 by the time you include the surround sound set-up? Man, it's very hard to complain. That's great, once we got the latest firmware and everything? (snaps fingers) HDR, variable refresh rate, everything's just working. Now obviously, without support for 120 hertz, you're not gonna be able to run games at 120 FPS and get the absolute lowest input leg, but support for variable refresh rate, and the fact that it's running at a nice, smooth 60 hertz means that it does feel very fluid. - [Andy] Can we speak to the camera? - I'm playing video games, Andy. (all laughing off camera) All right, you know what? I gotta go. That's it for this video. If you guys are looking for a TV with great, vibrant colors, then you can't go wrong with one with Quantum technology. And of course, you can learn more about this and VIZIO's higher end models at their Quantum Color Month feature at the link in the video description. Don't forget to subscribe to Short Circuit for more videos unboxing the latest and greatest technologies. Oh no. This brain-spider thing just killed me. I'm dead. Hope you guys like the new set! I sure do.",

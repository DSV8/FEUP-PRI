    "transcript": "- The deep breath thing, we're going to make it a thing. I think it's a great way to start a video. We all collectively take a deep breath. (airy music) Wow. What's up guys? Lew here back with another video, and today, I am showing you something outlandish. The box, not so outlandish, but inside, I am fairly certain we are going to look at something that will only be bought and consumed by a small number of people, the elite, the Donald Trumps of the world. Okay, maybe it's not that elite. In here is a one thousand dollar iPhone 6s case. One thousand dollars! Let's see what it's all about. Inside of this cardboard box is a couple of different things here. A little Ziploc bag with what looks like maybe some options, color options. Oh, sounds hard. Gray. Advent. Some weight there. Whoa. To our dear customer. That's me. \"The Advent was created to turn your fantasies \"into a reality.\" Do you hear that, Beans? (laughing) \"It is a case that redefines design and elegance. \"Each case goes through a time-consuming machining \"process where a solid block of aerospace Grade 5 \"titanium alloy is transformed into a being \"of such complexity and precision, \"inheriting the strength and lightweight properties \"of titanium.\" Oh my goodness gracious. Okay, so, you guys are serious. Oooh. I see my name engraved. A little cursive writing there. My name here right on the case itself. Holy smokes. Inside, the important components. Grade 5 titanium sounds quite serious. Actually lightweight. And then the other side of it. Ooo, it's numbered. Number 34 of 100. Like a fancy car, if you will. Watch the way this closes right here. Oh. Attention to detail, the extra touches. A little touch to the thigh when it counts. It's a family show, Jack. You know what, I think that, yeah, that makes sense. (funky music) Okay. I mean, eh. It definitely looks cool, and it's got your initials or your name engraved in it. So, yeah, but I gotta say, for a thousand bucks, a kinda wish that maybe the gasket portion was, like, right adhered onto the... Also, I'm not sure how confident I am in just having that friction fit on there. Nonetheless, this is such a low-volume product, like how many people are going to put a thousand dollar case on their iPhone? Donald Trump, he's your guy. So anyway, I guess you can swap out the colors, you could do different colors. You have a cutout for your headphone jack, your microphone speaker situation. There's still space in the middle for your lightning connector, and then cutouts, of course, for your volume, your lock switch and then your power button over here. This is going to protect your phone, for sure. It's elevated a little bit from the surface, and on the front, but my goodness. One thousand dollars for a case? I mean, this thing might need to make me breakfast for that kind of money. Maybe a waffle, Belgian style waffle, they put a little fruit on top of it, unbelievable. Okay, question for the audience: Waffle, pancake or French toast? You gotta choose one. For the rest of your life, you're done with the other two. You gotta stick to only one of those three. Let me know in the comments. In general, I'd probably go with French toast. I know it's weird, but... The Advent case, okay, it's for fancy people. I mean, you pull this baby out of your pocket you're all of a sudden an interesting fellow. The ladies, they see this case, they go, \"Oh my goodness. \"What's with Mr. Titanium over here?\" Tony Stark type dude. Definitely not Mr. Bean over here. (laughing) 'Cause this case says I got more money than I know what to do with. Just got back from Las Vegas. People were throwing money around like it's going out of style! Like they can't get rid of it fast enough. There's like green felt tables everywhere and machines that you pull a handle and you just pump money into them. Jack saw it! Well, this case is like a slot machine. It's about exclusivity. It's about belonging to a particular club. I'm here to be honest with you guys. You guys are my guys. That's the world we're living in here with this titanium enclosure for your already expensive phone. Life is weird. At least we're in it together. Take a deep breath. We out.",

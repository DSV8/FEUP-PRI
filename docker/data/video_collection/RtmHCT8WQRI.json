    "description": "Dave2D review of the Razer Mamba HyperFlux. Razer is setting the bar with their best wireless gaming mouse that charges itself on the mousepad. Razer Mamba HyperFlux -   Razers new HyperFlux Wireless Power Technology is a great step forward for gaming hardware. Gamers now have access to a wireless mouse that doesnt contain a battery for an smooth ultra-lightweight gaming experience. Having the Razer Mamba on a Firefly HyperFlux mousepad will keep it charged indefinitely with wireless power. The combination of a 16,000 DPI 5G optical sensor with swappable hard and soft mouse pad texture is awesome.

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here, so this is a Razer Mamba Hyper Flux This is their new wireless mouse that uses inductive charging to power this thing And I don't do mice reviews like this is not my thing on channels, but because I like this thing so much I thought I'd do a quick video about it. So this is literally the best gaming mouse that I've used so far ever and The thing that I like about it that makes it special is just how lightweight It is so what makes this different from other inductively charged wireless mice is the fact that there's no battery in this thing It's a completely Battery free device that has a capacitor which I don't think those are technically batteries But it does hold the charge through a capacitor, but because there's no heavy battery in there It's incredibly light and its really good for first-person shooter, so I like my mice really light and this thing fits the bill So I've used a lot of wireless mice before obviously and I've used Wireless mice that use conductive pad So I've used the Logitech they think they call it the power play, and I've also used the Corsair They call it the dart core thing is every single wireless mouse that have ever used that uses inductive charging has This weight to it, and I like weighted mice for like just work and just regular stuff But when it comes to playing games I absolutely love light my system comes in at 96 grams to put this in perspective there are Wireless mice out there that have I think like 120 150 gram weights. This is super lightweight and when you're playing a shooter It's just like it just moves around real quick real smooth completely wireless mouse it's just an awesome gaming experience now the way this thing works is you have a mat they call this the Firefly copper flux and You connect it to your computer, so this thing is actually wired But your mouse sits on top and through induction it charges the capacitor inside this mouse so the charge on this thing lasts about 20 seconds maybe 30 seconds it's not very long, but you basically always have it on the mat And when it's on the mouse mat it never runs out of power it basically uses the mat to sustain itself so you can kind Of keep using it for indefinitely now this thing can be used in a wired mode So you would unplug the cable from the mousepad and connect it directly into the mouse and it's just basically to give it some extra functionality if you want to travel with this thing like you wouldn't bring the Mousepad with you you just bring the mouse in the cable And it'll work the hyper flux mechanism to power everything actually feels pretty good. You feel reliable more reliable I thought like a wireless connection would feel, but yeah, I really like this system so this Matt It's reversible so you have two sides. I don't if you saw a video of mine earlier there was like a razer mousepad that had a flippable surface and both sides were hard surfaces this has a hard surface and a soft surface I prefer the soft kind of cloth feeling side but both materials are pretty good and the mat lights up So it's got RGB lighting. I think this is unique to this system like the power play and the dark core systems Don't light up like this, but it's 2018. It's a razer product You kind of expect that I mean would this even be a Razer product if it didn't light up an RGB um I don't think that the lights look Obnoxious or anything like that because at CES I was a little bit worried the demo booth was really dark and the lights were just like glowing Like crazy these are fully customizable in the software and you can control brightness and stuff so you can basically Light it up to your heart's content, or just keep it kind of muted. The mouse itself, so this is using the 3360 sensor It's a pretty popular sensor amongst high-end mice 16,000 dpi at the top-end, it's fully controllable, and it's a very responsive sensor a lot of people like it I personally find it extremely comfortable to hold it's definitely comfortable for palm grip users I can't speak for claw grippers because I'm not a natural claw gripper I feel like it would work, but I feel like there's better shape than this for claw grips I also like the rubber on the side I think this is something that a lot of the recent Razer mice have so this kind of horizontal pattern I just find it more comfortable to hold than the dotted pattern that my older SteelSeries 300 Mouse had The buttons are very razor ish I feel like most people are gonna like these buttons They're a little bit stiffer than the Death Adder buttons not as stiff as the SteelSeries Rival 300 ones They're very light, but not too light. Now there are some things I don't like and a lot of these dislikes stem from the fact that this is a very expensive mouse. It's $250 It's literally one of the most expensive mice. Maybe the most expensive - I've ever seen and Let's start with the first one I wish that the scroll wheel had some kind of tension Adjustment because we've seen that tech and some of razor's other mice It would have been nice to seen it in this. The other thing is I wish this thing had a weight adjustment So I understand that this whole thing is supposed to be a super lightweight Mouse that really is what defines this Mouse But for some people that prefer a heavier mouse it would have been nice that you could kind of increase the weight of this for people that I don't know for like MOBA players and stuff that do prefer heavier mice And they don't allow that so it kind of limits that customizability of this mouse But there's not that much else I dislike about this thing I wish it came in white obviously, but yeah It's a really slick Mouse and of all the gaming mouse that I've tried. This is seriously my favorite. That's $250 it's obviously not for everyone, but if you're on that hunt for that perfect gaming mouse That's got that performance of a wired mouse and the physical feel of a wired mouse But has that freedom of a wireless mouse check this thing out. It's awesome ok. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs of you loved it. See you guys next time",

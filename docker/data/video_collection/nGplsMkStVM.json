    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here A few months ago, I did a video on Helios 500. It was a Core i9 laptop, very powerful laptop that was properly cooled in this particular chassis. This is also a Helios 500, but it's running AMD hardware. So it's running AMD's Ryzen 7 2700 as well as AMD's Vega 56 GPU. So once again, very powerful components stacked into a chassis that has been proven to be very good at cooling things. And what makes this laptop special, what makes it different is that this is an 8-core CPU. All the stuff from Intel this year, on their mobile stuff, is 6 cores. So i7, i9, they're all 6-core CPUs. Great CPUs, this is an 8-core CPU. So if you're running something that's CPU-dependent, this is gonna give you better performance. Now, I wanted to take a look at this thing just because I've seen how good the CPU is in desktop applications. I've run this particular CPU on several desktops. Great performance for the money And they're running that exact CPU in here, 8 cores. So not that much else is different on this device compared to the Intel variant I reviewed previously. The screen is FreeSync-compatible, in case you have multiple FreeSync external monitors you want to plug it up to. But in terms of actual build quality, and keyboard, the trackpad, the battery size, all the stuff remains the same, it's just the CPU and the GPU that have been changed. So let's talk about the CPU first. The 8-core Ryzen 7 2700 is a beast. It's literally the most powerful multi-core CPU that's available on a laptop right now. I mean maybe, there might be some custom-built like, 18-core laptop out there But in terms of commercially available ones, this is the most powerful one I've seen. The overclocking software from AMD works on the CPU and because it's a well-cooled chassis, we can take advantage of it. I may be able to get decent overclocking on this laptop but, nothing crazy. So in desktops, I've been able to hit 4GHz on each core Not without difficulty, but it is doable. This laptop lets me hit 3.7GHz on every core, which is really respectable considering what this is. Now, you can disable cores if you want to run 4 for games and stuff like that, but for what I was trying to do, I want to see how good this thing was for multi-core applications. So, I ran this in Cinebench and I got the highest score I've ever seen in a laptop It's same in video renders. In Premiere, this thing's pushing out significantly faster render times than an i7 or an i9. Those 2 extra cores really make a difference. The GPU in here is AMD's Radeon Vega 56 and it's also a very powerful card. I would say it's very similar in performance to a GTX 1070. Depending on a title, some games will do better or worse. I find that DirectX 12 games tend to do better on an AMD card. The gaming performance on the AMD variant of the Helios 500 is good, but I wouldn't say that it's better than the Intel version. So, if you're trying to decide whether to get this one or i9 version, like if you're in that fortune position where you're kinda deciding between the two, it really depends what you're going for. If you're just playing games and that's all you're getting this laptop for, I'd probably lean more towards the i9 and the GTX 1070 variant. That's a very powerful system, this system is more geared towards people that are content creators, like if you're a video editor, or you deal with 3D work, like 3D modeling, or game development, the 2 extra cores in the Ryzen system is gonna give you better performance than the Intel system. And that's basically what this thing is, an absolute beast for multi-core applications. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time!",

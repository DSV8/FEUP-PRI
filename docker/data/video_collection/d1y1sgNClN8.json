    "transcript": "Hey Siri Wow wowie hey while we you guys Are new here I say while we all the time And I am going to present blame my friend Edie for saying it once and then me Laughing really hard about it and now we Say well we all the time now that I've Calmed down from the Siri while we I just wanted to make a follow-up video to Sum the home pod videos that I made Because I made a lot of them I made a bunch I made an unboxing I did a review Basically showing the features of the home pod but this was before I really Spent much time with it having spent at Least a week with the home pod I will Say it sounds absolutely incredible that is something that no one can deny I listen to a lot of music all day long when I'm working editing doing whatever I always have music playing securely Judging this thing as a speaker and a Music playing device it is beyond Fantastic one of the things that I think People are comparing this a lot to is so Knows because Sonos has really great Sound qualities I have so no speakers All throughout my house in every room I have one speaker whether it's a very Small one or in the kitchen I have a Very large one that produces a lot more Sound it's one of their newer ones I Don't have any of the Alexa powered Soto's though all the ones that I have Are from the past few years the mass Appeal for me of the Sonos is playing Them and never seen the room and right Now this little guy is not capable of That and that is a huge huge letdown I Bought a few of them this is the most Recent purchase I got to this space gray One so that would match my Space Gray iMac obviously in my IMAX setup video I Hadn't got this one yes so I was still Using the white one but this definitely Fits with the desk aesthetic much more but all those things aside what has it been like spending a week with the home Pod since then I've had a home 5 party And I've spent plenty of time with a Home pod I've also converted my entire House over to everything home kit Whereas before I would specifically use The hue app but now everything is voice Enabled through Siri I turn my lights on Off I've enabled routines when I come Home or I leave so certain lights will Turn on I have motion activity so now Everything is integrated with home kit Where this falls flat it's very very sad For me because I really do love this Thing a lot especially being an Apple Fan this just fits into my entire Apple Ecosystem And of course you guys know I'm a huge Apple fan so yes I'm slightly biased but What I'm not biased about is my love of Sonos I have a loved Sonos for so long They sound great but the sound quality in comparison of this to some of their Smaller speakers this definitely is much Better quality well that being said These sono speakers are less expensive You can also get two of the Alexa Powered so no speakers for the same Price as this guy but this looks so Incredible and yes it is Siri in abled But no it is not as smart as Alexa or Google and that is the real unfortunate Reality but the thing is all of those things are software updates so easily This can have the potential to be the next Alexa or the next Google home but Right now in its current state those two Are still far superior they've also been Around a lot longer but Siri has also Been around for quite a while I still feel like Siri has not unlocked her full Potential but again it's a software update so now the ball is in Apple's Court Let's get Siri to the level of Alexa and Google and then we're talking this did Not ship with his full capabilities Without airplay - you're not able to Play in different rooms you're not able To sync them all up together I wanted to Have one in every room I really wanted This to be a Sony's replacement but Right now it can't be because I cannot Play music all throughout my house at The same time that's not going to be available until airplay - so that should be later sometime this year and you also aren't able to do stereo speakers so if You want to do surround sound and have Two of these set up in front of your TV And watch a movie on Apple TV because That's the only way that you can use them if only there was a way to sync This to your television with an optical Cable like there is for the Sonos of the Sound bar that would be really really Awesome so the reality is the home pot is not as smart as Alexa or Google but the good news is she definitely has the Potential to be these things are easily Updated with software so now it's Basically just apples choice thanks Alexa another thing that I feel like my Homepod and my Apple music it's well It's not a bad thing but I feel like I bought a lot of music around 2002 my Apple music tends to supply me with a lot of music from like the early 2000s hey Siri play me some music here's a personal Oh station built just for you let's kick things off with some Third Eye Blind Every time look I mean I still AM like a Huge Third Eye Blind fan hey Siri stop Playing but it's so crazy because it's Still definitely favours music that I've purchased over music that I've recently streamed using Apple music so I've been Doing a lot of work kind of retraining Apple music to like my interests now so I didn't start really using Apple music Until I got a car the supported apple Carplay so before that I've just been using Spotify because I had so many Great Spotify playlists that I didn't Want to completely convert over so now I Think that I'm using Apple music more Than Spotify mostly because I do drive a lot so I tend to be talking to Siri a Lot in my car so because of that Apple music has slowly taken over Spotify but I'm still I absolutely love Spotify and Another thing that a lot of people are Complaining about is you're not able to Use third-party music apps with this so You can but it has to be playing on your Phone so essentially if you want to listen to Spotify you have to airplay it to your home pod from there you can Still get some sort of smart commands You can ask for specific questions if it is in the database live what's this song When was this long release play another Song on this album so those types of Things still sort of will work depending Upon what app you're using but my Over all thoughts of having spent plenty Of time with this over the past I guess at this point maybe a week and a half Almost two weeks I'm definitely looking Forward to the airplay to update so I'll Be able to play stereo music I'll be Able to play music in all of my rooms But right now I just have one in my Office one in my kitchen and one in my living room I was thinking about getting them for surround sound for my TV but I Probably won't because I already have The Soto sound bar integrated into my Televisions so I would love to have them There but since I can't really use them We're just watching normal TV you can Only use it while you're watching Apple TV I feel like they would get more use other places in the house so I think a Lot of people may be on the fence if they want to buy a homepod or not and I Think if you're looking to get one now I Would say do it if you're looking to get More than one I would say potentially Wait until airplay 2 is out unless you just want to get them anyway and just Wait patiently for it to actually be Unlocked to its full potential but until then I will be the one waiting patiently but know this will not be replacing my Alexa anytime soon I feel like there's So much that I have integrated into Alexa that she is just sort of another addition to my smartphone essentially so I hope you're having fun with me are you Having fun with me so far Hmm that's something I don't know Oh No come on girl calling me hanging in front All my friends play me some music okay let's press play starting with paper shoes by Incubus what was the song released paper shoes by Incubus came out on November 22nd 2006 it's not playing I also haven't Noticed the white ring happening because I don't really have a lot of wood services in my house I don't know if any of you guys have experienced that let me know in the comments below if you have molted my services are either mirrored reflective or this just like a white lacquer so I have not run into that at all yet that's also kind of an unfortunate thing and I feel like Apple's response was a very Apple response like respond they're like well just don't put it on a wood surface so I Guess don't put it on a wood surface all Things considered I really like the home pod and I'm not just saying that because I'm a huge Apple fan girl I love small compact speakers this looks good any Room it matches my setup perfectly as far as Siri being smarter yeah it's definitely a possibility there's a lot Of things that she is lacking in comparison to Alexa and google home but Again is a software update so fingers crossed that all of these things happen very very quickly well thank you guys for watching I would love to hear you Guys thoughts I know you have a lot of Thoughts because I've been hearing them Quite often on Twitter I will see you Guys in my next video let me know if you have any suggestions for things you would like to see here and if you're not subscribed already subscribe and if you feel like it if not it does really matter cuz I don't feel like YouTube subscriptions really should make a difference anymore see you later my little girl hey Siri do you like to Be picked up this is about you not me it is actually{ unreflecting because I do Not like to be picked up okay hey Siri I Oh okay No go by for me no go back for you

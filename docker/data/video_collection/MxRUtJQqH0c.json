    "transcript": "hi my name's Gary. No, that's not true. I'm just trying to hide my identity because I'm ashamed of my terrible impulse control. For example, I spent most of my budget on this fancy PS5 and doing terrible things to it with a bunch of crap off of AliExpress... but now I need a living room setup to go around it and considering that it's been Black Friday for the last 17 years, instead of buying a bunch of used stuff like I probably should, I decided to buy the cheapest thing in every category from Amazon. Sure, this will go well. but first today's video is sponsored by be quiet's new dark Rock Pro 5 or if you're feeling real elite the dark Rock Elite both coolers are rated for over 250 wats of TDP come with easy installation and you can even slip the middle fan in which I really like both coolers also come with excellent Ram clearance for such ginormous beings and with the elite you get just a splash of tasteful RGB check out the beire dark Rock Pro 5 and Elite using the link in the video description so apparently this is everything I bought which I find difficult to believe considering that there's supposed to be multiple pieces of furniture in this box not including the tea so um I'm not sure how they fit it all in here but I guess we'll find out soon enough now I'm going to start with this box cuz it's the only one I can imagine them possibly stuffing a TV bench in wait a minute this is like the the couch thing where's the TV bench does that mean it's in here it very much wasn't now I'm assuming the TV bench definitely isn't in here so I I probably forgot to bring it give me a second okay okay that makes a lot of sense there was a box missing wow it's a good thing we have that super flimsy foam in here so that it didn't damage our beautiful counter top oh they forgot to also put thin vinyl on the bottom of the panels but I guess you only look at the top right uh it's so dirty it's a good thing no one spent a whole bunch of time vacuuming in preparation for this video like what is this material even it just keeps rematerializing I can't get rid of it ooh I don't think having weightbearing metel plastic in a TV bench is a grain idea wow that is some quality right there and then I think the middle one goes on like that sturdy and all of this Primo quality can be had for as little as7 Canadian dollars on Black Friday which for what this is I feel like is still too much especially considering that there are several used options in my area that include a TV for almost half as much which on the note of TV now the TV I got is this 32 in high sense thing which despite being a smart TV so it can do our taxes for us or whatever has a couple of pretty big problems with it for our PS5 gaming setup the first is that it's got a max resolution of 720p I didn't know they even still made 720p TVs and it makes it a better pairing for like a PS3 than a PS5 and despite bragging on the Box about having 120 motion rate this is still a 60 HZ TV it can't actually show 120 frames a second it can just kind of guess the frames in between and then just completely ruin the motion rendering but let's open it up and have a look maybe it's way better than its specs suggest so in here we get a remote and two little footies oh yeah that's looking good oh no way it's still got analog video in which honestly kind of makes this a viable option if you have like a PS2 lying around that you want to use cuz you'd be able to plug it straight into your TV other than that we've just got some TV holes cool and this beauty that's more reflective than a teenager's acne riddled forehead cost about $160 Canadian dollars which is really not very much for a TV for audio duties I got this too 1 two channel sound bar that cost a whopping 55 Canadian dollars accessory wise we get a little wallwart this Savage dual RCA to 3.5mm cable the thinnest optical cable I have ever seen we also get a remote for it so our remote clutter is building up nicely and finally we get a couple of screws with Fisher plugs so we can mount it to a wall if we need to oh it's actually sturdier feeling than I was expecting ooh you can see the drivers through the grill so I think how this works is that we have a single driver uh for each Channel and then that is a passive Radiator on the back we've got USB Optical and Orcs which is pretty complete you can plug a bunch of stuff into this it's even got physical buttons on the side for when you lose the remote and then it's got little rubber footies as well so that it doesn't move around on the table uh but that doesn't take into account that the table is the one doing the moving around having not heard it yet surprisingly this seems the most promising thing so far which became doubly true when I saw the next thing next we need some comfy seating for our gaming setup so I bought the cheapest thing resembling a lounge chair I guess ah whoa It's So staticy um I I think you kind of oh you can sit on that I guess there's I I don't think there's anything else really to say about it this magnificent piece of seating equipment cost $62 Canadian dollars which again somehow feels like way too much money for it and finally I got a bunch of miscellaneous gaming related accessories like this neon Sunset I think these are real hot right now and it's got a very promising looking wall mount I got some gaming thumb sticks so that are thumbs can game a bit better I guess and then what is a gaming setup without RGB so I got this star projector to give us some nice gaming Ambiance wow it's it's even got a speaker in it which is terrifying I hope that it doesn't make a bunch of noise to distract us from our gaming but with that I can't contain my urge to game anymore so let's set it all up so we can get going wow that's a terrible implementation that clearly should have been a straight cable um I I think that's as straight as we can get the sunset they didn't take into account the weight of the the cable on the side they just have to ruin the product somehow don't they oh and another problem is that it comes with USB power but it didn't come with a wall wart neither did the The Starry Night Thing so um I'm going to have to cheat a little bit with the RGB and use my own that thing is so dumb oh my word Cable Management situation is definitely not great so I'm just going to kind of do that first things first I do want to try out this seat cuz I think this is the best part of our setup it does actually hold you up which is more than I was expecting uh but I I'm very much sitting on the floor next before we turn the TV on I want to see what the lights do uh so I think I'm going to turn off my lights so that we give it the maximum ability to to impress us oh ah why why did that turn this one on oh okay there we go that one actually looks quite nice I mean if it was straight it would look it would look a lot better but um yeah it's it's got a nice soft glow to it and then this does does that let's sit back and Marvel at it I was clearly impressed oh maybe I need to turn the other light off but even with no other lights on in the room I felt like I could get more out of the starry night so I moved its position to behind me which made a pretty big difference okay so with it on the table behind it it does look a lot better you can see that we've got some some Galaxy action happening it's quite a nice Ambiance for some gaming I'm really excited to try out our new gaming setup I don't know if any of this is going to look okay I've had to make it really dark in here because the the TV is wildly reflective I have to be very careful with where I put lights it's a reasonable remote you've got a whole bunch of shortcuts to various Smart TV things you might want to do it's not turning on I think the Soundbar is yeah the Soundbar is very much in the way so I can't use this much and after spending ages in this very comfortable position setting up the TV we're going to game with it in standard settings first wow my arm's getting tired I was ready for some gaming w the TV's black levels are really good I think this is a VA panel which if you've watched any of my videos you'll know that means I'm probably going to have a real bad time gaming on it oh yeah no oh no ooh this is like headache inducing stuff Happening Here the soundar I don't think makes any base at all like nothing under 200 HZ is being produced by it uh but like it's it's relatively clean sound like I I think compared to the TV so that's cool you know it's it's better than the TV for 55 Canadian dollars although in all fairness it's kind of like being more pleasant than having the Bubonic plague that's not really a high bar to clear the TV on the other hand has quite vibrant colors and deep black levels which I think would make it pretty good for TV watching if you're far enough away from it measurement wise the TV does better than I was expecting I guess although there are a couple of issues with it like the color accuracy gets a bit wonky when it's not displaying Shades of Gray and its Max brightness is really not very good partially because anywhere above 50% brightness the TV just reduces the contrast for some reason it doesn't get any brighter the image just gets all flat and terrible looking and that combined with its shockingly reflective finish means you can basically just use this TV in a cave on the Dark Side of the Moon but I'd argue that gaming is where it's the least comfortable ooh that input lag and motion rendering motion blur zero no way that that is what it looks like with no motion blur on oh oh no yeah I then turned on instant game response mode which made a big difference to the input lag that has significantly improved the input lag I can actually feel that but in all of the modes any movement just feels like the TV's throwing placenta in your eyes I just realized there are little pads on the joysticks and I feel like if anything they are uncomfortable because they lift your finger higher off the controller than you're used to and then it just feels like you're gaming on a mountain yo modern gaming man all you do is wait for crap to update a 12 gig update and while waiting for the fourth update of the day like a real professional I decided to update you on the ergonomics of the chair the chair is fine it it really feels like you're just sitting on the floor but something is supporting your lower back that's pretty much the only difference between it being there and not so after my chair rambling I decided to play some disco alysian while waiting for gt7 to finish downloading and aside from apparently the game making me real frowny the gaming experience was fine although I will say when it comes to like mumbly speech that Soundbar really struggles with intelligibility In fairness I find that's a very difficult thing for audio gear to do well especially at lower volumes so I can't be too hard on it in that case uh and again with gt7 I just kept thinking like it's difficult for me to be very critical of like the TV and the Soundbar because if you're shopping in this price point it's because you just need a TV or a soundbar you're looking for something purely functional and at the end of the day TV is better than not TV if it's a thing that you can play games on you can have fun with it it may not be an OLED TV TV but it's not like we're choosing between this or an OLED we're choosing between this and not having a TV but at this price point if used is at all an option for you that is the way to go the furniture on the other hand is a great example of how a cheap thing can be terrible value for money you get so little for what you pay for I just I don't know why anybody would buy furniture off of Amazon you're way better off just wandering the streets in your local city looking for stuff people left out on their sidewalk because if you go on to Amazon to buy stuff that's what you're getting is that is that what you want that's not good it really isn't which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching if you enjoyed it subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one and until the next video bye-bye",

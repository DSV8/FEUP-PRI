    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin'? Vinyl records have seen a major resurgence in popularity, and with many people getting into 'em for the first time, there are a lot of options for turntables. This time, we'll take a look at one that promises modern convenience and connectivity for a decidedly analog format. [ Music - Intro ] This is the Audio-Technica AT-LP60-BT. As far as turntables go, it has a simple, understated design. Its platter is belt-driven, and as you'd expect, it supports both 33 and 45 RPM records. The dust cover is included and fits well. Operation is very simple. This is a fully automatic turntable, meaning you only need to put a record on the platter and press start. It'll start spinning and the tonearm will move itself to beginning of the record. Likewise, when the stylus reaches the run-out groove at the end, it'll put itself back in its resting position. That tonearm comes fully set up with the cartridge already installed. There's no balancing or weight adjustment necessary. To get sound out of that stylus, there's an analog audio jack on the back side, and the turntable has a built-in phono preamp. This is pretty important, since most stereo systems and powered speakers these days, otherwise lack dedicated phono inputs. But the big feature on this turntable is its built-in Bluetooth connection. You can pair it to headphones or wireless speakers, which gives you a lot of flexibility. And the sound quality is quite good. The analog connection is of course, going to sound a bit better than Bluetooth, but overall, I found records to sound full and warm, like you'd expect from vinyl. though the highs can be a little sibilant at times. There are a few drawbacks to the LP60 though. First, while the included stylus works well, there aren't many options for upgrades. Second, the analog audio out is a 3.5 millimeter mini jack, instead of the more traditional RCA jacks. Finally, but most notably, the Bluetooth connection is hit-and-miss when it comes to compatibility. I had no problem pairing the turntable to my Sony wireless headphones or two different Bluetooth speakers, but there are a lot of reports and online reviews about products this turntable seemingly just won't pair with. It may appear counterproductive or even a little silly to use Bluetooth to listen to records, but this turntable is all about convenience. It's super easy to use, which makes it friendly to those who are just getting into vinyl. There just aren't any adjustments to have to worry about. That said, it's probably not the best option for audiophiles. The sound quality is good for casual listening, but the limited stylus options really don't give much room for improvement. I paid $150 US for this model with Bluetooth, but there's an analog-only version available for $90. At those prices, I think you get pretty solid value for the money, despite the drawbacks and compatibility concerns. So, if you're new to vinyl or just looking for a turntable that doesn't require fussing over, the Audio-Technica LP60-BT is probably worth... a spin. If you like the video, I'd appreciate a thumbs-up and be sure to subscribe. You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram at thisdoesnotcomp, and as always, thanks for watching.",

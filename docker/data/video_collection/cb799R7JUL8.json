    "transcript": "- You've been watching a lot of tech news lately, and frankly, I'm impressed. Promote this person, Fire Colton. The world is incredibly divided over what the heck should be done about NFTs, but Twitter thinks they know the answer. The social platform just announced official NFT profile pictures, a feature that will allow users to link their crypto wallet to prove they actually own the JPEG in their profile photo. So, suck it right clickers. (all laughs) The feature will be available to Twitter Blue subscribers. I mean, these people are all about status anyway, so. Meaning you can now pay $3 a month to prove that you paid for a token that proves you own a JPEG. - [Man] Finally. - If you're on the anti side of the issue, the better tweet deck browser extension just added an option to automatically mute every account that uses the official NFT feature. Oh my God! People care that much. Now, if only there was a way to automatically identify scam links, to fake NFT discord servers, where so many people are shoveling their money into hacker's hands. Look, the risk is worth the thrill baby. You gotta break a few eggs... - [Man] I mean, those apes look excited. (mimics ape sound) - Erected apes. Google has announced the users of the now deprecated G suite service, which offered the ability to have a custom email domain instead of @gmail.com will now have to pay for a modern Google workspace account or their old account will be shut down. See you later. Sayonara. (giggles) Google stopped offering free G suite accounts in 2012. You probably weren't even born yet, but I guess it's 10 years later and Google is hunting for cash. Yeah, the nine-year-old demographic is huge for tech link. They're in a bad place right now. You could use Google takeout to export your data to a regular old consumer account, but not everything can be perfectly carried over On May 1st your account will be suspended and then deleted after 60 days, unless you upgrade to workspace. That's a capital W workspace. It sounds kind of threatening. It's a hostile workspace environment, if I'm being honest, - [Man] We have Google. Google's not, they're not Apple. Maybe you get some more money. - And today Intel unveiled plans to start construction of a $20 billion chip making plant on a 1000 acre site in New Albany, Ohio USA, - [Man] Represent. - It will be the company's third plant in the US joining a proposed $100 billion mega fab, which is less than a Giga factory, obviously in Europe. That's where a bunch of different fabs connect to each other to form a giant robot. - [Man] For mega fab. And then they have a sword. Full fab comes in, it's great. - Mega is one of my favorite type of Zuora Intel also revealed some details about it's ultra low voltage energy, efficient Bitcoin mining ACEC code named Bonanza mind. It's a mining Bonanza. There's some disagreement over Intel's a numbers here, but the goal appears to be, to reduce the power requirements of mining Bitcoin so that it doesn't drain our oceans and trigger all the volcanoes. I think that's what people are worried about. - [Man] Awakening a giant. Using a lot of power is a security feature, not a bug. - [Man] That's very true. I'm with you. - It is. Now's time for the quick bits brought to you by Vessie footwear maker of shoes that are lightweight, easy to pack comfort waterproof on my feet. And also, oh, you wrote that, on my feet right now.

So save 25 bucks with our offer code techlinked at Vessi.com/tacklinked And Vessi, I can do this all day. It's the song that never I feel the quick bits, I feel the quick bits babe (beatbox mimics) It is the weekend. Google again has officially launched the beta for Google play games on PC, which sounds like Google is a defrosted caveman being introduced to video games, - [Man] Google play games on PC. (both laughing) - Google smash game stadia suck, but it's actually a windows app though that PCs uses to play Android games, which is cool. It's only available in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong to start. So you have to wait before you can turn your monitor and show off your \"Asphalt\" high score to your friend. I'm sorry. I don't know why we want this. And yet more Google news company insiders apparently told the verge that the tech giant is ramping up, work on its AR headset for release sometime in 2024, which is apparently when we'll be able to buy GPU's again. It's code named project Iris, and instead of being a little of crystal thingy, hanging off your glasses, this headset reportedly looks more like a pair of ski goggles, Google goggles baby, goggle googles. I can see this taking off. Xbox had Phil Spencer tweeted that he had a good phone call with PlayStation. Hello, this is PlayStation, where he expressed a desire to keep \"Call of Duty\" on Sony's console in an attempt to assuage gamer's, fears of Activision Blizzard properties becoming Xbox exclusives. But he said pretty similar things about Bethesda's games when Microsoft bought them and look what happened. Xbox game pass became super awesome. That's what happened. PlayStation people, you have \"Spider-Man\" and \"God of War\" and stuff. Stop freaking out. Also regulators won't let them make these all exclusive 'cause then they'll get broken up. He's not a nice man. He just doesn't wanna get regular. - [Man] Phil Spencer? He loves you. - He seems nice, but I have a bone to pick with Phil from our past. Arctic has issued a soft recall of its MX five thermal based after reports of oil in some tubes settling, which is unsettling because it can result in degraded performance. But the company is relying on customers to identify faulty product rather than releasing batch numbers so customers can identify whether they got bad paste before they put it on their chips. Bad paste, more like bad taste. That's what this is in. Do not eat this stuff. - [Man] It's not healthy. - How expensive could this crap be? Just send people free stuff. It's not a car. - Whether is it in tea at least. - There's such an NFPS. Have you heard of NFDS? NFDSs noo. (beep) And security company McAfee, which merged with Fire Eye last fall has announced a company rebrand. The amalgamated cyber security giant will now be known as Krehlik indomitable slayer of malware incorporated. Wait, is this a joke? - [Man] Nah its not - This is not a joke. - [Man] Just Trellix. - Trellix, the anointed one. It's unclear whether changing the name will make the company software easier to uninstall, in which case who cares. - [Man] That's what we care about. Can I destroy it. - And you're out. - [Man] With a portion. - I care whether you come back on Monday for more tech news, because I care about your success. I truly believe you can do anything you put your mind to like watching our next episode. Go you. (man cheering) Our next episode's in NFT. (both giggle)",

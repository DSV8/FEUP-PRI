    "transcript": "Hollywood has been using tech in movies since the computer was first invented, and they've been getting it wrong for just as long. And just like The Corridor crew, when we see IT mistakes in movies, it's pretty hard to overlook and focus on the rest of the story. Which is why we were here at Computex and we invited Wendell from Level One Techs to help take a look and break down some scenes from TV shows and movies to see what they got wrong. But maybe also some stuff they got right. I was wandering outside and they brought me in. That is actually true. And we also brought in this message from our sponsor. You Green, their Nexode X 160 watt charger is smaller than the original Nexode and comes equipped with four charging ports. Bring your 16 inch MacBook Pro from zero to 50% in just 27 minutes with its 140 watt USB-C port. Check it out in the description below. Starting with the TV show \"Bones\" in season seven, episode six, their computer gets hacked because someone accidentally uploaded a virus by scanning a skeleton. Let's watch. Once we scan the bones, the computer can predict scenarios consistent with the damage. Yeah. Now, please silence. Now that's realistic, especially these days. Okay, now the computer should tell us what caused the internal injuries. A gunshot? There's a bullet, yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not even into the computer stuff yet. And that is straight up not how that would work. It's not even pointing at a bone. Okay. They fire under the rib cage. I'm sorry, was it a shotgun? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what just happened? I think I smell something. System failure. I smell something. Oh, wow. Oh no. Yeah, the computer wouldn't catch on fire. Even if the cooling failed catastrophically, it wouldn't catch on. Sometimes the wires will catch on fire, but that would be at the back. Yeah, you can get little like spot burns. Now there is a product that is specifically designed with a kill switch that is supposed to heat up the circuits and destroy them. A lot of the flight data stuff in classified airplanes also have explosives. So you just pull the thing and it's like a thermite and it just (whooshes) and then it's gone. But it would have to be designed for that. Also, that first flame was about as convincing as when we did our April Fools video where I said our server room was on fire. So it turned out the malware killed our fans. They're supposed to turn on when the CPU reaches 75 degrees, but the malware added a zero and made it 750. How did this malware get past our fire? It doesn't go past 255, sorry. Okay, for everyone who gets that, that's hilarious. It doesn't catch fire immediately. What? It would slow down or turn off. It's also weird because like you wouldn't, unless the program is badly written and your adversary knows exactly the software that you're using and the version, you could do this with like a buffer overflow. So like the data is parsed as commands instead of data. But most of the time when you're scanning something, it's just going to be data. I feel like by giving it that thorough of a debunking, you're almost respecting it too much. Even if what he said wasn't true. There isn't a processor on Earth that would manage to heat up that fast, even if you turned the fans off. \"It originated in my computer.\" \"Wait, but it wouldn't have gotten in there unless you had downloaded something.\" \"Yeah, or uploaded.\" \"All you uploaded were the scans of those bones.\" \"Are you telling me that there's a computer virus in the bones?\" The computer virus is in the bones. Imagine you had like a CT scan, and you have a malformed CT scan file, and you give it to your hospital, and they parse that, and then it turns into a virus. That's kind of what happens with PDFs or anything in your emails, like you get a malformed PDF, you're not running a PDF thing, and it takes over your computer. Looking at a PDF should be a perfectly safe operation, but it takes over and does stuff. So that part is the least unrealistic part, and it's really a stretch. And no two scans are likely to be exactly identical, because that's largely an analog process. Again, I think you're respecting it far too much. Also, what was the point of that? Just to light their computer on fire? A Molotov cocktail would get you there a lot faster and a lot cheaper. Anything promising? It's hard to say. All the documents were photographed during Chinese. We've got his hard drives, scans of everything in this. Now hold on just a moment here. This is disappointing, because like... Some of the stuff is like, there's artistic creative license, you know, maybe they scan the bones, whatever. That could have been a bomb. This is just... they didn't Google it. Does that even have chain of custody? Again, respecting it far too much. Now just a minute, we've got his hard drives. For one thing, that is one hard drive. For another thing, really? You couldn't afford any more than a doorstop power supply from the P3 era? Is that a 20-pin connector? Yep, yeah, that's like a 300 watt power supply. You will have plenty of stuff to go through in the morning. He has so many questions. He's like, \"That's not a hard drive.\" I haven't talked about this much, but Luke and I actually did a little bit of unpaid consulting on a high tech script for some medium. Don't worry about the details because I'm pretty sure I'm under NDA. But speaking from that experience, if I had to guess how these things happen, I would say it's not because nobody knew better. It's not because a tech expert wasn't hired to come in and tell them something different. But because they actually made a conscious decision to not f*cking care. Or the, or they did it too late. Like there were some changes that we had suggested that were like, \"Well, we can't do it now.\" I think they could have sourced an e-waste hard drive instead of an e-waste power supply. System breach. Here we go. Firewall 1. We got a problem. This is from Castle. Someone's synced a rat to one of my servers, a remote access tool. We're being hacked. First of all, it's remote access Trojan. Like is it the more firewalls I have, the more safe I am? No, it's like Swiss cheese defense, right? All the firewalls have minor vulnerabilities, and you just have a variety of them the whole way through. Yeah, that's the Battlestar Galactica model. I love the percentage to breach thing. I love that they have this tool where they're like, we know we suck. Let's make sure that we can measure exactly how screwed we are. Yeah, what's the morale of the team that develops that? Breached in red. I mean, if you could figure this out, it would be great, because as soon as firewall one hits breached, you just... message the backup battery and be like, \"Hey, you need to turn off right now,\" and it turns off. Yeah. No, that would be too sensible. And look, I know that this is probably gonna be the most pedantic nitpick of all, but that's not how you spell \"synced.\" I'll start an intrusion inspection and find out who our rat is. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hieroglyphs? Uh oh. Hold on, you don't decrypt a firewall. No. Firewall number four. He's stopped respecting them too much. His brain's broken! Yeah, it's not, this is terrible. View options, yes, no. View options, yes, no. Coming from inside the city, trying to narrow it down. Okay. What even is this? It's supposed to be narrowing down. Which is funny, because how this circle works... They already know, theoretically, that it's in the middle. I can ping a friend that's three states away. He has a lower ping than my neighbor across the street. So this is like, \"Oh, let's figure out how far away it is.\" It doesn't always work like this. Yeah. Type, faster. Oh my god, this scene is like three minutes long. Starting counter straight! That barely slowed him down. I'm sorry, but he's gonna find us in less than a minute. Should we abort? No, we've only got two of the blinky boxes left to kill. I like that. That's good. Come on. Got it. Exact address. That's Castle's office. He must be working with Hayley. She's got the skill set for this, and she is about to breach our firewall. If she does, they'll have instant access to our entire investigation. Turn it off. No, they won't. Okay, tell me this. You have breached the URL of Apple.com. Do you have instant access to all of the data that's on it? No. No. No. If all of it's public. Dell's public suffering lately with that though. They did exfiltrate a lot of data to do with the customer orders and names and... But it would take time. Yes. And if they were, if Dell was literally sitting there... preventively anti-hacking. Yeah. No, in fact they would not have access to everything Launch a cyber nuke, but it'll completely fight a cyber nuke What is this interface? Why do they have this interface? But they don't have the ability to shut off the power Oh, what just happened? We got cyber news. Armageddon, I'm afraid. It doesn't work that way. You don't just have like digital ICBMs? I mean, I assume that what's supposed to happen there is like you can trick the person attacking you into running some executable code and it wipes something, but it doesn't work that way. Someone hacked a curtain ad on the scroll MD site. Looks like a normal ad, right? And this is the code for the ad. But peekaboo, there's actually two codes written right on top of each other. Okay, we were doing really good. Surprisingly good. For a bit there. I was convinced this was quite solid. That was actually really cool, like, and pretty realistic, injecting a malicious redirect into some kind of seemingly real advertisement. Especially a pharmacy where you'd collect a lot of personal information and valuable personal information about people. Maybe that guy was just thinking his coworkers are morons and is using that to explain it and it's like okay This code actually injects this other code. It's not like Code on top of another code. I'm convinced that dude wants to claim that he has like two weeks to a month of work And he's gonna do it in like four hours. Now that sounds realistic The target had to breach the scrollmd service to inject this code. It's not true. Actually You could just exploit a kind of delivery network. This happens all the time. Yeah He's operating almost entirely on the surface web where he can reach millions of every day since we'll take on the surface web What the fuck is the surface web? Well as opposed to like the dark web I get it better script dialogue for that would have been it's like they're you're Utilizing like public ad networks and they're flying under the radar of public ad networks. Yeah, are you you should do this? Are you auditioning for your next career move? Consulting for Hollywood They won't listen to you. No. 218 gone. No. What? I mean if it's a pharmacy website there's probably tens of I mean just bot traffic is gonna be tens of thousands of IPs but look at the IPs 164.387 it'll never be more than 255 on any number. Whoopsie doodles. No that might be on purpose just cause like you can accidentally have an IP address in there and it's like oh look it's Bing. Yeah but that's a whole thing. Like there's reserved IP ranges for kind of like 555 555 555. There's fake IPs. So they could just use those if they actually knew. Yeah, they need like a whole ocean of them and these all look like they broke that rule. Yeah, none of these are can be real IPs. Oh, like any of them are. Maybe it was on purpose then. Let's give them that one. And their whole narrowing exercise doesn't work at all because the guy working in the mailroom and the executive would actually have the same public facing IP. Likely, yeah. God, you're kidding me. Target's using an IR LED array. This license plate unreadable, the cameras off our tires. That's real. Okay. Yes. That's actually kind of cool. Oh, and like that and the whole, none of those IPs would be working. So like there's, there's, you know, traces in here. All four tires give up the two signals for poor when they're low on pressure. What are you thinking? I don't know. Bluetooth. Bluetooth. No, they really don't. Yeah, that would be done over low frequency signal. Yeah, that's not even a little bit Bluetooth. There is something really wild that's happening with self-driving cars, and that is the standard for aircraft, like the aircraft-to-aircraft communication has been co-opted and modified slightly for car-to-car communication. So a lot of smart cars are emitting tons of radio and can be uniquely identified. If you drive a Tesla, your Tesla can be fingerprinted and tracked without a license plate. Now Wendell, this is something I legitimately don't know. Would a Bluetooth device have a MAC address? Yes. Okay, okay. I've never looked up the MAC address of my Bluetooth device. Well Apple actually has been worried about this for a long time, so they've been doing MAC randomization and Android got that feature later. So when you connect to a public Wi-Fi, actually I used to work on a project for a very large commercial entity where we were doing Bluetooth beacon tracking and you could track somebody moving through a commercial store like Marshall's or something like that. And it's like, \"Oh, the same people are coming back. We don't know who they are, but they're probably somebody that bought something.\" Oh yeah, that's kind of like what they do on the cruises, where they can bring your drink right to you. See that little white box right there? It's the Department of Transportation Traffic Monitoring System. Fix a Bluetooth signal to report traffic patterns. Sadly, this has become a reality. It's not Bluetooth. No. But if you're trying to communicate this to people that are gonna watch this show, it's not that bad. Why don't you just say wireless? No way. I'm getting hacked. No, no, this is ridiculous. They've already burned through the NCIS building firewall. Oh my goodness. Oh, my frontal lobe. I have never actually seen this. This is a super legendary scene. If someone is stealing your documents, the documents that are being stolen are not opening on your screen. You're not gonna get a million. It would be impossible to do any work on this computer because of all the pop-ups. Remember the 90s? Like, you get all the pop-ups and bad things happening on your computer because of the malware. It's like, \"Oh, what is this?\" Take the node and dump them on the other side of the router. I'm trying. It's moving too fast. Have you seen this before? This is so, like, okay, two people, one keyboard does not work in any... There's just no universe where two people, one keyboard works. Where'd it go, Abby? I didn't do anything. I thought you did. No. Hints why you don't have two people on one keyboard. He unplugged it. Well, that's the first person with a brain. We did it. Literally the most reasonable thing in that entire scene. With all the submissions you guys gave us from crime shows like CSI and NCIS, we could probably make an entire second episode just from that. So hit the like button if you guys want to see a second one of these. I mean according to IMDB NCIS has a budget of only two and a half million dollars per episode so that would explain why they just didn't have the budget to accurately represent hacking and technology on the show. Let's pivot though and take a look at a movie that had a budget of a mere 200 million dollars. Surely they did a much better job. Oh good it's Fast and Furious 7. This is certainly the intelligence services want this if we look at it it's like we and they try to make components of this the headlines for the Pegasus malware and the dual elliptic curve incursions by the intelligence services and this is scary close to reality possibly maybe I say thank god it can only access anything on the digital network as opposed to the analog networks that we're still rolling One thing that I may argue is that I don't know that the Fast and Furious universe is actually the same as our own. Really? I think at this point, I think it's arguable that it is not actually the same universe. Dr. Chan, recalculate the new thruster data and relay it to Blue Oyster called immediately instantia. Roger that, doctor. Fuuuck! What's wrong? Seriously? Auto-updating now? General, I won't be able to calculate the right data for the satellite for 49 minutes. How long till impact? 11 minutes and 44 seconds. You could probably do it on a different computer. F***ck Microsoft! It do be like that sometimes. Okay, this is actually pretty funny. But you could probably use a different machine on the network. I'm enjoying this one enough though that I don't feel like I need to pick it apart. It didn't pull me completely out of the scene. Elijah actually has some inaccuracies in there that we were supposed to notice. Their group policy almost certainly would have prevented an update for happening at such an inopportune time. Although Microsoft has started ignoring group policy. And they can for certain things. Yeah, group policy is not as ironclad as it used to be. If they're like, \"F*** Microsoft!\" If they're like, \"This is important enough of an update,\" they'll just... Our last clip, also from the Fast and Furious universe, as Luke calls it. Yeah. Wait, he's in a giant motorcade in a city and they weren't sure. Okay, they found it. I thought those coordinates to Dom's Nav. Copy that. So like, if that was a dude that was under surveillance already and they had malware on his phone like the Pegasus malware, they absolutely could do that. Yeah. Turn the microphone on surreptitiously like the whole nine. Also, am I gonna be the one to point out that they have planes? Yeah, that are just in the air all the time. And yet they choose to pursue on. The ground? In the Fast and the Furious universe, cars are the best thing that exists at all, other than family. Well, wait, if they've got a New York police escort, just radio the New York police and be like, \"Stop.\" This is what I've been saying. They had to try to track this person down, but they have a giant motorcade in the middle of a huge city. Wait, why do we need to read his license plate? This is what I'm saying. They definitely know this is happening. Do these guys work for the Department of Redundancy Department? If you have this level of control, can't you just turn a stoplight red? - Yeah. I want every chip with a zero-day exploit in a two-mile radius. Any idiot with a flipper zero can turn. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Every chip with a zero-day exploit in a certain mile radius. I thought, why do they need a chip with a zero-day exploit? They've got god's eye. They should have. Probably gotta use the orange text on the video. Hack 'em all. That's like in the Batman movie that made Alfred upset. Yeah. What does hacking... They're gonna start driving the cars to crash the motorcade. Oh my god. Excellent. This will also be a thing. But why would they want it to do that? Why would they want the windshield wipers to go? Now there's a lot of intelligence services that would be really happy for this level of functionality 'cause it's like, oh look, this problematic person died in a horrible car accident. Whoops. Where did those coins come from? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Did the coins just come out of the ground? What the F*** happened to that parking meter? I think those were added in post. Really? Also notice how much rust there is on the ones that are real. Shoot their engines? There's people in those cars. No, no, no, no. Did you see the spread? What are these bullets hitting? That's epic, dude. Oh, interesting. When you shoot the engine, it naturally diverts away. Massive thanks to Wendell for joining us to critique some scenes from TV shows and movies.

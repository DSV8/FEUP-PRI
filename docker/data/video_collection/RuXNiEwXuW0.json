    "transcript": "now this video has been ages in the making it took a surprisingly long and disturbing time to track down all them wuss but after having to scrub my search history several times it's finally happening we're building an all(ish) waifu gaming system very [Music] excited [Music] now before we start building the system I do want to point out that not much of this stuff actually matches so I think this is going to be quite a wild looking gaming system I'm really excited to see the end result uh so let's get [Music] started now I'm starting off with the motherboard which is quite a nice looking board from Asus it is a Rog stck B7 60g gaming WiFi D4 that Edition I'm not sure what that says but there is a lady standing next to a motherboard and the motherboard even has a little bit of waifu accenting going on which makes it very much a waifu motherboard when you open the box you're immediately greeted by some Asus lady art I don't know why but I often see wuss with ears is does that make it a better waifu I I don't [Music] know W you get so much accessories with it now this is one of the things that I unironically quite like about the waifu stuff is that somebody put a lot of care and attention into making a whole bunch of art for the packaging of this motherboard right so you have these stickers that you get with it and then here is a warranty card that some talented person made and then look at the manual for this motherboard this is crazy they've gotone the picture of the lady on the front but when you open it up there's a there's another lady picture there that again there there's a lot of care put into this design and then when you get to the actual instructions look at that there's like ladies shouting things in Chinese at you about how to put the CPU in and somebody with Talent put a lot of time and effort into that there's even a flying lady on the anti-static bag oh look at that Beast oh we also have a pretty solid rear IO for a motherboard with some more characters adorning it that's pretty nice to see even the socket cover has a little character on it that's cool and there's like a silhouette of the motherboard lady I like that a lot very good idea now I'm using a 12 600k which unfortunately does not have ears because that's not a thing that exists it's it's just a normal CPU but we don't have to see it so it's fine the RAM on the other hand does involve ears because it matches the motherboard I think that may in fact be the same lady ooh look at that now this Ram kit not only has a kawaii little Neco waifu on it powering down some watermelon it's also real fast at 6400 [Music] MHz [Music] wait a minute oh it's a ddr4 motherboard come on a few moments later now outrage aside luckily I came prepared with a ddr4 kit look at that it's even still matching I bought this like a year ago for this build and then when this motherboard showed up I was like oh wait a minute it's going to be ddr5 so then waited another like month for that kit to show up but we still have this one so we're goodoo safe they even look basically identical to the ddr5 [Music] one oo that looks pretty niceu now when it comes to the CPU Cooler for the life of me I couldn't find one with pictures of anatomically precarious woman plastered all over it but then I had an idea you you see these NZXT coolers let you make like a photo happen on the AIO block which means I can add the greatest waifu of all time to this cooler which would still technically make it a wfu [Music] cooler now in terms of case I'm using the Asus NZ Coan case that's been on the channel before and as far as I understand it I don't think NZ Coan is technically a waifu but I'm not a waifu olist so I I don't know maybe she is let me know in the comment section down below but either way I didn't want to have to buy another exorbitantly expensive anime case I'm already unhappy about owning this [Music] one and there is our case in all its Majesty which does have a couple of small issues the first one is that that's an ATX case and the motherboard is matx so we're going to have some slight girth compatibility issues or like lack of girth I guess and then what was the other issue um I can't remember I guess we'll figure it out soon enough now with the power supply there is legitimately a couple of problems the first one is that this is meant to be an Asus Gundam power supply and even by my pretty loose definition of what a waifu is I'm pretty sure this big ass robot doesn't count as one but then I thought I shouldn't discriminate I'm sure somebody out there gets off on these big ass robots so it means that it's a waifu to someone right the second problem is potentially bigger I don't think this is the correct power supply it does say on the shipping manifest that it's supposed to be a Gundam Edition but this doesn't mention Gundam anywhere so um I I think they sent the wrong one got a baggie of stuff who no way I think these are Republic of Gamers fridge magnets oh I just dropped a bunch of stuff this is like a little enamal fridge magnet so you can let everybody know the moment they come into your kitchen that you're a massive nerd I don't know oh never mind they attach to the power supply which would make more sense to me than a fridge magnet let's see yeah no that I was I was sent the wrong power supply this is very much not a Gundam Edition power supply which I think means depending on the price difference I was scammed uh either way this is a majestic power supply my word it's really pretty now we need to put the fake Wu power supply in here I mean I can't be that mad I think this is a very good power supply either way like it's not it's not like I got a wish power supply instead you [Music] know now I am curious how well the radiator is going to fit in the top it's it's not it's not going to fit in the in the top that's a bit of a problem problem because if I put it in the front I'm pretty sure the graphics card doesn't fit it like super doesn't fit Nan isn't a very good case okay this is going to get ghetto pretty quickly but I have a solution I think that fits maybe let's see on the other side okay that doesn't look super promising but let's try screw it down anyway and see what happens [Music] now the radiator mounting situation hasn't gone very well and I don't just mean in terms of the fan we're missing on our 240 mil radiator but because the motherboard's heat sink is Too Tall I've had to kind of wedge the radiator in there and I've only been able to attach these two screws so um yeah it's not it's not mounted very well all of my previous hatred for this case has very much come flooding back I really don't like Nez Goan very much but I do think it has very much met the minimum criteria of what I would consider mounted so honestly it's gone better than expected when the case is upright the radiator stays in place so see mounted and then all there was left to do was some cable management before we brought out the most exciting component of all of it [Music] and then finally the center piece of our build yon's spectacular RX 7800 XT Sakura Edition wo it barely fits wa even without the radiator it barely fits in Nez Coan I am going to see if I can add some intake fans on the other side of this Mount but if not we may have to bear back [Music] it now before we admire our creation we do have to see if it actually works which I haven't tested like half the components so it could not that's not a good sign though oh no that could just be the front ey the power button cable pulled out oh did I get it I did I have magic hands apparently wow I am very happy with how easily that happened and then all there was left to do before we orul the Majesty was add a bank of fans to the front install Windows and Adorn our cooler with a picture of the greatest waifu of all time Miss [Music] Piggy [Music] whoa straight off the bat the waifu's running cold as ice look at those temperatures that is the most Battlefield 5 spawn ever and at 1440p ultra settings it's zooming in Battlefield 5 damn I mean it does stutter a decent amount but in all fairness I did just load in and this is dx12 which is quite stuttery so I'm going to give it a minute see where the temperatures go and if the stutters go go away also the temperatures are climbing our aiio is going to warm up slowly I'm curious to see how it's going to handle this long term considering we only have one fan on [Music] it okay so I've been playing for a while and the graphics cards temperatures are still Immaculate despite the 250 to 60 wats of power draw it's very comfortably been at 51 C which is great the CPU on the other hand creeped up a little bit but it's still below 70 C and that is with just a single fan on it so I it's better than I was expecting it to do quite frankly so many people damn uh but yeah very very good performance here uh but let's try a more demanding game oh damn the waifu a beast at 1440p high settings with cyberpunk we're getting over 100 frames per second which only dips down into the 80s when we bump up the settings to ultra which makes me think what's rate racing going to do and with low rate racing settings we've basically not lost any frame rate and the game looks awesome ow that's rude someone just ran me down and then finally some The Last of Us action here running at 1440p ultra settings and the Wu is giving us about 80 frames per second and this is some smooth 80 frames per second damn it's running very well the system is a real beast and with that highly impressive result you may be thinking to yourself wow I also want a parts bin selection of Wu parts to build a PC out of which would be fine aside from it being pretty difficult to find all of this stuff there's also a huge price premium attached to it and worst of all you then have to explain to people why you actually own this stuff with brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching subscribe for more of whatever the content is that I make and until the next video [Music] bye-bye",

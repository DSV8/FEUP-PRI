    "transcript": "hello good people Eber here with Hardware Canucks and today is gonna be an interesting day because I will be swapping out the motherboard on my existing X299 workstation PC to something a little bit more robust so if you do recall about a few months ago I think we did a build sponsored by Intel featuring pretty much every hind component out there including an 18 core processor with a lot of with two gtx 980 ti's and just maxed out stuff but after then I've been using this PC for editing because you know it's 18 cores who want to say no to that right and one of the things that I've run into is of course with the motherboard so I've been using or we decided to go with an MSI x2 99m gaming carbon pro AC motherboard and one of the bottlenecks or I guess one of the issues that we had with that motherboard was the VRMs weren't capable enough to overclock the 18 core processor because I tried it but just is to see if I can push it above 3.5 gigahertz or even hit the 3.5 gigahertz overclocking setting but unfortunately I wasn't because the VRMs just got way too hot and so it just wasn't able to overclock the 18 core processor fast forward to Computex we were at the EVGA booth checking out some cool stuff and something really caught our attention it was this guy right over here the X299 micro ATX version 2 and what's really interesting about this motherboard is obviously first and foremost it is a micro ATX form factor but most importantly it features active cooling for the VRMs that means I would be able to overclock my 18 core processor so the objective for this video is to keep the components identical so that includes the cooling solution the case the graphics card the memory and storage stuff exactly where they are except for the motherboard and we will be swapping out of that component with this guy so let the teardown process begin but first a quick message from our sponsor the new t46 caliber ddr4 memory is one unique RGB kit with awesome light spill from each module and the special edition has a cool totem design on the light bar you get lifetime warranty up to 4,000 megahertz speeds and full lighting control through the software check out the t46 caliber ram down below how are I good people so the swapping process is complete but now it's time to see if the system actually builds because you never know I might have screwed something up while installing the CPU or the RAM or anything like that but fingers crossed this actually works here we go it works actually works well fans are actually blasting a blade but I guess that has to do with I might have to go into the BIOS and change the fan profile but this is this is news to me because I always screw up something so this is awesome well after spending the majority of the day playing around with the EVGA BIOS I was finally able to overclock the core i9 7980 Extreme Edition processor to 4.3 gigahertz and 1.15 volts now I leave the rest the overclocking settings somewhere in the video down here so you can actually see those for yourselves but this is fabulous to me this is great news in my opinion because being able to achieve that kind of clock speed on all 18 cores consistently is just awesome I mean being a nerd here it's just it really does show something in terms of where we are in terms of technology and how far we've come now I did make sure to run a few stress tests and concerns to ability so the first thing I did was of course run the Adobe Media encoder test to see if those cloud speeds were consistent and that was in fact true I did notice I didn't notice any dumb clocks or anything like that while I was rendering a video which is great and the only thing that I would mention is that I had my AV x offset set to 3 so if you're hammering the CPU or in my case if I were to you know stressed as a CPU at 100% on all 18 cores then I can expect clock speeds to go to 4 gigahertz that's something that I'm okay with moving on to temperatures and I definitely expected a drastic increase in that department because you know when you overclock a CPU and the obvious drawback or I guess one of the compromises if you need to take is the increase in terms of temperatures in my case I was rendering a 4k video or using Adobe Media encoder and my low temps were around 50 C at stock settings compared to 78 degree Celsius when the CPU is overclocked at four point three gigahertz it's not too bad especially if you think about this form factor because I'm using the X62 a cooler from NZXT and a push-pull configuration so you know getting that kind of temps and their micro ATX chassis is pretty awesome I also want to touch base on power draw and this is an important factor for me personally because I live in Toronto Canada and I pay one of the highest hydro rates so you know being able to find a system that can be as efficient but also not consume a lot of power is also something on my wish list when it comes to building the optimized workstation PC and this is certainly not for that as you can see under stock settings the system draws around 400 watts and with the 4.3 gigahertz overclock the system drew around 520 watts which is ridiculous so does that mean that I'll be sticking with this external PC in the long term no because I do intend to explore the coffee lake ecosystem which is a lot more power efficient in my opinion but it's also for the fact that you know with the recent update with Adobe Premiere Pro it actually takes advantage of the integrated graphics chip on the processor as well as the discrete graphics card to accelerate rendering performance so I'm really curious to test out and compare the 8700K to the 18 core processor and see which one's faster and more efficient especially when it comes to cooling and of course power drop because I really don't want to pay those expensive hydro rates now that being said allow me to showcase some benchmarks that I ran on this system with both the stock settings and overclock settings so I'm not kicking some foot Cinebench at stock we got a score of roughly 33 57 when compared to 42 13 on the overclocked 18 core processor at four point three gigahertz again a massive improvement in terms of performance right over there the same story goes when it comes to blender as well so I did run the BMW render scene and the system had stock settings took two minutes and 22 seconds compared to a minute and 57 seconds on the old clock setting at 4.3 gigahertz I do want to mention that this PC isn't really geared towards gaming or just external and in general you're much better off investing that money into XIII 70 series or even the Rison platform because you're gonna be saving a lot or getting a lot in terms of value so I'd really plan on running in gaming benchmarks just because it just wouldn't make any sense but here just for tests purposes Iran 3dmark fire strike extreme test and I got roughly 13,000 on the overclock setting compared to 12,500 with the stock saying so it's not a drastic improvement right there which is it to be expected and the last test here is rendering performance in fact it's one of the reasons why I wanted to switch from the MSI motherboard to the EVGA board and see if the overclock would actually make a difference in terms of rendering so I took a 16 minute 4k project in this case it was the cooler master of hmmmmm case review video you can check it out right over here if you're interested but I took the 16 minute video and I rendered it to the YouTube 4k or using YouTube 4 k % with Adobe Media encoder and it stock settings the system took 14 minutes and 40 seconds to complete that task when compared to 11 minutes and 27 seconds with the overclocked setting at four point three gigahertz it is a significant improvement in my opinion because when we try overclocking on the MSI board we really didn't see a drastic difference in terms of rendering so this is definitely a win win and I want to wrap things up by discussing some of the drawbacks with this EVGA x2 19 motherboard the first one is the lack of a multiple nvme inductive slots so this particular motherboard only comes with one of them so I was I had to sacrifice my scratch drive that I was using so that was kind of a disappointment the second being it doesn't come with a USB 3.1 gen2 type-c port so I wasn't able to hook up my WD hard drive or my W external storage array to this motherboard now it did come with a type C to type a cable which obviously solves the issue but if you're someone who uses if you have external devices that use a USB type-c interface then you might find this a bit frustrating and I cannot forget to talk about the active cooling solution for the V RMS take a listen to this so as you heard that's something that I have to deal with especially during rendering times I can see or can hear those fans ramp up because you know it's basically utilizing all 18 cores at 4.3 gigahertz so definitely keep them in mind don't expect the best acoustic performance if you're trying to build an ultimate compact extranet system with this particular motherboard it's just not going to happen so I hope you took away something from this video in fact it was an interesting experience for me swapping the MSI motherboard with EBG board I definitely did not expect the system to boot right away because I always screw something up in between and I have to obviously go back and troubleshoot but I'm glad everything worked out just fine in fact I'm very happy with the overclock because 4.3 gigahertz on all 18 course is unimaginable it's the first time I'm looking at something like this because it really is awesome but I can't wait to test out the 87 and can of course testy Coffee Lake platform to see how it does in terms of rendering performance and compared to this guy right over here so definitely stay tuned for that in fact if you're interested in this comparison let me know in the comments down below I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much watching and we'll see you in the next one",

    "transcript": "If you saw my last video, you know that we have some pretty big things happening in the shop lately. And it's time to upgrade my security. I have a few Eufy smart cameras around the property and they've done a pretty good job. There's no wiring to deal with and they are all battery powered and communicate through wi-fi which means that there's also no monthly fees, which is a pretty good deal. The issue though is that I do have to charge them up about every 5 or 6 months, which isn't a deal breaker but it is something that I have to do on a regular basis. Today though, Eufy, a branch off my channel's sponsor, Anker, just dropped a brand new camera, a 360 degree security floodlight. I have an old school floodlight that I'm going to be replacing with this new upgraded high tech version. This does need to be hard wired, which is a little bit more work up front, but saves me the hassle of charging up every 5 or 6 months like my other cameras. And they'll still all work together in the same system. I'll leave a link down in the description so you can check out the current pricing, as well as a $50 discount code if you get one within the next 30 days. It's time to wire this up and see how it works. Let's get started. [Intro] One super important thing to remember before you work on electricity is to make sure there is no electricity. I have one of these little tools that can tell if electricity is running through a wire without actually plugging anything in. These wires right here are the ones heading up to that light fixture that we'll be working on, and as we can tell, they are currently powered. So we will flip the breaker where those lights are connected to and now we're safe to start working. Taking down my old light just has one large screw in the center and three wires underneath connecting it to power. With the old unsmart light disconnected, we can unbox the smart light. Inside the box we get the Eufy 360 camera along with the builtin multi directional LED lights. These can color change from warm white to cool light to kind of match with the sunsets. The camera can be mounted on a flat ceiling or folds out at 90 degrees to mount on the wall, which is what I'm going to do. Setting up the camera is easy enough. Just like all the other Eufy cameras I have, I'm going to plug it in temporarily and take a picture of the QR code underneath the camera. Then once the light is blinking red, press the sync button back and it's connected to my system along with all my other cameras. It doesn't get much easier than that. [Camera voice] Setup was successful. Wiring a new Eufy light into the existing socket is actually pretty simple. Obviously if you're not comfortable working with electricity, make sure you hire someone for this part a professional. I'm just going to connect the green wire to the ground, the black hot wire to the other black wire coming out of the house, as well as the white neutral wire coming out of the house. I am using wire nuts to connect these wires together, just extending the stranded wire from the Eufy lights slightly above the solid wire so that the wire nut grips onto the strand as it's screwing down into place. Holding everything securely which then allows me to lift the light into place with the one large bolt in the center. All in all, the installation took about 20 minutes. And just like that, with the breaker flipped on we have full access to the camera. Kind of fun that it has full motor control capabilities right here from the app, as well as the ability to turn the lights on and off. Which reminds me... we'll have to test the lights out more tonight to see how motion activated they are, as well as the camera quality, but let's check out the motion tracking right now during the day. Here's some actual footage from the camera. 2K resolution gives you plenty of pixels to work with, and the ability to crop in after the fact. The floodlight Cam 2 Pro does have motion tracking up to 40 feet away. With a 360 degree pan and tilt, it can track as I walk across the field of view, and then turn around and walk back the other direction. The tracking happens automatically. There is internal recording storage built directly into the camera, enough to record for 5 days continuously, or 30 days worth of a vent recording. It also has built in audio so you can communicate through the camera if for whatever reason someone decides to steal your ladder and waltz off into the sunset. And here's what the footage looks like at night. I have the lights set to turn on when I'm about 30 feet away, and then once again, the camera starts recording and tracking me even though it's nighttime. It does a good job of tracking people that might show up to measure your driveway in the middle of the night. It's nice to have some documentation. Those three adjustable light panels surrounding the camera have a total of 3,000 lumens and are compatible with Google Voice Assistant and Alexa. It just depends on how integrated you want to be. Overall, the Eufy security cameras are easy to set up, easy to use, and have no monthly fees. So it's no surprise that over a million households across the United States are being protected with the Eufy security cameras. Extra security is always a good thing. I'll leave a link for the camera that I installed today down in the video description, along with that $50 discount code. If you have any questions, leave them down in the comments and I'll try to answer them. As well as, come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. I have a couple videos showing off what we're doing here in the garage coming up really soon. Thanks a ton for watching and I'll see you around.",

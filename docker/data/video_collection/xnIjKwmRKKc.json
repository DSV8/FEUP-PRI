    "description": "Sennheiser HD6XX -   The Sennheiser HD6XX is available in limited quantities exclusively from Massdrop. The HD6XX is based on the legendary HD650 from Sennheiser.  More info from the manufacturer -   If you know audio gear, you know the Sennheiser HD 650. The companys flagship from 2003 to 2009, this open-back headphone has shown serious staying power. Praised for its richly detailed, effortlessly enjoyable sound, it remains one of the most talked-about products on Head-Fi todayand is still widely considered among the best headphones under $1,000. So when we teamed up with Sennheiser on its first-ever community-driven design partnership, the HD 650 was a natural place to start. A new revision of the popular all-rounder, the Massdrop x Sennheiser HD 6XX has that same great sound plus a few updates, and a price that makes it even easier to love.  Crafted with the modern audiophile in mind, the HD 6XX replaces the HD 650s gray colorway with something darker and more dramatic: a deep midnight blue. The silver nameplates have been swapped for black plates with contrasting silver textand the Massdrop logo is silk-screened on the inside of the headband, just above the right cup, with the serial number located just above the left cup. Based on feedback from the community, this iteration has also been updated with a detachable 6-foot cable (compared to the originals 10-foot cable) and a -inch plug, which is more versatile for everyday laptop, phone, and DAP use than the standard -inch plug. Of course, the HD 6XX comes with a -inch adapter for those who want it.  Good news for fans of the HD 650: In this revision, the driver structure and sound signature havent changed a bit. Youll get the same smooth, laid-back presentation, with a balanced midrange and natural-sounding bass. The HD 650 is considered more refined and better damped than its predecessor, the HD 600, with less energy in the upper midrange (which some listeners may find less fatiguing) and an overall balance thats a bit warmer and bassier. Its neutral response provides a pleasant listening experience with any musical genre from a range of sources. Plus, it responds well to improved sources and amplification, and headphone amplifiers of any output impedance could potentially make a good match.  Because the HD 6XXs open-back design wont isolate you from outside noise or prevent sound from being heard by those nearby, it may be best-suited for quieter home and office environments. Like all headphones in Sennheisers HD 600 line, this new model can be disassembled by hand to its component parts, all of which can be easily replaced. Many of its parts are interchangeable with others in the series, and owners of the HD 6XX can benefit from the rich aftermarket and brain trust of modifications and gear matchingalong with excellent long-term support from Sennheiser itself.  *This video is sponsored by Massdrop  FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

    "transcript": "Today is a exciting day, my friends and a reason why, is because, I'm about to hit you with a deal A crazy deal, depending how aware you are, of how legendary, this set of headphones in front of me, actually is. So recently Massdrop got in touch with me and they said \"We have got these new headphones that are coming out we would love you to make a video.\" I said \"Let's do it.\" Their called the HD 6XX and what they are is a reissue, a remake, a retake on the legendary HD 650 from Sennheiser. Now, if you don't know about those headphones, they sort of started this movement into the audio file style of headphone, being accessible and available in the average persons home. Open back listening around the ear cup design, that was the HD 650, and the HD650 people are still buying them all the time between $400 and $500. That said, Massdrop they were like \"Let's team up with Sennheiser and we think we can do it a step better.\" \"We're going to do a few small tweaks and we're going the hit the people with a far better price.\" What is that price Jack? $200 Limited availability the HD6XX this is going to be a $200 reference class headphone. Wow, a nice box, Sennheiser box to keep them in. Oh, look at those babies. If you've ever seen the 650s before you know they weren't this color, but now there's this like deep blue kinda coloring here. And look at these nice giant ear cups on this. That's what I love. I want it to be all the way around the ear. Look how deep that pocket is there. Now I've talked about it in the past the advantages of an open back. Generally speaking this give you a wider perception of sound. The ambiance and the room almost has a personality. If you want to lean back and get the ultimate experience, at least in my opinion you probably want something open back and that's exactly what these are. For what for 200?!? Another thing I'm noticing straight away is how lightweight these are. These are made in Ireland. That's interesting. And of course adjustable, as you see here. The branding, so you know it's a Massdrop exclusive collaboration. You can see the Massdrop logo in that location over there. So the previous version had a much longer cable which is great for at home listening but no so useful when your on the go. They took the 10 foot cable from the 650 and turned it into a 6 foot cable in this case. The other thing they've done for on the go listening is giving you a native mini-jack termination point. 3.5 mm instead of the 6.3 mm quarter inch jack. Which used to be the default termination on the 650. So when you phone is in your pocket, yes you can now connect these directly to your phone. It looks like these have detachable cables. Let's just verify that. Yes they do. They're headphones what are we here for I mean we gotta test these babies out. I've got a turn table and a tube amp, but then I gonna do the unthinkable. I'm going to take these beautiful headphones and plug them directly into my phone and see what happens. Oooohohooooh Let's just, let's just, let's just listen to some music real quick. It's no big deal. (Unbox Therapy Theme Plays) If you've never listened to an open back headphone before. There seems to be a lot of detail surrounding each independent instrument. This idea of having a lot of space for each on of those instruments to breath. Look at that vinyl right there. Isn't that a beauty. (Inaudible Music Plays) (Music Plays) $200 are you kidding me? They claim I can go ahead and chuck these babies straight into my phone. So here we go. Let me tell you something. Your mileage is going to very on this depending on the power of the amplifier on your perticular device. For me it's like these are beauty headphones right. You gonna want to get the most out of them, so even on a mobile device I would probably recommend some sort of small pocket amplifier. Just to put a little bit of, just to put a little more juice on the wire. Because once you heard it like this. You kinda wish that's what you ending up having on the mobile as well, if you know what I'm saying. And that's the unique scenario with the HD6XX. And I know a lot of people wish, that they could step up to that different style of listening experience. And believe me this is a, this is a totally different thing from that pair of Beats that you see sitting on a shelf at the local Apple store. It's not the same thing. And at $200 it's. You just might need these in your life. I just going to jump back to Hotline Miami real quick. Because that's just. I just want to go out like that.",

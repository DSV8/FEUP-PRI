    "transcript": "- Do you guys remember AirPower? It was Apple's wireless charging mat that supposedly would let you put any of your devices down and charge from anywhere, like anywhere that you would put your devices, that it would charge them. There's a company called Aira who came up with this technology called FreePower. Now they partnered with Nomad, who is one of my favorite companies. I use all of their charging devices. I've covered their AirPod cases before in one of my videos. Now what I'm showing you guys today is something that I think is gonna change the way that we wirelessly charge our devices. Obviously wireless charging is not as fast as plugging in your device. If you've ever used a wireless charger before, you know the pain that goes into usually trying to make sure it's in the precise area. (buzzer blaring) So let's open it up and take a look. And what's great about this is not only were you able to place your devices anywhere on this charging mat, you can also place up to three devices. And what's really interesting is using the Aira technology which is actually 18 coils, fit very nicely into this minimalist sleek design. It will be able to intelligently direct the specific amount of power that the device requires. If you put your AirPods on for instance, it'll be able to direct the specific amount of power to the AirPods and then more power to say your smartphone. Let's plug this in and try it out. I, actually already opened this and I've been using it so I repackage it up so I could do an unboxing (giggles). This unboxing, it's a lie. But I can tell you what, this thing's awesome. So it comes with a USB-C cable. You can also plug this into any other 30 watt charger which is great but it does come with one supplied. It even has all of the other ports that you would need if you are international. Anytime I travel I always bring one of these Nomad wireless charging mats with me and I have the one that has a little Apple Watch extension on it as well. So you can also charge your Apple watch. This doesn't have an Apple Watch charging extension but this will charge anything that is Qi wireless compatible. So any of your smartphones, any of your AirPods, anything that will charge with the Qi wireless charger this works with it. And it just got a USB-C port here in the back. It's lighting up! So while this seems kind of simple, to be able to achieve what this mat is achieving, it's really, it's never been done before. To this company, as I had mentioned before, is the technology inside of this. And what makes them so special is because they do have this underlying 18-coil matrix, and they have more than 30 patent assets for this ground-breaking hardware and software and magnetics to make all of this work. So FreePower's individualized device communication protocol delivers the exact amount of power that's required to efficiently charge each device. So, for an example, a smartphone might require 7.5 watts, whereas AirPods or the Earbuds next to it might only require two watts. So it knows what you're charging and will give it the right amount of power. I'm talking a lot about this, but I'm not showing it to you. AirPods, okay. Let's charge them up. (upbeat music) Charging! Let's see, Note 20 Ultra. Okay. Oh, charging. Oh, hold on, let's charge my iPhone. Okay, cool. Oh, it's charging, it's also charging. So we have all three devices charging and what's great about this is, you can put it anywhere, charging. Charging. Okay, let's just move you over. Okay there we go. You guys are all charging. And this is, I'm putting it in the corner as well so it's wirelessly detecting where the device is and then sending the appropriate amount of power. This was a very interesting stat that I never even thought about considering. When you have another wireless charging mat or any device. This goes for any of them out there. Without being used in a 30-day period. It is giving enough power out while not charging something up to 130 iPhone charges. So that's like four iPhone charges a day but with this they were able to make it so much more efficient that when it's idle, I think the equivalent was maybe two (buzzer blaring) and a half iPhones a month which is a huge difference. This is actually one of Nomad's AirPods' cases, which I absolutely love as well. And it even charges through the case. I love that this has like a nice leather finish to it. They even added some soundproofing to it so that when you put your phone down like it's not, like you're not slamming it on like a desk. I love this, I'm so excited about this. I just really wanted to show this to you guys. This is not a sponsored video, they did send me this to check out. But I was really excited just watching the demonstration and I love the company Nomad. Aira was featured on Shark Tank. So they went on there showing their technology. And what's most exciting about this is the technology inside of this because this has such a potential to change the way that we charge our devices. This could be something that's integrated into hotels in nightstands, in tables, maybe even in the medical field. You can install something like this in a car, like in a dashboard, you can just put your keys down and it'll be able to intelligently realize that those are keys, we're not charging the keys. But those AirPods that you also threw into your center console. That's something that we can charge. What's great about the FreePower technology stack is that it's remarkably thin measuring less than six millimeters. So something like this might not have been possible with the traditional Qi wireless charging coils, because it would have to be so much thicker than this. And there's no way that you'd be able to get this all fit into this small of a device and be able to charge from anywhere. I've never been so excited about wireless charging. This is so exciting. I'll see you guys in my next video. If you haven't already. Make sure you guys hit that subscribe button and be sure to hit the bell and leave me a comment. Let me know what you guys think of this cool tech. It's not air power. It's FreePower. (upbeat music)",

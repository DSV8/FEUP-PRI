    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin'? I got some cool replacement parts for my original Game Boy. Stick around and we'll check 'em out. [ Music - Intro ] These are a new two piece design from Hand-Held Legend. They were kind enough to send me a set to match my Darth Vader DMG. What's unique about 'em is that they have a separate inner button and transparent outer cover, so you get kind of a 3D look. Installing 'em is very straightforward, and of course, it starts by removing the tri-wing screws in the back of the Game Boy. Disconnect the ribbon cable and set the back half aside. Remove the Phillips head screws holding the circuit board to the front panel, then carefully lift it away. The new buttons can simply be pressed together. Pull the old ones out, drop the new ones in, and then, put the silicone membranes back in place. Button up the Game Boy, and you're done! Now, these new buttons look really cool, and you can stop here if you want. But you know what? We can take this a step further. Hand-Held Legend also sent out a strip of these small LED modules. They have a side-mounted white LED and pre-tinned solder pads. I used a flush cutter to separate three of 'em by cutting along the scoreline. I soldered 'em in parallel by daisy-chaining the positive wires to the positive pads on the modules, and likewise on the negative side. In the Game Boy's front panel, I used the flush cutters to snip out a small section of the plastic wall around the button cavities. It only needs to be as wide as the LED itself. I cut a small piece of 3M VHB double-sided tape and stuck it to the back of each module, then pressed 'em into place with the LEDs facing the buttons. If you're feeling confident, you could use Super Glue instead. Then I dropped the front circuit board back in. This capacitor is a great place to tap power from, so I soldered its wires to its legs. The board is marked as to which side is positive. Then I put it all back together like usual. Wow. The clear top part of the buttons illuminates pretty well. Hand-Held Legend sells these buttons in different colors, including some transparent ones, so you can mix and match and get different effects. You could also paint the inner button pieces for a truly custom look. I think appearance mods can be just as much fun as functional ones because they help you create a console that's all your own. And what I really like about these replacement buttons is their flexibility. You can change colors or use those LED modules to light 'em up. But even if you don't have much experience with console modding, these are a great place to start, simply because they're *so easy* to install. I'd like to give a big shout out and thank you, of course, to Hand-Held Legend for sending me these parts to check out. I'll include links down in the description in case you're interested. If you like this video, I'd appreciate a thumbs-up and be sure to subscribe if you haven't already.

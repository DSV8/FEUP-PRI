    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] Well you can't spell Setup Assistant without ass now can you? Safari can't verify the identity of the website Apple.com. Well that's a bit of an issue. The old Front Row carousel interface with sound effects. Let's have a look. (carousel gong) Oh my gosh, that is amazing. I'm getting so much nostalgia. Enjoy that old icon. Look at the platinum loading bar. (sonar pings) (upbeat techno music) Hey guys, how you all doing? Really, that's just great. You know, I'm doing pretty great today, too, because we're goin' on a big nostalgia trip today. Yeah, it's really just nostalgia for me, but I want you to come along with me. This is not just your everyday Intel iMac. And not only was this one of the earliest Intel Mac computers, this was my first Intel Mac computer. In fact, it was my first Mac after I switched back from Windows as my daily driver for years. This was my gateway back into the Apple world. This was the first computer I ever cut video on. This was the first computer I ever used iMovie on. I explored a lot about my creative interest on this exact computer. And I've cleaned it a few times, but there's still a lot of barnacles and crust on there and some old user account stuff and all that. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna restore it with the original software disks. And a lot of the stuff that came on these disks, which I don't even remember all of what came on these disks, is not even on here anymore. So it'd be cool to get all that stuff back and go back to Mac OS 10.4 Tiger. It's currently running Lion, but it'd be cool to flash back to Tiger. The first first to Mac OS X I've ever used. So this is gonna be a nice little time travel trip. Time to boot this baby up. Now one thing I really liked about this computer was the sound it made when you turned it on. Just the quick rush of the fan spinning and then the hard drive kicking in. I just liked it. (fan whirring) (startup chime) And the super drive, hearing the super drive kicking in. Oh yeah, that was a thing. And then of course, the startup chime. You gotta love that. Yes there is a Windows XP partition on here, but I'm not going to touch that. That is running some legacy Windows software and games that I don't wanna get rid of, but I do want to refresh all of the Mac parts of this computer. So we have two disks here. For Mac computers, Mac OS X install disc one. In you go. Hang on, hang on a second. The super drive is soundin' a little cranky. Let's eject for a sec. All right, so that's kind of okay. I'm gonna reinsert the disk. Just listen to this. Tell me if this is normal. (buzzing and whirring) Okay, admittingly that wasn't as bad sounding as it was a little while ago. Maybe it just needed to warm up. Okay, let's hold down command v and go into the install disk. So we get verbose mode which is way more fun, 'cause it takes a while to load off the CD. So you might as well entertain yourself looking at the kext, the Mach kernel, and the unique device identifier, I forgot what UUID stands for. And we're at the blue screen. That was actually quicker than I thought it would be. Ah, the old beach ball, and the old aqua interface, yes. Oh that's another thing that's gonna be a huge throwback here. Look at the chrome and the aqua, the barber pole, beautiful. Ah yeah, Spotlight and Dashboard. Those were big new features for Tiger, the old OS X logo. Oh man, I'm having so much fun already. Oh this is great. About Installer 215, cool. All right, let's go to Utilities, Disk Utility, that's what I want. Oh we got pinstripes goin' on in that menu. Oh yeah. Mac OS X, there we are. Again, we're not touching Windows XP or the MATSHITADVD. I didn't need to know that. I'm gonna go to Erase. Yep, we'll keep OS Extended Journaled, Mac OS X, the old pill buttons. The pill shaped buttons with the aqua. Oh, so beautiful. Erasing a volume will destroy, very deadly. Destroy all information on the volume. Yes, time to erase, time to start fresh. And go back in time from Lion to Tiger. Back at the installer. Continue, Continue, Agree, I read every word. Obviously we can't install it on this volume. Oh it actually says it's Windows NT, it knows that. Very smart. Options. I guess we could have done an Erase and Install from here. But I like Disk Utility. Disk Utility is my bitch. Click Install to perform basic installation. Okay, the software you're installing requires Mac OS X Install Disk 2. Yes, before the days of the app store and the cloud we had DVDs. What am I talkin' about. It's not a very old technology. Anywhozal, I do have disk two ready to go. Again, I don't really remember what came bundled with this system and it's been a long time since I've really used Tiger at all. So this will be fun. Let's see Printer Drivers. I think we can skip that. I'm not gonna be printing anything. Fonts, yes that'd be great. Language Translations, no I'm just speaking English. Essential System Software is good. X11, we definitely should have X11 on here. It's fun to mess with the X Window system. Bundled Applications. Okay, this is what I'm interested in. CPU Help Files. I have no idea what that is. OmniOutliner, oh man I haven't touched that in forever. Comic Life, oh I remember experimenting with this on this computer like way long ago. I didn't use it too much. Big Bang Board Games, yes. I, yes, playing chess and checkers with the sun and moon goddess, god and goddess. It's been a long time. I'd like to have that on here. Front Row, something that doesn't even exist on Mac OS anymore. And since this is Tiger this is the old turntable style Front Row. Not the newer one like what the Apple TV had when it first came out. This was the old turn style interface with the cool, or the carousel interface with the cool sound effects, (bleep) yeah. Oh man Photo Booth, so many fun memories messing around with that. Oh yeah, Trial software. This did come with a trial software, that's right. iWork 06 Trial, why not. iWeb, all the old iMovie app, or the iLife applications. iMovie, the first software I cut video in. This looks great. So far so good. GarageBand demo songs for GarageBand, why not. Sounds and jingles, probably for GarageBand I would imagine, and iMovie. And then the Office 2004 test drive. Yeah, this was back when Apple included more third party stuff. They don't really do that anymore, which I appreciate. It's a little less bloaty that way. But yeah, you got an Office 2004 Test Drive. Dude, let's freakin' do it. Install this shit. Yes, I have disk two ready. Continue. Checking your installation DVD. I don't know why it did that. What did that actually do? Zero percent complete. Well, I'm gonna press the space bar and skip that. And commence the next part, Preparing for installation. And what I'd like to do, as I usually like to bring up the installer log just to see what's happenin'. And we're gonna go from show errors only to show everything as it's running the BSD subsystem thinga majig right now. And here you go. Now you can see all the shit it's installing. And if you want you can scroll and see these very long lines if you'd like. A system part one, the aqua is starting to fill up. Oh and the part I'm really excited for? The intro video that played when you installed this system. Do you remember that? That was Apple's coolest intro video. And for some ambient calming sounds, I now present the sounds of the super drive. Enjoy. (static and clicking) Ah, majestic. Wasn't that relaxing? Anyway, we're extracting files now it looks like. 95% Base System Part 1. Oh now it gives me an estimated time remaining, an hour and 20 minutes? Installing Essentials. Holy shnikeys. I mean that's not terrible, but man it's so much faster nowadays. I mean, if you have a good internet connection. Once the download is done the install is really fast 'cause it's all solid state, but yeah, to download over the cloud you should have a decent internet connection. Ah, trade offs. Well we're down to 56 minutes, so that's good. And we're on Java. I just saw it say it was installing iCal. Yeah, I remember that. That used to be the name of the calendar application. Now it's just called Calendar. And now we're on Safari, yes. Built-In Web Browser and the Dictionaries, that's cool. The Mac having a built-in dictionary has always been a super useful feature. Hey, hey, X11 time. We're gonna have some fun with that. Basically, that's just a way to run the X Window system in Mac OS X. And it's rebooting, automagically. I forgot it actually does do a reboot between the two DVDs. (startup bong) Bong, there we go. Out you come, Install Disk 2, in you go. Here we go, phase two. Oh, and there's another fun thing I just remembered about these disks. On there it says, well I dropped it, but on there it says AHT version. That was Apple Hardware Test. So the hardware diagnostic software is actually on these disks, and that actually might be what I used these for in the past, but nothing else. I do want to experiment with that because if I remember correctly, the interface for that looks very OS nine platinumy. (laughing) Which is kind of funny seeing on an Intel machine. So yeah, we'll experiment with that later, the Apple Hardware Test. Right now we're installing the iWork '06 Trial. Yeah, Apple changed that stuff quite a bit recently. There was a trial, and then you could pay for the full version, and now it's just all free. All of Apple software is free except for their pro apps, which is pretty awesome. Times have changed. And what's that? I see a little proxy sitting up here. Let's see where you are. You're in the variable folder, database I'm guessing that's what stands, that's what that stands for. And then .AppleMultiCDInstall.dist. Yeah, .dist, distribution I'm guessing. I never really saw that file type before. Pkgs for like packages, yeah, but .dist, no sir. Installing iWeb. That was the first program I ever made a website in, and I actually used it for a long time to make Computer Clan websites before I switched to Adobe Muse, which hey, Adobe is now killing off. (laughing) Yeah, I still have my domain file, though. I can't open it, though, because I have nothing to run iWeb on, but I have this computer now. It may be fun to install iWeb 09 and open up that domain file to see all of the old websites I used to make. Oh my gosh. That might be something fun for another day. Installing Other iWeb Page Templates. Well, good. Other. And that was iMovie HD that just blew by. The program that started it all for me, in terms of video editing. Now we're on to iPhoto, which doesn't exist anymore. Yeah, iWeb doesn't exist anymore, iPhoto doesn't exist anymore, iDVD doesn't exist anymore. GarageBand and iMovie were the only ones that made it out alive. And we just finished. The installer will quit in 26 seconds. Now we can speed this up by pressing Close. Yes of course we will do that. Out comes the disk, like. Oooo, nice and toasty. All right, let's reboot, I think into the Setup Assistant. And let's see what's up. I haven't seen a Tiger Setup Assistant in, I don't even remember how long. Oh boy. Just right into it. (light music) Oh yes, we can sign up for a .mac membership. I remember that. That's what evolved into Mobile Me, and now that is what we know as iCloud. Yes, they used to cost money back in the day, yes. Good times. Oh the cube animation, oh my gosh, that's hot. I can just do this all gosh darn day. Don't transfer my information. I don't have any information. But I do have a United States so we'll choose that. Hmmm, someone nearby must have just installed some Spectrum wifi thing, 'cause I've never seen that before. I bet one of the guards just got a router and didn't change the name on it. So we'll go with the government sanctioned, Deep 13 router. Enter your Apple ID. I do not want to put one in. And yeah, it's gonna make me do this bullshit. It used to make you always do this. You could skip it in, I think you can skip it in, I don't even think it asks you in new versions. You are an asshole. Well, you can't spell Setup Assistant without ass now can you? 10 Stories Underground. Hopefully it'll accept that. Okay, where will you primarily use this computer? Is there an option for 10 stories underground? No there is not, well it's basically my home so I'll say home. What best describes me? Psychopath, sociopath, I don't think any of those are in here. We'll just say retired. And no, I do not want to stay in touch. Go away. Create Your Account. Well, my name's Krazy Ken, short name Krazy Ken. I don't need a password. Connecting to Apple. An account picture. Wat best describes me? Well I am doughy so gingerbread. Let's do that. Is there even dough in a gingerbread? I don't even know. Don't forget to register. I thought I did that. Enjoy your Apple computer. Okay, I will do that. Blue screen. (bell chiming) And the aqua interface. Ah, the old wall paper, oh my gosh. The brushed metal, hello. You remember this shit? I mean it was cool, brushed metal, aqua, the menu bar, rounded corners in the menu bar to simulate that CRT feeling. Maniac Mike and I were actually just talking about that in a recent episode with the first developer preview in Mac OS X. That's a good one, go check it out. Hey, a software update popped up. There are things, oh there is a lot of things. iPhoto, Airport, Front Row, X11, Pages, Keynote, Java. Wow, lotta good stuff. I'm gonna close that for now. And let's take a look at what we got down here. Oh we got the Dashboard. Oh yeah. Cupertino, calendar, the clock. Now this is still a feature in Mac OS, it's just kinda hidden because we have the notification center now, but you can turn it on still. And you can just drop these things in and watch them ripple. Yeah, oh, I'm gettin' so many flashbacks now. When I was like first using this I was like wow, it animates it, it's so pretty. And you can hold down shift and like, here wait, I think you can hold down shift and it morphs in slow motion, look at that, and then (explosion), ripple. Yeah, all the Dashboard, good times man, good times. We got iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iTunes, GarageBand, iWeb, iCal, Apple, Mac OS X, which was a thing you click on and you go to the web. Safari can't verify the identity of the website Apple.com. Well that's a bit of an issue. Well it probably doesn't know what this type of certificate even is. It's a very old version of Safari. But yeah, it brings you to the Mojave page now. Look at that. Oh yeah, I can't resize the window from the edge. I gotta go down to this thing. I think it's called the thumb. Oh yeah, take a look at how that renders webpages. Oh shit. Oh that's just beautiful. This is what, Safari three or two? Two, this is version two, copyright 2005. Wow that goes back. The pinstripes in the menus, oh I dig it. So I know there's some other applications that got bundled on here. So yes we do have Comic Life, the Big Bang Board Games, holy shmoley, I think we have a free trial of Microsoft Office '04. Yes we do, holy cow. These icons man, Word, Entourage, I don't even know what frickin' Entourage is. Excel, PowerPoint. Let's open up PowerPoint. Yes, evaluation copy, I agree. I did not read, I'm sorry, but I do agree. Microsoft, oh my gosh look at this. Installing fonts onto your hard disk. Dude. It says test drive like all over the splash screen. Just in case you forget. Oh my gosh it expired. Oh, I just installed it you asshole. Fine. No fun Freddy son of a bitch. Okay, we'll ignore that. The Big Bang Board Games. This is what I was talking about. Oh, we got Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Checkers, Backgammon, Mancala, or is it Mancala? I really don't even know. All right, let's do Tic-Tac-Toe. (sinister music) Oh shit. Oh hang on, volume. Tiger is not quite used to this keyboard. Oh how do I turn up the frickin' volume? I guess I'll just go up here and do it. (popping) Ah, the old sounds. Okay, Solo. (intense music) Okay, so I shall play. I don't know what Hot Seat means. I'll play the sun side. So I can kick Luna's ass. Yes we shall play a game and I'm gonna kick your ass. Just because you're a goddess doesn't mean you can do everything. This is gonna be a stalemate. It's just like War Games taught us, there's no way you can win this game. The only winning move is no to play. (dramatic music) Oh such dramatic music. It's Tic-Tac-Toe, how can you lose unless you're an asshole? - Bye bye. - Bye bye. I did not say that, that was like in the game. Just a heads up. Yeah, oh my gosh Reversi, Steve Ballmer would be so happy about that. I suck at Chess. 4 In A Row? I'm gonna beat the Moon Goddess. Oh it's curved, I don't know if I can handle this. (gentle dramatic music) (voice distorted) Mmhmmm. I'm sorry. But I win. The sad thing is I couldn't even tell I was gonna win with that move because I'm not used to playing it in such a 3D perspective. It kind of confused me, but I kicked your ass, Luna. Suck a big one. I'm just kidding. That was rude of me. Ignore that. I'm so sorry for just bursting out of my anger. Anyway, Comic Life, hell yeah. You remember this shit? So yeah, I mean I never really used this, but it came with the system. But yeah, you could make like comics and shit. Like you could put pictures in here. I don't really have any but if I did you could put 'em in here. And lettering and all the old sheets that curved like that. Hang on, let's undo that. I think there were sound effects there. - Oooooo. - Oooooo. (laughing) That is delightful. There are sound effects like all over this software. But yeah, you could put bubbles in there and everything. Yeah, this was a nifty little program. I don't know if this is still made. Oh that is a sock puppet mascot? Yeah, that's not scary at all. I think I just, I didn't need to sleep tonight anyway. Oh Sherlock, that's right, this was still in here. This was a thing. I think this is the last version of Mac OS X to come with it. I don't even know, I don't even know what to freaking do. In Mac OS eight and nine when this software was newer there were like big buttons you could press and stuff. But now it's like uuuuuhhhhhhhh, what do I do? I really don't know. Add. I have no idea how to even frickin' use this thing. That was really exciting. And iWeb, oh my gosh, all these iLife applications, so cool. That's right, you could publish to a .mac account, that's right. I'm gonna close that though. But yeah, you can make your own websites. Again, I have some old files. I'm not gonna load 'em up right now, 'cause I think I need iWeb 09 to do that, and this is probably 06. Oh yeah, version one, yeah 2006. But yeah, I used to build the Computer Clan website and all of that stuff in iWeb. But hey, it was pretty cool for included software, you know. It was built in. You can choose a template and go to town. New QuickTime Tutorials at this link. Yeah, I bet it still works. Yeah, no freaking way. That was discontinued a long time ago. But thank you for your interest. No, I did not mean to minimize you. You get back up there. I meant to zoom. Our Trip to Tuscany. So yeah, this was iWeb man. Good times. All right guys, now it's time for the moment I've really been waiting for. Aside from the simulated CRT aperture rounded corners, there's something else I really like about this system. The old Front Row carousel interface with sound effects. Let's have a look. (light music) Oh my gosh, that is amazing. I'm getting so much nostalgia. 'Cause I remember playing with this when I was kid. I was like oh my gosh, you can watch videos on your big screen monitor. (whooshing) The sound effects. Music. (light music) You had music. (whooshing) Photos. (camera clicking) All the nice sound effects, man. (whooshing) Scene 1 apple (1A) take 1, common mark. (slate clapping) Got a little slate (tongue clicking) sound. And then the DVD. (light music) Probably the coolest sound effect in the thing. So that was the Front Row interface. Yeah, the nice animations and everything. They just did a lot of fit and finish with this bad boy. Cool, another fun thing that is bundled with this system that is not currently bundled with Mac OS is X11, which this particular application runs the X Window, or excuse me, not necessarily the X Window environment, well, I guess yeah, the X Window environment inside of Mac OS X. Yeah, the X Window system. Look at that. So we could run programs like X eyes, and have a lot of fun with that. Check that out. Not as freaky as the ones I made in the Hannah Montana Linux episode, but still pretty crazy, right? We could do X clock. Huh, or maybe not. All right well let's do emacs. I'm (bleep) up everything. Hang on, let's just abort this. Try again, emacs. There we go. We can load up a game like Pong. Oh yeah that's right, in Tiger it just supported an ASCII art version of Pong, not a very graphical version. Let's see, I think there's some built-in applications here. Xlogo. The X manual, terminal. I mean, let's see Xcalc I think is, yep. So you can just run all these, I guess X window system programs. I'm not really sure what exactly they're called, but yep, they're here. And there you go. So that was built in as an optional part of the installation. So now for the grand finale, we're gonna boot into the Apple Hardware Test. And you're gonna enjoy the classic Mac OS platinum interface on a modern Intel flat screen Macintosh because the interface in the Apple Hardware Test was still using the old design. So let's reboot and hold down the d key, d as in delta, to boot into diagnostics. AHT, Apple Hardware Test. Here we go. Enjoy that old icon. Look at the platinum loading bar. Look at this man. English, platinum buttons. Let's do it. Look at that. The barber pole, the tabs. This was the Apple Hardware Test. It came with your install DVD. Product, iMac, iMac 5,1, Core 2 Duo, number of cores, two, hmmm, good to know. Glad we figured that out. I don't think I've ever really gone through this before. It has all of our specs, which is nice. And there's a RAM. Yeah, I think this originally came with one gig when we bought it years ago. But it has been upgraded to four since. But I think it can only fully address three gigs. See I check out that old interface. Apple Hardware Test, 3a11, 2000 to 2006, pretty awesome right? That's how you get platinum. All right, reboot. (computer gonging) You know, it is really cool to have this restored to its former glory. I mean, aside from the Windows XP partition, this is how the computer was when I received it. And it's given me like a huge nostalgia attack. I made a lot of old videos not just on this thing but about this thing like the freaking iMovie tutorial I made back in '07. I had to do this on a video that was only five minutes, and it took a whole whopping 50 minutes for the thing to render. And then I'm running off of a 2.16 gigahertz Intel Pentium. Yeah, I talked like I had a clue about what I was doing. (laughing) I said there was Pentium inside this thing. There isn't a Pentium inside this thing. It's a Core 2 Duo. I don't know why I said Pentium. I was so dumb, well I still am dumb, but I was dumber back then. I remember having friends over, and we'd record movies with the iSight camera in iMovie and edit them together. We'd mess around in Photo Booth. Man, a lotta memories. Yeah, that was so much fun. And just everything was right here in the dock. I could just go down and click on something and learn about it and make stuff. And I guess it was that simplicity of the creative tools that really sold the Mac experience to me. So yeah, this is pretty much where it all started. The Mac was my first personal computer I ever used. I actually have a computer history video that talks about that stuff. But I was really young. I didn't really know what it was. And then I used Windows for many years. But this was the computer that brought me back to the Mac, and I've been with it ever since. I think everyone has their own computer nostalgia stories and I'd like to hear yours, too. They're really fun to hear about. So share down below and there's more to come on Krazy Ken. Thanks for sticking with me, catch the crazy, and pass it on. (upbeat techno music)",

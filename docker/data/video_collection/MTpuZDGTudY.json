    "transcript": "- You see this? This is the 2021 Ford Bronco. This is the first edition two-door Sasquatch edition. This thing has been so much fun to drive. Me and my sister did a road trip to Vegas and back. This does have the V6 engine and it is surprisingly way more powerful than I thought, and we were cruising around Vegas, and you would just hit that gas and you know what? You freaking go. I'm so hyped. We are out here in basically the middle of the desert. This is the El Mirage dry lake bed. You can bring ATVs out here, and we brought the Bronco out to have a little fun. (laughs) Get in, loser, we're going for a ride! (car engine purring) (upbeat electric guitar music) Dude, that was freaking fast. I think I was going almost 80, which in theory, like, doesn't seem, like, fast. I don't drive fast. For me, it's fast. (upbeat electric guitar music) Welcome to the interior. So this actually is kind of like a navy blue color here. We've got our little Bronco logo here. I also like that there is plenty of storage in the center console. Lots and lots of, lots of places to put things. Also something down here that you might notice. I'm actually gonna turn the car on real quick. This right here is a wireless charger. (electronic beeping) Pretty cool. (electronic beeping) The top of this also comes off, something that I have not attempted yet. I think I'm gonna try maybe to do it for this video, but not in the middle of this dusty desert. The seats are also kind of awesome because they flip down, so I'm able to store a lot of stuff. So for our trip to Vegas, I'll show you guys what these look like flipped down. This actually pulls right up, just like so, but like magic, that just pushes down for more storage. There are so many flies in here coming along for the ride now. Here's how we can switch all of our goat modes. It has a nice interior display. It does have CarPlay, which is nice, hook up my phone, do my maps, like you normally would. This also has obviously some built in navigation. Towing! Not today. So my dad actually used to have a 1978 Ford Bronco, and this picture right here is so incredible. This is actually me sitting in this bicycle and that's my mom driving, and she even has a Bronco T-shirt on and I wish that she still had the shirt. I'm gonna search everywhere when I go back home to see if I can find it, but you can see my Dad's Ford Bronco in the background. And now here I am many, many, many, many years later testing out the 2021, and the cool thing is, this is the first edition. And they originally were only making 3,500 of these, but they did end up manufacturing about 7,000. Obviously this is the two-door. They have a four-door version, which, I know the two door is super cool, but I think for my lifestyle and amount of hoarding that I do and people in and out of my car, I think I would probably get the four-door if I was getting one, just for the practicality reasons. But the two-door definitely looks way cooler. (dramatic music) It is such a nice day out and I thought, wow, since I have this Bronco, I should probably take the top off of it. Now I did a little investigating, and to take the entire roof off, it is a little bit of a process, you do need some tools, but it's honestly so easy just to take these top two panels off, that we're gonna do that and ride around and get it. We're gonna start with the driver's side. There's four latches. You just have to flip these, unhook this one, and that's it. This is like not even very heavy at all. Now we do the same thing on the passenger side. (upbeat music) So this wire, I actually taped up here because I put a dash cam in and this isn't my car, I didn't really want to be able to like, you know, start removing things to hide this wire. So this is not a part of the Bronco. That's a Justine add-on. (roof panel sliding) Whoa! Okay, this looks great. I mean, even without the back off, this is cool. I feel like I'm ready to cruise at the beach. Oh man, I am peak influencer now. Let's go to the beach. (upbeat music) Does anybody want to be our friend? (upbeat music) Well, thank you guys so much for watching, I hope you enjoyed this video. I just wanted to show you guys this awesome Bronco and a huge thank you to Ford for letting us borrow this for the week, I've had the best time ever. Don't forget to like, comment, subscribe, hit the bell. I'll see you later. (upbeat music)",

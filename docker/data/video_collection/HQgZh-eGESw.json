    "transcript": "*intense clicking sounds* Hey how's it going, Dave2D here. So, MWC is happening right now. And there are few devices were announced. I'm just gonna go through some of them and giving my thoughts on them. The big one, flagship phone of this event was the Galaxy S9 from Samsung.And most the information from the announcment was leaked like way before the event. But IT is still a pretty cool phone. If you don't know much about it. Like some reason... it's same kind of design and shape as an S8 But there is four big things: it got a brighter screen Faster processor, stereo speakers and A significantly improved camera. Now the camera Looks pretty good on paper. Supposed to have a variable aperture from f/1.5 to f/2.4 . And just in name and terms, it just basically allows you to control how much light is hitting the sensor through a physical aperture change Which honestly sounds really neat but My gut feeling about this tech is that It's gonna be bit of a gimmick. And I may eat my words when I actually do my review on this thing. But, if you think about how this campaign has played out, I feel like Samsung",

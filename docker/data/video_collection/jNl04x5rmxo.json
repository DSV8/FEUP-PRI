    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to, THIS IS And who wants to be a techillionere, With our very special guest, Sarah Dietschy Rhymes with Peachey, Sarah. How's it going today? - What's up everyone, I'm a little bit nervous, So this is audience, Be nice, Be nice to me. Because out of all of the, \"Tech YouTubers\" I'm probably the most selective, With what I cover cause I'm lazy. - So the rules are very simple, We have 10 questions, That we're going to ask You about various different types of tech, And we're going to ask you to answer two questions About each one of these items of tech. First of all, The name of the piece of tech, And secondly, The year that this piece of tech was released, Now we are giving you a one-year handicap plus or minus. So if an item of tech came out in 2015, and you guys 2014 or 2016, You will get the point for that. - Okey it does We do have an optional wager, Which is very, Very straight forward. So out of these 10 questions, iIf you can get 50% correct, So that means if you got the year on every single one right in the name, wrong, Whatever the cases, any combination, But if you can get 10 points out of the possible 20, Then THE THIS IS account Will tweet whatever it is that you want. - Easy, Yes, 100%. - Alright. Are you ready to play? Who wants to be a techillionaire? Because we haven't gotten sued by ABC yet. - Oh yes. - (Clapping) Here we go. - Let's begin with item, Number, 1. - You guys photo-shopped out so much. So obviously it's a Sony RX100, It has the flash. It has, I mean, that looks like a hot shoe. So the lens looks like the 24 to 71, Not the newer ones, So I'm going to say RX100 Mark 3, But see, I'm going to fail on the dates, Cause I'm terrible at dates. I don't know any dates - Before you lock in your final answer, We do have a lifeline available to you, Which is Phone a Ken, where you can ask are wonderfully slash not very useful friend, Ken Blino But for help, But obviously with 10 questions, You may want to save that toward later, But just throwing it out there, You do have one lifeline available. - One Phone Ken, Okay. I haven't talked to Ken in a while, It'll be good to say hi, So for this one, I'm just going to guess, okay. RX100 Mark 3 I used that to vlog a ton in 2016, But it came out, I'm going to say 2015. So RX100 Mark 3 2015 For question Number 1, Sorry to say you get zero points, This is in fact the R200 Mark 2 from 2013, So the big tell with this one Is the Mark two is the only one that ever had the hot shoe After that, You're right. It did have the older lens, But I believe they replaced the hot shoe with the EVF, I think. - Oh, I didn't even think of that, The EVF, Oh my gosh, Okay, All right, Game on Austin, Let's go, Number 2. Oh gosh You know what? It's hilarious. I was so phone illiterate until probably like 2012, 2013. Um, so this like an eighth grade, I was rocking the Motorola rocker. - Ooh, nice. I don't even know what OS that is, I'm just going to like, Stab in the dark It's a Samsung phone from, 2000 and 9 You actually get 50% points. This is a 2009 phone, However, it is the Palm pre, This was a very beloved Phone by a lot of people, mostly because this was POLM being way ahead of their game, Right? So this had wireless charging in 2009, This had web OS, Which honestly, Both Android and iOS, Have pretty much just stolen, All the multitasking, You can see the cards here that was actually, Really, really well sort of implemented, And the other thing that Web OS had going for it Is the fact that it actually still lives in LG TVs now. So it has had a very strange life. - That's fascinating, Well, okay, I'm so disappointed that I got half points for that, But not the RX 100. - (laughing) - You're one for four. So you're still well in it, And keep in mind, You still have an earlier lifeline, But I'll give you a little hint. We do have a special bonus at the end, If you choose to take the rest. So just throwing it out there, You're you're you're in good shape, So let's move on, To item number 3. - Oh, digital blue, What's up, Yes, This is the digital blue, That was my first camera ever. Because it was so long ago, I don't even know what year that would be, I would have guessed, I would have gotten it for like a birthday or something, or Christmas, So I was still a young kid. - So I will say, We actually, Haven't been able to track down when this will come out either, So we know that you did a video on this, If you can give us the year of the video you made with this, Then we will give you points. - So for some reason, I remember that Citibank sponsored it, - For your digital blue video? - Yeah, How weird is that? Gosh, I'm going to probably say 2016 or 2017, So I'll just say, - 2017. - So Dietschy, You have full points, Yes. In fact, this is the digital blue movie creator that you create a video on sponsored by Citibank in 2017. - It came with its own software, And so I wasn't even an I movie or final cut you know, It was way before I learned all of those programs, So it really was my first experience, um, Where I would just like cut together home movies, And it would take pictures too. Um, And you would basically just hold down that trigger, It was like, almost like a gun, So you would hold it down like a trigger film, whatever you want, And then when you release, you release the button, It stopped. So, um, and you really felt like it was a super eight too, Cause you could like look through the viewfinder, Super crappy video. But um, yeah, it was my first experience with video. I was like, Oh, I like this. - Hey look, you know what? You guys start somewhere. Honestly, my first camera was, uh, Well, my first real camera was the Xacti. It was this sort of same kind of thing. It always looked like a taser. But man, I mean, look in those early days, kids got it easy these days Let's stupid smartphones that shoot 4K video, Like get outta here, Man. So I'm actually happy to say, You are now tied your three of six points. So you are well in it right now. - Alright. Alright. - Alright. Let's move on to item number 4. - Oh, that's a good looking phone, I'm so bad with Android phones, For some reason, Like my first reaction was Sony for some reason, But I feel like that's wrong. I don't even know what brand to guess. - Do keep in mind, to keep in mind, You still have your phone a Ken available. - Okay. I'm going to phone a ken, Let's do it, Hello? Is this phone aken? - It is Phone a Ken How's it going? Okay. I'm heavily relying on you for this, This phone Cause I have no idea what it is, - It is the essential phone. - All right, - 100% final answer Essential phone, I'll say 2019. - Okay, wait, So you're locking in 2019 essential Phone? - Sure, Yes. - Ken was right about the Phone actually, No, it's from 2017, So you get one point on that one. - I mean, That looks pretty, Nice for 2017 That was the company that the Google guy did, Right? - Yes. So there's a lot Lou going for the essential phone, So first of all, This was one of the first phones that brought in a notch. So this was before the iPhone 10, It actually had pretty much a full screen display, It also had a ceramic build and it was sorry. It had a ceramic back panel and it was made of titanium. Sarah, I'm happy to report. We're almost halfway through, And you were still at 50%, So you were well within the threshold, Of winning the game, How are you feeling right now? - I'm feeling good, I feel like I'm at a point where now if I get all the answers wrong, It's not completely embarrassing. - Okay, Okay, - (Loughing) I mean you're not zero for 20, That's always a good sign, Well, let's move on then to item number 5. - Ooh, look at those bezels okay, So it's for sure a surface, Is that a surface pro or surface go, The keyboard is super thin and it doesn't seem like a legit, Like a legit keyboard, I feel like maybe it's the first surface go. I want to say 2017 or something, But those bezels just look so dated. I'm going to say 2016. - I'm sorry to say, That is incorrect, This is actually the very first surface ever, So it was the 2012 Microsoft surface, And one of the main tells you're right, The keyboard was very bizarre. That was before they actually had like the nicer sort of chiclet keys, But also this ran windows RT, So it wasn't, It was before windows 10, It wasn't even really full windows eight, It was windows RT, And the main problem with this, Is that it didn't really run anything - Interesting, well am learning lot. - Let's move on to item number 6. - Oh Austin, Did we do something with this together? - What, Maybe, possibly, I don't know Because I am honestly, I'm terrible with phones. I really am. But this was actually a really fun experience with you and Jonathan, And we basically interviewed each other And this phone came into play. So I'm just going to guess the year, and maybe you can give me partial points, Huawei honor V something, And the year that we did that was probably, Hold on, I'm doing math, And we were in our apartment in hell's kitchen, And that was my second apartment in New York, So I think that was 2018. - You don't know, I'll give you points on that one, So it is the 2017 honor view 10 - Oh 2017. - Yes. I'm going to give you one point on that one So the thing is, Of course this was one of those campaigns we did where, It was, I remember going into it legitimately, Not even knowing what to expect. I remember I walked upstairs to that little set that they had built and you were there. I was like, Oh sweet. - (laughing) Yeah - So at this point you were still very much in it, So by my count, 5 of 12, You are very, very close to being in this game, Are you ready to move on to item number 7? - Yup. Here we go. Oh, okay. All right, That looks, it looks like it has more buttons in the C 200. So maybe it's like a C 300? - Hey everyone, It's me, Jimmy, If you didn't know, I edit all of this is videos and I'm actually working on this one. You're watching right now. So Sarah's camera cut off while she was answering this question, she said the C 100 and it's the C 200, I just wanted to let you know, That she didn't get the points. So let's get back to the video Item. Number 8, please. - I didn't have a laptop until 2012, That's when I got my first Mac book pro, I built my entire YouTube channel on that, But before that I only had like Dell's and one iMac, So my computer game pre 2012 is really weak, I want to say 2007 and it was just a pre Mac book. So I know I'm going to get the name wrong, But that's what I'll say for the year, I mean, wasn't power book of thing, But I feel like that was even before. So I'll just say, Power book, This is embarrassing. - I'm sad to say, I can't give you points on this one This was you actually, You were right on the laptop, But it's the Apple iBook, iBook G4 from 2003. It was the first laptop with this sort of design language, It had, So this was the 12 inch model that we have here, which had like the full size keyboard. It was very similar to the power book of the time, But that was aluminum and this was a plastic. - Okay. I have to say the fact that I was looking for the windows and command key, And you guys Photoshop that out is ridiculous. - I didn't Move anything around on the keyboard, - Are you it? I want to get you a point for that one, Just because of Matt being nefarious on this, I feel like if you're, If you know, to look for a command Key, and windows key, you should at least be able to get points for that differentiation, Matt. - (laughing) - Okay. All right. You know what? I will do that Then Here you go, You get, You get one mat point here. Let's move on to phone number 9. - Oh, it looks like a Samsung Galaxy S7 Maybe or S87 S8 S7. I do not Know, I'll go with that. A galaxy was my first phone, so I have a special space in my heart for it. And I'm going to say 20, I'm going to say say 2016. - This is the Samsung galaxy S 8 2017. So you get 50% points on this one. - Damn. I was so close, cause. So the S7 I did do the three 360 video And I remember it still having a button, That video has like 7 million views on my YouTube channel, Me jumping out of a plane and Samsung 360 - Oh brag about it, Geez. - I'm just flexing on you guys - Well speaking of flexing and everyone, why don't we move on to our final item? - (Laughing) Yeah, I got so frustrated with my 2016 MacBook pro and I just went full on, I want to build a PC, I want to try this world out, And so you were one of the first people I reached out to And I was like, Okay, I'm friendly with Austin, He's super nice, Maybe he will help me out, And I will have to say, I don't think I have ever thanked you for that video because I was so naive how long that, that was going to take, I felt so bad. - It all comes back around. Cause now you are on the scenes. So for this question, It's actually three points available. So obviously there are a lot of components that went to the system. I'm looking for three answers, The year that we did the video, The processor, and the graphics card, You get one point for each of those, So if you can get two of those three, Then you are a tech illionaire. - I like half, know each one, So it's all going to be a guest. It's like all a blur, I know that it was an AMD Ryzen chip because I remember the irony of putting in a thread ripper on this PC and probably like Intel seeing it, And then we both did a huge Intel campaign, This is so sad, Cause I feel like I'm not going to get it right. Okay. I'm just going to say Nvidia RTX 1080 And then the year that we shot this video, I'm going to say 20 17. - So this is actually a little bit tricky, So I will say yes, 2017, you get points for that. You were very close on the CPU and the graphics card. It is a 1080, But it's a GTX, Not an RTX, But I'm gonna give you half points for that. And it is a Ryzen7, But it is not a thread ripper, It is just a Ryzen7. I believe this was a 1700 X. I'm gonna give you half points on both. Which means that you are successfully a winner of the, who wants to be a tech illionaire game. This is so exciting. I would like to thank everyone out there, Who's believed in me, I like to thank my mom, I like to think of my cat. - I know you're basking in your victory, However, the game's not over just yet, Because we have a bonus round, Right now. You're going to get a tweet from THIS IS Right. If you can walk away with the tweet, no harm, no foul. However, if you want to go double or nothing, There's no penalty. If you lose, If you lose, You walk away with nothing, You don't have to do anything. It's a clean slate. But if you win, You get a 32nd ad spot in a future. THIS IS Video, Where we will say literally whatever you want and you can send us a script. We will read it word for word, But there's no handicaps. So you have to get not only the item, But also the year. Exactly Right, So it's up to you. If you want to go double or nothing or you can feel Absolutely great walking away as the winner of the game, We can't take that away from you, - I will tweet you guys anyways, So let's go ahead and do double or nothing. - All right, It's time Sarah is ready to do double or nothing. So our 11th and final question For the extra bonus victory. Is this? - Yeah. Okay. All right. So my, my first reaction was crap because, it both looks like a DJI, But not a DJI Drone at the same time, Oh wait, This one doesn't break down, Okay, So I do recognize that's probably the battery, But I don't remember any DJI, Drones having a battery like that. But the only thing that's tripping me up is that, Battery Oh my gosh. What is the smaller one? Its Not not the air, So there's the pro, There's the air, But there's that, There's the one that did not fold down. That was really miniature. I'm just going to go with DJI, Mavic mini It's, The best guests that I have, Was it would be like the smallest one. And then the year I'm just going to say 2017, - Sarah, In all the games we've played For who wants to be a tech illionaire? I've never had a question come down like this, It is a DJI drone, It did come out in 2017, It is the smallest in the line, This is the DJI Spark, NOOOOO I feel so bad, You literally like the thought process was perfect. You literally like, okay, It's DJI because of the blades. Like you literally made all the way until you hit mini, - My, Okay. So that means I just get a ten second spot, Right, You know what, that's fair. You get a ten second spot On THIS IS, I will completely give you that, That was heartbreaking, I was stuck, Oh my God. You're like, You're getting it. You're getting it. And you said 2017 was like, Oh, - Oh the spark. Yeah, Because that was, that was the only one that I didn't own. So I was like, Because I don't recognize the bottom, It would have to be that one. I would absolutely not been close on this, Because every DJ I drawn looks exactly the same to me, - Sarah, Well-played and congratulations on all your victory. But your ten second, THIS IS spot, We looked forward to the script. You have to send us - If you have time, I feel like it would be legendary, If you came on my podcast again But just you, And then the spot, We can promote it. With the 10 second spot, - Oh, what a ? You were really a good influencer, You know that that's very impressive. Sarah, can you tell people, How they can find you on the internet? You can Google Sarah peachy if you're lazy, But then everything else, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube is Sara Dietschy. Bm, but no one knows how to spell that. - I look forward to being on the podcast, I look forward to coming up with a very creative ad spot, for episode of the podcast. - I feel like I want you to be a part of it, So we'll do it on the podcast. We'll come up with a fun 10 seconds. - Congratulations, Sarah, On winning, who wants to be a tech illionaire, Of course, everyone feel free to go subscribe and as always, thank you very much for watching this episode of THIS IS, Sarah, Would you like to play us out with, a wonderful outro of your choosing? - Guys, Thank you so much for tuning in, This is what an amazing YouTube channel Austin and the gang Has been killing it.

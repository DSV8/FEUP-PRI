    "description": "Disclaimer: This video is for educational purposes only.  Only attack WiFi networks that you own or have permission to attack.  HackerD explains that Airodump-ng is used for packet capture, capturing raw 802.11 frames. It is particularly suitable for collecting WPA/WPA2 handshakes for the intent of using them with aircrack-ng.  Commands used (Change WiFi BSSID as needed):  1. iw dev 2. Find the Wi-Fi Interface name. In this case it is wlan0mon and my Wi-Fi adapter is already in monitor mode. 3. sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon 4. ctrl + c 5. sudo airodump-ng --bssid C2:0A:0F:DE:E0:71 --band abg wlan0mon    #shorts #wifi #kalilinux",

    "transcript": "Did you know that we can capture all the Wi-Fi packets and raw 802.11 frames that are within the range of our Wi-Fi adapter? We can use a tool that is part of the aircrack -ng suite called airodump -ng. I run the command iw dev to see the name of my Wi-Fi interface and show that my Wi-Fi adapter is in monitor mode I run the command sudo airodump -ng wlan0mon airodump -ng will now start to list all the Wi-Fi networks and clients that are in range airodump -ng will continue to sniff packets until we exited using control+ C. We can also run airodump -ng on a specific Wi-Fi network. We use the command sudo airodump -ng bssid Mac address of Wi-Fi network followed by the interface name a specific Wi-Fi network will not necessarily remain on one channel and we might rather use the band option where it stands for 5 GHz and B and G are for 2.4 GHz as you can see there's a lot of information that we can gather using airodump -ng",

    "transcript": "So we just landed here in Amsterdam for the Mercedes A-Class car reveal, but there's a pit stop first that we need to make to show off one of the most unique cars I've ever seen, one-of-a-kind Tesla, which could be the last ride anyone would ever take.... ... A hearse. [Intro] So the reason I say this is the last ride you could ever take is because this is a silent, modern, and very stylish farewell. This Model S Tesla converted into a hearse. We'll take it for a spin here in a second, but this is literally one-of-a-kind. They've taken the Model S, which you can see here in the front part, and they sliced it in half, extended the body, this is a rear wheel drive, and added the back half. So here in the back, this is where the coffin would lay. And there are spots for flowers and stuff. You can take the coffin and slide it along those rollers inside. In the book about Elon, he says he wants to die on Mars, but if he ends up dying here on earth, this might be a valuable option. So obviously the Tesla does not have a motor in the front, so there's the front space which you could put different things there. And then they've also...when they extended the body of the Tesla, this might be the same hinges that they used for the previous door. They just, you know, have a half door instead of the full door. And then you can put different funeral stuff in here that they use for that. Then these rails right here are for the flowers. Alright, so coming around here to the back of the Tesla, this opens up and this is where the coffins are stored. So if I were to grab right here, this whole thing slides out and I believe locks into place. Then the coffin is slid over these rollers all the way back into the very back, and then this is placed here and locked in to keep the coffin from sliding around. And then this is where the coffin would sit, you know, on it's final journey to the grave site or the graveyard. Then obviously, the whole thing slides out so people can grab it on either side and do the carrying. And then if we want to put it back in...perfect. Let's take this hearse for a spin. Alright, so pretty much just like a normal car. We're going to jump inside. It's got the huge display up front, just like other Model S's and the Model 3 have. It's got the same dashboard that we saw inside of Dan's Model X. And we are moving. So here in the front it looks pretty much the same as other Tesla's that we've seen. But over in the back is where things start to get a little bit different. We have the compartment back there for the coffin. So how fast is this thing? [Driver] Well... [speeds up] [Zack] Ha ha ha! Okay, so the acceleration on this thing is the exact same as the Tesla. It has as much get up as a regular Model S. This is pretty sweet. One thing I do like is that they kept the aluminum side panels because the Tesla's use aluminum body panels. And then they kept the glass top. So you know, you've seen in the Model 3 and the Model X it has the glass roof in the back. And so I like the aesthetics as the glass goes back over the top. This is my first time in a hearse. This is the fastest hearse that I will probably ever be in. So the company that designed this hearse specializes in funerals, and they have quite a selection of different hearses that they use for funerals. So if you have a funeral here in the Netherlands to take care of, this might be a valid option for you. That is it for the Model S Tesla. Now we are off to the Mercedes event to check out their A-Class. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and oh my goodness, the Apple iPhone 14 rumors are heating up and now, here we are on MacRumors and it's saying that Apple is planning to hold the iPhone 14 event on September 7th, so I guess mark your calendars. Most of the time, a lot of these rumor sites, they're pretty accurate and pretty true, so I am definitely putting in my calendar, September 7th. I haven't really been looking at the iPhone 14 rumors and I just kind of glanced to take a little peek to see what people are saying and see what everyone thinks is gonna be released because like it's almost time like September 7th is going to be here before we know it and even if the event isn't September 7th, September is iPhone season and I'm so here for it, you all know that. So let's take a quick look and see what some of the rumors are for the 2022 iPhone lineup. So this is sad for anybody who was an iPhone mini fan, it said that they're gonna be eliminating the 5.4-inch mini phone as it turned out to be unpopular with customers, but here's the thing, how unpopular it may have been is probably equally as popular as it is with the people who are super into the iPhone mini so I don't know, I still feel like there's a market for it, so I guess if you do want the mini, you're gonna have to stick with the iPhone 13 because it looks like- The sizing though for the flagships, they're expecting to see a 6.1-inch iPhone 14, a 6.1-inch iPhone 14 Pro, 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Max, and a 6.7-inch 14 Pro Max, yeah, okay, let's just keep going, let's keep scrolling. No notch and new Face ID hardware design, Pro only. Rather than just a single hole-punch cutout, Apple's working on a design that will incorporate both a pill-shaped cutout and a circular cutout. The circular cutout will likely house the Face ID dot projector and the pill-shaped cutout will work to include the front camera, Face ID, infrared camera, and possibly other components. Hm, interesting. So something that Samsung has been doing a really great job of is they're under-display camera. I think they did an incredible job on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold. Yes, Fold, Flip, Fold, I keep getting them confused even though I know in my mind one folds and one flips. I'm trying. The Fold has a really great under-display camera and it doesn't seem like that is something that Apple is doing this year. Although it's says, \"Apple may be planning to put some of the Face ID hardware under the phone's display, which will cut down on the size of the cutouts that are needed and will leave more available screen space on the front of the device.\" ProMotion display, there were early iPhone 14 rumors suggesting that all four iPhone 14 models would offer ProMotion, but it looks like that's not going to happen. Okay, right, well I guess we'll move on now, that our dreams have been crushed. Likely to restrict ProMotion to the 14 Pro models only, okay, a move that may suggest that there's a lack of availability of the necessary displays, which also could be a possibility. The body design, oh yes, let's see it. The iPhone 14 models are expected to look like the iPhone 13 models, with the same flat edge design. I feel like I'm kind of ready for a change, I'm ready for something new, but here's the thing, like this version of the iPhone, it's pretty great. So it's like how much do you change? How much do you try to iterate on something that is already so good just for the sake of trying to do something different than the previous version? I don't know, it's pretty great. I think this phone looks incredible. Here, this says, \"A photo that allegedly depicts molds of Apple's upcoming iPhone 14 surfaced back in April,\" so this is giving us kind of a clear view of the sizing, which looks very, very similar to this one. So here's a set of cases, the 14, 14 Pro, 14 Plus, 14 Pro Max. So here's some color options, the purple is- Is that purple? A purple shade that has a unique finish that shifts tone based on lighting conditions. I clearly am into the color purple, also, the Bora color on the new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, freaking beautiful. I mean, these devices look almost identical. I mean, I know these are renders, but that looks just like the iPhone 13. Titanium, oh interesting. Apple's upcoming iPhone 14 models are expected to come with a high-end titanium alloy according to investors. Apple has used titanium for the Apple Watch, but this would mark the first time that the material has been used for an iPhone. I've actually not purchased the titanium Apple Watch before. I've always got either the steel or the ceramic. The ceramic Apple Watch, still to this day, is my absolute favorite and I kind of hope and wish that they bring it back. Honestly, if there was a ceramic iPhone, I probably would also be very into that, so. Hmm, if they did a ceramic Apple Watch and a ceramic iPhone, oh my gosh, I would probably pass out. Starting in 2022, high-end iPhone models are likely to adopt a vapor chamber thermal system. Let's hear it for the vapor chamber thermal system, which Apple has said to be aggressively testing. I'm sure many of you guys have experienced this, but trying to do something on your phone in a hot, sunny day, the screen starts to dim, it is absolutely the most frustrating, infuriating thing ever because I end up not even being able to see the screen. I don't care if my battery dies quicker, I need this screen to be brighter and I need my phone to not overheat. So definitely very interested to see how this thermal system holds up on the new iPhones. Lightning port, is this gonna be the time? Are we here? Are we finally gonna get rid of Lightning? So they are saying that from the dummy models that it looks like it's gonna be a Lightning port. USB-C is a little bit larger so I guess you would kind of be able to tell. So I'm still holding out, I think that this is the year we're gonna get USB-C and if it isn't, that's fine. I love setting my expectations high and then getting them crushed, that's why I don't, I normally set them super low and then anything that happens is always so much cooler. So this is a dummy model right here of the iPhone 14 and this is the iPhone 13 Pro blue. So yeah, looks very similar, but again, how do you mess with perfection? Here are some front glass panels, so this is showing that notch-less design here on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. So it looks like the 14 Max and the regular 14, still have the notch. Pro's, notch is gone. Camera technology, let's talk about it. All of the 2022 iPhones, I also can't believe it's 2022. I wrote 2021 the other day and I just had to stop and I couldn't believe it, I was like, \"We're in 2022, baby.\" We're set to see improvements with the ultra wide camera. The iPhone 14 Pro models will see significant improvements to the wide angle and updates to the telephoto lens. It's believed that we could get a 48-megapixel wide camera. Yeah, that would be a huge upgrade 'cause it's currently 12 and 8K video recording capabilities. I do feel like 8K shooting on phones is kind of gimmicky because you're not really getting the full capacity of this footage. Yes, I'm excited about that happening, but also, for everyday consumers, it's gonna be a burden. You're going to be filling up the storage on your phone, which is already- They're talking about needing to add a 2-terabyte option, which you're gonna have to especially if you are shooting this 8K content, but what is great is now with 5G and finally kind of getting to a place where it is starting to be more places. You'll be able to start storing this stuff in the Cloud and to be able to upload and download as needed, so it won't have to be actually stored on device. I think that's really the only way that this is gonna make sense. I mean, most people, like my parents, I don't think you're gonna be recording 8K content, I mean, they might be 'cause they're my parents, but most people's parents or grandparents are not gonna be recording 8K videos of whatever it is that they're filming. 8K video recording feature will allow iPhone-recorded videos displayed on an 8K display or TV to provide a better user experience and that the resolution will allow the iPhone to create videos, images more suitable for augmented, and mixed reality devices like AR and VR headsets that Apple has in development. Oh, this is cool. That is actually a good point. I think the thing that I love so much about the iPhone and sort of being in the Apple ecosystem is the future of AR. With their Lidar and all of the things that they've been doing with ARKit, I'm super, super excited to kind of see the route that they take with AR because they've been kind of implementing this into the Dev Kits and kind of getting people ready and kind of getting developers to sort of think a little bit differently and to think larger like, \"What can you guys actually do with this?\" So hmm, okay, all right, yep. As for the front camera technology, all of the iPhone 14 models coming this year are expected to feature an upgraded front lens with a wider f/1.9 aperture and autofocus capabilities. A wider aperture would allow for more light to pass through the lens to reach the sensor for sharper, crisper photos, and improved depth of field. So keeping in mind that people are using these things for a lot more than selfies, I think is really important. People are taking classes like we're still in the age of not everyone is going back to work, not everyone is going back to school. So many things are now digital and happening from home or from remote places that this is like your key to the outside world. I mean, I basically could function perfectly fine if I lost everything. If I didn't have a computer, if I didn't have anything, I could continue making YouTube videos, I could do everything from this phone, and that is so empowering. The A16 chip, new iterations of the iPhone, typically come with an updated A-series chip, but Apple might deviate. (gasps) Oh, so only the iPhone 14 Pro models will get a new and faster A16 chip. It says that the standard iPhone 14 models will continue to use the same A15 Bionic that's in the iPhone 13 models. I mean, I think it kind of makes sense because honestly, if you can still push the boundaries of this A15 and not need to go to the A16, I don't know, I'm not sure, I don't know how I feel about that. Like I'm trying to think it's okay, is it okay? I don't know, I don't think I'm gonna actually know until I actually see the device and see how it works, see how it operates. Is this gonna cut down costs for people? Will this get new devices in the hands of more people because they're able to cut down costs and not use the newest, latest, fastest chip? I don't know. They're saying here, though, that these new devices even if they are using the A15 Bionic chip, will still get an overall performance boost thanks to updated cellular modem, a new internal design, and other updates, which could see it offering faster performance, which totally makes sense. If you're kind of reconfiguring everything in here, and if you are getting- I think they said that the Pros would be the only one that has the new thermal, so that would actually make sense because you're not gonna need the new thermals if you're still using the A15 Bionic chip. So yeah, that makes sense. Hm, understand, I see you now. Both the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro models will feature six gigs of RAM, which is the same amount available in 13 Pro models. Okay, all right. Car crash detection, they're working on a car crash detection feature with the iPhone and the Apple Watch, which could come out in 2022. It will use sensors like the accelerometer to detect car accidents when they occur by measuring a spike in gravitational force. I think that's actually pretty incredible because a lot of times, you know, you're not able to get to your device if something traumatic like this happens and I think that's what I've loved so much about the Apple Watch, is their fall detect and all of those kinds of things that can help people when they're not able to help themselves, so I'm really excited about that. Snapdragon X65 Modem, this is the world's first 10-gigabit 5G modem and antenna system for smartphones. Satellite connectivity, you have my attention. The Qualcomm Snapdragon X65 enables some satellite connectivity features and alongside the modem, Apple plans to implement satellite-based emergency features that will let users send texts in emergency situations and report major emergencies in areas where there is no cellular coverage. I've talked about this before. I used to have one of the Garmin emergency cellular little devices, I forget what they're called, but I love this thing. I haven't been hiking as much in remote places, so I have disconnected my service. I would take this everywhere. I would take it on hikes, I would take it traveling because just knowing that I had this backup device in case this little guy did not have cell reception, so that will be really great if I'm able to do that on my iPhone and even if this is an added extra service or a charge, that would be definitely worth it especially if you do things like remote hiking or go places where there is no cell reception, such a great idea. WiFi 6E, two-terabyte storage, no physical Sim slot, iPhone 14 pricing, so it's expected to be starting in price at 799, which is the same starting price for the iPhone 13. They don't have plans to increase the cost of the entry-level smartphone. That's good, that's nice. Oh boy, wowie, future iPhone rumors, oh my goodness, like we haven't even got through the iPhone 14 and we're already talking about like future iPhones. 2023 iPhones are expected to feature the same. Will have a dual cut- Okay, so we're still talking about this, USB-C. They're saying that in 2023, Apple will finally do USB-C. I'm still holding out for this year, still holding out. In-house modem chips, would make sense that Apple would probably go this route since they are doing that with our Apple silicone, so it would make sense that- But hey, if we can do this, why can't we do this? You're Apple, you can literally do anything you want. You can do it all, you can have it all, your empire. Periscope lens, if a periscope telephoto lens is not ready to debut in 2022, it could be introduced in the 2023 models. Under-display Face ID, they're saying that the components like the infrared camera will not be moved under the display until 2023 or 2024. Foldable phone, yeah, it's not gonna happen. I mean, I would literally- I don't even know what I would do if Apple announced a folding phone in upcoming weeks. I don't even know, I don't know. I would be so absolutely shook that I probably- I don't even know. I feel like I would shoot up out of my seat so quickly that you would think that there was a SpaceX rocket that took off from my home because that's how incredibly shook I would be. Potentially, I don't know, I don't think it's gonna happen. Of course, they're gonna start, it's Apple. They're working on so many secret things we will never know. We will never know, but I'm pretty sure it's safe to say that they're definitely working on something foldable. Let's pop over to 9to5Mac's, see if they have any other photos that we can take a look at. That looks beautiful. No notch, but oh yeah, look at that, I love these colors, that's beautiful. No Touch ID, mm, yeah, I know. I am a little salty about that because you did it in the iPad Air like you could easily make this power button Touch ID. Maybe not easily, but like you can do it. I definitely would've loved to have had Touch ID over the past couple of years especially when wearing a mask was pretty much a daily occurrence. It's saying, \"Apple has faced lower than expected development process on its work to integrate Touch ID in the phone's display,\" we don't need it in the display, put on the power button. I don't care if it's in the display, power button. iPhone 14 to offer biggest camera updates in years, yes. Camera bump is here to stay so these are all some prototypes, I mean, it looks exactly like the iPhone 13. It actually also looks like the iPhone 12, so I don't even know. So that, my friends, is the iPhone 14 rumor round up, you guys heard it here first from MacRumors and 9to5Mac. I'm obviously very excited about the next iPhone. I feel like a lot of tech reviewers, maybe myself included, a lot of my friends, and people in the industry, we've become incredibly jaded because we see so much tech so quickly and that is not the case for an everyday consumer. Most people do not upgrade their phones every single year and I'm very grateful that I'm able to do that. I think we sometimes take for granted the huge upgrades that people are going from older devices. A lot of these updates, yeah, they are incremental and it's not something that you need to have, but what I love seeing is people who have devices who they haven't updated in five, six years, get these new devices and it is just so exciting to sort of see that joy and see what a huge upgrade that is from those older phones, so that is something that I'm looking forward to. Well, thank you guys so much for watching, I am so excited because it is tech season, it is iPhone season so if you haven't already subscribed, please do so and hit the Bell so you'll be notified when I post new videos. I will, of course, have all sorts of Apple content, but I also have a bunch of other tech videos coming out, so stay tuned and look for those very, very shortly and if you'd like, feel free to leave a comment below as well and I would love to hear from you. What are you most looking forward to in the iPhone 14? I'll see you guys in my next video, bye. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "What's up, guys! Lew here back with another video... and today i'm back with something unusual as you've come to expect here on Unbox Therapy. This is a big...giant thing. I have been addressed; things show up. Alright. Don't send me anything that's alive. Those are the kind of the rules. A giant Bluetooth speaker! You may have seen it; you may have heard of it. It's called Mars by Crazy Baby, In the past, I've done things that float before. This is no exception. So, if you like things that float, then this might float your boat. God dammit. this thing kinnda look like a mac pro is this upside down? jack i blame you so the way these things work usually what you end up with is a unit like this the saucer the flying saucer and this guy is gonna probably your hi end and then this big tube portion is like gonna be your low end some USBs on the back, jack you can try pick that up USB on the back jack, so you can charge two devices power brick here now this guy i guess how is it, what are we aaaahh so that's smart it's kinda fits on the top and stays charged that way let's power it up and see what the deal is i assume that means that this guy on the top is charging and there's a power switch on the back and i'm going to press that now some indicators here that means it has its own power switch it does have a switch on it? (Starting up sound) bit of an odd nothings floatin' up. Don't you make me read the manual god damn Charge before using Mars for the first time. Well, we are doing that now But, I'm guessing, the reason we are not levitating right now is one of the two is lacking some juice Rolly Polly!!! Alright....uhm listen. I'm back Apparently I don't know how to charge things up When I hit the button. The power switch Look! Look at that! Woooooooo! Oh! I gotta move this way. Look at that! Okay! Time for some bangers! (SONG PLAYS FROM SPEAKERS) I don't know. I think it's cool. Right. It looks cool. Look at it. It's all fancy. The way it goes up and down, you hit the button I mean it's like a spaceship. You gotta spaceship now Spins down! Hits it. Starts charging. That thing is portable. You take it with you Meh! Sound - not so great. Uhmm.. Go check out my other bluetooth speaker videos for some of the better values there But if you need to float You're on those floaty vibes. This is probably as good as it gets (MUSIC)",

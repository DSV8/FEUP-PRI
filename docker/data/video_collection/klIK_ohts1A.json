    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today we're gonna be talking about some of the things that I wish I would've had when I was going to college. It's crazy how much time has passed but it's also crazy how much technology has changed in those short years. And by short, I mean like 14 or 15 years. (chuckling) One of the things that has stayed consistent through all of those years, even through college, is I always went to Best Buy for all of my tech, all of my gaming needs, which makes this video even more exciting for me because I actually got to partner with Best Buy to make this for you guys. So a huge thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this video and making this possible. And if you guys have been around for a long time, you guys know that this is not new information that I'm such a huge fan so this is so, so exciting. In preparing for this video, I was kind of going down memory lane and just thinking about all of the things that happened in college and how much easier things are now, as far as technology. Everything has become so much more accessible. We didn't even have cameras then. We had to rent them or check them out because an actual decent camera then was so incredibly expensive that it was just not attainable for any college student. Now you can shoot a feature film on your phone. Another great thing that Best Buy has is student deals so if you are a student and you are going back to school, they have a bunch of exclusive deals that will get you guys the best prices on tech. All you have to do is text 332211 to sign up. Another thing that's great is they have fast store pickup. So a lot of times, I don't have time to wait for something to be shipped. You could just go online, look it up, and then you could pick it up in the store. And they also have a price-match guarantee so if you do find something that is cheaper somewhere else, you can go in and say hello, can you match this price? That was me holding up a flyer or something, I don't know. Let's go head into Best Buy now and see what kind of things I found. (relaxed triphop music) (upbeat hiphop music) This is the one that I was looking at online so this is the ASUS 15.6\" gaming laptop. And if you guys are trying to convince your parents into getting you a gaming laptop, parents, you can do more on it than just play games. That just means it's really super powerful and incredible but they'll able to do their homework faster. But it also means you can play games too, so don't lie. Thank you. Our first purchase. So I'm kind of looking for a crossover bag, something that I can use for my computer but also for putting my cameras and stuff in. This looks very nice, actually. There's a lot of places to put things. I'm gonna do this one, unless I find another one that I like more. One of the things that I definitely wish I had in college was a printer of my own because I'd always have to go to the computer labs and it was such a stressful situation. Everyone was printing stuff. But this is really exciting because I saw this one. This is the HP Tango X wireless printer. What I love about this is it's a smart printer so it does connect A-L-E-X-A. You can kind of hide it so it doesn't look like a printer so if you are in a smaller space, like a dorm or an apartment, you can kinda neatly tuck it away. It connects wirelessly. You can connect it to your smart phone so you can basically take it anywhere, print and scan, which is so amazing. Not only would I have loved to have it in college, but I'm going to enjoy having it in my adult life. Yes, okay, here they are. So these are the Turtle Beach Atlas Elite headphones. Of course, they are for gaming but you can also use them for, y'know, listening to audio books or whatever it is that you want to convince your parents and tell them yeah, this is important, I need this for my (yelling) homework. Oh my gosh, it's so loud! Can you hear me? I mean, can I hear you? I can't hear you. Hyped. Can't wait to listen to audiobooks with them. So smart home tech is something that I'm extremely into and we definitely did not have any of this stuff when I went to school. But I am such a huge fan of Phillips Hue. You can control your lights, the color temperature, everything, so it can really change the entire ambiance of your dorm room. They have so many different things to pick from now. So I'm gonna go with one of these light strips. I love these because you can put them under your bed, behind your TV, so you can really put these anywhere. And I'm also gonna grab two, oh they're on sale, two of these Phillips Hue light bulbs. Thank you. These are my absolute favorite hard drives. These are the Samsung portable solid-state drives. This is the T5. These are so fast. I edit almost all of my videos directly off of these drives. Now depending upon what you're doing, you might not need a drive that is this fast, but I think a portable hard drive is something that everyone should invest in. You should always make sure that you have your files backed up, especially if you are writing papers or something like that. And if you don't save things on a hard drive, make you're saving in the Cloud somewhere, email the files to yourself, but you do not want to be stuck with a crashed computer or a crashed hard drive and then you lose all of your hard work because I have definitely been there and it is not fun. My mom's gonna be like are you going back to school or are you gonna start joining any sports leagues? Both, mom! Let's go take a look at the coffee makers. (gasping) Keurig has a coffee and latte maker? This would've, first of all, saved me so much money at Starbucks because I could've made my own lattes. Maybe I just get this. Ooh, back to school. I'm so happy. (giggling) We're on a mission. I'm looking for a surge protector because one of the things we always ran into at school, especially living in a dorm, is we needed outlets. We have some regular power strips and then this one's an actual surge protector so we're gonna get this one (singing) and it's on sale. All right, let's check out. I think I got everything I need, plus a few extras. Let's go home and unbox. Here's our laptop. Let's open it up. I cannot tell you guys how much I wish that I had a PC when I was in college. Most of the programs that we used were all on PC. I didn't even have a laptop at all so I spent so much time in the computer lab. I could've spent it at home with my roommate, who I actually got along with. So this is the ASUS 15.6\" gaming laptop. This has AMD Ryzen 7, 16 gigs of RAM. Wow, this is a nice finish on the top of it. (crinkling) Look at you. So, of course, this will be powerful enough that you can play games on it and, of course, powerful enough to do any of your homework. I do remember, I think it was my second year of college was when I started really getting back into video games again. The first year, I focused so much on my work, which, yes, is very important. If I would've had this, I could've done my work and played games at the same time, sort of. (hypnotic hiphop music) Next up, we have the Turtle Beach Elite Atlas. These are some headphones that I definitely wish that I would've had. Let's open them up. Oh wow, these look nice. Oh, yeah. These are super comfy. (hypnotic hiphop music) This is something that I definitely wish I would've had was a printer and this is actually something that I wish that I currently would've had in my life. I am so excited to test this printer out. The one that I have is such an absolute nightmare so this is honestly so perfect. Look at you. So I have the app all downloaded and this is pretty much set up and ready to go so I'm gonna go put this in my office and I'm gonna try the first test print. Are you ready? (hypnotic hiphop music) Oh, did you know there's a printer here? You probably didn't because of its little (giggling) hide and seek cover. Look how awesome this thing is. So this is where you put the paper in. I've got some of this little printer photo paper. Maddie, we're gonna print a picture of you and I'm gonna print this right from the app. So here it is, it auto-changed the paper size and now we're just gonna hit print. (whirring) Have you ever seen anything more amazing, Maddie? You're gonna be coming out of there. What is that? Maddie, is that you? Maddie, what is that? It's a picture of you when we went on the hike the other day. Look at you! This actually looks really good. It's so great! Are you over it, bud? Okay, bye bye. I really like this printer a lot. It also has an ink subscription so depending on how much you print a month, you can get a subscription and it will only send you ink when you need it. (whispering) Genius. These things are so incredible. I have them all over my house and I don't even think this kind of technology was around when I was in school. But what's great about this is it can kind of turn your dorm room or your house or wherever it is that you are and give you a much more ambient feel. You can change the color of the lights. You could put these basically anywhere. The light strips are probably my favorite. They come with just this little power adapter. This has double-sided tape on it so you can just peel off the tape and stick it wherever you want it. This is something that I actually picked up on the way out. This is a silicon carrying case for your Air Pods. I always am trying to find my Air Pods in my bag and I love having the little clip to just hook everything onto. Look at that. So you can just pop your Air Pods right into this, clip them to your keys, your gym bag, and never lose them. You can never have enough surge protectors in your dorm or your apartment or your house. I'm constantly always looking for outlets. I travel with these things. You're gonna need one of these. Oh look at this. - What, it gives you a cup? - [Justine] It's for the milk, for the frothing. - I'm new to this. - [Justine] Anything else in there? - [Friend] No. - Ooh! - Oh, it's beautiful. - [Justine] This is a nice nickel, yes. - [Friend] Maybe is it brushed nickel? - [Justine] Maybe. - It might just be nickel. (sultry jazz music) - So the reason that I picked this as something that I wish that I would've had when I was in college is because honestly, I spent so much money at coffee shops and this actually would've have saved me so much money. - A latte for like four or five bucks but I could've made my own. - I know, so this is great so it's definitely something that I wish that I would've had. Thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed this video and, again, a huge thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this. This was so much fun to make and it was so fun kind of going back and reliving my college experience while I was shopping. Let me know in the comments below if there are any tips that you have for future college students. And especially if you are in college, what is something that you wish you would've known before you went to school? I'll be looking forward to reading your comments and I will see you guys in the next video. Bye. (relaxed hiphop music)",

First up we've got the Lelight. This thing is a case for the iPhone 6s that includes a built-in light. It appears to be targeted at selfie professionals. Next is a similar product that is slightly more universal. The Cyxus round spotlight can clip onto any smartphone and provide lighting to either the front or back camera. Lastly, we look at a magnetic charger for iPhone (or iPad) that turns your lightning connector into a magnetic charge port. What do you think? Which of these 3 iPhone gadgets is your favorite?

    "transcript": "So today's video is about iPhone accessories I've got three of them in front of me, I think they're pretty cool I ordered 'em off Amazon, of course that's what we're gonna do in this video Is find out just how cool they are. The world of iPhone accessories is vast. This one the LELIGHT, the LELIGHT. What this is, is of what I understand is, a case for your iPhone that also has a forward facing light in it. and a battery. That's kind of weird looking, how its translucent like that. To illuminate yourself. Possibly for a selfie. Does it clip in? What are we doing here. It starts with a clip, then a slide Its a clip and slide. Kind of like a slip-n-slide. The micro USB port there to charge it up and this looks like the power switch down here. so As usual, no juice when I need it! Oh! Lights up. This bar along the top You know a lot of people, there out with their friends of something, ... your at a party, it's not going to be the brightest environment. But you still want to take your selfies. So, lets do it. I'm going to trigger this guy on, and, here we go. as scary as that is, you've got a lot more detail in that. So, unlike a flash that would be triggered for a still image, this just stays on. So that's going to work for video or photos. The, Lelight Or, Lelight. In this box, look at this nice little letter I've gotten from the seller. This, is not actually not iPhone specific. So, this one, everybody can be interested in. Its called what? Pickogen. It's a little clamp. It's for the back or front of your device There look. Its a pretty powerful, LED right there. Truthfully, I'm not that big of a selfie dude. But, what I do do is use my, what I do do when I do it If I do chose to do it. Take some video on your phone, like this, but as you know, dark enviroment, you're no seeing much. Regardless of smart phone, iPhone or other wise. That's going to, illuminate the scene. Once upon a time, there was a boy named jack, nobody liked him. There once was a boy named Jack. A happy childhood he had, until one day... Thats evil overlord Mr. Lew himself Forced the poor jack in to eating, silica jell for lunch. Now, Jack has a rumbly in his tumbly Here's with nothing turned on, level one, level two, level three. Ooo spooky. I dont know. It a little upgrade, Its a realitivity inexpensive way to get some lighting at least. I don't even know whats its called, It says Mr. Pro on it. A lightning, to magnetic connector. This guy, this little piece here. Turns your lightning port, into a magnetic connector. Simular to a magsafe on a Macbook for example. So this slides right in here. Once you got that in, and you're charging, if somebody then walks by right, and trips over the wire. It just breaks free. If it were plugged in there it might just yank the device the table right off the table completely. Somebody comes by, maybe a pet, maybe its a cat or a dog, or maybe it a militias sibling. Somebody comes running by. You put it on, get the vibration, it goes to blue. Couple little accessories, couple accessories, nothing here is too expensive. Accessorize your phone.",

    "transcript": "- Hey everyone, happy holidays! We are getting hyped for the holiday season with a gingerbread house. This is Jenna. - Hello, ready to decorate. I'm not, this is ready to decorate. - This is, your... You did decorate me. - I did decorate you. - Wait till you see that video. Decorating is fun, but building them is not. - This is already pre-made. - This is a small house. Good, I hope it's not shattered. Did you pick this up at the store? Or did you get it on the Internet? - I picked it up at the store. I did a gingerbread house for... Actually, no, it was a chocolate house for... What was the last holiday? - Easter? - No. - Thanksgiving? October? - What's the spooky one? Halloween! - October! - I did one for October and it was broken. - You did one for October? - I did-- (laughing) October's my favorite holiday. - So this is an unboxing of the gingerbread house. We've got icing. There it is. Also got-- - [Jenna] Oh, those are probably candies. - [Justine] I bet it's like some fondant. We've got some-- - Peppermint sticks. Do you want mac and cheese candy canes for the house? - Absolutely not. What's this? Okay, more icing. Ooh, we've got the tips! Here's the tip. - Just one? - Two tips. How many tips? - Just two. - Here's our house, and it's in perfect condition. - [Jenna] Wow, it's so small. - There is a little cheat that you guys can do if you ever do build gingerbread houses, use hot glue. - And just don't do it. - Or don't do it. Here's a tip on building life-size gingerbread houses. - Don't do it. - Don't do it. - Absolutely do not do it. - [Justine] Do you think this is like our tradition? - We do it frequently. - We do it frequent enough. - I think we did it on my channel. I don't actually remember. - Uh-oh. - [Jenna] I'm gonna roll my sleeves up and do something. - While I'm getting hyped for the holidays, I always... Well, so do you, I was gonna say I do. We both travel home for the holidays, and traveling during the holidays is always just wild because everybody is traveling. So, the house has lifted. - Put it, put it... Put it back. What is all that ruckus you're making? Oh no, my tip! (laughing) What's your favorite thing to do during the holidays? I feel like it's nice 'cause we've got lots of time to do things. - Well, Jenna, it's so funny that you asked. My favorite thing to do during the holidays is listen to Audible books. - I actually know this, because when we're home for the holidays I always hear them. - It's like the best thing, because I absolutely love Audible. So thank you guys for sponsoring my videos because, honestly, this is something that I truly, absolutely love, and there is something new this holiday season for Audible. For a limited time new members of Audible can get three months for $6.95, which is pretty incredible. You guys can go to audible.com/ijustine or text ijustine to 500 500. They also have these new things called Audible Originals, which I just downloaded my first one. I downloaded Aliens. They also have audio fitness. Have you seen this? - No! - Yes, it's actually super exciting. So I downloaded a few of those, too, because usually when I'm traveling for the holidays, or traveling anytime in general, trying to workout or make time to do it is usually a struggle. But look, they have 5K training. Also have an Everyday Meditation, which goes through 20 days. I got Michelle Obama's book, Becoming. I got Brittani Louise Taylor's book, A Sucky Love Story. Anyway, if you guys wanna check out Audible, audible.com/ijustine or text ijustine to 500 500. - All right, here, you can start the other icing bag. For best use, place in a bowl of warm water. Nah. - Eh. - What is this? There's goo coming out of it. - Did you guys enjoy that? If you eat this-- - You'll die. - Your insides will look like they're bleeding. - Aren't all of our insides, technically? - That's not what I meant. We're gonna just decorate the front. - [Jenna] Which one's the front? - Take you pick, girl. We don't have much icing. Really need to plan this out. - I'm really bad at this. - Do you want me to do the icing? - No. You should, I'm aware. - [Justine] Do we just stick this on the entrance of the house? - No, you have to have a door. - Maybe there'll be a back door, you just won't see it. - Secret entrance. - Secret entrance, this smells really good. - [Jenna] Am I doing something bad? - No, I just know how much you love your symmetry. - Do I? - Yeah, you love your symmetry. - Do I like symmetry? - [Justine] You've talked about it so many times in videos. - That I like symmetry? That doesn't go there, that would be not symmetric. So here's the thing, I've gotten myself into a pickle. Do I follow the pattern of the lights, or do I reverse it? - I love how you say symmetry. - Symmetry. - I say, like, sem-eh-tree. - Symmetry. - But you say symmetry. - Symmetry. - Symmetry. - Symmetry. - Sim-uh-tree. - Sim, cinnamon tree. You should do... - No. - What do you mean, \"no\"? - I don't know. I'm going to put red around the bottom... No, no, that would look like murder. - There has been a murder. - There has been a murder. - Turn up the lights in here, baby. Extra bright so Santa can see you. - She'll be here all day. That looks good. - [Jenna] There's no door! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, let me turn this for you so you can get a better look. - We need more color. - Well, I kind of broke that one, but we're just gonna jam it on there anyway. You're gonna get a tummy ache, stop eating those right now. 'Cause I don't wanna have to have to hear about it. It's poison. - Well, no it's not, it's sugar. - Sugar is poison. But it's freaking delicious. - What do I do with the green? What do they do with the green? - What did they do with the green? - Oh, I like wat they've done. - What have they done? - They made windows. - That's nice, what are you making? - Oh, it's gonna be a window. - I'm just gonna add the-- - Oh, no! I have got a speck. - Yeah, fondant is... It's hard to do. There has been a murder. - There has been a murder. - What is that from? - I think I just said it one day. - So, Jenna is a forensic scientist... - Well, I should've been. - You should've been, but she's not, technically. But she does have a degree in it, so I'm gonna put some blood splatter and I would like for you to tell me how the murder has happened. - The murder, we must get to the bottom of the murder. - [Justine] Well, there's been another murder over here. - Oh, no, I've got icing in my hair. - You need anything, like, eaten? - No. - Oh, shucks. This stupid chimney keeps falling down. All right, so I think that our house is done. - These are good, they have like a flavor. Like not just sugar. - Really? Like what's the flavor? - Yeah, like that one tasted like cherry. - Do you guys wanna see the front? - Hold on, I'm making grass. That's a turd. That is a green turd. - So just so we know not to decorate, 'cause, like, no one's gonna see the back of it. - [Jenna] Does that say on or no? - [Justine] It says no. - No peaking-- - In the presents. - Could you turn that... I really think that the bonus decorations really made it. What is it, you ask? A grass patch. - I was on my phone. I forgot we were making a video. - [Jenna] I added a doormat. - [Justine] Oh my gosh, that looks good! Well, guys, here it is. This is our holiday festive... It actually looks pretty good. Did you put that there, too? - Yes. - Wow, you added so many things since I looked down from my phone. I looked up and we've got a whole new world. A whole new world. - I almost went like this with with the microphone, then I was like that was a knife! - That's dangerous. Well, guys, thank you so much for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed this. I would love to hear from you guys, what are some of your holiday traditions? And what are you guys gonna be doing for the holidays? Anything? Nothing? It's okay if you're not. A lot of our friends are staying here this year. - I know. - It's kind of crazy. But we'll be heading home visiting our friends and family. - Bre, we're gonna make Bre be in videos. - Bre, get ready. If you guys have any ideas of what you'd like us to do with Bre, leave those, also, in the comments. Bre's our other sister, if you didn't know. She's the middle sister. I'm the oldest. - I'm the baby, even though I'm-- - She's the baby. - Old now. - Well, I'll be... Well, if you're old, then, oh my gosh, I am Mrs. Claus. I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye! - This looks cute. (gasps) One of the lights has fallen! You had one job. - I had one job. - And that was your side.",

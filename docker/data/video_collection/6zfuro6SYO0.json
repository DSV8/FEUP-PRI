    "transcript": "this always happens I'm recording a video chatting with the guys I'm on the phone but the loud elements don't care it's been hours this is my life now but I do hear good things about RTX voice I want to test that out and see if we can cancel out all that loud garbage out of you ears so let's first install the application downloaded directly from Nvidia and this is the app here you can choose an input device so any of your microphones and you can even remove background noise from an output device which is pretty insane you need an architects graphics card for this to work plus updated drivers and everything is in real time first I want to dive into an epic battle and see how rtx voice works with this headset in the moderate rage RTX voice is enabled oh no your tank blows up you had so much fun but don't worry your keyboard can take it now let's play sound of a tank growing around an actual tank to add some complexity to our environment and let me tell you about today's sponsor World of Tanks it's free-to-play it runs super smooth look RTX voice it's all about epic PvP tank battles where you can flank capture objective enjoy a fiery domination from a safe distance or when tanks get intimate i've grade your arsenal with too many things to mention with reasonable upgrade trees and beautiful sunsets use our free link below to sign up for the game new players get some gold a tank and seven day premium trial the code by the way is tank tastic I'm gonna turn off rtx voice now so you can witness the magic turned off as this audio whirlpool becomes unbearable but not to worry another round of World of Tanks should satisfy use our link below to sign up and new players get some free goodies using the code tank tastic thank you very much all right so let's move on and do some more testing I'm recording this with the PC 3 7x headset I think this microphone sounds fantastic it's going directly into my Sound Blaster x3 without any processing applied so let's begin with a little bit of a keyboard test these our blues and I'm not gonna be typing them on my lap I'm gonna be typing right near my face okay all right so right now our text voice is disabled this is super annoying to hear if you're talking on somebody and someone is taking notes in the background once we unable rtx voice I mean you can definitely hear all those strokes are being canceled out even while I'm speaking I have no idea how NVIDIA managed to do something like what wizardy is that like who do you know what I mean you can be talking and all this background noise is still audible but it's a lot more muted and tolerable - yeah so this is a fun with vacuum cleaner so I'm gonna keep that on right now and just gonna speak into the microphone obviously it's gonna pick up some of that noise but it's a bit in the distance so it shouldn't be too much of an issue but let's see what happens when we enable rtx voice all right so our text voice has been enabled as I'm speaking you can probably hear that that's been heavily muted and only my voice is being picked up clearly and with a little bit of processing that happens to my voice but like totally totally acceptable right I haven't seen this one actually someone clapping for you they are ecstatic to see you you're wonderful at gaming you're wonderful at streaming and they just want to show your support alright so rtx the voice has been enabled and I'm curious to hear how this will turn out I've heard samples of construction noise which I will play for you with later but yeah I'm just wondering how these like really sharp sounds affect rtx voice now what about multiple voices of having my own video playing in the background let's see what happens so this is our most recent about the new Rison 3 processors and then UB 550 motherboards coming later on in May and June you can check out that video over here but now let's enable rtx voice so rtx voice has been enabled and I'm really curious to hear what will happen in terms of like trying to isolate my voice locally versus something that is happening in the background but from what I understand it should still be able to pick up all that noise or voice along with mice but yeah we'll see and we're here now what if we go back to some loud machinery metallic objects moving in the background like a tank right now rtx voice is disabled oh my god this is so loud and I cannot even hear myself speak anymore I'm sure dad's been muted slightly by the microphone by default but now let's see what happens when I enable rtx voice all right so rtx voice has been enabled i cannot even hear myself i'm gonna have to stop this because i think the neighbors might think there's something going on and this is making me quite uncomfortable but on the topic of tanks oh oh make sure the users are free link down below to sign up for world of tanks and use that tank tastic code for new players for all them free goodies so based on all the samples you've just heard this is not a gimmick and I'm totally blown away at what RTX voice is able to achieve now sure there's some processing and modulation happening to your actual voice when like loud sources are really close to the microphone but like that doesn't matter it's able to cancel out all the background noise while understanding what is a voice and what isn't as for performance impact it does vary between games so I tested this in three titles and our performance hit is six nine and twelve percent between the three games so definitely expect a lower FPS with rtx voice enabled and I'm running this with the Arctic's 28 ETI as well and I will mention there is a hack for gtx cards to use RTX voice but it is not official furthermore it's an extremely easy application to use in terms of selecting your input and making sure the background check mark is enabled and that's about it and what's really cool with the rtx voice really is its application doesn't only apply to streamers and gamers but for people like me if I use this microphone for example plug into my computer the application sees the interface and if there's like massive construction happening and I can't be recording normally I mean I could potentially trust RTX voice to remove all that background loud garbage so that was pretty fun I hope you enjoyed and if you've tried it yourself let me know what's your experience been like and yeah thanks much for watching check out this other relevant content subscribe for more and I'll you",

    "transcript": "- In this video, I'm gonna show you how to install Kali NetHunter on an Android phone. Gives you a lot of power. As an example, I could run an application such as Wifite with my Android phone connected to a Wifite adapter. I could then attack WiFi networks. So as an example, I'll select three here which is this network adapter, LED comes on and we are now scanning for WiFi networks which I can then attack. I've demonstrated that kind of stuff in separate videos. As always, this is only for educational purposes. Do not attack WiFi networks that you don't own or have permission to attack. But in this video I'm gonna show you how to install Kali NetHunter on an Android phone. There are various versions of Kali NetHunter. To get the full power of Kali NetHunter you need to use a rooted phone but there are various additions. We've got Rootless, I've shown you in previous videos how to install Kali as a rootless install. Use the video below if you want to see how to do that. Very simple installation but doesn't have as much power as NetHunter Lite which doesn't have as much power as NetHunter. If you wanna run WiFi injection attacks you need to use a rooted phone. If you want to do HID attacks, you need a rooted phone. Basically, if you wanna run NetHunter and use it to its full potential, you need to have a rooted phone. In a previous video, which I've linked below I showed you how root an Android phone. In this video, I'm just gonna show you how to install Kali NetHunter on a phone that's been rooted. As an example, if I run this application I can verify that the phone has been rooted. So as you can see here, this is a rooted Android device. I'll create various videos showing you how to root Android devices. In this example, I'm using a OnePlus 7T to learn how to root, learn this kind of stuff with, but I'll create videos on other phones. Let me know in the comments below which kind of phones you want me to create content about. But without further ado let me show you how to get Kali NetHunter installed on an Android phone like this. I will warn you that it isn't a simple process. There are a bunch of steps that you have to do but it gives you a mobile device running Kali which is fantastic if you wanna, for instance, test wifi networks. (electronic music) Okay, so the first thing we're gonna do is download DM-Verity and Force the Encrypt Disabler. We're gonna download it using this link. We need to download the disabler, so I'm gonna download that to my desktop and then I'm going to extract those files. Okay, so files have been extracted. Next thing we need to do is download Twrp so I'm gonna go to the Twrp website. On the top right hand side, I'm gonna select devices. In my example, this is a OnePlus so I'm gonna select OnePlus and the specific phone is a 7T, so OnePlus 7T. So I'm gonna download the software for this phone. In my example, this is a European phone. So under settings I'm going to check about phone and you can see the model number here is a 1903, that is a European phone. So I'm gonna download the primary image for Europe and then download that image file and I'll save that to my desktop. I'll connect the phone to my computer. If you asked, you need to allow USB debugging I've already done that, so I don't have to do that here. Now in the previous video when I showed you how to root the Android phone and I've linked that video once again below, we downloaded the platform tools so that we could send files to the phone. So in case you haven't watched that video you need to go to the developer.android.com website, download the SDK for the relevant platform, in this case, it's a Windows computer, so I'm gonna download the SDK to my desktop. I'm gonna show that in folder and what I'll do is extract that file. So my platform tools have been extracted and what I'll do here is open up a terminal in that folder. I'm currently in the platform tools folder and I'm gonna use the ADB software to push the DM Verify software to the phone. So what I'll do is move the disabled DM Verify zip file to the platform tools folder, it's actually in this extracted folder here. So there's the file in the platform tools folder. So if I type ls again, you can see the file is there. So the command we're gonna use is adb executable, push, the file that we're gonna push is the disable DM verify, a zip file and we are gonna push that to the SD card on the phone and the downloads directory. Now actually before I type that command, I'm gonna use adb devices to make sure that the device is connected. So the service had to start, so that's now starting and as you can see, the device is connected. It's important that you see your device. And now what I can do is push the zip file to the phone. We're gonna push it to the SD card download directory. Make sure that you get to the spelling right. And as you can see there, the file has been successfully copied. I'll clear the screen. We now need to use adb reboot bootloader. As you can see, the phone has now rebooted so I'm gonna use the command fastboot and we need to tell it to boot from the Twrp image. Now this is taking a while to download so what I'll do is take a copy of a previously downloaded file and I'll paste that into my platform tools directory. So the Twrp file 3.7.0_11-0-hotdog.img file is the file that I downloaded from Twrp. I'm going to specify that image and that's what I'm gonna tell the phone to boot with. So the boot image file is being sent to the phone. Phone is now rebooting into fastboot. As you can see, Twrp has started. This may take a while, so just wait for it. And what we're gonna do now is press install. We are gonna go to our download directory and we are going to install the disable software, so that zip file that we downloaded. Move this to the right, software is now installed. I'm gonna wipe, I'm gonna slide it to the right and then reboot the system. Phone is now rebooting. Now while we waiting for the phone to reboot, you need to go to Kali.org if you haven't got Kali already downloaded, and then you need to download the virtual machine version of Kali. Okay, so that's actually rebooted now so there we go, I can log into the phone. But back on the virtual machines I need to download a virtual machine image for VMware as an example or VirtualBox depending on what you're using. In my example, I'm using VMware Workstation Player. Once you've downloaded the Kali virtual machine so as an example, clicking download and downloading it, you can import that into VMware Workstation Player or VirtualBox, whichever one you're using. So I've already pre-downloaded this so I'm gonna go File, Open. I've got this in my downloads directory, so I'll open up Kali and I'll press play to boot it up. And there you go, Kali is now booting. Okay, so I'll log in with the default credentials, KaliandKali, and there you go, Kali is now running and what I can do is open up a terminal. Now on the Kali website, I'm gonna click download and I'm going to select a mobile and I'm going to download the NetHunter software for my specific phone. My specific phone is the OnePlus 7T so I'm gonna select that software. I am using version eleven, not the OxygenOS so that's the version that I'm gonna download. Okay, so according to this download it's gonna be three hours. Now that's gonna take too long so I've pre-downloaded the software so I'm gonna copy that to my desktop platform tools folder. Okay, so in PowerShell, ls shows us that we've got that file in the platform tools directory. So what I'm gonna do now is use adb push NetHunter zip file to SD card download, press enter and you can see that that file is being copied to the phone. Might take it a while, but you just need to wait for the zip file to be copied and then we can install it on the phone. (electronic music) Okay, so the file has successfully copied. So on the phone I can open Magisk, that was installed previously when I rooted the phone. So if you don't have the phone rooted and this installed have a look at the previous video, which I've linked below. I'm gonna go to modules, install from storage, go to File Manager, download and the software that I'm gonna install is the NetHunter software. You just need to wait for that installation to take place. It will take a while, but again just wait for it to complete. As you can see there, Kali's now being installed. As we told you, it could take up to 25 minutes for this to install. So now's a good time to go and get some coffee or something while the software installed. You literally just need to wait for this to complete. Okay, so once that completes, press reboot to reboot the phone. Okay, so the phone is rebooted. Notice the background has changed. We can see that this is a NetHunter phone but the next step is to compile and install the Net Hunter kernel. Without that, you lose a lot of functionality. So on the Kali Virtual machine I'll make the terminal bigger. I'm gonna use the command getclone and I'm gonna clone the Kali NetHunter project so that's been cloned. (electronic music) Okay, so software has downloaded I'll go into the Kali NetHunter Project directory. LS shows us that we've got a NetHunter installer directory, so I'll go into NetHunter Installer. Ls shows us various files, we wanna run the bootstrap.sh file. We need to respond no to all the prompts, so no. So we just need to wait for this to complete. We now need to run the build.py script. You can use the Python3 build.py-h to get help but in this case we want to build the kernel for the OnePlus 7. So the command I'm gonna use is Python3 build.py devices, the OnePlus7-all and we wanna build a kernel for all Android 11 devices. So I'll press enter, that's completed. Ls now shows us that this file has been created. So as you can see we've got a NetHunter file that's been created. Okay, so what I'm gonna do is move that to my Windows computer. It's under Kali NetHunter Project, NetHunter installer we've got this file, so I'm gonna drag that into Windows and there you go. The file is now available in the platform tools directory. So back in PowerShell ls we can see the files here. So adb push kernel, NetHunter zip to the SD card download. Okay, file has been pushed. Okay, so now you need to make a decision if you are using the European version of a OnePlus 7T, which I'm doing, we are going to use the Franco Kernel Manager to install the software. If using a global version you need to use Twrp to install the kernel. If you're following the document, which I've linked below you can skip to page 35 if you are using a global version and you want to use Twrp. But what I'm doing here because I'm using a European version of software I'm going to go to the Play Store and I'm gonna search for Franco Kernel Manager. Okay, so this costs about $1.49 probably worth buying. This makes it a lot easier, especially on European phones. So I'm gonna install that software which I've already purchased and then I'm gonna open it, grant access and we can see various information about the phone. So I'm gonna go to the menu, I'm gonna select Flasher, I'm gonna allow access, I'm gonna do a manual flash. Go to File Manager, go to download, I'm gonna select the file that I just copied and then I'm going to flash and reboot to the phone. As you can see, the Kali Kernel has been installed, phone is now restarting. Okay, so under my applications I can select NetHunter, I'm gonna allow access while using the device, I'm gonna grant access. I need to select the Kali Root Manager. As you can see, NetHunter was granted super user rights. Okay, notice the applications are not enabled on the phone. So what we are gonna do is start ch root or start char root, however you want to pronounce that. Notice it's now enabled so applications are now enabled on the phone. So don't forget to start CH route. And the next thing to do now is restart the phone. So I'll restart it. Phone is back. We're almost finished. I'm gonna open up a NetHunter Terminal, allow access, specify Android shell and then I need to put in the command su -c pm disable com.oneplus.opbackup. We basically want to disable oxygen updates. Okay, so that was a long process, but there you go. I've got Kali NetHunter running on this phone. I can run the Kali software as an example and then do things such as attack WiFi networks and run various other attacks. (electronic music)",

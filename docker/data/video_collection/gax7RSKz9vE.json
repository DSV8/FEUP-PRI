    "transcript": "(Home Depot Theme Song playing) (Humming melody) (Humming drum noises) (beep) - Hello and welcome to \"This is\". Are you- - Ready to go to Lowe's? Yep I am. - No, not at all. Because today we got- (laughing) - Home Depot Tech. - If you've catched our series on tech, you probably shouldn't buy tech from places- - I don't know why the bucket's so funny. I guess I wasn't expecting it. - We've looked at tech from convenience stores, from dollar stores, and now we're looking at our good old friends at Home Depot. - So do I just open up things from the bucket? Yeah we can, we'll get you the bucket. You can have the bucket. - Okay. Number one, we have 14 in one Switch accessories pack from Home Depot. 14 in one accessories pack, which seems like it's Joy Con charger, USB carrying case, joy con sleeves, screen protector. They're a little liberal with their use of- 14 in one. - 14 in one. Yeah. - Yeah, I think there's like four things in here. All right well we got a carrying case. It actually seems fairly decent. - I believe I have the exact same- (crashing noise) - Ah, okay, let's, let's count them. So we have a lanyard, a dust absorber sticker, a bunch of little Joy Con nubbins, a crappy headset, wipes for your screen protector. Screen protector. And a place to put your Joy Cons, Switch, and your games. Joy Con sleeves. A USB A to C cable. - Chargers. - The charger for your Joy Cons. And that's it. I count 10. - But, okay. Did you count these twice? Because there's wipes one and wipes two. - Oh no. You know what they do? They count. This is six. This is six of our accessories is just each individual thumb thing. How much did you spend on this? - [Young Woman] This is $23.57. - Nothing about this is unique to Home Depot in any way, whatsoever. - Did you think this was gonna be unique to Home Depot? - Yeah, I want Home Depot tech. - I got the bucket. What more do you want from me? - I'm just going to use my thumb grips to get a stronger feeling while using the controller. And I'm gonna have a stronger feeling about the fine items of tech at Home Depot. Just like you can have a stronger feeling on that subscribe button. I can guarantee you that it's tactile, clicky, and will give you all the oral bliss your heart could desire when you Ringling that Dingling. - So proud of you for using Oral right. Let's move on to the next one. We're just going power through these. Go ahead and take something out of the bucket of wonder. - Okay. Oh no, this thing. I own one of these. (laughing) - He's so squishy. Oh my God. (whip noises) - Yeah. Let's go to Cozy and get the mood going here. (jazz music) Mm oh, oh, oh. That's the Home Depot- But then you just kinda- he's not giggling though. Wait. (high pitch giggles) (laughing) (high pitch giggles) - [Male 2] I regret buying this as a gift now. How much did you pay for this? - [Young Woman] $22.97. - Here we have this, this next bucket. - It is a MacBook Pro charger with magnetic USB-C cable. So it's a stylish aluminum silver designed to match a 12 inch MacBook and 13 to 15 inch Mac Pro with USB-C. This is actually a lot more tech than I thought was actually on Home Depot. I, I'm impressed. I'm impressed. - That's the beauty of this series is we're letting you know where the really, really good places to get tech is. - Let's not say really, really good. Let's just say the places to get tech. (high pitch giggles) - My favorite part about this item is it looks like a tiny little Mac Pro. - Oh my God, I love it. - It's a little cheese grater. - I love it. Okay. - I will say that immediately I'm disappointed that I thought there's only a single USB-C on this. - Yeah, it does have MagSafe light capabilities. Do you wanna grab the end? (pop noise) - Oh. - Oh. - Let's listen. (click noise) - Ooh, that was good. - So I'm going to plug it into one of my USB-C ports. Okay. It is charging, it shows that as a 60 watt charger. - Well that's exactly what it's advertising. - Whoops. Wait, it stopped working. - [Male 1] Nope. - It's not charging anymore. - I think it's directional. - Is it really? Oh, you're right. It only goes on one way. (laughing) - [Male 2] How much was this? - [Young Woman] $64.47. Nah-ah. Nah-ah. Look, it's adorable. This would've been cool in 2017 for a tech under a hundred dollars video, but it's 2023. Those aren't cool anymore. The cool thing is just to click bait people. So you're feeling pretty tech, right? - Is tech an emotion? - Yeah. You're feeling pretty tech right now. Next up we have something I think you're really gonna like. - I hope so because, Matt, I'm highly SUS with this Home Depot stuff. - Okay- - Here we have- - You aren't kidding. There are a lot of buckets. (laughing) - A bucket of keyboards. - So inside we have not one, not two, not three, not four, but five membrane keyboards. And- (laughing) - Is there an infestation in here? Because that's a lot of mice. - So Matt, did you go in Home Depot and buy a five pack mouse keyboard combo? - I did. - Just for the reference. Wait, wait. Listen to this. Listen to the space bar. (clicking repeatedly) - That should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. So I'm guessing that this is sold to like contractors or something who are like loading up a bunch of basic like server closets or whatever. You just need a bunch of like random mice and keyboard. Or maybe you're working on an office because you hate your employees and you give them no respect. You're just gonna throw the cheapest keyboard and mouse as you possibly can on their desk. Oh, so wait, I just realized what the (beep) is this Leo? Why is there a function key beside my shift? Matt, please make me feel better. - No. (laughing) - These should be like maybe 15 bucks each. How much was the five pack? - [Young Woman] $79.90. - Can I clear these out of the way? - No. Because like I know how much you're a fan of the bucket of keyboards. - Huge fan. - So what if I got you another bucket of keyboards? This time in white? (laughing) - We've got not one, not two, not three, not four, but five more keyboards and a whole bunch more mice. I don't see Best Buy. I don't see Micro Center selling you two buckets of keyboards and mice. - Matt, if you fill out one more bucket of keyboards, I'm- (slide whistle) (beep noise) - Excuse me, I'm just fanning myself with all these keyboards. (laughing) Should I just give you my credit card now? - Depends. Is there another bucket of keyboards? - There's not another bucket of keyboards. - Okay then we're good. We're good, we're good. - There's not- I got you this two buckets of- it's one for each hand. (loud crash) Do you see the- I give him gifts. I try and get good things for him. (loud crash noise) - So you're feeling pretty great with- on the keyboard side of things. - That's not the word I'd use. - But what about your mice? You got plenty in that one. But what if you want a different type of mouse? - If you're gonna gimme a mouse trap that would be very helpful right now. So I could just put my finger in there and have an excuse to be done with this video. Okay, so we've got a wearable pointing device mouse from Gold Mood Tree. This is from Home Depot. Home Depot. So this is a wearable pointing device, right? Right. So just do this and it's like here. - Yeah. - It's like- - Oh, that's not what you point with. Because I think you wear it like this and then it's like - Swipe on it. Yeah, I think so too. - A little. You swipe- I'm gonna swipe right on my finger pointer. This is actually kind of comfortable. Well, considering what it is. - It's apparently made in Korea. So you know, it's going to be high quality. The product may be damaged or the human body may be injured. Do you want to do the laptop or you going to do the phone? - This here is manufactured in North Korea. Comes with a little pouch. Ooh. I don't like the way this feels. Oh oh. Feel that. (crinkle noise) - This micro-USB port might be the worst micro-USB port I've ever felt. That just does not go in well. - If I had a nickel, man. - Boy, that mouse cursor is so slow. So slow. Wow. How much was this little clicker boy? - [Young Woman] $75.99. - I spent $75 on this. - [Young Woman] Yeah. - Matt, I would pay $3 on wishes. - I, why did I do that? Oh yeah. This is not fun to use. - It's not good. It's not good. So here's the thing. This is not the actual worst idea I've ever seen but you should not buy it from Home Depot and you should not spend anywhere near $74 on it. - You win some, you lose some. So far everything we've had has been complete winners. So it's okay to have one L in the column. - What? A seven inch Bluetooth DVD boom box. - Do you wanna relive the eighties and the two thousands all in one - Naxa. The new generation in technology. Seven inch Bluetooth DVD boombox. It is a 800 by four 80 display and we need 8 C size batteries not included. - I feel like this is on sale at every target at Christmas. - Never seen this in my life. - Oh It's got a, it's got a fun dongle. - You're a big dongle boy. What? Sorry- - What do you- Oh, he's doing a thing in- oh God. Then- (techno music) I'm down wind of this. Do you you want help? (techno music) - It's good. I got it. - Look at how, look at how dope this looks. - And then also we have what looks to be a terrible screen protector. Oh my God. Is that, that's broken, isn't it? It looks broken. We're gonna peel off that screen protector. But that looks broken, right? I mean, it is heavily scratched and scuffed but I don't think it's broken. All right. Wow. (ring bell) - What, why did- - Carcinogens not good. (upbeat music) - We can't play any of this. (upbeat music) - So looking through our endless store rooms here's what I came up for a DVD to watch on this. A VHS copy of \"Ghostbusters\". - Not a DVD. - HD DVD of \"March of the Penguins\". - Yep. That's- we own that. That's a thing. - A HD \"Ultra\" DVD. 4k Blu-ray. Unfortunately the actual DVD is missing. So we have the Blu-ray. - Okay. So the only DVD that I was able to find in all of our stuff is this sealed- - Let's go! - Blu-ray copy of \"Shrek\" anniversary edition that does include the DVD. And I'll be honest, I'm hesitant to break the seal on this because I'm pretty sure this is worth $9,000. - You know what, \"Shrek\" is timeless and priceless. Let's do it. All right. Wait, actually, does this sound not terrible? - Oh shit is it actually playing the movie right now? - Awesome. We're about to get a copyright strike. Luckily I have a way to fix this. - Okay. \"Tim Burton's The Nightmare before Christmas\" wireless headset. Wow. - So now we can watch our movie without having copyright strikes. - Never watched \"A Nightmare before Christmas\". - Clearly you didn't shop at Hot Topic. And we may or may not have gotten some tech coming from Hot topics. So keep an eye out for that video. This may or may not have also been at Hot Topic but since I got it from Home Depot - You can't, can't double dip. I do struggle a little bit with like who should buy a portable DVD Bluetooth boom box. - Why? Why not? What- who shouldn't buy it? I feel like that's how we should an ask these questions. It's not who should, who shouldn't buy this? - I mean, do you have a phone? That's probably better. - Good volume? - That's not comfortable. Oh, these are like blown out. Yeah. Listen. Listen to those. It's not good. - It's really quiet. - Yeah. And keep in mind, this is full volume. - It doesn't sound good. It sounds very bad. How much? Okay, how much was all of this nonsense? Because this I know is too expensive. - [Young Woman] So the DVD boom box is $160. The headphones are $50. - These headphones are not good. Bad. - Speaking of bad, like subscribe, follow. We'll catch you in the next one. - That's the end of the video? - If you want a bucket full of keyboards, check out the link in the description. - Don't do that. Don't listen to Matt. - And we'll catch you in the next one. - Don't buy a bucket of keyboards please. (humming Lowe's Theme Song) Oh that's how they get that noise. (Lowe's Theme Song playing) - Thanks for watching. Subscribe to the channel. - [Male 2] Really appreciate you watching this video. Please subscribe to the channel.",

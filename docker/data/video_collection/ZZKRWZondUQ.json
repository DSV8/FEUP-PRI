    "transcript": "Hi there, this is mrinal once again and welcome to RTT videocast Now, this is first video of YouTube 101 a series of videos where I will sharing my experience on making YT video And, In todays video you will see how I record audio for all my youTube So if you just starting a YT channel or what know how I work, then this one is for you OK, So, how do I record my audio? Well, its a long journey and to make things simple, I have divided this video in 4 parts. #1 What equipments do I use #2 how to write a good script #3 How to Set up good enough recording studio #4 And finally how to record and edit your audio So without any further ado lets get started: #1 What equipments do I need? Now, If you are just getting started with videos, then you can use the build-in mic in your computer or even a smartphone. Obviously, they will not have the best audio quality in the world, but we can make it better in post production.. and we will see how to do that, in later part of this video. However, Once you decided to this YouTube thing seriously. You should definitely invest in more professional mic. like a blue yeti if you are working indoors. which works with your computer. or if you are working in the field then you can go for a livelier or shotgun mic. Basically, you can get a decent professional mic for 100-200$ and they are well worth the cost. --- Now, In my case, I record my video and audio separately. For videos, I use a panasonic camcorder and for audio there is the popular, blue yeti mic, which is plugged into my computer now, this setup has its own pros and cons The advantages being- you can improve the quality of the audio in post production while the disadvantage is- sometimes it can be tedious to sync the audio and video but you can overcome that by clapping before and end of the video. and later use the spike in waveform to match the video footage. So in short, start with, whatever you have. And later, when once you have the resources, get a professional mic like - blue yeti. or whatever fit your purpose. #2 get a good script Now this may not look obvious but trust me having a good script is important especially if you are beginner But why? Well, take it this way. If your content is high quality, you will feel more confident and your voice will sound more natural. For instance, here is the script of this video I wrote on Google docs. And there are couples of take away from it. #1 Remove redundancy. and keep your content to the point. People on YouTube has very short attention span and if they dont find useful information for 30 sec. Remember, it only one seconds to click the back button. So respect your audience time, and say only the important stuff. #2 Use a conversation tone, as much as possible. Now, it may not work for every situation but for 90% of the time conversational tone is good. Imagine, that you are taking to person sitting next to you. And write your script accordingly, Like if there is a pause in a sentence then leave a gap or write it in a new line. #3 And if you have noticed, I only use one half of the page, because, you can other half to write the corresponding actions, like what will you do/say for this particular sets of lines. this will help you visualize the character while doing the voice over. Now once you are done with your script print it out if you have a printer or you can also read it from the smartphone or computer. So in a nutshell using a script will help you communicate clearly in less time. #3 Recording studio Now, that we have our script ready we need a suitable environment for voice recording. But why not just record the voice over? Well, think of this way, unlike a blog post, video cant be edited later So make sure to do your best. ------ #1 In the beginning, its better to stand up while recording your audio this helps to fill in more air in diagram and you will be able to breath in easily. #2 Use curtains and cushions to avoid the reverb I personally, record most of videos after midnight to avoid the surrounding noise caused by people and surrounding. #3 A pop filter is good for cutting high end sounds, like when you say sentences that has lots of Ps and Bs in it. It also helpful, for removing slow breaths that you take after you finish your sentence. #4 One big mistake, I made in past was, I was speaking right into the mic. But actually, one should speak perpendicular to the mic and a distance of one 1 feet while your pop filter is kept somewhere in the middle. #5 Another technique that helped me a lot was using hand gesture while recording. This makes your voice sound more natural You can also hold a pen in your hand, so when you want to raise your pitch raise the pen and vice versa This trick works pretty well in sub conscious level. So, this was a sneak peak on how i setup my recording studio. If you want, you can setup your home studio in similar fashion And, Now that we have everything setup, lets start recording the audio. #4 Record and Edit like a Ninja For this, we will use audacity Now, there are many other audio editing programs as well like audobe audition and garage band etc. But, I like audacity because its free, open source and its indeed very powerful So install the app if you havent already and then open it. Press on the red button and start recording your audio And, once you are done hit the stop button. ----- Now, you can see there is a bit of noise, so lets remove it. For that first select a sample of pure noise and then extract it. Its good practice speak after 5 seconds this way you will be able to pick up the noise quite easily. Now, lets improve the audio quality by applying couple of filters #1 Normalize So select your clip and go to effect > and then normalize. In very simple words, what this does is it increase the audio level of the entire clip without affecting the dynamic range. So, if you audio is low, it will increase it but dont overdo it, or it will kill you quality and add extra noise #2 Compress next you can try a little bit of compression. Now select your audio go to effects > and compression. Now what compression does it decrease the diff between low and high of your video. so that you audio sounds more even. (now at this point, It very important to know the difference between normalization and compression) when we normalize an audio we are increase the audio level on entire clip but without affecting the dynamic range which the ratio b/w low and high and when we compressing an audio we are reducing the diff b/w low and high. so the dynamic range get affected. so depending on how you are audio is use them accordingly. But dont overdo it or you will get noise in the audio. Next, you can some equalization like bass boost this will make your voice sound deeper like morgan freeman. and then add a bit of of treble boost to make it words crisp and clear. However, I highly recommend not to overdo with any of this filters because then you are sounding like someone else and next time if you speak without filters your audience will not know who you are. And Finally once you get the sweet spot in your recording you apply the chain effect to automate everything So that you dont have to do all this manually. ------------ So this all for now. I will end this video with the most important tips i.e. PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE everyone sound awful at first but with practice and following some tips that I showed in this video you will definitely produce some great content just be patient. So this all for now, I will leave the like of this YouTube 101 series in the description below so be check that out. That being said, give this video a thumbs up if you find it useful Or if you any doubt let me know in the comments below And subscribe to this channel for more pragmatic tech videos And like always thanks for watching.",

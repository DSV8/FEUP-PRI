    "transcript": "Resident Evil 4 just hit the iPhone 15 Pro, marking the second AAA game to land on Apple's flagship handset this year. Its an impressive feat of technical wizardry, but not one free from substantial compromise. Well dive into all this, but the most pressing question most havent tackled is: can mobile AAA gaming be commercially viable and does Apple have what it takes to make it happen? Capcom isn't the first publisher to bring a AAA title to the iPhonethat honor goes to 2K with their 2014 port of BioShock. Similar to Resident Evil today, the mere existence of an outgoing console generation best seller for smartphones was heralded as a marveland in many ways it was. This wasn't just a tech demo like Infinity Blade before itBioShock for iPhone was a fully-fledged port that looked fantastic on the iPhone 5s' 4\" display. and had intentionally designed on-screen controls. Similar to Bioshock of yore, both Resident Evil titles are exclusive to the latest-generation iPhone SoC; however, unlike Bioshock which had intentionally designed on-screen controls for a touch-based interface, Resident Evil lazily plasters on a modern game pad layout that takes nearly the entire screen. And the laziness doesn't stop there. If you didn't see the game running on an iPhone, you'd never believe it actually was as diving into the settings presents you with a whole bevy of options that frankly, have no business being on a device with known and standardized specs. For example, you're prompted to set the display safe space and screen resolution, the default audio device is set to TV, and viewing the port credits lists the game title as \"underscore RE8 underscore sub greater-than-sign.\" You also have complete access the graphics settings that would be available on PC or Mac; however, I have a conspiracy theory... There's surprisingly little visual difference and performance impact for things that very much should make a differencelike texture filtering and shadow detail. In fact the difference in frame-rate between settings is so negligible relative to the PC and Mac versions that it makes me suspect these settings aren't actually doing anything at all. That's not to say none of the settings make a difference. You can enable or disable MetalFXa spatial upscaler similar in concept to AMD FSR. When enabled, frame-rates do improve by about 20%; however, at the expense of incredibly bad anti-aliasing and perimeter artifacting. The scaler manages to turn distant bushes and hair into pixel clouds that look downright awful. Unfortunately, it's something you'll have to leave turned on because the phone can't really handle frame-rates above the low 20s without frame drops when native rendering is usedeven at 720p low with trilinear AA. Curiously, you can exceed the A17 Pro SoC's 6GB VRAM limit for a single app by increasing texture and shadow quality. This leads to a crash with the Springboard reappearing once the buffer reaches its maximum capacity, just seconds into gameplay. One might suggest this is the consequence of using a single binary for both iOS and macOS, but Resident Evil Village doesnt Now, this lazy port relative to the work required for Bioshock suggests two potential upsides: (1) thanks to stuff like the GPT, porting was potentially straightforward with minimal work required for App Store readiness, and, (2) as hardware evolves, these higher graphics settings that currently crash the game could be user-defined without Capcom having to update the binary. This contrasts with 2K's dismal handling of Bioshock, which broke with iOS 8.4 nine months after release and was left inoperative for nearly two years before being withdrawn from sale altogether. Such theories seem reasonable until you load up the new Resident Evil 4 remakelaunched simultaneously on iOS and macOS this week as a universal binary. Gone is the graphics pane from the iOS version altogetherwith no ability to change resolution, upscaling, or texture settings. Despite some oddities like the Mac and iOS version having separate audio setting line items, most of the abject weirdness is gone suggesting a more refined and carefully developed port. This attention to detail is perhaps expected, considering there was no prior Mac version of \"Resident Evil 4,\" unlike \"Village,\" and it being a release from the current year. Immediately upon opening the iOS version, you're prompted to download a substantial amount of data, and with all DLC included, the total game size reaches approximately 32 gigabytesroughly twice the size of \"Village; however its also a longer, more modern game. Although this size is considerable, it pales in comparison to the 66 gigs found on my M3 Max MacBook Pro which downloads entirely from the App Store. This size difference certainly comes down to the quality of textures packaged withinparticularly so given the iOS version has pre-destined settings. Luckily, Resident Evil 4, at least in my mind, runs substantially better on the iPhone 15 Pro than Resident Evil: Village before it. While the messiness introduced by the MetalFX scaler continues to be a thorn and frame-rates peak at around 30FPS, the sustained framerate stays fairly close to that target and frame drops are much less common. This comes at the expense of graphical fidelity and words cannot be minced here: this doesnt look goodat alleven on an iPhone display at arms length. Textures are incredibly soft with edges being wickedly sharp; proof the scaler is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Compared to my Steam Deck OLED, its really no contest with the handheld console able to support double the frame-rate at 800p low settings while looking substantially better in the process. And that would be a money-grabber headline: $349 game console destroys $1,500 iPhone but I really think thats missing the point. The fact that were comparing a passively-cooled smartphone to a comparatively massive dedicated gaming console with a fan and SoC that draws 3x more energyeven in its most efficient stateis a marvel. The iPhone is not the best camera, nor is it the best device for writing emails, but its with us all the time because it functions as a jack of all tradesits good enough to leave our DSLRs and laptops at home for the monotony of daily life. For casual gamers, or for those that dont want to take their Steam Deck everywhere, this is more than sufficient. And the fact that just like the Deck, I can save my progress to the cloud from the train and resume right where I left off on my Mac at a later date is superb and will only improve as Apples silicon gets better. From a technical standpoint, this is amazing. The problem is from a commercial standpoint. Mobile gaming is cancer. We've moved away from the era of charming, inexpensive mobile games due to unsustainabilitysmartphone users didnt want to pay more than $3 for a mobile game and those one-time purchases werent supporting ongoing development. And so, addicting free-to-play shovelware supported by in-app-purchases of in-game currency and garish ads plastered all over have become the norm. And the revenue has exploded. Most gamers dont realize this, but listen up: the entire PC and console gaming industry owns just 43% of global annual revenue. Mobile gaming accounts for more than $100B in revenue annuallywell over half. Currently, most of this money comes from high-income countries; however, many parts of the globe where mobile gaming is the primary and sometimes only way for many to gamecountries like Brazil, India, Vietnamthere is demand for games on mobile. Not because its the best experience, but because its the most accessible. As much as I appreciate Resident Evil and find myself excited for Death Stranding, Assassins Creed Mirage, No Mans Sky, and other AAA games coming to iPhone, selling $30-70 experiences to mobile gamers will not work; because it never has. Sure, RE4 and future releases will include a Mac version, but consumers that own an iPhone and a Mac willing to shell out $60 for games are not suddenly going to put their foot down at the prospect of buying a console or Steam Deck for a better experience So, the onus is on Apple to make for a better experience or improve access. Video game graphics have been diminishing in return for well over 5 years. Heck, the mere existence of the Steam Deck proves that fidelity isnt everything when it comes to PC gaming. Most M3 Macs are good enough and the iPhone is on its way. Even if Apple somehow released an incredible GPU at a competitive price, it wouldnt pull away console or PC gamers from their platform of familiarity and years-long games library. The only way Apple can win is with moneyand boy have they got lots of it. Post COVID hardware sales have dropped across Apples entire lineup, but services revenue continues to rise. Apple could dig into the coffers and give a few coins out to incentivize the work of porting to iPhone. And you know what? Shell out even a little more for timed and outright exclusives. Heck, try to buy one of the last independent game studios not already snatched up by Microsoft and Sony. And then launch Apple Arcade+, with unlimited access to all of these games and plan to run it at a net loss until youve got enough people invested that they wont leave when you raise prices. Its what Microsoft did with Game Pass, its what Sony is struggling to do with PlayStation Premium, and its what Nintendoesnt. Providing low-cost access to emerging markets and making a seamless experience for established ones might finally bring Apple the gaming credibility they so desperately seek. There have been rumors of a gaming iMac for years, theyve tried games on Apple TV, they demo cutting-edge AR experiences nearly ever year, but nothing has materialized beyond crappy free-to-play mobile games. This could be their shot at redemption and the hardware and software legwork is mostly done. The ball is in their court and its time to put up or shut up. Thanks so much for watching and as always, stay snazzy.",

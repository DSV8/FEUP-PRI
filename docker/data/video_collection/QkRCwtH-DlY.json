    "transcript": "hello good people welcome back to some quarantine content this video is gonna be interesting and you may be wondering why well we have two coolers from Zalman I know right Zalman so this is the CNPS20x the big boy the duel tower design Kimmy and this is the CNPS17X I hope I got that right anyways these brand-new coolers sort of popped into the radar when we started catching a few videos and articles having them shown either matching or beating some of the most popular air coolers available on the market today and yes that does include the Noctua NH-D15 and the U12a so fun popular request we finally have them here so can these new CNPS models really beat the best of the best even during quarantine everyone here was anxious to see the results like really really anxious since Zalman has more than 20 years of cooling experience and they have some pretty big claims about these coolers too but does that really matter let's find out after this power up your PC with be quite straight power Levin platinum series featuring 80 plus platinum efficiency a fully modular design high-quality Japanese capacitors and a silent wings fan that's optimized for air flow and silence choose be quiet and your components will thank you alright so let's start at the top of things with pricing and like most high-end air coolers these will burn a hole through your pocket the CNPS20X is $100 u.s. so the same as the Noctua nh-d15 Chromax while the CNPS17X is $70 which hits somewhere between the Noctua u12s and the U12a or aligned perfectly with the u14s now for the purpose of this video I'll be addressing these colors as the CNPS20X and these CNPS17X now for the looks well opinions about that will be super personal I like to stealth approach not to a be quite in sight take with their coolers but if you want something with RGB then Zalman has you covered or if you don't like all that bling you can just turn off the illumination in your motherboard software both these coolers have very similar designs with the CNPS17x being much more compact it uses a pretty traditional design with a very interesting open frame 140 millimeter fan for size comparison it's a little bit bigger than he knocked to A U12 taking a look at the fin array Zalman created what they call a 4D corrugated design that leads to a more efficient airflow through the aluminum fins so the fans don't have to produce as much static pressure oh and that copper area is just aluminum with a simple electroplating but it does look pretty cool the 5 heat pipes run down into a base that's polished to a mirror finish now about the CNPS20X well it's basically a super-sized CNPS17X with dual cooling towers and a pair of fans instead of five heat pipes it uses six slightly larger ones that run up into the fins and from a size perspective it's comparable to the Noctua NH-D15 but it's also a bit taller one of the things I really want to focus on are the unique fans zelmans using here and of course the RGB will be the first thing you will see the elimination comes from an area in the middle which is super bright and it's kind of impossible to show the individual LEDs on the center but it's also kind of painful to look at as well the light then spills into a four clear plastic area there's a couple of issues here first of all the NCPS20X and the CNPS17X use a non-standard mounting mechanism so it's impossible to switch them out for higher performance fans also you'll need to mount them onto fan guides yourselves and that involves a bunch of small screws a ton of flimsy plastic and some metal Clips it's a total total pain in the butt guys speaking of installation prepared to be completely overwhelmed here because when you open the box and start taking out the hardware there are tons of small bits and pieces that are needed to put these coolers together and none of the bags are labeled so that just adds some confusion like I said just a single fan needs a lot of pieces but that's just a tip of the iceberg especially if you're using an AMD or lower end Intel system or a Zed or H series motherboard let's start with mounting this on an x2 9 on board since that's the simplest sorta first up you screw in for standoffs and then mount a cross plate with four bolts now you can either do this vertically or horizontally depending on the configuration you prefer just watch out the plate has holes for all intel socket and both positions will actually fit on a 26-6 system but only one will allow you to properly mount the cooler just make sure to use the outer holes and everything will go fine the next part is the same for every installation on AMD and Intel you'll need to carefully align the screws with these threaded studs which is pretty straightforward on the CNPS17X since they're easily accessible now for the CNPS20X you'll need longer Phillips head screwdrivers and the screws are magnetic so threading them between the towers is a complete or a total pain in the butt to be more transparent not only that but shame examine for not including a screwdriver with $100 cooler like pretty much everyone else does after that it's just a matter of mounting the fans and dealing with the mess of cables coming out of them remember each fan has two wires one for the RGB illumination and the other for running the fan itself moving on to AMD mounting and this is where things get even more complicated and the first thing you'll need is the world's most complicated backplane basically this one component is made to fit in three aim for and all non HTT Intel motherboards to actually make it compatible with any platform you'll need to slip in these small plastic side caps and vertical nuts the next step is to apply what Zalman calls they're loading block which is a sticky pad that makes sure the backplate doesn't kind of fall off and it sort of gets a flush installed to the motherboard if you thought the process was overly complicated check this out guys you will need to install or tiny washers screw down the standoffs position the cross brace and secure that in place guys at this point I was wishing for a Noctua or be quiet process finally you just have to screw down the heatsink and that's it so with all of that being done what about clearances well both coolers have fan clips and that can easily be used for avoiding PWM heat sinks and taller memory but there is a bit of a problem here as you can see even with the shortest memory I have here it causes the fan to be pushed far upwards that'll certainly cause a problem for some cases and it's something to keep in mind and now the moment that you've all been waiting for the results now just a friendly minder for folks who are wondering about our testing methodologies I'll leave a link in the description down below that goes through every single detail step by step you're welcome kicking things off and oh my both coolers actually post some of the best numbers we've seen it's actually amazing to see the SMT necks keep up with a bunch of dual fan designs while the s20 axe takes a crown and even overcomes the d15 one thing I wanted to keep your eyes on is how the CNPS17x stacks up with the U14s since both of those are single fan 140 millimeter designs that cost about $70 at default fan profile they're pretty quiet too but it's obvious that the CNPS17X needed to ramp up at speeds a bit higher to compensate for its smaller size then CNPS20x on the other hand is really really impressive guys pushing fan speeds to a thousand rpms shows some interesting results with the CNPS20x improving over the stock test while the CNPS17X actually sees higher temperatures the reason for that is pretty simple that the default fan speed profile the smaller cooler ended up running over a thousand rpms while the CNPS20x ran below that speed the noise readings proved the situation even though the CNPS20X takes the crown in temperatures it does start getting quite a bit louder but seriously to the naked ear it's literally just as loud as the D15 and that's pretty impressive the CNPS17X on the other hand not too great since it got beaten by the U14s in both temperature and noise in this test bumping up to full speed and the improvements aren't really all that worth a while personally I think this is because both coolers were already operating near their peak efficiency at stock CPU speeds so pushing more air through them wasn't going to do that much so this is the first sign of concern as Zalman fans start heading above 1,200 rpms the amount of noise being produced increases exponentially and that's likely due to their unique design the Noctua coolers are clearly superior here now before I get into the overclocking results I do want to quickly sum up the stock CPU results because zelmans performance on our 1080 HD can be used as a great representation on how the CNPS17X and the CNPS20X would stack up on lower wattage processors for example I'm sure that the results will be very similar to these on a Ryzenn 9 3950X or a 9900K but overclocking me 10 and a exe separates the men from the boys and I should also mention that this pushes thermals above what these smaller CNPS17X is weighted for well the first shock is the SMT next held on for all of its life and actually cooled the CPU to a point where it didn't throttle but what I want my processor regularly chugging along 101 degrees probably not on the other hand the NCPS20x ended up beating the dark rock pro but the D15 started to pull away with this one both coolers also started to get pretty loud with the smaller one running at a hundred percent fan speed the whole time it's important to note that the you 14s got similar temperatures but it's much quieter than the CNPS17X the CNPS20X the bigger boy hits a point where it became the loudest cooler in this test running the fans that at constant RPMs has the CNPS20X delivering really respectable results but they're still not good enough to pull ahead of knock to his beast and that CNPS17X well it's overwhelmed at this point but that was expected the last test just repeats what we've already seen and with that I think it's time to wrap this up so is the CNPS20X the big boy ain't not too a killer well that actually depends on how you look at things you see for lower thermal loads it actually ends up beating the D15 while operating at some more decibel levels but as you start to increase the heat load the D15 sort of stays ahead while remaining quieter if you want bragging rights for having the best RGB air cooler on the block this is it just be mindful that Salman's competition is miles ahead when it comes to ease of installation now what about these smaller CNPS17X I can't believe I actually remember this off the top my head but anyways it offers overall great performance and good acoustics as you know we haven't come across an air cooler than offers RGB lining now if you don't really care about all the RGB goodness and all that stuff and if you don't mind the color scheme or the way how it looks you're actually better off with the Noctua u 14s I mean sure it's that color that you'll have to get used to but for $70 it's an overall great option but there's also these Scythe Fuma 2 that's around $60 which offers heaps of value provided that you can actually find one on sale so on that note I think it's time to wrap this up let me know if you guys are interested or if you have any other air coolers that you'd like us to check out we'll definitely add them to our testing I'm Eva with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching stay safe and it's been responsibly my friends",

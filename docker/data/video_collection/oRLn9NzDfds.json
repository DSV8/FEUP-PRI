    "transcript": "this here is another viewers very dirty gaming pc in fact it's so dirty i decided to film the intro out here in my garage because i don't want this filled indoors so this system is quite old gtx 550 ti an older 650 watt power supply and what i believe to be either am 3 or am3 plus asus motherboard we have a north and south bridge here so you know it's yeah not newer now the goal of this series again is to deep clean older and dirtier systems if your system's not very dirty then there's really no point in it being featured here and that's why we've had to ignore so many inquiries in the past month or two here in the orlando florida area the premise is simple we deep clean viewer systems for free one of the side effects of filming outdoors is that you have very loud things happening outside so i apologize for that neighbor's mowing his lawn just how it is this system here clearly sat for a very long time and the fact that it is so old i think adds to the dust factor here it is caked up in so many places and i think this is going to make for a very satisfying clean uh what i was saying about entries not being dirty enough it there's just no point in me making a video and spending that much time it takes several days usually to clean these kinds of systems and if it's not very dirty what's the point right now you guys like seeing the big transformations i'm going to make it a point in this video to not upgrade anything everything will be recycled we will deep clean it all and put it all back into this case here what better way to end season two of pcdc so with that i think you'll enjoy you'll want to stick around stay with me make your next cup of coffee more exciting with trade trade lets you explore new coffees curated

get started today by clicking the link below and running through the quiz you'll get free shipping and your first fresh bag of roasted coffee for free when you sign up today i think with this build we're gonna have to start with the leaf blower it's not my first choice but it is kind of a quick and dirty solution to get a lot of this loose dust up first before we bring it inside which is where we're going to be cleaning a majority of the individual components in here the case we will hose down with water because water is a lot more abrasive than just air alone even using an air compressor probably will get a lot of this dust and grime out of here so we're going to use water for that and then all the individual components we're going to bring inside and deep clean those we're going to tear them down as far as they will go so i guess with that out of the way yeah let's bring out the leaf blower oh by the way if you want to find any of the stuff i use to clean in this video with the exception of the leaf blower because that's kind of unconventional you can find it in this video description okay now now let's get the leaf blower this right here is your walmart special get yourself a blackened decker it's actually a pretty weak leaf blower but it gets the job done at least where i live 20 volt uses battery so you don't need to plug it in or throw gas into the thing but uh yeah i like using this to clean my pcs right so here we go wow that already looks so much cleaner and now that a lot of the surface dust has been taken care of it's time to take all these components out again i want to do that in the garage because i'm sure there's still plenty of loose dust in there to go floating around in the office not that i'm new to that but i just prefer to mitigate it in this case if possible so we'll take all this stuff out and then we'll start bringing things in one by one we'll also hose down the case it's time for the music and the montage here we go so so and day two one deep cleaning later we're ready to reassemble now i must confess this case didn't clean up as well as i'd hoped there are some stains that just are not coming out i'd have to repaint this entire thing it's just not worth putting that much effort into such an old case but i do want to make a point to not upgrade the case because i think it is pretty cool i noticed that he had the left panel on the right side of the case so they were kind of backwards i guess they're interchangeable so uh this is an entirely meshed out left side panel you can see you can mount a 140mm fan to it if you want it's probably one of the reasons why there's so much dust in here because there's no filter behind this mesh but anyway we're gonna get the case reassembled and then we'll start reassembling the platform throw it all in here and turn it on and make sure she posts here we go and now the moment of truth let's power it on at the rear i am slightly nervous about this because of something that the owner told me when i picked it up i'll talk more about that in a second if the problem persists we'll see but i think i actually found what was wrong with it while i was rebuilding it and i'll tell you about that in a second so yeah all right we've got a post that was super fast and uh great everything looks really good i don't know if there's an operating system on this hard disk drive yep looks like there is okay cool so what the viewer told me was that whenever he tried to turn the system on you would get like a purple screen and that might end up showing up here i'm not sure how long it took for him to notice that it might have been right away uh but i noticed when i was reassembling the system that the case didn't have any standoffs and so the motherboard was basically being screwed directly to the the motherboard tray the the tray that the board sits on in the case and that's not good because there are a lot of solder points that are very fine tipped and they stick out a good ways from the from the pcb and those could short with the case and that could cause some serious problems i don't know if the purple screen was related to that i noticed that when the motherboard was installed without the standoffs the pci slots were recessed a bit further than usual so i couldn't actually get the sound card to fully slot in uh because the board was just further away um and i think that might have been the problem i don't know maybe that was the problem as well with the graphics card but uh yeah i mean apart from the fact that this hard disk drive is super slow it does appear that everything is working i think by now we would have already seen that purple uh purple screen that the owner was talking about and if it does only show up once windows initializes it could be a driver thing and that's something i expect would be fairly easy to fix but uh yeah everything looks great now that's good news and i just realized my hair is like totally out i can't i could just can't decide if it wants to part this way or this way and it looks all blocky well like i didn't know what i was doing when i cut my hair yes i cut my own hair couldn't hard to tell that and it's okay you can make fun of me usually the first few days it looks a bit awkward i want to thank you guys for another epic season of pcdc i can't believe we're already finished with ten full episodes here in season two um these go by so fast i mean granted they usually take a few days to to film clean and ultimately edit and publish but it just it's crazy looking back how quickly these go by and i am so so fortunate that all of you have been so engaging in the comment section just clicking these videos as fast as you do these two playlists have been just a huge jump start again for the channel and uh your feedback your viewership all of that is greatly appreciated so thank you very much i'm not entirely sure when season 3 will be here there will be a larger hiatus between season two and three than there was between one and two season two started almost as quickly as season one ended but i think when it comes to three i'm gonna be attempting to streamline the process a bit more i'm gonna have a few different uh different approaches i'm going to try to take to that that season see if we can dice it up a bit because this does get a bit redundant over time i've noticed that the anticipation and enthusiasm for this playlist has been dying down just a bit as the fixer flop playlist continues to do very well so we've got to come up with a way to revamp this series and make it even more interesting and i've got a few ideas that i want to at least test out in season three so there will be a bit of a gap we are starting a different deep cleaning season though actually it's not not it's not a part of this playlist it's going to be a separate playlist but it is a deep cleaning playlist and uh it's going to revolve around consoles now i'm not entirely sure how well this one's going to do this might just be a one-off but uh we'll see there are plenty of dirty consoles out there and i think that it will be fairly easy to streamline those because not only are they widely abundant i mean pretty much everyone grew up with some kind of console right and you're probably still sitting on one that you haven't touched in years well that's the perfect candidate for that i think we're going to call it gcdc uh gaming console deep cleaning i would have said cdc but then that's like center for disease it doesn't work so yeah gcdc it is but uh yeah so that'll be coming up very soon i'll make announcements for that uh if i haven't already but uh wow can we just admire for a second how far this build's come now look i know it's not perfect the case is definitely not perfect there are scratches and imperfections that are just not coming out no matter how intensely i scrub with soap and water or ipa or what have you without risking damaging the paint using something like goof off or goo gone it's a much stronger solution i'm just there's not much more i can do here that said i think the fact that we were still able to recycle literally everything in here and bring it back to working order very clean it just um yeah i'm bringing life to a very old system again i know that the owner of this wants to give it to his wife just to use as like a work from home system she just needs it for microsoft office and a few other things maybe browsing the web and uh this is perfect for that you don't need any you know a crazy gaming pc thousands of dollars worth it just you know you could get by honestly probably with a chromebook if all you want to do is just type up some documents maybe use excel or an equivalent excel platform or application and then browse the web right i mean even chromebooks can do that it's when you start doing a lot of things simultaneously you start running some heavier programs that's when you're going gonna want something a bit more powerful than that but this here i think is plenty for an introductory office sort of solution uh someone that wants to run microsoft office again is probably gonna be perfectly suited for this rig here gtx 550 ti still a discrete graphics card using a phenom 2 processor this is older than i initially thought but yep it all works and it all looks much much newer and that's the goal of this one so if you enjoyed this one please please please consider subscribing i would appreciate that if you haven't already click that like button go ahead and do that if you didn't like it for whatever reason click the dislike button that's totally fine that's why it's there leave a comment below letting me know what you didn't like about this one but if you did enjoy it i'd appreciate those comments as well and again looking forward to season three whenever that comes probably a few months from now i think i think i'm gonna work on some things over the holidays try to get gcdc going still continuing to fix your flop playlist i'm not sure when we're gonna be able to end season one we've had so many inquiries but i'm very grateful to to everyone in the area who has loaned me his or her symptom to to you know allow me to make these videos it is greatly appreciated uh with that yep like subscribe comment i already said that and i'll catch you in the next one my name is greg thanks for another great season of pcdc and thanks for deep cleaning with me",

    "transcript": "- Monitors. They're pretty boring. But this one is not, 'cause it's got a special button that most other monitors don't have. And it's also got a pop-up doohickey that we're gonna find out more about, but I'm not gonna ruin it right now. That's a spoiler. I hate spoilers. \"Mandalorian\" was spoiled for me. (Riley sighs) (Jono laughs) All right. No, the cool thing about this monitor is that it's got a Teams button. Microsoft Teams. Have you ever heard of it? It's like Skype. And it's got a pop-up camera with Windows Hello. So I did spoil it after all. I'm sorry. I need something to open the box, though, with. And we're not allowed to use knives? (stammers) There's a knife right here! - Not allowed. - No. - Oh, okay, so it's there but you're not allowed to use it. What do we use these paper clips for? Come on. There it is. Okay, down we go. (grunts) It's a 34-inch ultrawide. Is that right, Jono? It is curved, for better or for worse. I wouldn't get a curved ultrawide monitor, just so you know. In the box we got a USB-C cable. A USB-3.0, or 3.1 Gen 1, I think. 3.2 Gen 1. (chuckles) They're all so annoying. They're all so confusing now. Features a DisplayPort cable. I think that's 1.2. And a power cable. Okay. Wow, there's compartments. What should I start with, Andy? How, this is... Oh, okay, there we go. That's the base. Do-do-do-do-do-don't drop the base, 'cause I'm not Linus. This is the monitor arm stand-thing. What do you call this? That thing? (Riley beatboxing) Okay, here's the monitor itself. Take the monitor out and then put that thing on it. I thought you just had to hold it. I thought you just had to go at your desk and just be like, \"Ah, that's nice.\" Large deep-dish ultrawide monitor. Okay. Get in there. (stand clicks) Ooh. That's always so satisfying. On to the base. We are now adding extra work features into monitors, which I've been like, \"Why haven't they done that earlier?\" Like, gimme something extra. (groans) Which Dell has apparently done. Ooh, look at that fabric! - Speakers. - Wow. - [Riley] This is a speaker? - [Jono] 5-watt speakers. - Dual 5-watt speakers? - [Jono] Dual. - I knew that there were speakers, but I didn't know that there was gonna be this nice old fabric on it. Ooh. How am I gonna stop myself from just doing this all day when I'm using it? - [Jono] You do that to laptops. - I don't do that. Oh, I do, that's right. Yeah, show the tweet. Show the tweet! I'm gonna hook this up so we can really test it out, but before I do that, we gotta talk about our sponsor. Whoa! Did you know Ridge Wallet sponsored this video? Thanks, guys. Ridge Wallet is a compact wallet that keeps pant bulge down. It has RFID-blocking plates to keep thieves from stealing your info. You can use the cash strap or the money clip to hold your cash, and you can save 10% and get free worldwide shipping at Ridge Wallet by using offer code LINUS at Ridge.com/Linus. Now back to the show, the show of me hooking up a PC to this monitor. - [Jono] Supposed to talk about the I/O first though. - The what? - The I/O! - Oh, I'll do that, Jono. You're right, I'll do what you say. We'll take a bit more of a look at the physical... Oh, okay, so this is one of the... So we're starting right off with a limitation. The smaller models are able to do this more, I believe. The other ones can go all the way. Because it's, you know, who's gonna pivot a 34-inch monitor vertically? Okay, let's look at the I/O. I think I'm gonna have to tilt it back like this. Andy can you get in there? I should've just done this before I attached it. Okay, so we obviously got the power connector. We got an HDMI 2.0 port, I believe. We got DisplayPort 1.2. Now, this is a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port that's worth up to 5 gigabits per second, but it also supports 90-watt charging that can charge your laptop or whatever while the monitor's off, apparently. We'll put that to the test. And that can also serve as an upstream port for the hub functionality of the monitor in addition to this USB Type-B port right here. I'm not sure whether that USB-C cable can do the hub functionality and DisplayPort at the same time, but we'll see. It's also got an RJ45 Ethernet connector, which is not something you see all the time on monitors. But this is a business monitor. And then on the bottom, you kinda have a more easily accessible USB-A connector as well as a 3.5-mil jack and another USB-C port that's also 5 gigabits per second, but it only supports 15 watts charging, so you're not gonna go crazy with that thing. It's also got this handy little Teams button on the front. That's not something you see every day. And in fact, it's the main attraction of this monitor. Get a close up on that, Andy. Right there. Got these other buttons. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Buttons. All right, let's put it back on. On the back we have the power button and a joystick! Always love to see a joystick for monitor settings. And what's this tape up here? That's for the webcam. It's got Windows Hello built in. Let's check it out. All right. Plug in my laptop here. Power! Activate! (upbeat music) Is it gonna figure it out without me doing anything? \"Use the joystick.\" And do what with it? \"Down\" English. \"Select yes to enable the following functions: always-on USB charging.\" Uh, yes. There it is! Hold on, hold on, hold on. I wanna see somethin'. When I close the lid, do nothing. Now what happens? It's smart. - [Jono] What about mouse and keyboard? - Is this a touchscreen? - No! - It's not. (Jono laughs) - Um, duplicate, extend! This isn't just a monitor that you're plugging in. So right now we're only using the display portion of the USB-C connection. But we're also asking it to use a webcam and mics and to send sound and as a USB hub. Let's open the camera. So right now it's using the laptop's webcam. Yeah, does it need a driver or something? Let's find out. Let's take this thing off. Yeah, ready for a peel? I set you free, webcam! (upbeat music) Can you see that? - Yeah. - What do you see? - Nothing. - Nothing. It's camouflaged. This monitor is a Transformer. Webcams in disguise Sorry. I'll stop. All right. I haven't pushed it yet. Do you think I should? - [Jono] Push it! Oh. What just happened? - \"Hey there. It looks like you're using a Team-certified device. Did you know tapping the Teams button opens Teams?\" That's what I just did. Let's bring that over here. Call me on Teams. Oh! - [Jono] Oh, is it working? - No, that's my laptop webcam. I'm unmuting, but it's muting you again right away. All right, let's cancel this. Canceled. - [Jono] No! (Riley laughs) - I'm gonna plug in the PC instead because I wanna see how smart it is at just setting up by itself without me doing extra work. I got a computer down here. Can you see that, Andy? Okay, so I'm plugging that into the USB-C port, and them I'm grabbing the DisplayPort. (Riley grunts) Does this have Teams? Wait, I won't search for it. I'll just press the button. Press-a the button! I almost half-expected it, when you press the Teams button, for it to go online and download it. Teams. - Hello? - Hello? - [Jono] I can't hear you, man. - Okay. Now can you hear me? Check, check, check. - Nope. - What the heck? This is probably a huge waste of time. Yep. Because I need to download drivers or something. All right, cancel again. Sorry. Get outta my face, Jono! (clapper clacks) Maybe the reason why it hasn't been working is because there's this little red doohickey on the top where the webcam is and I'm supposed to pull that out, and maybe once I pull that it'll magically work. Let's find out. Yeah, I don't... No, I don't think you're supposed to pull it. I think that's just like the lens cover. But what I think what you are supposed to do is push! Oh! There it is. And, \"Webcam and mic enabled.\" I'm gonna peel this off. All right. Call me, Jono! - [Jono] Whoo! After it kinda focused in, it's really sharp. - Yeah? It's supposed to be 1080p, 30 FPS. This shot we be better if we could see what it looks like on your laptop. Go over there, Andy. Yeah, it looks pretty good. And I can get right up in the face for the real business conference vibes. Listen, if you don't have those reports in by Friday... - [Jono] Yeah, you can actually see that. Is that brightness, Andy? - [Andy] Auto exposure and also auto white balance. - So it would be good if I was a makeup YouTuber and I had to show a product? It's like, \"This week I'm wearing Chanel.\" Let's switch back to the laptop! Okays, call me. Press the Teams call button. Oh, and there's no camera. - [Jono] I can hear you though. - And you're coming through the monitor but my camera's off, probably just because I... There we go! Nice. All right, you redeemed yourself, monitor. I was kinda scared for a second. - [Jono] Check out the new ShortCircuit set! - [Riley] Oh my gosh! Sneak peek! Is that the ShortCircuit set? I didn't even know what that was. I was like, \"Ooh, is that the podcast set?\" - [Jono] No, the podcast set sucks. - That's rude. Here I am hosting a video for you, on your channel. Subscribe to TechLinked. Subscribe to Carpool Critics. Okay, so that is... It's redeemed itself. I was just confused. Linus! Look! It's got a web... You ever seen that before? It's webcam with a built in, or it's a monitor with a built-in webcam. Look at this! (sputters) - [Linus] Nope, nope. - What, you don't like it? - Nope, it's too far. - What are you talkin' about? - It's too (beep) far. - Nah, it's great! - Nope! - No, it's just like a laptop without a... Without a mouse and key... Linus! What does he know? Papa! (Jono laughs) The viewing angles are pretty good. It's supposed to be 178 degrees, so almost 180. And, like, yeah! You're probably not gonna be doing a ton of gaming on this thing, okay, guys? It is 60 hertz, so whatever. It's got a KVM in it. So I'm plugged in with USB-C on my laptop. DisplayPort again. And I'm gonna plug in with the USB-A to USB-B. (plug-and-play tone chimes) Is it doing it? Cool. So there we go, that was pretty easy. What they say is that it has a built-in KVM, which means you should be able to use one mouse and keyboard with both machines. USB switch. Upstream. USB-C. (gasps) Yeah! Okay. That's super easy. So I still have my laptop plugged in and I can control the mouse on the laptop, but I can also control the mouse with this one which is plugged in through the monitor! Yeah! And that, I think, is the really cool thing about this monitor, is that it integrates a bunch of other stuff that you would need to go and connect to your PC in a discreet fashion, like separate. It's just all there. I'm a bit confused as to why Microsoft has a monitor with Teams integration built in when they have this special deal with Samsung, where Samsung and Microsoft are buddy-buddy. I figured this would be a Samsung monitor instead, but it's a Dell. You know, Dell's gettin' in on the Microsoft action too. Microsoft doesn't discriminate. - [Jono] Do you wanna check the speakers out? - I don't know. I'm scared. I don't think this is gonna be very good, guys. (upbeat dance music) For a business-focused monitor, that's pretty good. Well, that was a monitor, and this was a video. And you are a viewer, and I'm a host. And we're gonna make more of these is the point I'm trying to get at, so subscribe, follow, on Twitter? Do whatever you want. It's a free country. Depending on where you are.",

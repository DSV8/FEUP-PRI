    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine! - And I'm Jenna. - We're so excited because right now we're in Montana to announce something we are working on that is so exciting. - We've actually been working on this for a year now. We've partnered with Sony to have our very own - [Both] Camera camp! - Okay, cool, that'll cut to like a nice montage type thing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Just like that. (upbeat music) So we're in Montana and last year we went to this event with Sony called Kando and we had the absolute best time ever. I left that event with friends, I was inspired, we learned so much about camera gear that we didn't even know. - I mean sometimes finding friends and inspiration (Justine laughs) is actually the hardest part in life. So the fact that that happened, we were very motivated to have something very similar but for video creators. - We kept calling it camera camp. - It had that camp vibe because everyone was so close and we were doing activities. - So we had such a good time and Jenna and I were like we need to do an actual camera camp. So, guess what? Welcome to - [Both] Camera camp! (children cheering) The road ahead It twists and turns And the sun beats down and it burns But I keep Keep on pushing through And every step quicker - September 22nd, here in Montana. - Wait, you didn't tell them the best part. - I didn't? What's the best part? - That they can come too! - Obviously we wish that we could have everyone come to this camp but we do have an application process and we'll be choosing 100 people from those applications that can come! - It's gonna be incredible, so there's gonna be a workshop on September 22nd like Justine said, there's gonna be classes, there's gonna be activities, there's gonna be a welcome bag, there's gonna be a massive video scavenger hunt. But I highly would suggest if you're able to to come for maybe the weekend go visit Glacier National Park, absolutely beautiful so travel and lodging is not included but all the meals here are gonna be included and all the activities and the classes and everything. We really could not be more excited that you guys can come along. - That was the whole reason that we really wanted to do this because we wanted other creators and smaller creators who might not ever get a chance to go to events like this to have something where they leave inspired, or meet other creators. - There's also dogs here! - Oh my gosh. We've spent half the time petting the dogs 'cause we're easily distracted. There are so many fun activities and we'll be giving you guys more information as the dates get closer. The most important part though is if you are interested in coming, it is September 22nd, you have to be 18 and older. All of the info is in the description below and we look forward to all of your applications 'cause we're gonna be going through all of them. - Yeah, come hang out! There's also gonna be a lot of other YouTubers and content creators here. - And we do plan on doing this again so if you don't get accepted for the first round just know that we wish that we could accept everyone. - So once this is a success. - We'll see you guys in the future. - Yes! - Maybe we should stop talking and go show them camera camp. - Yes! We need to show you Montana. (upbeat music) - There's an elk, there's two actually. I'm trying to get the shot here with this camera with the zoom lens and also vlog at the same time. Forward makes this bend Oh oh oh - Oh god. - Oh god! - I'm in, you gotta get in too! - Wait, I have to get in now? - I don't know. Sun that beats down and burns But I keep Keep on pushing through Yeah I get love I get love And I may fall right back down But your love lifts me back To something better Your love your love I get up And I may fall right back down But your love, your love, your love Lifts me back up - Will Camera Camp have horse riding? Yes. This is Chester and these are all of Chester's friends. (upbeat music) - I'll see you soon, okay? We'll see you in September. Bye baby, goodbye sweetie.",

    "transcript": "what we have in this box is a thousand four hundred dollar aliexpress pre-built which on the website looks ridiculous honestly i haven't been this excited to get in a box for a very long time uh but before we get into that we have a sponsor for today's video that helped us pay for this ridiculous pre-build today's video is sponsored by squarespace which is the easiest way to get

up your website and you're ready to launch go to squarespace.com forward slash david to save 10 of your first purchase of a website or domain thank you very much squarespace for sponsoring this video [Music] now before we get into the box i just want to bring your attention to this document here which states that the value of the system in here is 282 us dollars now if i don't remember correctly i paid closer to a thousand four hundred dollars for this system and i'm guessing that the reason that they put that value down there is so that you don't have to pay as much for import tax now if anybody from the canadian equivalent of the irs are watching i did not ask for this this is not my fault i promise and here we have the box which is entirely covered in brown tape which kind of makes me feel like there's some guy in a factory in china whose entire job it is to just cover cardboard boxes with tape i have to say tape man you did a wonderful job it's very evenly covered in tape moving to the side of the box it seems like the case is by a company called zaginol i think is how you say that which sounds suspiciously like oh we have a box within an open box the box under here is actually oh there we go we can actually start to see a bit of it which is just getting my juices flowing and then as you can see over here we have the grape pot which is just the best combination of words i've seen in a while in here we can see that the case is actually very well packaged soft soft foam and a very exciting looking pc case in there let's let's get it out of the box pull that off like that oh this thing looks genuinely spectacular oh that something rolling around in there which i don't like the sound of we've got some dirty bubble wrap which is a staple of aliexpress products oh it looks so amazing oh it's got a strix card in it so as you can see in here there's actually a strix card down there we've got an evga power supply and some motherboard action we're gonna pull this back oh it's not a very good mounting mechanism but these screws look really amazing there we go revealing the inside so as you can see here we have the strix rtx card i'm not entirely sure what this is i'm guessing it's a 2060 but we'll have a closer look at it soon that's crazy because like a 2 000 strix pre-built doesn't have a strix card in it so that's exciting and then here we've got more foam to protect the graphics card and then we have the system down there you can already see a bunch of big issues with it but it's fine really hope this system actually fires up okay so straight off the bat there are clearly some issues with it first off uh the aio is not mounted down properly so if you can see here they just didn't screw it down on one side and then over here you can see that the ram is actually not in the correct slots for it to operate its dual channel why is ram so difficult to get right on these damn prebuilts i don't understand it but we have two sticks of ram and they're tri-dizzy as well which is crazy it's ddr4 3000 and seems to have been a part of a 32 gig kit so we only got we only got half of the ram kit here and then in terms of the graphics card this is a strix rtx 2060 which does seem to be used the motherboard is a tough gaming asus board which actually looks like a pretty impressive motherboard for a pre-built and then we have this strix card over here that has custom sleeving on it which is really cool unfortunately the actual motherboard power is just the standard connector uh but still you get you get cables up here it also seems like somebody blew their thermal paste load all over the system there is a lot of random bits of thermal base around the place there are also some loose screws lying around which is always always a great sign as you can see from the side it is a very flimsy case but that is without the side panel on this side so maybe that helps stabilize it a bit power supply-wise it's got an evga g3650 in it which is a good power supply around back um there's not the best cable management situation going on here you can see the same goes for around the top here but that's something that we can pretty easily fix honestly the the raw components that we have here are actually very impressive considering what we paid for it it does suspiciously seem like the system was assembled by somebody who genuinely couldn't be asked so with that let's put the side panels back on and fire it up to see if the system actually works considering that it was clearly built by a trained orangutan i am not super hopeful but let's see what happens i do have explosion cam ready in case something in case something goes wrong uh but yeah let's just i think this is the power button oh sounds of water moving that is a very satisfying power button i have to i didn't plug the monitor in oh [__] it does look really awesome oh look at that we're in um there may be a bit of a problem because it seems like windows may be in chinese a little bit um can i change that can i like okay update time i've reinstalled windows on it and then during the first boot cycle it blue screen it was a ram code error so i may uh just fix the ram configuration and then maybe that'll help i don't know whoever built this system spilled a whole bunch of thermal paste all over the ram slots here the diagnostic led down here says that there's something wrong with the ram so i'm going to try one stick at a time and see if at least one of them works and then i'll kind of swap it out for a different kit okay so i have a cheap ram kit in here that i know for a fact works uh so let's see what it does with that oh it's actually booted with that now i have my own true dizzy kit in here uh so hopefully it works with this one oh that is so much less catastrophic than the motherboard being dead um it still sucks but you know it could have been much worse that's definitely a first in my pre-built buying journey i've never had a system show up with dead components in it but i guess it was bound to happen at some point that estranged ram kit with half the sticks missing uh was was the problem both the sticks were dead i couldn't get the system to boot up with either of them in it uh it did work with the initial windows install though so it seems like it's not a bilingual ram kit the windows install just killed both of them but now that we have our own tree dizzy set in the system it's running very well which brings us to the gaming performance [Music] so as you can see the system runs very well while playing battlefield 5 both the cpu and the gpu are averaging at about 60 degrees celsius which is good for those two components and that temperature is stuck all the way through my benchmarking so that's that's impressive well done little abomination aliexpress kind of half dead system now after doing the performance benchmarks there was one more thing that i wanted to address which was the mad pre-built thermal paste [__] situation we had going on there really was thermal paste all over the system so i opened up the aio and had a look lo and behold there was a whole lot of thermal paste [Music] oh there is there is a lot of thermal paste on there oh that's that's like the that's like the best buy build all over again oh my look at all of that and then down there on the actual cpu yeah this is a lot of thermal paste after cleaning that up i actually tried to remount the aio properly and i now more understand why this system was so badly put together and it's because this vac case is just so badly designed the metal strips that you have to mount the aio to is so thick that the screws don't really reach the screw hole in the aio and if you put any pressure on it they just pop out so that's why we had all those loose screws lying around and one screw left holding the whole aio in so that's a pretty big design flaw and just getting to any of the screw holes is so difficult in this vacuum case because of just they're all hidden under bits of metal it's really annoying other massive design problems with this case include the fact that the power supply sits right at the front at a weird angle so it means to get the power cable to it you have to route it through the system and then bring it up at a very very obtuse angle to get that power cord in there which just feels highly precarious in conclusion the aliexpress pre-built was a roller coaster of emotions i was so excited when i was busy unboxing the system that i couldn't stop making weird overly sexual moan noises oh look there we go oh there we go it really made my editing process a lot harder to try and cut down on those as much as possible but then it turned into a pretty frustrating experience having to diagnose the ram issue and then finally remounting the aio properly made me so angry i just wanted to just huck the thing out a window at a point but considering the fact that we got something that looks like a not very well built custom system as opposed to just an off-the-shelf crap box i think it could have been way worse than it was quite frankly and on that note i ended up also buying a sub 400 gaming pre-built off of aliexpress which should be showing up in the next couple of weeks so stop to the channel if you want to see that that's gonna be a very interesting video on that note if you like this video please like and subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one and until the next video bye-bye [Music]",

    "transcript": "- Oh boy, it's here. The Sony A7S3. This is the camera that I've been waiting for so long and not just me, everyone. And I'm going to unbox it. And then I'm going to tell you guys to go watch another video where I do be very in depth review of this. We went to Utah and got a chance to check this out early and had the absolute best time. And now, for the past, how long was that? When did we go? Was that like a month? Has it been like almost two months? I don't even-- - [Off-Camera] What's time? - I don't know, but it's been over a month since. We haven't had this camera. So we've had to go back to shooting on the A73s which are also incredible cameras. This is it, It's here. And now I would say my video life has changed. I was gonna say my actual life, actually, I guess it sort of has, but video life there's no going back. Okay, let's open it. Everyone keeps asking me why I have a throwing ax in my desk. I don't even know why you would ask me such a question. It seems like a very normal accessory. Instructions. What are you telling me? They're telling me something about SD cards. I am excited to get the new compact flash card to really test out some of the high end S and Q 4K 120 recording features because I didn't have one at the time of shooting the previous review. USBC cable. You can charge this with USBC, which is incredible. No recording time limits, 4K, 120, 422, 10-bit. Oh! I'm going to call my mom and let her know. She probably already watched my review. So she's well aware. This is actually a very, very precious piece right here. This is the battery charger. This does use the Z series batteries, like the seven three, and a bunch of the other higher-end line camera. Oh buddy! Look at this. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. Wow. It feels so heavy compared to the A7C that they just came out with. That thing is so incredibly light, but this is a beefy boy or girl. Oh, it smells like high production value. Oh wow. (sniffs) Look at this. No jingle, no jangle. Have you met our friend with a flip out screen? I was reading a review. I forget what the website was, but it was like a super professional review. And in one of the descriptions, it called this, the flippy-out screen. It was like the cutest thing ever. It's really what it is. Like, what else are you going to call it? Anything else in here is like something like maybe some breakfast. Oh, a little bitty reel. Here you are. Z Series can never-- never have enough batteries. But the good thing is the battery life on this is really great. And since we've started using these larger batteries in a lot of our shoots-- it's incredible. And most of these cameras that we have right now, we started plugging them into USBC. So we'd hardly even use batteries. Oh something else! For the powerbrick. Charger. Charge it up. I'm charged up. So that's it. I have unboxed it. Now I want to send you guys to the link to watch my full review. This video was really fun. So it's something that I'm very proud of and we worked really hard on this, so I hope you guys enjoy it. And basically my next review is going to be all of the other videos that I shoot that look really incredible. It's because of this. Should I give it a name? Maybe like leave me some comments below of what you think that I should name this new camera and I will make a sticky label and I'll put it on the camera. Hello. My name is. (chill music) Subscribe for more videos because there are so many coming out, but it's incredibly overwhelming, but I'm so excited. So I'll see you guys later. I'm going to go charge, - You forgot the camera. - Oh my God. I am taking trash. I forgot the battery. God, I'm going to stab myself and not be happy. - [Off-Camera] You forgot the cable. The charger. - I have one. It's fine. - [Woman Off-Camera] I can hear you. - So it's going to be very dangerous over here. - [Man Off-Camera] Oh, that's a drop. - [Woman In Blue Shirt] So that's a drop. - [Woman In Gray Shirt] Oh my, it is. - [Woman In Blue Shirt] But you can go around. But like, I was up there on that edge. - [Woman In Gray Shirt] Okay. (gasps) - [Man And Woman In Gray Shirt] Are you okay?",

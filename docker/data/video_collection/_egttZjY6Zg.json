    "transcript": "- Are you really, even a gamer if you don't have a gaming phone? What are you playing on your PC? Get outta here, man. ASUS is back with the Republic of gamers ROG gaming phone number six, and the six pro, which we have today. (imitating spaceship door-opening noises) And then it just goes back down, okay. (imitates spaceship door-closing noises) There's so much going on in this box right now. How do I? Okay, so that comes out. That's the phone. And then what's over here? This is a little card. Join the Republic for those who dare. And I plug that into my cyber punk motorcycle and then we go and it's Akira time. It seems like there's more moving parts that I wanna- Hello? But it, I think the box reminds you of like just what we're dealing with here. None of this is function. It's all form. It's all fun. Maybe one of the most important things about this phone is that it's one of the first, is it the first? on the market with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, the top tier smartphone chip. It's exciting to see that chip debut in a phone that may properly be able to take take advantage of its performance. But this is my pixel three. This is my pixel three with a case on it. It is still a little bit thinner, but it's pretty close. Can you see that, Andy? So this is a chunky boy and just like the previous ROG phone models or at least the the last one, there's a display on the back. On the six pro, the six, a non-pro does not have a display. It has an illuminated RGB logo. Let's start here because this is the this is the thing that kind of, like, defines the ROG gaming phone, this side-mounted USBC port to make it a little bit easier to game and charge at the same time they also have the one on the bottom but the one on the side here is USB 3.1 gen two. And this one is just 2.0, but they both will get you fast charging using the included 65 watt adapter. But this one also supports display port 1.4. So you can output video. SIM card slot?! Because there is no SD card support it comes with 512 gigs of storage. On the top, we have nothing, maybe a mic there, or something. On this side, we got the volume rocker and the power button. And I guess these are like to denote the air triggers. Once again, for gaming. Over here, you got a headphone jack! Yes! Ooh, as we turn it on we got the display powering up on the back. On the back we got 50 megapixel with a Sony IMX 766 sensor. Everyone's waiting for me to say those numerical designations. Next to that is the ultra wide 13 megapixel ultra wide. And next to that is an interesting edition. It's a macro five megapixel sensor. This is for gamers and gamers want to get really nice, close up shots of all their their little Chocobo mini figurines or the little, what are those things called? Funko pops. And on the front, we have a 12 megapixel also Sony sensor IMX 663, which is why it was important for me to tell you about that first one. Don't forget it. But first, the true reason why we're here. - Thanks to Teamgroup for sponsoring this video. Teamgroup is currently giving away an exclusive set of their 32 gigabyte Delta RGB 6400 megahertz DDR five RAM, a support for Intel's XMP 3.0 one-click over clocking for ultra fast speeds in a single click. And it features 120 degrees of ultra wide RGB lighting with the clean geometric silhouette. Teamgroup will also be releasing a new gen five SSD and all new AIO liquid cooler that will be able to cool your CPU and MDOC 2 2280 SSD at the same time. Learn more about the giveaway and their Delta RGB DDR5 RAM at the link down below. - One of the big things that I didn't say about the overall hardware of the phone is the screen. It's 165 Hertz display up from 144 Hertz in the previous one and it's got 720 Hertz touch sampling rate. The end result isn't gonna be that much more noticeable, like look at that. And it's an AMOLED screen HDR 10 plus and I think it's 111% DCIP three color gamut coverage which means that the color accuracy is gonna be pretty good. The ROG phone six and six pro can go up to 800 nits sustained brightness, 1200 peak. It's not quite to the level of other flagship phones that we're seeing now that have like a thousand knit brightness sustained, that is. So it's a one millisecond response time. I guess if you have a physical controller connected but is 23 milliseconds touch latency. What does that mean? It's got the AS coating that's supposed to reduce friction when hand sweating, you know, when your hand's sweating. Okay. In the comments, if you know what an AS coating is let us know. In here, we got the arrow active cooler. They've updated this model a little bit for the gaming phone, six and six pro. It's got extra buttons on here. I'm not sure whether the previous one had four buttons. It might have had two but this one has a Thermo electric AI cooling system based on Peltier cooling chip. Pel-tee-ay? There's also the Kunai three game pad. Ooh, look at that case. That's nice. So this is like the Nintendo switch thing where you have the phone and then you have these bumper controllers that are kind of like joy cons. That's not what that is. Oh, you have to put this on the phone. Watch this. Slides in. These must be the joy cons and the really cool case. Oh yeah, see, there it is. And then I can, this whole thing slides into that. Oh, it just clips in. Cool. All right. So you can connect that to your phone. How do you now, how do you, oh, that's the release? Whoa. Whoa! Oh, these are, these joystick are legit too. Oh, look at that. I just plugged it in and it's automatically working. There's no pairing or anything. Successful system update. Thank you, sir. You know, I'm gonna say I was pretty skeptical when I was like are all these gaming phones. Do you really need that? But now that I'm holding it, I'm like this is a pretty good experience. I don't know if I would pay a thousand dollars which is what it costs for the ROG phone 6 and 1300 euros slash USD for the six pro. If you are dropping that money this is like a nice experience. I gotta say, like, this does not feel cheap. So let's strap this thing on. What is that? Look at- Oh, it's a stand. This is cool. Okay. So you plug it in you put that on the top, you clamp her down. You can still use that USBC port, there's pass through when you plug this thing in. That's awesome. So this is an interesting little bit of design here because most phones, you know they won't really they'll have the CPU of the phone you know, wherever they can, it makes sense to fit it. But the ROG phone has the Qualcomm CPU right in the center of the phone. And then above that they have a vapor chamber and a graphite sheet that kind of disperses the the heat from the CPU, and that helps normally. But then when you strap this thing on, it kind of like amplifies the cooling power that's already there because of that setup. And on either side of the CPU, they have two 3000 milliamp hour batteries. So you got a 6,000 milliamp hour battery altogether in this thing. I believe now attaching the arrow active cooler should put us right into advanced power modes. Man, every time you unlock it, it makes that sound. So armory crate is the app included with the ROG UI flavor of Android that you can choose to use, or you can use choose to use like Asus is more kind of non-gamery Zen UI, which they use in like the Zen phone and, and that kind of stuff. And here in armory crate, is this where I would choose power modes? Oh yeah, here we go. Okay CPU GPU. We got the temperature. We got the refresh rate maxed out, networking enhancement, battery endurance is low. But I guess because you know, those kind of those gotta the play off and trade off with each other. You know, they, they don't get along well. Oh, change it. So you can change it to ultra durable. So you got way more battery lasting and then you can change it to X mode. So like I just went into the settings earlier and changed it to 165 Hertz manually but then armory crate kind of will let you do this as like you can set profiles and just switch between them like that. I'm confusing the CPU a lot right now. It's getting pretty mad. Arrow active cooler, more settings. I can't, I can't change things here. Now we are plugged in. Now we have maximum power. It's going, I, I just, do you hear that? Whoa! This is the most annoying thing about mobile games. Every time I do a video where it's like gonna involve me playing some sort of like high fidelity mobile game, I'm like, all right let's do let's, let's try it out. And then it's like, Waiting. Twenty Two Days later. One thing I wanted to talk about briefly was the fact that this is a gaming phone and yeah, it comes with the cool accessories and it's got the cooler and it's got the most powerful processor on an Android phone, on the market and all that stuff. And that's cool, but is it good as like a phone? And I think that on a number of things it is a little bit disappointing. It's IPX four which is just splashproof, you know, water resistance. They're promising two years of security updates and two Android OS updates. But other phone makers are promising three years or three OS updates, or even like four or five when it comes to like the OEMs. Other things I didn't talk about, audio. It's got the Ceres logic, CS 35, L 45 amp just like the previous model. I wanted to talk about the speaker situation because unlike other phones you also have these big bezzles, like this is a pixel three. And at this point it was already getting kind of old that we had bezzles like this, so. But I understand why they put them there because I will appreciate front facing speakers especially on a gaming phone, dude. The RAM situation is similar to the ROG five where you got 16 gigs on the six and 18 gigs on the six pro. Yeah, the RAM is one of the few differences between the six and the six pro. So like it's a $300 difference, but what are you getting? The, the rear display, the six doesn't have the animated display and the pro does. So is that worth $300? That'll be up to you because everything else is the same. Unless I'm wrong. This is how you move around. Okay. Pretty cool. We found the, the game genie that lets us configure the air triggers. Okay. Ultrasonic buttons, turn 'em on. Here we go. Tap. Yeah. I'm tapping it. Nice, there they are. I think the last time I did the ROG phone, I couldn't figure out the triggers. I was like, how do they, where are they? But like, to be fair, there's some configuration that has to happen. You can't just like drop in. So I guess that's still the argument for like a switch or a steam deck or something. The new air trigger system, apparently there's 14 different actions you can perform between like swiping left and right, swiping up and down, hitting certain parts of the screen. That's cool to have that available to you. Short circuit hoodie! Wow, you were just waiting for me to put that on. Oh man, I am so gamer right now. (wolf-whistles) Oh. And now the, the cooler's working, the lights are on. Okay, we're experiencing some technical difficulties with the gaming side there but suffice to say for the, for the hardcore gamers you're gonna have some options available to you. You got some cool accessories. You got the armory crate, to make sure that you can customize your experience how you want to do it. How do I get outta here? Crab Rave. Show me what you got. Pretty good. Oh man. Yeah, this one is like missing a little bit of mids that this one, one fills out nicely. We're on the 50 megapixel main shooter right now, I guess. And then there's a 0.6 option that- okay, so that's using the 13 megapixel ultra wide now. I can shoot video at 8K and 24 FPS. 4k at 120, slow motion mode. That's pretty good stabilization like, whoa. - Whoa. - I'm actually pretty impressed by that. What do you think Jake? Am I your favorite short circuit host? - You're one of 'em. One of 12 of my favorite hosts. - Gonna burn it to the ground. Those photos aren't horrible. That's the ultra wide one, so it's gonna be a little less. This is the 50 megapixel, highest quality. Lots of detail, colors are maybe a bit washed out. I mean overall, it seems like it's like a decent camera for sure. I don't think that it's gonna let anyone super down. But again, why a macro lens instead of a telephoto? Just put that on. That's the selfie cam. Okay. Now I'm in the macro mode. Oh man, you can tell that's only five megapixels. Is it dirty back here? That doesn't look like alloy at all. Yeah, now that I see like other photos the color is definitely lacking. I mean, it could, it, it could tell that there was a lot of colors going on here, so it popped everything. Anyways, I think that's about enough playing around in a very non-professional way. The ROG phone six pro, it's a gaming phone. It has the top end mobile CPU you can get in a phone right now. It's got a crazy amount of RAM, 16 gigs or 18 gigs in the pro version. It's got a completely unnecessary back display. It also doesn't have wireless charging. And I wonder if they didn't include it because of the rear display. So it's missing a few things that you definitely wanna see on a, you know, thousand plus thousand dollars smartphone. On the other hand, it's got all these cool gaming features. So if you were somebody who is just like like lives and breathes mobile gaming, it seems like this is one of the best options. If, if not the best option for the person who like absolutely needs that, you know mobile gaming experience. But that's not me. I'm just Riley. And this is just short circuit. So subscribe if you want more heartfelt sentiments like that from me and probably not from me actually from other people cause they're never gonna let me back here again.",

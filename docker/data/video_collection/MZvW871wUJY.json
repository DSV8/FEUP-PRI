    "transcript": "- Well, it's been a good run, Dell. I've had this XPS 15 for a bit over a year, and honestly, it's been fantastic the whole time. But sometimes you got to change it up, (Alex grunts) to the new XPS 15. It's the same thing, but a little bit faster and that's good enough reason for me. So, I guess, do we just get into it, David? - [David] Yeah, let's do it. - Yeah, just unbox it. Here we go. Brand new XPS 15. What a fancy box. All right. Oh David. (laptops shuffling) Which one's the new one? - [David] Uh. Left? - Yeah. It's not dented. (Alex and David laugh) That's the exact same laptop. IO is completely unchanged. I have found it really annoying only having Thunderbolt and type C. I do really wish there was a type A. Although the full-sized SD card reader, I actually use a lot. I absolutely love it and want it on all of my laptops. Every little thing is everything. - [David] What does that mean? - Yeah. Every little thing is everything, sure. Here's our power adapter. Yeah, that appears to be exactly the same as the last one. Still 130 Watts. This is an awesome addition. I don't know if this came in the last one. I definitely didn't get it. But we have just full-size HDMI and a type A port, so that you don't get, well, screwed, when you buy this thing and realize that you don't have a dongle. And here we have another one, this one's marked, \"Brandon Lee,\" because Brandon is lucky and happened to be standing there when I was asked by a Dell rep if anyone wanted an XPS 17. So you got a new work laptop, Brandon. Good job. Oh my God, this is heavy. Yeah, I remember why I don't like the XPS 17. It is an awesome laptop that is very powerful, but it's just, it's that little bit heavier where you want to actually need the power and I don't need the power this thing has. Let's put the XPS 17 away for a bit and talk about the 15. All right, this is the actual reason that I'm taking the time to switch computers, 'cause like this right here is essentially the same laptop, but with marginally faster insides. The thing that... Oh my God, Jake, your car sounds ridiculous. Is that a problem? - [David] Yeah, we should wait. (beeps) Why I'm switching over is because this is a proper production version that has a trackpad that is, well, what the trackpad should be like. My old XPS is a pre-production version that has a slightly wonky trackpad. I don't know if you're gonna be able to even see this, David. If I kind of like angle it like this, can you see just the tiny bit that goes in there? - [David] Yeah, it's not clicking. - [Alex] Yeah, so that's not clicking and it's just moving down. It's just, well, it's a problem that these laptops had at first, and maybe still occasionally have. Basically, if you get an XPS that has like a weird floppy trackpad, you contact Dell and are like, \"Hey, give me one that's not broken.\" So the upgrades that we have here are very marginal. So this one right here has an i7-11800H from the i7-10875H. They're both 8 cores, 16 threads. More than fast enough for a laptop like this. And not quite as fast as the i9 version that is available, but in almost every task, just as fast. Because like the power and thermal constraints in this guy is going to be your problem, instead of like i9 versus i7. I did upgrade to 32 gigabytes of RAM from just 16. And we have one terabyte SSD instead of half a terabyte. But the biggest difference though, again, is, oh, it's a 3050 Ti GPU as opposed to the 1650 Ti. Apparently it's 11% faster, so yeah, if you have the old version, don't buy the new version. It's literally the same thing, just 10%, maybe faster. So yeah, don't sweat it. (Alex chuckles) Now, what Dell really wanted me to show off here is their new OLED screen, that's the one thing that the old version did not have and the new version has. And I did not get it because I'm legitimately going to be using this computer all the time and I don't want the OLED option. (Alex laughs) The problem is that a lot of OLED screens that I've seen before have this like weird graininess where you can kind of see the subpixels. And especially when you have a digitizer on front for the touchscreen, it'll just be kind of grainy and weird. Especially when you're looking at an all white screen. And so when 90% of what I plan on doing with this laptop is being in Word, writing scripts, having an all white thing look bad is not going to be great. We have the 4K touchscreen. It is one of the best displays that you can get on a laptop, if not the best. So we need to go into here, it's called Dell PremierColor. All that we do in here, is we come into, I think it's advanced color setup. Yes. From the factory, it comes with the vibrant color preset, which basically just takes all your colors and makes them more colors. If that makes sense. It's real Best Buy TV mode kind of crap. Like it looks terrible unless you don't know what photos look like. And then you're like, \"Oh my God, colors.\" Is there a less (beeps) way that I can say that, David? - [David] Absolutely not. - [Alex] Anyway, we can just take that right here and click on photo Adobe RGB, and boom. It now looks pretty much the same, except the colors are now accurate. - [David] How does it sound? - We'll get into the sound in a bit. We're gonna do a \"Crab Rave,\" David, but we're gonna look at the 17 first. (whooshing) But before that, our sponsor, Bitdefender. Thanks to Bitdefender for sponsoring today's video. We all love browsing the internet, but Bitdefender Total Security helps make it safer. It works great with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS devices, and protects you against network threats, phishing, ransomware, unauthorized webcam access, and more. With Total Security's focus on protection, performance and privacy, you get both security and functionality. It's the awarded Outstanding Security Product by AV-Comparatives, and PCMag Readers' Choice award. Protect yourself today by checking out Bitdefender, and get a 120-day trial in the link in the video description. (whooshing) So let's put this guy away. Actually, I'm gonna use it for just a tiny bit first. There's two ways that you can get into this computer and both of them are pretty good. So we have Windows Hello facial recognition up here. Actually, I'll just show you on my laptop, since I already have it setup, we don't need to bother with it. But it's really great that they have the touch sensor right here in the power button. So you can use your fingerprint to get in or the facial ID. So we'll just use my face to get in. Awesome if you're wearing a mask, you can use the touch print. And it's great. The keyboard and the trackpad are just so good. It's the reason that you buy this thing for sure. So I am typing a thing here. (keyboard clacking) Yeah, it's exactly the same keyboard that I had before. A-plus Dell, good job. (Alex chuckles) And yeah, the trackpad, it's absolutely massive. Dell have just maximized the size of this thing. And move on to the XPS 17. So this right here, if you're looking for a laptop, I don't know that I'd recommend it because it's heavy as frig. (Alex chuckles) If you're looking for a desktop that you can easily put in your bag, this right here might be a really good option. Like if you're going out and doing actual video editing in the field, this right here will do it. So let's take a look at the specs of this guy. So this one also has an i7-11800H. Although it's the same CPU, I would expect it to perform a little bit better in this guy because the 17 gets a wicked, full vapor chamber cooler on the bottom, as opposed to the heat pipe solution on the 15. Plus I have 32 gigabytes of RAM. One terabyte, SSD. And an RTX 3060. So that's the really big difference between these two. If you want to game, you get this one right here. Actually, before we do the audio test, we need to do something very quick. So yes. (laptop clicks) MaxxAudio Pro by Waves. We go into this program right here. So this does a bunch of cool things like changing the audio based on whether you're looking for better stereo surround, it adds an EQ. It's terrible. It's hot garbage. It makes everything just have like weird reverb to it, especially when you put on headphones. So it just goes. Goodbye. I don't want to see you again. Uninstall. Oh, are you excited, David? - [David] Yeah. For what? We're gonna get to do the first of many \"Crab Raves\" on this laptop. (David whoops) So yes. (laptop playing \"Crab Raves\" by Noisestorm) All three screens unsurprisingly look exactly the same. Let's switch to the new one. (laptop playing music) I think it might be better. No way. (laptop playing music louder) That's way louder. (David speaking indistinctly in background) Yeah, they're at the same volume, they're both at max. This is way louder. (laptop playing music) Wow, that's way better. Dell, you didn't tell me this. New 15 to new 17. (laptop playing music quieter) What? Why? Okay. Good job, Dell. I have no clue what you did. And like we know for sure it's not an EQ or anything, because I literally just uninstalled the program that has the EQ stuff in it, so like, also, why is your 17 worse? I'm flabbergasted. Sure, so there's a bonus that also gets to why I am still using XPS 15. It's the benchmark for Windows laptops, that's why I use it every single day. Because I need to benchmark the other laptops and none of them are as good yet. But HP and Lenovo, please give me a new benchmark laptop. It's been a year, you're not even close. (Alex chuckles) (David makes sound) Yeah. I guess should we get Brandon over? Like we have his new laptop here. Should we get his thoughts? - [David] Brandon, are you here? - Hey, Brandon. Do you want to say something to the people? - Is this the 15 inch? - [David] It's the 17 inch. - 17 inch, what? Okay, I didn't even know I was getting a 17 inch. I forgot what I looked at when I looked at the specs. I mean, I'm upgrading from this like Korean-only LG Gram, but it's not a Gram. So this thing is not that amazing, but I don't do anything that intense. This is a really big upgrade. Alex, I am so excited. So thank you, Alex. I'm gonna just take this now. - [Alex] Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's it. Hopefully Dell doesn't want this one back, 'cause I know that Andy wants to use it. I guess we'll find out after this video. And yeah, I hope you guys have just a fantastical day. Hit like, get subscribed. I'm gonna go and eat a sweet potato puree. Maybe just treat yourself to something that tastes good. - [David] Treat yourself. - Yeah. I made a tasty dinner last night and I'm gonna enjoy it for lunch. - [David] Treat yourself. (Alex laughs)",

    "transcript": "Here are the things you need to take the best photo of the solar eclipse on April 8th. First, a camera that allows for interchangeable lenses. Next, a lens that extends to at least 200 mm, but the longer the better. Once you have both those things the most important part will be getting a solar filter, for both your camera and your eyes. Remember trying to start small fires with magnifying glasses as a kid? Well, your lens is essentially a magnifying glass, and pointing it right at the sun can cause similar damage to your sensor, even if the moon is blocking the sun. A solar filter is basically a pair of sunglasses, a really dark pair of sunglasses, for your lens. There are expensive options and cheap options, but if you don't think you'll ever use it again, just go with the option that's best for your budget. And remember, you should get something for your eyeballs too, whether that's a homemade pair of glasses using your newly acquired sheet of solar filter ,or a bought pair of eclipse glasses. And lastly, you're going to want a tripod to put your camera down on to minimize shake, and so that once you get your shot you can also just stand back and enjoy the view. Happy solar eclipse y'all!",

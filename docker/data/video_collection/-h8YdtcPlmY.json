This isn't the smallest ITX / DTX case around but it uses some new concepts to create a truly different kind of PC case.  Thanks to Thermaltake, Razer, be quiet! and Phanteks.

    "transcript": "what's up guys I'm retreating Hardware Canucks today we're visiting ASUS we got our name tags I've decided to be the money just for fun of it and this looks like a bit of a night and IKEA set to be honest but I hear there's a new case somewhere floating around I think I've noticed it but first huge thanks to Thermaltake Phanteks be quiet and razer sponsoring our CES video should be should be should be do be do be do be do be do be do be do so this my friends is what I want to check out today the rog z11 in its final finished form we saw the prototype being display at Computex a few months ago but it's actually quite awesome to see it being finished and it scared to see many awesome cases being released at CES whereas usually that's the case for Computex but the z11 is now just give you a quick rundown on the specs is a $249 case so that's a little bit pricey your opinion the ROG tax it is the same price as the LG Helius enclosure and there's also a two $99 model this that includes the all the display in the front that you can connect to the ROG terminal that can display CPU temperature and whatever else you want to display similar things you see on ROG motherboard so the two $49 price point what does that get you it's a full aluminum enclosure okay so no steal full aluminum frame aluminum paneling on the outside and some plastic bits here and there the one thing that this thing reminds me of outside of having likes very ROG complexity and dynamics in terms of the paneling and the little shapes here and there is if you guys are into sci-fi and if you watched the expanse that thing looks like the spaceship the rosin on tape especially from the back with that beautiful aluminum thing I don't know this is something that I thought of when I first saw the case from the rear so the z11 where does that come from that is the actual angle in degrees for the motherboard so they've patented this thing where the motherboard is not flat against the motherboard tray as the motherboard tray is angled 11 degrees on the interior and that presumably actually has many benefits we have additional spacing behind the motherboard tray for cables which is actually quite important when you're dealing on the ITX form factor even though this is a pretty large enclosure for ITX space but that degree offset on the back of the tray gives you more space for cables so that is one thing the second thing is performance because having more area behind the CPU backplate means you have more cooling the power supply is installed at the bottom supports full ATX units because I mean the case is pretty massive the shroud is nicely angled the cables do exit from both sides we do also have a bottom intake 140mm our fan that is included and it slightly below the power supply so if you do have a really long unit they will not interfere I do appreciate that so cooling wise we have two more fans at the top 140 Miller fans are included set in exhaust and we also can install dual 120mm fans for the rear and this is most likely the perfect scenario where you install an all-in-one cooler with these radiator and fan installation set up to exhaust from the back the GPU area is located the front tempered glass is of course to reveal all that beautiful card at first we were worried about performance because it is fairly close to the side panel but we do have ventilation that is available on the top on the side and at the bottom of the graphics card plus because of that angle we do have additional spacing there so I don't think GPU temperatures should be a problem all the potential intake ports are dust filtered with a fine mesh that you can easily clean as for storage you can install dual SSDs instead of the radiator in the back so there's a bit of a compromise there we also have this low cable bracket below the motherboard that is to hide the cables onto which you can install an SSD and you can also install one behind the motherboard tray CPU towers up to 130 millimeters are supported so you're most likely going to want to go with an AO solution or actually build a custom loop in which case you will be able to mount a 240 radiator up top otherwise you can't really mount an AO at the top because there's not much room width wise the RG hub behind the motherboard tray is included with six PWM fan headers three 5 volt addressable RGB header steel and dual USB twos pastors so because this is ITX it's always great to have additional USB ports that are included in the hub now since the motherboard is facing up all the i/o of course is hidden it's not your traditional orientation so you will have to route all those USBs and whatever DisplayPort your connect thing into the motherboard and the graphics card and because the case can orientate both vertically and horizontally we do have multiple cutouts behind that you can route all these i/o cables and I'm guessing this is something of a bit of a compromise but really should not be an issue the i/o is also pretty rich with four years B ports a type seen there and some buttons to control the case light I have asked them about what the assembly procedure is like because the case does appear to be large for an ITX system while also maybe kind of a cramp to work in but they have put conscious effort to make sure that the assembly procedure is as user-friendly as possible and I do appreciate ROG taking risk on this even though it's a super expensive tower but ITX form-factor is such a small niche in the entire computer space that I do appreciate them doing something that is very different I hope that more companies take approach on that whole angled motherboard tray especially when it comes to I TX form factors really really want to test to see if what exactly is the benefit in terms of cooling performance having that the motherboard being angled having a little bit more space behind the CPU block and the fact that you can place the case horizontally is a nice innovative touch we've seen that with the evolve shift and not many ITX enclosures go with the hybrid approach but the rog z11 might be a pretty popular tower in the ITX space if you like the design and like ROG as a whole this will launch at end of q1 let us know if you'd like us to review it I don't think this would be very popular in the ITX space simply because the ITX case form factor has been blowing up lately with really focus on making sure that you can compact as much as possible whereas the ROG approach I mean this is a very large enclosure for an ITX form factor and there is potentially room for micro ATX but that's not a segment that is very popular so yeah let us know what you think of these z11 thanks so much for watching I'll talk to you guys in the next video",

    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   Honor 8 Smartphone -   Had the chance to take a look at the new Honor 8 in every color. It's got a unique reflective back which creates interesting patterns when exposed to light. It also features a dual lens camera system featuring two sensors, one color and one monochrome. The Honor 8 will retail for $399.  From the manufacturer -  The Honor 8 combines exclusive design and high-end craftsmanship. The premium, slick body of the Honor 8 is made with heavy 2.5D glass on front screen and back surface, finished aluminum alloy, and ultra-narrow bezel design for a much stronger body and a smooth, seamless feeling.  The innovative bionic 12MP dual lenses of the Honor 8 are your eyes to the world. One lens allows for rich color and the other lens is monochrome to give your images more light and increased sharpness. Together they help you capture crisper, more detailed photos.  Do you want high-quality photos under macro, black light, low-light, and complex conditions? No problem for the Honor 8. The hybrid auto-focus enables laser focus for short range, precise depth focus for long range, and contrast focus  each working together to help you take better pictures in complex lighting conditions day and night.  The Honor 8 is powered by a (up to)2.3GHz octa-core CPU built on a 16nm architecture. 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM enable flawless multitasking and seamless gaming.  The CPU chipset contains an i5 co-processor, which controls the Honor 8s sensors and other features. The i5 co-processor works together with the Kirin 950 SoC chipset to increase processing speed, response time, and battery life.  *Honor 8 gold model is unavailable in US - take your pick from blue, black or white.

Look at that right there Two sim cards if you choose to or A sim card as well as a micro sd card Nice and vibrant Providing you with not just two lenses but also with two different sensors so you got one color sensor here and one monochrome sensor this allows you to take essentially black and white monochromatic images They are super high contrast . So if you launch into the camera app here the mono option is in the top left corner but there are some other filters you can use as well this allows you to create again a monochromatic image Okay so am gonna show you here there is this mode which allows you to create this shallow depth field by essentially taking two images and thats what gives you this really cool shallow depth of field effect isolate object from an artistic prospective but after you've snapped the photo then what can you do Are you stuck with it? NO! In this particular case you can you can shrink that aperture down and grab back some of the elder elements and bring them into focus as well Options for exposure compensation Auto focus, white balance, ISO A photo of the video that you are watching while you are watching that video (((pointing finger towards camera))) Make sure to get the various edges So lets say i locked the device. And i come back! OOOOOOO!!! Hit with the finger and boom! And here we go with the speaker hah ha ha It has a 3000MaH battery in it It also has quick charge So you can get like 50% of battery life in about 30 min of charging it There is a mode called perfect selfie Check me out Is that a pretty dude right there Who knows what you are looking at right now This could all be beauty mode you meet me in real life You are like aaaggghhhh!

What if we chuck a second lens on there I mean I kind like these kind of ambitious unusual looks at what this tech can do for us and where you can make those changes and where you can experiment with what you gonna include So this device the honor 8 here you're looking at a device that's 399 bucks retail. Available in few different colors And its pretty hard to distinguish it from stuff that is twice that price. So Go check it out for yourself I don't need to tell you You saw it here.",

    "transcript": "This here is a Viewer's extremely old extremely nasty playstation 2. at least i think it's extremely nasty and the reason why i think that is because i know firsthand that this thing has never been cleaned because this is my ps2 it's the one i grew up with my dad bought us this thing when i was just a boy and uh we've been i mean we used it forever we used it all the way through high school yeah we never really bought like the latest and greatest consoles so when i got this we kind of just held on to it and played tons of games on this for over a decade and like i said it's never been cleaned we've never taken it apart we've never done anything to it at all it's even got a little apple logo on it i'm gonna apologize in advance for that so this being the gcdc playlist i'm hoping that whatever is inside of this can be thoroughly cleaned we're gonna disassemble this entirely and then i have a few extra things to revamp it just a bit at the end of this one i'll just kind of throw it as an easter egg i have a free mcboot and i also have a uh it's a sata ssd adapter for the ps2 so we're going to try to you know modernize this console a bit make it a bit more enjoyable to play here in the early 2020s this is this the 20s not like the roaring 20s i suppose but it's the 20s again that's so weird to say anyway i am super excited to see what is inside of this thing i'm assuming there's going to be quite a bit of dust that we'll need to get rid of there's a lot of dust on the exterior as well in and around the frame these little grooves here on the sides of the console so i imagine yeah internally there's going to be quite a number of dust bunnies but it'll be fun it'd be great the transformation should pay off i hope you'll stick around stay with me to get rid of that annoying windows activation watermark head on over to vip scd key and purchase a windows 10 pro oem key for a fraction of the price of retail just use the secure payment method like paypal enter your product key into your pc settings window and say bye-bye to the watermark and be sure to use our offer code skgs for a sweet discount hey there and welcome to gecdc which stands for game console deep cleaning we have a similar playlist called pcdc where we deep clean viewers computers and we kind of stretch this over into the console side as well because well many people have consoles and a majority of them i would wager don't at least annually clean them which means they get very very dirty now this being a ps2 full transparency here i've never disassembled one of these i've done many xboxes xbox ones playstation 4's ps4 pros i've never done something quite this old i did disassemble my original playstation i do have one of those still and it still kind of works unbelievably but this ps2 i've just never touched because it's always worked it's always just been a very reliable console that said i'm sure we'll find a few surprises inside when it comes to my cleaning gear you can find all the stuff linked in the video description pretty much the same as it is in the pcbc playlist i have isopropyl alcohol here i have q-tips for cleaning those fine spaces especially around circuit board smds and the exteriors of consoles i have nitro gloves just in case things get especially icky though for my own console i probably won't bother i have shop towels great absorbing liquids especially oils i have a knock off ifixit tool kit you can use this to disassemble pretty much anything in the electronic space it's really nice it doesn't cost a normal leg either and i have a super beast electric duster pretty much tons of cans of air condensed into one little one little electric duster here my bristles are a little bent not sure how that happened but uh should still be effective oh and there is one more important product that i am so glad i've taken advantage of recently that is from levoit their core series of air purifiers has helped tremendously with cleaning up the atmosphere in this office i try to section this off from the rest of the house because i have young kids and i don't want them breathing in all the crap that i bring home right from random strangers essentially computers and consoles it's just it's super gross so when i close the door right all the dust that this thing blows into the air just stays in here so it gets really cloudy very disgusting but having an air purifier like the core 300 and the core series of air purifiers can definitely help clean up that air and allow you to breathe a bit better now what i like the most about levoit purifiers is that they use 360 degree air filters which means air is being pulled in from all directions in your room and clean air is exhausted out the top through very quiet fans you can set these things to be virtually inaudible while running and that is awesome but even if you're not doing things as extreme as i am here right where dust is just flying in the air all the time it is still important to have a purifier in your home at least in one of the rooms where you tend to just congregate and gather the most it will make a difference not only in the quality of the air that you breathe but it will also make a difference for some of the electronic products that you have laying around that room in particular for example if you place a core mini next to your pc or next to your console that can noticeably cut down on dust intake for that build because again you're more or less forcing a lot of that air to be filtered through the purifier before it enters your console or your pc or insert whatever electronics product here and i think that can really help in the long run save you time in having to clean these components because they won't get as dirty as fast just another reason to consider i'll avoid air purify you can check them out by the way linked in this video's description by the way one more thing before we get started i didn't mention it earlier but we clean these consoles we also clean computers for free in and around orlando florida we do not charge a dime as long as you're okay with us filming these processes we can monetize these videos that's how i make my money here on youtube and i don't feel like offloading any of that cost to the owners who are already gracious enough to loan us their systems for a few days so if you have a dirty console especially check out the video description info there on where you can contact me so that i can clean it and not charge anything now it is time to disassemble and again full transparency i have not ever taken apart one of these i've taken apart many playstations before but not a ps2 so i am actually referencing a video as i go along and i will be showing you what i am doing throughout this you'll find most of the screws to get the uh cover of the unit off are under these rubber feet so we need to remove these first this is where having pry tools comes into play yep there's one exposed phillips screw there there are two more under these plastic caps all right so that looks like eight in total you can see here how long these screws are they thread all the way through the unit we'll get these last two out of here it always helps to have a magnetic screwdriver as well you'll notice this little warranty sticker here this has never been removed again the console's never been disassembled it's never been cleaned inside so just more proof of it right here right and now i think we can go ahead and pull this top cover off wow look at that we do have a small ribbon cable here to mind be very careful of that it runs along the side of the optical drive yeah and looks like this is for the power and reset switches as well as the cd tray opener this here should just pop right out there are no screws holding it in okay and uh yeah the upper shell of the playstation has been removed and now i'll remove these four brass phillips screws surrounding one half of the ps2 along with this little expansion bay cover which we'll be taking more advantage of later in the video now the memory card area should slide up it is attached by a wrapping cable so be careful we can also pull up the back half of this let's see the fans a bit loose i think we can also slide up yep the power button assembly so this will pull up and out as will the fan actually i'm not sure if the fan i know it's obviously connected down below i don't want to pull on this just yet aha another hidden brass phillips screw we'll get this out of here and with that now i think we can go ahead and pull apart the bottom half of the covering for the unit this is going to be a bit awkward here i think it should just slide uh maybe i need to cut the warranty seal a bit more yep it looks like that's what i need to do so we'll get our tool and we'll just cut down we're going to remove this sticker all together once we reassemble so i'm not too worried about it never cut toward you folks something like that all right and i think now i think now we can get it apart let's see oh yeah that's more like it there's oh yeah it's gross in here wow this is this is disgusting yeah that's what a 10 plus year old playstation actually even older than that looks like and this actually isn't all that bad i've seen um i've seen much worse than this you can tell we've got quite a bit of dust there in that front corner and just a very cool looking pattern of dust at the base of the shell over to this side still more dust this is supposed to be black and instead it looks quite gray which we can very easily clean up with some soap and water there are four phillips screws around the cover of the optical drive we're going to remove these they are quite small this might have to switch phillips heads i'll just pull this off here should be able to see the laser assembly whoops underneath hey tetris i totally forgot we still had a game in here i actually have still been playing this uh rather recently this was at my parents house for a very long time so every once in a while i like to just um yeah play with the throwbacks so we'll pull this out and yeah we um we should definitely clean the laser we can attach the ribbon cable here from the memory card area i think we just pull back on this tab or lift up it's one of the other ah it does lift up okay so we'll lift up and then that'll just slide out and we can clean this ourselves we don't need to disassemble this any further same goes for this power supply connector this leads obviously to the uh well the connection at the back of the unit so we're just going to pull back on that tab and lift this up and that'll slide out now the optical assembly itself should just slide right out but we have multiple ribbon cables on the underside of this and we need a tackle we'll want to carefully remove this power supply board from underneath it is held in by four it looks like brass phillips screws i think this is just held in by a few prongs one side of the board let's see so i'm gonna pull straight up here yep that's it so the prongs are at the front and that's essentially how it connects to the uh the remainder of the console and now i believe we can just lift up here on the expansion bay area nice we can go and remove this pesky little fan here at the rear now you can see the connections exposed underneath remove this little piece of tape i want to be very very careful here this being a very old console this plastic could snap super easily and nicely done we can now lift up the metal housing underneath oh yeah look at that beauty actually pretty clean under here i guess because most of it was covered by that metal shroud and now it should be much easier to address these ribbon cables most of them run straight into the optical drive underneath i'm just going to pull gently on these blue tabs all around i'm going to pull straight out nice and i believe there's one more somewhere yep there's one more on the underside of the optical drive actually that one we can disconnect from above here so that's going to be this one this has a pull tab we'll pull up and then we'll pull from the white tab out and now we've fully separated the main board from the optical drive now the only remaining component to disassemble here i believe is this little metal shroud on the other side of the main board and this actually houses the heatsink it's yeah it's not very big or anything in fact i think this changed from model to model so this might look a little different if you're taking your fat ps2 apart i'm going to try here again i'm not super familiar i'm not sure what else is holding this on if we have thermal pads or what have you that are just a bit sticky i think it should just pry right up because there aren't yet because there aren't other physical connections and wow would you look at that that is so so beautiful and oh yes my favorite plenty of lovely fuzz going around this large thermal pad so kind of surprising they didn't use thermal paste here just a pad we're going to stick with the oem stuff that i want to change it up and uh risk damaging anything this is super super gross we're going to lift up because we do want to clean this we'll probably just clean it with isopropyl alcohol i don't want to pull too hard there i started to notice that it was tearing a tad so we're going to just wiggle our pry tool underneath and slowly work our way around and with that i think we can just lift away oh yeah wow now there is one other primary component here this being the optical drive that we could disassemble further however there are so many small intricacies involved with this you actually have to power the ps2 back on in order to open the cd tray to get further in here i just don't want to bother we can access most things from the exposed housings on either side and we'll just blast it with a ton of air take some ipa and very lightly clean the laser make sure that this is in tip-top shape for when we reassemble all right now we're going to start piece by piece here i'm outside because we're going to blast this stuff with water all the plastic components we'll remove this apple sticker finally after several years and we'll get the water hose and with it all back inside now we can dry things off with a towel we'll also use our electric duster to get water out of smaller spaces especially in this heatsink here by the way i timed this perfectly because now it is absolutely storming outside i've had to have done all this by hand indoors which wouldn't have been fun this plastic on top really cleaned up nicely with just water if you notice any harder stuck on grime or stains you could try adding soap to the water and scrubbing with maybe a toothbrush or something but i think this is good enough here i'm actually really surprised at how well it's cleaned up and now we'll just do a bit of manual scrubbing to get my fingerprints off of here a few water stains it looks like or i'm not sure what these are we're going to try to use ipa to get it all up also try to remove any residue old tape left behind things that just don't look pretty granted you won't see this when the console is fully reassembled but this just adds to the deep cleaning factor of it all same goes for this one we've got a bit of sticker residue here on the side so ipa should take this right up and there we are no sign of sticker in sight more or less there might be a bit of a bit of oil and stuff left behind i'm going to continue cleaning this off camera i also slightly scratched you can see where i took my knife and went through into the plastic so there's a bit of a line there not the end of the world but it does sort of kind of annoy me now moving on to the main board and remember this side here looks pretty good there was a large metal cover here so there wasn't enough space for dust to collect very much but on the other side you can see that the pcb is a bit discolored it's a lighter shade of green and a bit muted and that's just because there's a pretty fine layer of dust here so i'll just go over it with my finger you can see right there how much darker it is because i just removed a lot of that dust so we're going to take some ipa to this and scrub it clean we'll do our best to clean these rio front i o ports we've got a few usbs and a couple other connectors here i think this is for display out we do have an hdmi adapter to run this playstation 2 to a modern tv so that'll be nice now we'll blast this thing with air to round it up i think i will also replace the clock battery here similar like a cmos battery and a pc uh it'll be good just to change this out piece it's never been changed again and then the main board should be finished more or less we'll move on to the power supply board and then we'll clean the fan at the optical drive a few more peripherals this thing will be ready to be put back together all right and would you look at that something about clean bare main boards it just looks so dang good the underside here looking the same really like the way this turned out so uh pretty much as close to new as we can get it you know within reason we're gonna set this to the side again move on to some other things now for the power supply you'll want to be extremely careful if you don't know what you're doing please do not attempt this uh first off you shouldn't even be touching the board itself there are things on here that can kill you even when partially charged you see this large cap right here this is a 220 220 volt it's a 270 microfarad capacitor that will kill you so be very careful here i'm not going to manually scrub with isopropyl alcohol and q-tips i'll just be using my electric duster we'll be getting loose dust in and around these smds i'll go ahead and start cleaning this fan you can see all that dust is right there in the center that is super gross we'll get this up and out of the way by the way there are some fan upgrades out there for a classic ps2 so i'm interested you can check those out i didn't want to bother some of them have issues with voltage so like 5 volt versus 12 volt so some of the fans don't spin at all really and that can cause overheating issues down the line i just wanted to stick with oem the fan still works in this case it is a bit loud but it'll do these little blades are so small they're a bit frustrating to try to clean around you can see there's a lot of dust in the undersides of these fan blades it's pretty typical we see this all the time in computers however this is where i want to stress the use of ipa and q-tips you could use cans of air of course or like we have an electric duster to get rid of most of this but you'll find that some of it does end up getting left behind especially the hard stuck on grime that hasn't been cleaned in several years that's where the deep cleaning aspect of this comes into play so use q-tips or some sort of like makeup brush or something with ipa to dislodge this dust it'll really help and here we are the fan is looking so much better not a single speck of dust and sight that i can see uh the only thing we could do that we haven't yet is remove this little sticker tab here at the back of the fan and add a few drops of machine oil just to lube up the bearings a bit that'll breathe totally new life into this old fan we're gonna use some ipa and very carefully scoop up the dust are these more like dust bunnies wrapping around this thermal pad it's a very large thermal pad we don't want to mess it up and have to switch to something else so we're going to be very careful here the ipa shouldn't hurt the thermal pad a lot of people ask me how they can clean theirs especially in their graphics cards and such but you can just very carefully glide over it with ipa if you start being more aggressive maybe start scrubbing pretty hard you might tear into the surface of the pad and then at that point you might as well just replace it out right so just be careful going around you should be fine flip this over there's quite a bit of dust here on the back side wow just gonna try to scoop all this over to one side rotating the q-tip as i do it yeah there's a ton of dust on here golly for this plastic cover ipa shop towel should do it it's already fairly clean so we'll just give it a quick scrub just get rid of surface dust no this blue lines completely come off oh well not a big deal yep looks pretty good to me that was lisa by the way she for some reason wanted to help i guess we're scrubbing just a few more things here this is the power switch at the rear also the uh power cable uh port and i think the last thing we need to do then after this is clean the optical drive we're probably just going to clean the laser and give it a light dusting again i don't want to disassemble that any further so this is the most sensitive part of the playstation and we want to make sure not to damage not only the rails that slide the laser back and forth but also the laser itself because of course we need that to read the discs so we'll clean that at the end because it's probably going to get a bit dusty once we blast it with air again very lightly going to scrub around in the mechanism we'll also flip it over and try to get some of the loose dust out from the underneath and then we will just take a cotton swab and lightly clean the lens itself we won't use any alcohol at all i don't recommend that for these kinds of lasers alrighty and again we'll just take a q-tip very very lightly here gonna scrub the top of the laser oh yeah there was quite a bit on there all right and i believe that there we'll do it just trying to get up a few more stains i see around the exterior but uh this is looking so much cleaner than before so the last piece of the puzzle then is finished now i'm going to take about 30 minutes or so i'm going to deep clean this off because there is a lot of loose dust in here and then we'll come back and begin the reassembly process 2 000 years later so the office is now fully deep clean didn't take um i didn't take too long we have all of our playstation 2 components up top here they've all been thoroughly cleaned we just need to this is uh disassembled we just did that we need to uh reassemble and then we'll try to power on of course we'll mess with our uh extra goodies over here like the mcboot and um the ssd or the uh yeah the state ssd adapter and the like so we'll see if we can get a pretty sweet ps2 setup going i've also got like i said my wireless controllers here to make it feel a bit more modern just uses some aaa batteries that's a dead giveaway that it's not super modern anyway we also have one other visitor down here and that is pepsi girl she just likes chilling under the couch i don't know sometimes i'll sit down and she'll attack my legs so yeah cats now i'll be totally honest with you guys i have no clue how to reassemble this i kind of just yeah i was just removing whatever i could in somewhat of a logical order but uh reassembly that's going to be the real challenge so i got to figure out how this stuff fits so bear with me and that should do it here we go this is a fully reassembled ps2 that has been deep cleaned it really wasn't all that difficult i expect it to be a bit more challenging than it was i think just because an older console there weren't too many issues uh that arose but i will say that if again you're not very confident working around electronics especially power supplies just don't bother you might just be able to spray air into the unit from one side have it come out through the other i mean that should help it's not going to be a deep cleaning by any means but it's better than you know potentially nuking your hardware so just be mindful of that it turned out really nice it is significantly cleaner than it was when it first arrived here in the office and uh well especially that fan got a lot of dust out of the uh the thermal pad that was in there i mean all around looking a lot better i do wish i had another sticker for the playstation logo i don't unfortunately so just give me more of a blacked out kind of stealthy look but uh it it looks it looks super clean i'm really excited to power this on again and i'm going to test this way without any mods or anything attached to the unit just to yeah again make sure that uh as is it's back up and running so we'll connect the power supply cable here i'm super anxious okay yes it lights up there oh the classic fat ps2 sound oh look at that it works let's try the disc tray it works we'll put tetris plus back in just want to make sure that it reads disks still all right so this greeter works as well we didn't screw anything up that's always a win i've set up a blank ssd of 480 gig which is way more than we'll probably need through win hip so that this is ready to go for our playstation 2 and this will literally just slide into the console through the back and we'll screw it down and that's pretty much it uh this along with the mcboot memory card will allow us to access games without having cds in the optical drive and with a bit of help from some tutorials i'll have one link below if you're interested in doing something similar to this with a mcboot memory card we are able to boot into our ssd you can see i have installed tetris plus this is not the tetris plus cd the cd is not in the console anymore i took it out but we went ahead and installed the rom from my pc and we can play tetris plus without the actual cd anymore just pivot over to the right and we'll scroll up to hit play and it's that simple you can also by clicking the install button install disks for you know games that you already have physical disks of you can back up those copies to your sata ssd that you've connected through that bridge that i showed you earlier so if you want backups you don't want to deal with cds at all maybe your cd is like pretty close to kicking the can then you can obviously transfer that data to the storage drive so really cool this is just a small small little facet of everything you can do with the make boot memory card so check it out i'll have it linked below if you're interested you have a ps2 and you want to start reliving the good old days so that's it for this one we were able to get the playstation 2 not only disassembled uh and deep clean but we also modded modified it a bit and modernized it threw in an ssd that makes uh loading games through the magic boot uh memory card much faster and of course we can save games onto our ssd now that we've got baked into here it's pretty cool um there's a really loud bird that just flew right by the window but you know a few things i still would have liked to have changed maybe the fan i wanted to keep it simple for now but the fan is quite loud but we shouldn't have any thermal issues that i can think of because again we deep cleaned it so it's very clean inside it looks almost brand new and i expect we still have plenty of life to take advantage of here in this ps2 i'm gonna ask that if i can keep it because i really want to play some some old playstation and playstation 2 games this should be super fun we've got wireless controllers now so uh that might be what i'm doing for the next week or two the wife's going to kill me because it's something else that's going to draw my attention away from everything else but it's a balance all of

    "description": "I have been seeing a lot of ads on YouTube for the website Wish.com lately and it made me wonder: Is it still a scam?  I bought a $48 GTX 1050 ti, and there is something a bit dodgy about it.  Here is the video where Phil fixes a similar fake GPU:   Are you looking for some new clothes?

    "transcript": "I recently saw an ad for the e-tailer wish on YouTube you know that ad where it's just a bunch of Millennials massively overreacting to things are you like even for real are you seeing this are you seeing this is it just me or is there like a condescending tone to that ad well it's basically like you can just buy millennials cheap electronics off the internet and they're not going to be able to tell the ditch but I mean the ad obviously works because well I bought something off the website now when I saw this ad I wanted to myself do they actually sell PC components on this website and how much cheaper would it actually be so I went on and surged PC components and they actually sell quite a big variety of gtx 1050 TI's on them so I very excitedly ordered the cheapest one I could find and then tentatively put my credit card details into the website honestly it's quite a scary process putting your details into that website it feels a bit like sending your credit card information to a Nigerian prince that you met on a forum and after three weeks it's finally here I'm very excited we're gonna unbox it we're gonna put it in a PC and we're gonna see how it performs and well whether or not it's actually a 1050 Ti and maybe this is the best bargain ever so here's the suspiciously small package it actually didn't take nearly as long as I think it would take for it to come it actually shipped almost immediately now it ships from China but it only took about two three weeks I can't remember what I said in the intro I don't know how to get in here and do I do I just savage this is probably the worst unboxing I've ever seen in my life okay so here it is it's got the witcher on the front so that's that's exciting that means it probably should be able to run the witcher and it says it's a g4 series graphic scott it doesn't actually specify what it is this kind of box reminds me of like the GeForce 4000 days back in like the early noughties but let's open it up it's not been sealed in the factory which again is also fairly worrying there's a driver CD which also doesn't state what what graphics card it is so there's still no indication of what this GPU is anywhere and there's nothing else in the box it's actually it's actually suspiciously loosely packed like if you look at it like that like this no like it's it's there's no poop there's no padding oh you know let's have a look at the very badly packaged graphics card and again just note that this isn't an anti-static bag it's a very oily like bubble wrap bag it's actually quite gross feeling drop so this is what a $60 1050 TI looks like and it doesn't look amazing now this heatsink is pretty rubbish it has no heat pipes and it's very much got that effect of a block of aluminium that they just cut lines and so that there's more surface area it's so weird that the memory modules are on the back like this honestly this PCB is so bare I haven't seen a GPU PCB that bare in a very long time but what's very reassuring is it does say 1050 Ti on a sticker on it so it has to be a 1050 Ti right but it's a bit suspicious because the 8 pin has been removed now that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not a 1050 Ti because there are 1050 ti variants that don't have the EPS power plug the the GPU actually is low-power enough for it to get all of its power from the PCI Express port but that's still a bit weird and then when we go to the i/o of the graphics card this is very suspicious because it's got an HDMI port which is fairly normal and then it's got a VGA port which for a Pascal graphics card doesn't really make sense and it's also got a DVI port so it's not the most up-to-date I wonder it isn't like I don't know what kind of HDMI that is like if it's 1.4 or it's definitely not 2 but yeah so let's take this beaut and we're gonna plug it into a PC and we're gonna see whether or not a it's actually a 1050 TI and B how well it performs because this may be the best value for money ever now instead of just making fun of this graphics card because it almost definitely has whatever the PC equivalent of venereal disease is I'm actually going to look at what a very reasonable use case is for it now I'm going to use my PC that I bought with my first ever YouTube paycheck I did a video about that you can check it out link somewhere it's a really cool video I would recommend checking it out but it didn't have a graphics card in it so it was just an AMD 2400 G APU and then if you get a couple more dollars like let's say $60 you could upgrade it with this whish gtx 1050 TI that's if it's actually a worthwhile purchase please okay so that was my fault there was a power cable in the fan o video display settings are not available because an Nvidia graphics card was not detected in your system oh we've got signal there we go so it must have been some issue where it was competing with the APU but so let's look oh oh blue screen of death according to MSI Afterburner there's not a graphics card in here okay said it's going to nvidia and video graphics card was not detected in your system so on this one it gives the same the same warning according to GeForce experience we do actually have a 1050 Ti in here yeah so I'm gonna install the drivers or update the drivers this is the second attempt to install the driver and it actually the pc blue screen of death while trying to install the driver and i don't know if you can tell on camera but it's actually like flickering like the monitor is like flickering here so i think what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take it out and i'm gonna see what this GPU is because it's obviously not a 1050 TI because the drivers can't interact with it like it is the graphics card that it says that it is so let's take off the heatsink and see what GPU we're dealing with now I did see another video where a guy bought I think it was a GTX 960 off of wish and he had the same thing where like the ins in the software the graphics card was actually kind of convinced it was the gtx 960 but when he removed the heatsink it was a different GPU i can't remember what it was now mine is also convinced that it's a 1050 TI but the graphics card drivers can't interact with it properly I'm not unscrewing this heatsink as as well as I should be but again it doesn't matter like this thing doesn't really work anyway [Music] that was very much an example of how not to remove a sink now as you can see under the thermal paste this GPU is a GF one one six two hundred kaa one now if you google that it shows that this is actually a GTS 450 revision two that means that this GPU is five generations older than they state that it is when selling it to you which is atrocious now one thing that I just want to quickly point out is that this GPU is worth significantly less than $60 so whoever the reseller is that selling these GPUs on which made a killing of this graphics card they probably couldn't sell them for very long because you can leave reviews on products there so I'm sure people pointed out that this is actually a fake and it's not a massively good deal on a 1050 Ti and when I find really funny about it though is that the production quality is horrendous if you look at these like little spacers that have just been fused to the PCB and it's not actually the spacers that they use to separate the block from the GPU because that's actually here you can see they're still on here so they just kind of like have a bunch of spare spacers stuck around so is wish still a scam yeah well I mean of course it is as it always is with the internet if something seems like it's too good to be true it almost always is although there is a video on a channel called Phil's computer lab where he shows you how to flash the BIOS on this card and turn it into a functioning GTS 450 and it's actually a really interesting video I'd recommend that you go check it out I would do it myself but I don't have the hardware available to do that if there's enough interest on this video and people want me to try it out for myself I will buy the stuff on eBay so that I can actually make this thing work but as it stands it's 60 dollars down the toilet if you liked the video do share it with your friends subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one like and all of those things follow me on Instagram and Twitter where I have other updates around the channel and yeah until the next video bye-bye [Music]",

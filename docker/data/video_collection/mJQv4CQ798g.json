    "transcript": "(screen whirring) - (exhales) Hey, guys. This is the story of the world's fastest elevator. Recently I took a trip to Taipei and it is hard not to notice the giant Taipei 101 tower. The idea was to strap tiny incendiary bombs to bats and then release them over cities. Has the elevator actually flown out of the top of the building, is that possible? (glass shattering) A traditional solar panel will use what is known as a photovoltaic cell to turn the energy from the sun into actual electricity, which then can be fed into the grid and used to watch YouTube videos. Have you ever wondered why the hold music you listen to always seems to familiar? As you can imagine what happens when a bird flies through that, it's not exactly pretty. The older Boeing 747 uses four engines, whereas the newer 777 uses only two. By 1966, he had it patented and by then, the era of hold music was on us. (upbeat music)",

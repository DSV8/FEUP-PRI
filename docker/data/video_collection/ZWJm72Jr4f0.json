    "description": "Can the LG G6 Survive a Waterfall? a Pressure Washer? Enjoy! The $1,500 Smart Room :o  LG challenged me to test how durable their new LG G6 is vs water. Took it through a series of tests and it held its own pretty well.   Add me on Snapchat!  My Gear:  Instagram:  Twitter:   Do not try this at home as this is my creative expression of extreme water tests as this phone has only been tested and verified for IP68 only. The LG G6 is water-resistant up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes; completely wipe and dry after any exposure to liquid.  Do not attempt to charge your phone while wet or when moisture is present.  Exposure to liquid or moisture or to shocks, drops, or other physical abuse may cause damage and void the limited warranty.  Product Disclosure  \"I am using in this filming is a pre-production preview unit.  IP/Testing Disclosure  Every water test you see in this video is UNOFFICIAL and the results DO NOT imply that Brand is claiming for any of the results to be accurate of its smartphone device. Furthermore, these unofficial tests make no claim to have been conducted in an official test setting, as I do not have the qualifications to provide official results. The tests I have done in the video are my creative expression on how I believe these tests could potentially be conducted in everyday life. Even though my personal tests has shown LG to be water resistant, if your phone does get damaged by this, it may not be protected by the warranty so it's always good to double check.",

    "transcript": "- Yo guys, Jonathan here, and today is gonna be a fun day. LG reached out and wanted to sponsor an extreme water test, and I was like wait, you want me to try and destroy your phone with water? They said yes, so I was like, I am in, and now we're about to put the LG G6 through its paces. So what we're gonna do is incrementally climb the ladder of extreme, so to speak. We're gonna start out somewhat small, with a simple one hour in water test. Once it hopefully passes that, we can then move on, but as a disclaimer, do not do what I do. Just because this phone can withstand the water doesn't mean you should replicate the dumb things I'm about to do. Drop a like if you appreciate that though, because the last thing I wanna do is see you void your warranty. And with that out of the way, let's drop this guy in water. (upbeat electronic music) So the hour's passed and actually taking a look at the phone, we got a little more than that. We're currently sitting at about an hour and 13 minutes. Everything looks good so far, but I'm gonna pull it out just to make sure. Shake it off a little bit. So I'm gonna hop out of the timer and everything looks good so far. I do wanna make sure that the speakers are still intact, so let's go and actually test out the screen with some audio playing. (dramatic music) So it definitely passed that test, which really wasn't too much of a shocker. But what it does mean is that we're ready for round two. Part of the next test, we are taking the G6 hiking. It might get a little wet. - [Camera Man] No man, we'll be fine. - [Jonathan] This is just the beginning, buddy? - [Camera Man] Is this it? Is it gonna be worse than this? - Yes, your feet are gonna get wet. So we're about 15 minutes in right now, and man, hiking is pretty good cardio, but we're racing the light right now, hoping to find the waterfall before it gets dark. So, we shall see. (upbeat techno music) All right, so, we made it, and I was kinda hoping that maybe we wouldn't make it in time, with the sun dropping out, but now this means I gotta do it. (upbeat techno music) God, it's cold! Oh, that is cold. Oh, it's cold. Well, that was cold, but, obviously the phone passed that test. We're on to the final round. So next up, yes, I am standing on top of a washing machine. That is because we're about to toss the G6 inside. I will, of course, make sure we use cold water, so we don't shrink that sweet display. But now, let's go ahead and soak this baby up. (dramatic music) (clanking loudly) So, the cycle is completed. Honestly, we may have gone a little too extreme with this, in the sense that there is nothing but the phone. No pillows, no blankets, no padding to protect it. But now, it is the moment of truth, and we've gotta see if it survived. I'm kind of a little bit scared. I heard it rattling and smashing around inside. So, pop the door open, grab the phone. Holy crap, the phone is still alive! The screen is on! No dings, no damage, no cracks. The screen is working perfectly. I know it's probably a little hard to see in this blinding, blazing sunlight. So as impressive as the water test, I may be more surprised due to the fact that it actually survived being tossed around like a rag doll inside. But that means we are ready to move on to the next round. So next up, it's time to whip out the heavy artillery. It, by no means, is this an official IP69K test, nor am I an official tester, so please, do not do what I do. I'm about to blast this G6 full of water. Look at that. Notifications work, the camera's still recording. I think we should probably bump up the test a little. (dramatic music) (menacing laughter) (upbeat music) So, at the end of the day, whether it was an hour underwater, a hike through a waterfall, being tossed in a load of laundry, or blasted with pressure and water, the LG G6 held its own and then some. Huge thanks to LG for sending this my way early. Again, this is a pre-production model, so things may change in the final version. Again, don't do what I did. But hopefully you enjoyed it and had some fun. If you did, make sure you guys drop a like down below. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later.",

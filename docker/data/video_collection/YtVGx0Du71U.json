    "transcript": "- [Austin] So today, we're building the ultimate Halo Infinite gaming PC. So we've done at this point, a number of PC builds to help support Game Pass for PC. But this one might be the most ambitious in scale yet, because we're trying to build the ultimate Halo Infinite PC, for the ultimate Halo fan, George Kittle. I like this case because it does, feel kind of Master Chiefy, especially I think, about these three windows here. If we can tint that orange and turn the PC, I would think somewhat green, because some of this stuff, even though it is sort of like sort of automotive-inspired, looks a little bit like armor. Thankfully, unlike some of our other builds that we've done, for the fine Game Pass for PC team, which, of course, has PC games, we're actually going to be packing this up and driving it up to George Kittle himself, personally. So we don't need to worry about shipping it, we don't need to worry about customs or freight or anything like that. Which to me, always makes me feel a lot better, because one of the most stressful parts of these high-end gaming PC builds, is trying to ship it and hoping that it shows up in one piece. So let's- - Road trip. - Yeah. - Road trip! - Road tripping. (background chuckles) My friends, the day is here. The limited edition Halo 6900 XT has arrived. I wish that this was ours, but we have to give this to George. George Kittle is an interesting guy, because not only is he an incredibly, incredibly popular athlete, on top of that he is a massive Halo fan. I've heard that he's got a Halo tattoo. He seems like, look, if I'm gonna be honest, a little bit of a Halo nerd, but that's a good thing, because if we're gonna be spending all this time and effort to try to build the ultimate Halo Infinite PC, I hope it goes to the ultimate Halo fan! All right, the reveal is... Underneath this box! (both chuckle) Oh, my God! - Oh, wow! - Look at that! - That's something else. - Yo! Yo! Oh my God, dude. - Dude. - That's so good. Oh, my God and the back! - Oh, and it says Halo over there. - 1 17. - 1 1 7. - Halo Infinite, so like, well, we'll just thoroughly test Halo Infinite, before we give it to him. Not because we wanna play on the graphic card, because we wanna make sure- - We wanna make sure he has a good experience. - George will, your PC will be to shortly after we play it. For this build we've each got a task. So Jared is really gonna focus on the customization side of things. Think 3D printing, think the CNC work, the laser. Ken is really on the aesthetic, making sure that this thing looks absolutely mint. And for me, I'm tryna make sure that the components side, the actual performance, is really there. Which means that we're tryna go for the most high-end stuff we can get. The brand new Core i9-12900K is about the best gaming CPU we can get. Of course, we've got that incredible limited edition Halo 6900 XT, which is gonna give tons of performance. But on top of that, we wanna load this thing up. Tons of memory, great SSD, a high-end power supply. As far as I'm concerned, there is no room for compromise, on this build. Is George Kittle gonna say, \"Hey, I'm not gonna show up for this week's game, 'cause I'm not feeling it?\" No, he's gonna give 100% all the time. So we've gotta give 100%, just like Master Chief does, every time he gets into some wacky shenanigans, and has to fight some aliens or something. The dude gets into a lot of trouble, actually, to be fair. So it is Thursday, which means that we have today and tomorrow, before we have to ship the PC out. - So what's cool is that we also have this camo plasti dip. So, basically how plasti dip works, is that you do a couple of coats and it makes a really cool, not permanent, but, as I like to say, it makes pretty much a paint coat that's as permanent as you want it to be. This is great for, if you are terrible at masking, like Austin is. So we can paint over here, and Exacto around where the paint goes and then just peel it off. - And luckily for us, this case, is kinda like a transformer. I know it looks like it's kinda broken here, but really, pretty much all the parts on here just kinda pop off - Yeah. - or screw off, and we can paint them separately, which is gonna make our lives infinitely easier. If you've ever tried to paint - Hey! - a case before... - Ah like, - Ah, it isn't really. Halo Infinitely easier. (Jared chuckles) - What's next, you're gonna mention how Game Pass has PC games or something. (group chuckles) - [Jared] That's what you get paid to do. - All right, so now it's time to plasti dip the top of the Halo PC. This is where our front panel stuff is. We also have what is basically our visor. So we have a lot of plasti dipping to do. One full minute of mixing, let's go. (can rattling) (mellow music) So, let's just do it. It's nothing for it. (can whooshing) See unlike Austin, I'm not tryna do this in 10 minutes. So, we're gonna do this right. I'm gonna be a little generous, with this first pass. (horn beeps) Just to re- (can whooshes) That might've been a little too much on that side. It's okay. It's okay. We're fine. Here it is! - Oh, that actually, wait, wait, wait, let me see. - Yeah, not bad, right? - Yo! - If it were me, - It's actually pretty good. - I would want it a little lighter. But, I think for what we were able to get, - Yeah. - and here's the visor, look at that. - Yo! I'm not gonna touch it, 'cause I don't wanna ruin it. - [Jared] That color with that yellow tint on it? - It's gonna be- - Yeah! - It's very Master Chiefy. - Yeah. - Look, I had some doubts on the plasti dip, I had some doubts, 'cause usually I see plasti dip it's like, plasti dipping wheels and it looks terrible. - Well, youtube.com/austinevans and paint don't exactly go well but, when Ken's doing it, this is what happens. - 100% accurate. - Yes. - 100% accurate. All right, good job, good job. But you also wanna do some lasering, too. - Yeah so, that yellow tint I showed you earlier, we're gonna be putting it on these three front panels for sure, and maybe something on the side panels, but we'll have to figure that part out. And I actually already have something set up on the laser, ready to go, to do some new tests. - Have you tested this yet? - We have not tested it yet. - Will it catch on fire? - We'll find out. So going into this, I had no idea if the laser was actually gonna be able to cut any tint. One, tint is see-through, which means the laser might just pass completely through it. And two, it likes to curl up a ton, and lasers really enjoy having a nice, large flat space to use. So, we really had no idea going into it, if any of this was actually gonna work out. - [Austin] Do you wanna turn on the air purifier? - I did, do you want it on, maximum power? (machine whirring) - That is very loud. I feel pure. - We're gonna have the cleanest air in all of California. - All right, I'll watch it through the laser safety plastic glass. (Jared chuckles) - Oh wait, actually this was not gonna. (switch clicks) (machine whines down) - Yeah? What happened, Jared? (Jared chuckles) - I didn't set the work origin. So it was gonna laser in the entire wrong place. - We had to spend extra on the emergency stop button. - Yes, the snap maker, what the hell? Why don't you just include that? All right, you ready? - Yep, let's do it. - Let's see if it goes. (mellow music) - Nothing's on fire. That's a good sign. (knuckles knocking) That's, yeah, yeah. - That's not wood, there you go. - That's not, yeah. - So, as you can see on the back, it looks like it didn't laser the back, - Yeah. - and it's only the tint, which means this should look pretty damn good. - Oh, look at this. - Yes! - Oh! - Oh, yeah. Oh, I like that. - Ah, dude, it looks so good on the tint. - You get that RGB through it, on the glass, and that should look pretty sick. I'm pretty excited for this now. I'm happy we tried that. - Let's go. - So right now we are attempting the tint on the... (hairdryer whirring) - Oh, you know what, I have to... I don't have, (hairdryer whirring) - Come on. - slacks on the table. - So the tint is currently being applied. What we've since learned, throughout the processes of today, is that we ordered exactly enough tint and not a single shred more. Which means that basically, we have one shot at this, because there's not enough time for tint to come in before we leave on Monday. - Trying not to peel it off. - So, no pressure. Shouldn't you guys have put something soft down, so you're not scratching your plasti dip? - No. - Okay. - Yes. (chuckles) - Why would we do something smart like that? That's not Overclock way. - If we were smart, we wouldn't be working here. (group chuckles) (group chuckling) - If I was smart, I wouldn't pay you next week. (group chuckling) That does it, should look really nice. - All right. - Wow! Ken, good job! (background chuckles) - [Jared] That's about what he deserved. (group chuckles) - He definitely deserved that. - Yeah, just go home. (group chuckling) - Oh! - Yo! - Yo! - Yo! - Oh, my God, that looks good. - I can't wait to see that with the RGB going through it and everything. That's a big difference. It doesn't look so much, when you look right at it, and then you see the regular glass, and you notice like, - Yeah. - wow, okay. - Yeah. That contrast is nice. - Yeah. - Especially with the green, this actually looks Master Chiefy now. - Don't say, Master Chiefy. - [Ken] Master Chiefy. - Don't say, Master Chiefy, I don't like that. - [Jared] What's wrong with, Master Chiefy? - It sounds, sus. - [Jared] Austin, you of all people, do not have the right to call anything we say, sus. - Prepare yourself for aural bliss. (keys tapping) - [Ken] What? - [Matt] Aurel. (background chuckling) Aurel, with an A. (background chuckling) - So my friends, another day, and actually a lot more progress on the system. So not only is the case coming together, so Ken's got the first level of the plasti dipping done. Most things are vaguely in the places they need to be. So, let's hope that this works. Here we go, no pressure. 3, 2, 1. (drum roll) (button clicks) Oh, wow! - Ah, jeez. - That button has a lot more, - [Jared] You cannot do me like that, Austin! - I pressed the button! - I didn't realize how far - Oh, my God! (chuckles) - you have to click it down! Okay, okay, okay, so, look, there are a lot of things that can go wrong, when you're testing your PC. You can forget to plug in the power supply, or forget to flip the switch, or not press the button all the way down. Look, these, these, these, these things happen! It's fine! Some buttons require more force than others. The power supply is obviously is powering, the graphics card is spinning. We've got the NZXT cooler on, the RGB for the memory is on. - And then we just don't have the fans up here, plugged in ready. - Those are not plugged in. - Okay. - And yeah, there are literally no fans connected to the system besides the graphics card at the moment. - Oh! Oh! - Oh! Oh! Oh! Look at that! Beautiful! - Look at that. - CPU temperature, little warm, but that's fine. It's almost like installing fans is a good idea. Okay, that's actually... (Jared blowing) Ah... Actually let's, you wanna sit here for a second? We'll do a little bit of troubleshooting, and actually install some fans, but it works. - [Jared] That's all it needs to do right now. - So the PC, at this point, is pretty much good to go. We got our tint on the windows, we got the plasti dip all applied and dried, all the PC components are tested and working. The only thing that's left for it, is to transport it up to San Jose, to present it to George Kittle himself. - So we have to be very quiet, George is in the other room right now, but we're frantically trying to get the PC setup and ready. We have Tiny here as well, who has made an, can you actually show the keyboard? Look at this key cap she made. So Tiny's world's all about the artisan keyboard-side of things. So she custom hand-makes these incredibly intricate key caps. So I know that Tiny has spent a ton of time working on a couple of key caps, to give to George. And so, when we're all together, I think it's really going to be the ultimate Halo Infinite package, for what, could quite possibly be, the ultimate Halo fan. Come on, let's do it. - All right. - Okay. - I see a screen. (group chuckles) And, a place where maybe a keyboard would go, some I'm connecting the dots just a little bit. - So, before we do the full reveal, - [George] Yeah. - You're a bit of a Halo fan? - I, just mildly, yeah. - Mildly? - I read all the books so... (group chuckles) - I've heard that you got a Halo tattoo? - I, what side is that? It's the right side. - Yo! Whoa! - Wow. - [Austin] Dude, that is so sick. - [George] So my first Xbox was the release of Halo 3. - Oh! - I got, so I have every Halo Xbox ever released. - Oh, really? - Besides the original Xbox, I was too young, I played all the campaigns, probably, 20 to 30 times. - Oh, man. - Read all the books. Yeah, no, she knows I'm obsessed with it. My wife knows that I'm obsessed with it too. - Well, we might have something, - Yeah I was, I was, - You might have, you might like. - I'm pretty excited right now - All right. - Ah, we did- - Oh! The screen turned on. (group chuckles) That looks like Halo. Holy sh, Nike's. (Austin chuckles) (George gasps) - So... We built you a little something. (Austin chuckles) - Whoa! Oh, my goodness. I would've been cool with the mouse. (group chuckles) - So Tiny did an incredible job. She custom-made all of this. - That's awesome. - Including the key cap. - Yeah. - That is sick. That is The Chief. (group chuckling) This is just gross, in and all the best ways possible. - Yes! - So there's a ton of stuff in here. So, probably the big thing. - Yeah, talk to me about it, talk to me about it, stop it. - So the, probably the big thing- - Or shut up first, this is beautiful. (group chuckles) Now go, okay, I'm ready for it. - So, probably one of the big things is the custom Halo Infinite edition, 6900 XT graphics card. - I saw that, yeah. - There are 117 of them in the world and you've got one right here. - There's 117? - 117, you can't buy them. Only available, yeah, exactly. - Look at you guys. (group chuckles) Wow! - Did you see up front here, we did the laser engraving for Halo Infinite, the UNSC logo. - Whoa, oh wow, that is just so... With the... - The dog tag? - Dog tags- - Did you know that Master Chief is 6'10? - Yeah, I did know that. - Okay! (chuckles) - You look, I don't even know why I asked. - [George] 390, wow. Just an absolute stud, he'd be a pretty good dude to tackle. - Yeah! (group chuckles) - Wow, I can't wait to show this to all my friends and see how jealous they are. - Yeah. (group chuckles) - My buddy just got the Infinite in Xbox One. - Oh, yeah! - And so he was like, \"Oh, yes, yeah,\" 'cause he's not even a big Halo guy. And I was like, \"Yeah, screw you.\" - Dude, you- - But, now I can send him a photo of this and so... Ha ha! (group chuckles) - [Ken] So we're meeting George for the first time and he seems genuinely excited about this PC that we're presenting him. It's one thing to hear that he's a huge Halo fan, he even has a Master Chief tattoo on his arm. But he, really, really likes this PC. And I think it's taking us all by surprise. - So this is actually really special for me. I didn't get a go last time we gave a PC away to somebody, so being there in person, and seeing his reaction, especially, as a genuine Halo fan, it felt good. Especially seeing him run upstairs, grab an Xbox controller that was a custom Halo design on it. It just shows that he is really passionate about this, and that, this isn't just gonna go sit in a closet somewhere it's actually gonna be used and I'm really glad George Kittle's the one that's gonna be using it. - I'm that guy that will sit and edit things for three hours - Yeah! - before I ever play a game. That's I'm sorry. (group chuckling) - [Austin] That's all good, man, that's all good. - [George] Oh, my goodness. Let's get in a nice power stand son. (group chuckling) The gaming chair's upstairs. Get me in the warthog. - [Austin] Go, go, go, go, go! - [George] Damn, how do I get in? - [Austin] No, where are you? Come on! - All right, what are the button, X, is the button, I'm in. - There we go! Oh, what's the, oh! - Ah! (group gasps) All right, I got hit by a car by my own team. Let's ride. (group chuckles) - Oh! Wow! - Oh, that's what it does! (gun blasting) - [Austin] There you go. - [George] Ooh. - [Austin] There you go. - There it is! - Hey! - [George] I got my first one, let's ride. You know what, I'm not at the bottom of the leaderboard, so that's what really matters. (group chuckles) It's all perspective. - I didn't realize we both play the same way. (group chuckles) - Uh, I'd have to win. - Hey! - I warmed up there a little bit at the end, I'll take that. - [Austin] Yeah, yeah! - Wow, some fancy wow. Power stance. - There you go, there you. (chuckles) - That was a long power stance. - [Austin] You got stretched out now. - That's really fun. Do you know what I'm really happy about this is that, this is a different account, it didn't affect my KD. (group chuckles) - This is for your practice! - Thank you. (Austin chuckles) - This build is one of the most fun builds that I've been involved in in a while, because it was, in some ways, simple, right? I mean when you look at the final product, I think it looks pretty clean. Tiny's part of the system absolutely came out great. And the fact that the PC not only works, but almost more importantly, George is super-amped about it. To see that, sort of, genuine enthusiasm on George's face, when he's getting to play Halo Infinite for the first time, that is an incredibly rewarding thing to see. So of course this is all thanks to our very good friends over at Microsoft, for providing the wonderful impetus, for not only Halo Infinite, but also to be able to pull off a build like this. So don't forget, Game Pass has PC games, and also I'm very happy to say that this PC has found a very, very good home. - That it has. I'm gonna have a lot of fun with it. We're gonna put a lot of hours into it. And I think I'm only gonna play Halo on this one, 'cause I think that's all you're allowed to play on this one. - It doesn't actually install other games. - I like that. - It has Game Pass. There's a lot of games available, - For only halo. - they don't work. - Oh, it's only Halo games. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything else just gives you, - Error? - a 117 error and then, Halo. Yeah, see. - He's clever, error 117. - Yeah. (George chuckles) - Thanks Microsoft, thank you. I dig your Halo, you guys are awesome. - [Austin] With over 100 high quality PC games available, Game Pass for PC is an absolute no-brainer. Between titles such as Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite, Back 4 Blood and many more, there's no reason not to get your hands on it. Especially considering that Halo Infinite is just now dropping and you get access to not only the multiplayer, but also that incredible single-player campaign. On top of that, if you're interested in learning more, we've actually done a series of these builds to help support Game Pass for PC. Including one for Forza, Back 4 Blood, Jud even did one for Age of Empires. If you wanna check out any of those videos, definitely be sure to go check them out. And the links are in the description, if you're not already signed up for Game Pass for PC. (music fades out)",

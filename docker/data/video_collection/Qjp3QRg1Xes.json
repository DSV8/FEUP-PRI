    "transcript": "In this video I'm going to show you how to use a Flipper Zero to crash an iPhone running iOS 17.0.3 this phone won't crash and I'll show you what I did to stop the phone crashing. This Flipper is running the extreme firmware I'll go to apps go to Bluetooth and then I'll go to Apple BLE Spam now previously you could spam devices but on a recent update it's not possible to crash the phone so what I'm going to do now is press start and what you'll notice both these phones are receiving spam messages but suddenly after a while the iOS 17.0.3 phone will lock up the reason why this phone is not affected is because I've disabled Bluetooth on the phone but this phone is receiving messages after a while notice I can't do anything on the phone it's totally locked up this one still works this phone is totally unresponsive now I'll have to do a hard reset on the phone to get it back this bug has already been submitted to Apple I believe and hopefully they'll fix it but notice an issue on iOS 17.",

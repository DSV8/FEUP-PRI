    "transcript": "this year I've been to two trade shows computex and LTX which I guess counts as one and at both of those events they had these huge fancy racing Sim setups which got everybody very excited I got excited as well but not quite excited enough to Brave the obscene cues to try one but enough for me to go out and buy my own one in the only way I know how which is the cheapest crappiest one I could find on Amazon and here it is the box is actually not as heavy as it looks but first today's video is sponsored by two massive new be quiet coolers the dark Rock Pro 5 and dark Rock Elite the L of which provides 15% more internet porage that's not true I don't know why I said that both coolers are rated for over 250 watts of TDP come with easy installation and you can even slip the middle fan in which I really like and with the elite you get just a splash of tasteful RGB check out the b choire dark Rock Pro 5 and Elite using the link in the video [Music] description I feel like even by Amazon standards This is highly unreasonable box usage get all that space Oh Oh less oh oh yeah that's that's some very well hidden damage I was I was never going to find that oh no wait no it's yeah there we go the damage is gone we're good wa and look at the steering wheel box what happened the outer box was perfectly fine why is this so damaged and why didn't they stick a bit of paper over this one now this entire racing simig which isn't just the 3 in-one vibrator steering wheel I also got a frame for it and I feel like the word frame is maybe doing some heavy lifting here but I needed to get it because otherwise it's just a steering wheel right we needed a proper racing some setup but all of this madness cost a total and this is including tax and shipping and stuff of 2 17 Canadian drai but I think the Stellar reviews are what really sold me on the product I think the fact that the latest console compatibility it has listed is the PS3 is a very good sign so let's start off with the steering wheel I guess we just kind of Pop That Out ooh so many deals it's very well packaged we've got the steering wheel in there with some plastic under that we have the pedal box which okay the pedals are springloaded they really don't care if this gets to you in one piece or not yeah that looks great you've got some steering wheel action which offers a little bit of resistance you can use it with a console cuz you've got like the game pad on the front although like the box says only up till the PS3 and then on the side you've got a sequential gear lever that's very exciting you actually even get buttons on the back of the steering wheel for you to to do things with now on the base you can oh it uses suction cups to to connect to the table wait let's see do you do you just kind of push it down like that and then no that didn't yeah we're going to we're going to have to figure out how to deal with that oh and the steering wheel also pushes in a lot I I wonder if it's supposed to do that anyway let's check out the pedal box uh this is also very well wrapped in just some total death that is the most plasticky thing I have ever touched in my life uh it's also not got any way for you to like secure it down you've just got these kind of high friction rubber feet yeah that that doesn't really stay in the same place very well uh but at least oh yes that's that's going to that's going to be very good but it passed quality control so that's good right next we're checking out the very professionally covered up stand I am curious to see how compatible it's going to be with the suckers on the on the bottom of the steering wheel but we'll we'll figure out a way to get them to work [Music] together o we get this kind of like grippy felt bottom bit so that it doesn't slide on stuff that's cool this is the steering wheel mounting plate with some mounting holes in them which I'm sure will work great with the Sockers and then we've got some mounting stuff over here finally the frame assembly oh this actually doesn't look like it's going to require a whole lot of assembly but it also doesn't look like it oh I guess this way around right oh I guess you open that and then oh there we go and then the steering wheel plate mounts to this shockingly welded bit at the top oh that's just popped out this looks very very small after playing around with it a bit looking at the instructions got me worried but I'm not entirely sure what you're supposed to do with these it shows that you're meant to get them and then it just doesn't me it doesn't mention them again I feel like some of the instructions are missing either way I was rearing to assemble the world's greatest Sim racing ring oh it can't handle its own weight very [Music] good oh and then finally I added my Majestic stool which I think rounds off the crappiness nicely speaking of crappy this is one of the crappier things I've looked at on the channel this stand has to be Arrow straight otherwise it can't hold up its own weight let alone with the steering wheel on it the steering wheel on the other hand actually stuck down better than I was expecting on this whole filled surface for now I I think I need to lower this a little which is good it'll help with the weight bearing issue I'd say that is something that makes sense but I still took some time to really dial in the Majesty but now I kind of want it higher up but it's it's immediately oh that's or already come on done okay as anticipated the holes in the top plate meant the suckers weren't making full contact so I had to position the steering wheel in a way to avoid those mounting holes this is the straightest I can get this thing to stick down so I guess it's going to be like driving an old Ferrari because you know the steering wheel is going to be in the wrong place yeah it's kind of immersive I guess and after adding the jankiest monitor I could find at the office I was ready to jump into some Forza Horizon 5 but Forza was much less Keen after fza spent about an hour patching which then corrupted and had to happen again it made me connect to a whole bunch of accounts even though I was launching it through Steam and after all that Forza had the audacity to not be compatible with the controller even after I installed the drivers for it off the hilariously tiny driver disc which I felt was a reasonable point for me to just rage quit and download dirt [Music] instead dirt rally also initially put up a bit of a fight so oh it's it's come on done again but after re-plugging in the controller dirt let me assign all the functions and we were ready for our first rally oh I'm driving oh oh did I I'm turning the okay that didn't go great oh I I C the steering's the wrong way around oh no nothing think a quick recalibration couldn't fix oh oh the steer it it does nothing and then suddenly it's like full lock it oh it's it okay I really need to play I I need to calibrate it real hard that is not going great and the it it's collapsing into my leg here it's really trying to murder me in my thigh it moves around so easily after just seconds of gameplay I already had to make major structural adjustments to the setup with that out the way I just had to Fathom out some Advanced controller calibration and I was ready to go for a third time we're doing it um the steering wheel's changing direction pretty pretty rapidly this is harder than I was anticipating it to be uh the main issue is the this keeps moving around so much oh yeah did you see that drift that was spectacular I am kimy reenan but even my men skill wasn't enough to overcome the stand issue ow it's digging into my thigh somehow this stand is managing to be worse than the steering wheel so I decided to weigh it down with the heaviest thing I could find a CA stand which shifted my attention to the other problems this feels really really bad H you can't make small adjustments you got to like pulse it like that otherwise it doesn't you just loost at this point this this may as well be what I'm doing because it almost feels less terrible I was like trying to like oh you can actually drive I think I'm going to tap out quite frankly the car isn't working anymore this keeps coming undone uh so I but I do have a solution for [Music] that [Music] this is starting to look real professional I've just gone to town duct taping the steering wheel to the stand but as we saw earlier the stand is kind of the bigger problem so I've laid down some guy wires from the desk to try and hold it in place M sturdy and just like that we're ready for our world record Pike's Peak attempt oh yes this is way better oh it's it's still it's still not great oh look at that beautiful cornering we've got very precise feedback coming through the steering wheel as you can see Tiny inputs get you where you need to go with this wheel this is just a premium experience oh oh no we're we're good we saved it I need to be more aggressive with the shift to really get the speed up our duct tape mod is holding up surprisingly well to what's happening here oh no no not the okay we saved oh no that that did a lot of damage stutters there's a lot of stuttering happening somehow I feel like that is the steering wheel's fault but that's going to be difficult to prove wow honestly all it needed was a bit of duct tape it is significantly better now um again the feedback doesn't really tell you anything about what's going on on the road like I was on tarmac and it was feedbacking like crazy and then when I'm like off on the gravel rolling down the mountain it doesn't vibrate at all for some reason we're going to finish I mean that was that was an amazing run and it kind of held up to it for my final run I decided I was ready for a modern monster of a car which went well this is way harder it feels like I am fighting a bull here because every input just does something it just things happen I think I was supposed to go way faster through that corner that's what the wing is for this is way harder than driving with a controller this is the kind of thing that's going to take a lot of practice to master hopefully the duct tape will last long enough for us to kind of get used to it you know sarcasm aside you're probably thinking if you just don't aggressively tug at the wheel like a bonobo on heat the car will go straight the thing is the reason the steering wheel's basically unusable is that there's a huge Dead Zone in the middle and then on either side of that even at low sensitivity a very small bit of movement takes you from 0% input to 100% And that combined with the steering wheel giving you no usable feedback on where inputs happening means that when you're trying to make small fast adjustments from side to side you have to fling the steering wheel over the huge Dead Zone and then guess when input's going to happen with a very small buffer zone so realistically this piece of crap gives you three options straight full left or full right oh recover no oh okay I'm sure that didn't do too much damage a lot of you are probably going to watch this and you're going to tell me that this is all just going wrong because I'm us useless and you know that's it's probably more my fault than the steering wheel's fault this is a new experience for me but that's why you buy the cheapest crap so that when things go terribly you can just blame it on your equipment you know what they say the best Sportsman blame their tools that's how that works yeah see you can't you can't correct like it this is this is honestly barely a usable steering wheel experience at the end of the day this setup May well be one of the biggest piles of crap I've interacted with on this channel which is really saying a lot having said that I have enjoyed my time gorilla flailing on it and it's gotten me very interested in trying a proper Sim racing setup which brings me to the end of another video thank you for watching if you enjoyed it subscribe to the channel and until the next video [Music] bye-bye to",

    "transcript": "- Matt, did you know you can play PS5 in a car now? - No you can't. - Yeah you can. The thumbnail begs to disagree. (both laughing) (tone crackling and beeping) - Hello and welcome to This Is Sony took a look at what Microsoft is doing and said, \"Hey. we want a piece of that.\" They looked at the Microsoft Surface and the Alcantara and said, \"We wanna put that in a car.\" (both laughing) We got a chance to look at the soon to be released in several years Afeela by Sony Honda Mobility. - This is a thing that has been talked about for a while. I believe it was CES 2020. They first announced that they were thinking about doing a car. CES 2023 just a couple of months ago, they showed off the Afeela, which is a collaboration, a 50 50 shot between Sony and Honda, which is a weird combination in a lot of ways. But we actually had time to spend with literally the one and only concept in the entire world. - [Matt] Yet. There's one of these things. For reference, this is a concept car. We are not able to drive it. I don't think it drives at all. However, it was loaded with a ton of cool tech including the ability to play PS5. It has screens, front, back, middle, side, front grill. There's a lot to talk about here because we actually had time to spend with some of the people from Afeela. Which for reference is the name of the brand. So the company is Sony Honda Mobility. But the brand is Afeela, right? - Sony Honda Mobility. That is the overall- - The company. - The company. - And then below that is Afeela the brand. Below that will be the names of the cars. So this would be- - Which we do not have yet. This could be the whatever the Credos, (car whooshing) the Afeela sack boy. (both laughing) Everyone's gonna be driving an Afeela sack boy in the year 2027. Mark my word. You could mark it on your calendar right now. I do feel better about Afeela being the brand name versus the car name. It's still not good. - A lot of reason for that is they're trying to push like mobility and autonomy. There's a lot to break down here. So first of all, why don't we actually just talk about the tech? Because I think that was the part that is the most- - Which is really the selling point of it is how much they've crammed into this. They really went all in on entertainment. This is a luxury vehicle. So let's be clear on that. - And I will say that like looking at it in stills did not do it justice. Like when I first saw it, I'll be honest, I'll be like, eh looks like a generic town, whatever. But when you actually see it in person you realize this thing is massive. So I don't know the exact specs off the top of my head but this looks as big as something like a Tesla model X and Mercedes EQS, a very large sort of luxury style sedan which is also going to almost certainly have a very large price tag to match. This is meant to be huge, luxurious, and I think considering that the proportions are really nice, but immediately when you look at it, you see the screens. So as a driver you have a display right in front of you which is very common. You also have to the far left and the far right screens instead of mirrors. So you have digital cameras, which to be fair is not a unique thing. So a number of vehicles, especially a lot of European vehicles are offering this as an option. Although unfortunately in the US that is actually not allowed. 'Cause you have to have physical mirrors. On top of that there's also one very large display between the driver and the passenger, which in software is split in half but realistically is actually one large panel it looked like. - Yeah, so it's basically like having like an ultra wide. So there's a invisible seam down the middle. - We were watching a bit of a trailer and you could take it and just slide it between the screens. - Very cool the way that that works. And then in the back are two fairly large inch screens in the back for the two passenger sides. - And what's cool is from the front you can literally just start playing a video or whatever and you can just go, oh, play it in the back left headrest, in the passenger or whatever. You can control it all and throw it around fairly well. Clearly this is a concept car. This software's nowhere near final. But considering that, it actually was in relatively good shape, like if you said that this was shipping next year, I'd be like, yeah, sure, checks out. - Yeah, unfortunately I was not able to play PlayStation in it because let's talk about the elephant in the room. They claim you could play PlayStation games in it, which is- - You can! - It's not, - Matt. - Incorrect. - I literally had a dual shock in my hand and I was playing PlayStation on it. It worked. - Asterisk, big asterisk, boom. (asterisk booms) Asterisk. - It's a big asterisks. - It's remote play all this tech in here right now. And they did not put in an actual PlayStation 5. - It has 5G. I don't know of any other cars that actually have 5G right now. Obviously what you're getting here is really a streaming experience, but the ability for you to play PlayStation on the go, even on like the back headrest or whatever is neat. And that was actually, I'll say a shout out to the Afeela crew, they were very open to like feedback, right? Like they literally were taking notes and asking us like what we thought and everything. 'Cause this is not going to go on sale until likely around 2026. So there's still a lot of development to do, not only with building the brand, which is going to take a while, figuring out how this thing is going to be sold where it's going to be manufactured, how they're going to actually brand it. The impression I got was that they're going to be selling it maybe like online and then they'll do some kind of like delivery kind of thing. But you'll actually be buying it from Afeela not from Sony, you're not going into a Honda dealership. It's really interesting to think about this thing as far as they've got a few years to really build this up and they've got a really good headstart. Like honestly the car was, for a concept, was way more flushed out than I thought. - So talk about the Alcantara from the beginning. The entire interior, it's Alcantara. So the same material that's on like a surface keyboard and it felt so nice. - Incredibly soft. - I mean like we talk about the size of it. I'm a big (censored) dude, okay. And I fit in there perfectly comfortably. - It's also kind of neat because when you first walk up to the car, it actually uses facial recognition. So you're, obviously there's an app. Essentially what you do is you walk up, there's a camera on the B pillar, it detects you and opens the door. There actually are no door handles on the concept. For the production version. - That immediately backfired when we're in there. So that like, when we talk about how they were receptive to taking notes, I'm like, \"Hey, is there like a way to do like a guest or like, for facial recognition?\" They were like, \"Well why would you need that?\" And I'm like, \"What happens if you have someone who's not regularly a part of your you know, circle who's gotta get in your car, they can't get in your car.\" \"Well just use the phone.\" I'm like, \"Whoa, it's a great idea on paper. But the actual execution of it, like a door handle will always be more convenient.\" - Fair enough. But once you get in the car you realize it's a nice place to be, right? So on top of all of the screens and software it also has support for 360 Reality audio I think is Sony's branding for it. But essentially- - Yeah, which was- - It's spatial audio. - It was okay. - So basically we got to listen to one very specially selected track in stereo, which sounded fine. And then in the full 360 mix. And at least me in the front seat, you could actually really tell each instrument felt like it was completely separated. Obviously with the Sony branding there were tons of themes around a bunch of Sony movies, which I thought was neat. So there's Spider-Man, there was- - The only one that matters. - I'm Morbin'. (laughs) - And on top of that, the Afeela has a screen not only on the grill but also on the tailgate. And both of those also can change. It was nice because you can use that to see like charging indication, seeing like the weather. They had that like we were showing like sports game scores. - So like they have one that's like actually notifications from your phone. We're like, \"Ah, I don't know if I want the entire public to see that I got a text message from someone.\" The ones that make a lot of sense is like while it's charging it's literally a status bar across the front of the grill. That makes perfect sense. It's also just like a little thing to like customize the car a little bit to be you. All right, how many white Teslas do you see driving around especially where we are? Now having just a little bit of strip there that could add a little bit of color, add a little bit of customization - Get Spider-Man hanging on your back. - [Matt] Sure. - Like, it's cool. - Part of me is worried that Sony would just do that, just like while you're at a red light, they would just they would just automatically turn on- - (laughs) Ad mode. - Ad mode. - Now for some context. So Afeela was only really, or at least Sony Honda Mobility has only been like an official proper project for a little while now. I think they said that they launched it or like - Like five years? - They actually incorporated, no no, they actually incorporated the company last year. So it's interesting to see that they're clearly moving really quickly here, but they have an enormous amount of work to do to not only develop the car fully, work on that software, which does seem like really what Sony are bringing in. Clearly what they're trying to do right now as they're building the brand is understand what people like and what people don't like about this. So by the time in the next couple of years where they're really ready to finalize it for production they know what they should be doing. I think that they're pretty close. Honestly, I think the car looks pretty good. Probably need some mirrors, probably need some door handles. But other than that, like the actual look is pretty much there. I also think that the screens and the tech inside is terrific. Mind you a little bit more polished on that software. Now there are a ton of questions about this. As far as the power, the range, the price, yada yada yada. - We don't have any of that yet, but it's- - But I'm gonna assume the price is a lot. (words thwack) The range will be alright. (words thwack) - I had some more granular car concerns with it. The first one is currently it has zero cargo space. Again, this is a prototype. - Yeah, a prototype. - So that's like, whatever. But like at the moment there is no plan for a frunk. - No, no, they had actually, they had not decided that. - Well yeah, but like it's not, it doesn't exist at the moment. As big as this car is there's not a lot of cargo space in it period. - I will say I've been in a fair few concept and like, you know, pre-production vehicles and they do typically dump a lot of the electronics and stuff in the trunk while they're working on it. - Yeah, but I'm saying like if say they've moved all that out. The back part of the car is very small. All the leg room you had in the back of the seat, is you're sacrificing some of that cargo space. I know it's a sedan, but like it is a big sedan. - I will say that the frunk is something that they're still deciding on. Now with a lot of electric cars, you have one of two options. Either you have a frunk, which is what like a Tesla and some other cars have. But typically that means that a lot of the stuff that is in the frunk has to be then moved into the car. Now, I personally think that the Afeela, it's a big long car. The frunk area is huge. So I would like to think that if you open up the hood they would have at least a little bit of cargo space there. Which is always nice, especially in a sedan. You can have some hidden storage. No one needs to know about it. But I also very much value the fact that there's so much room on the interior. You can really kind of spread out. You don't have this tunnel that's like right beside your leg. - Yeah, like, I want a little bit more cargo space personally. The other big thing is like, well who is this for? Because when I think of Honda, I don't think of luxury. - Why it's not a Honda. (laughs) - Well like I don't think of Hondas as bad cars. They're very nice, reliable cars. But like, again, this is gonna be a really pricey vehicle. Why is this not an Acura, like? - I absolutely agree with that. It's very strange right now. I get that Sony as a company who want to make lots of money and who've branched out into a ridiculously wide number of electronics, they own movie studios, music, all this kind of stuff. The cars are a fairly natural thing. And this is not like something to cast aspersions on Afeela or anything. But my question is like, is this really the move? They've clearly pretty much committed to it at this point, right? They developed the company, right? They're going to do this. - Why? - I get that Sony and Honda, while it seems like it's a sort of strange situation, it does make some sense. Honda have not really dived that deeply into the EV space. But Sony having the technological experience with the software, obviously as an electronics manufacturer they know a lot of that. Whereas Honda have years and years of experience building vehicles. That kind of makes sense. But you're right. Why is this not just an Acura, which clearly that's a brand that Honda owns that are, is also heavily leaning into EVs. Is there gonna be some shared stuff? Maybe is it gonna have like the same platform or same software ever? Probably. - Probably. - But it just, this feels slightly strange to me and especially considering that while this looks cool for today here in 2023, the EV space is likely going to be much more competitive three years from now when this eventually goes on sale. And while I don't want just say like, oh, that means that they should give up. No, I would love to see more competition, but I also am a little bit like, this is a big gamble, guys. This is a big gamble and it's good. It's pretty cool. But I'm also not seeing any like massive reasons why you as a consumer should consider buying the Sony Honda Afeela. - I think this is could be more niche, which is difficult to to really build the brand if it's niche. We had like, all right, when Tesla first came out, they were like, the only right? Like the only EV you could get that was... - There were a couple of small ones but yeah. The only like, serious EV. - So like, I'm talking about model S. Yeah, like in order to make waves, they had to come out with the three, which was dirt cheap compared to anything else. - Yeah, I was gonna say- - For EV. For EV. - I was gonna say, compared to the S it was much cheaper, yes. - So like my thought is like, are they coming out with this one that's gonna be a hundred thousand dollar car? So they can come out a few years later and say, here's the Afeela two which is significantly cheaper, like get the luxury but in the cheaper thing. 'Cause look, there's so many things that I want. I love everything that they've done in it. Like, I wish more cars would have like the interiors that they had. - Here's the thing though, and the thing that concerns me. This is clearly meant to be more luxury focused. If you look at the Mercedes EQS, it looks very similar on the outside and it has a hyper screen, which is almost the same thing. But when you look at that, that is a car that you can buy today. This Afeela is years away. So if the Afeela can match what's happening today I don't know if that's gonna be enough. You know, if you look at like why you buy an EV, especially an expensive one, you're looking for a couple different things. Tesla clearly has the performance game down, right? A model S or model X, whatever, especially a plaid, is (censored) fast. On the flip side, if you're looking for luxury you've got Lucid, you've got Mercedes, you've got BMW. You've got a lot of brands who are really trying to lean into that luxurious sort of smooth, serene experience. And to me, I don't fully understand whether the Afeela lines up. - I think at this point, there's too many luxury brands. - And think about how many more are gonna be around three years from now? - Right? Right. - So like I feel like the move would've been to try and go somewhere more in the middle. - The thing is though, it almost is too late for that too because there are so many brands who are creating more affordably priced electric cars as well. - But if you wanna break into the industry from zero, which is what they're doing, sure, I mean like obviously they have the knowledge of Honda so they do have the leg up over any other company that's come coming from scratch which clearly has to figure out how to make a car and then maybe- - Go bankrupt along the way. - Right. - So like, I don't know if the entertainment side of it is enough to launch the brand. - With the software support that they've got with the ability for you to play, you know, videos and watch movies and play games. I do think they should probably just build an actual PS5 inside, right? The remote play is nice, but this thing obviously needs a lot of processing power anyway. Throw a PS5 in there. I mean if you buy a Tesla right now, especially an S or X, it basically has a PS5 chip inside where you can actually play games on steam and stuff, right? It's a very powerful vehicle. That is a thing that you could have bought a year and a half ago that existed. Considering how expensive this is, it can't be that much more expensive to throw in basically a PS5. It could still have all the Qualcomm, the stuff to actually run all the electronics and the driverless. And that's actually one of the things we haven't really discussed too much. This thing is very much meant, while of course it has a yoke and it is meant to be driven but the driverless features are pretty strong. It had something like what, 45? - 45 cameras. Yeah, but the thing is, again, coming back to a round while this is nice, you look at the Mercedes, you look at they're actually showing off their system which level three. And the way that one works is when you go full driverless you are no longer legally responsible. If you put it in the full driverless mode on whatever conditions that the car deems is okay. When you get into an accident or something Mercedes-Benz are liable for that, right? Which is obviously a huge deal but they're that far ahead at this point. If this car can barely maybe match that three years later. It's just one of those things. Again, I feel like it's good. I would love to see it succeed. I'm a little concerned it's too late. I almost feel like this needs to be coming out now not three years from now when the space is far far more advanced than it is today. - Yeah, a lot of EVs have come out in that three years since we've seen it NCS. - Absolutely. - But let us know in the comments what you think about it, are you a-feeling- - Put a PS5 in it. - What it's throwin' down- - Put a PS5 in it. Like, follow, subscribe and we'll catch you in the next- - I want my PS5 car. - Next one, next one. I can talk. - Yeah, you can talk them into putting a PS5 in my car. (mellow music)",

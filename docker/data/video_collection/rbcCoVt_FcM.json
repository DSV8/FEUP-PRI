    "transcript": "join the dark side I caved I'm sorry I caved but after using the OnePlus 6 for the past six months I really wanted a small device and really see how iOS has evolved since my iPhone 7 days and I'm going to be straight it's been a mixed bag with Xs mainly because my own expectations were higher than reality so in this video I want to share all my ups and downs with the most expensive smartphone I have ever bought it truly is I have asked a few others to join on this conversation to share their daily experience with a X or the Xs should be fun optimize your desk space with the Sora's new Graham spectrum TTL keyboard with a compact steel frame and low-profile keycaps removable cable and sweet illumination plus your choice of the Sora's agile blue or red switches to satisfy those fingers see if the Graham spectrum tkl keyboards for you links below so I'm going to lay all my cards on table right away so I love the size for everyday carry one hand reach ability is excellent there's enough room for twosome typing there is still enough display for entertainment and comfortable sized font and many would agree I love the form factor the form factor the iPhone X just feels perfect there's a ton of screen and a very small amount of body there so it just feels like it's made for your hand I totally agree with David the all screen body is gorgeous with uniform bezels ignoring the notch of course compared to many physical inconsistencies of curves or notches or bezels on many Android smartphones although with the case it is still quite chunky especially compared to my similarly sized iPhone 7 the Xs max the larger variance would be just too big for me but let's hear what Jordan has to say hey guys it's Travers consumer here and I've been using the iPhone Xs Max since it was released and I got to say the thing that I liked most about it is the fact that it has this nice large display that was actually a con for me in the beginning getting used to it was really hard and while having that nice big beautiful display is absolutely a benefit there can also be some drawbacks with that since some developers haven't updated their apps to work with a new big screen and with that you do get some of your content cut off with a not some developers have been treating a sense it first got released but there are still some out there who have it and it's kind of annoying and speaking of annoying it is just way too easy to scratch the display and the back as well many users are complaining about micro scratches that appear just gentle use so you're almost forced them to using a phone case and a screen protector to preserve its condition and therefore value if you're planning on selling this thing down the line and that's probably a smart choice for a little extra grip when you hold it and if you like some music in the shower so the phone won't slip from an uneven surface although you could bring this into a shower because of the ip68 water resistance but why would you now the speaker quality is excellent but the cellular and Wi-Fi issues are still present with Apple using Intel chips instead of Qualcomm so my Wi-Fi range on the OnePlus 6 is actually better and many are reporting LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity slowdowns where the X the previous version of the iPhone is faster with LTE and Wi-Fi versus the Xs and that's kind of a bummer this being Apple's flagship Matthew Monis here and thank you so much Hardware Canucks for having me on I really don't have too many iOS related issues but my main issue with the iPhone Xs is definitely connectivity problems I'll be chatting up with Eber we talking about Dyson vacuums and a look at my bars and I'll have like one to two bars compared to 4 or 500 device so that's one specific bug that still needs to be fixed on top of that I had to do a factory reset just the first week of using this device because I would still get full bars on my data connectivity and Wi-Fi but no connection was going through it all and to reset the antennas by going into airplane mode I was getting constant stuttering with just like simple animations I would get bugs all over the place where the phone would just freeze the microphone on the earbuds would not be working so nobody could hear me also a little bit of charge game what's happening as well where the phone would not actually start charging when it was plugged in it was annoying as expected most of these have been slowly patched out for the latest iOS updates but I generally questioned my decision to get a Xs because of all these unpleasant shortcomings but as an upgrade cycle for me it made sense since I'm coming from the iPhone 7 but for newer iPhone users it doesn't really make much sense hey so I guess the reason why I didn't upgrade to the iPhone Xs this year coming from the X is mostly price like it's just a very expensive phone the iPhone's are always expensive but I felt like the phone didn't give a notice we different experience from the original iPhone X like everything is basically the same except for the camera there's a few things that have changed obviously but the actual usability of the phone remains exactly the same between the two from my personal usage case now I will say though that if camera is like super important to you for me it isn't but if it is tennis kind of makes sense if you're coming from X like you just you know I mean but for most people iPhone Xs what's up guys I'm randomFrankP and I'm still using my iPhone X nothing that I saw really from the XR or the XS really made it worthy for me of an upgrade and this still works just fine it's fast it's smooth no complaints on my end and if I'm going to want to drop a thousand dollars on a new phone upgrade I'm gonna want to be blown away but what I did do however though to kind of combat that was I picked up the new 11 inch iPad pro this is more of my style anyway I'm not really a big mobile user as it is so yeah I'm so content with my iPhone X now there are plenty of things that I love that are not followed by a negative so the vibration motor in here is better than anything else I've used you'll feel it in your pants I guarantee it face ID since day one and it's been reliable but with some speed variation sometimes it's instantaneous and other times you can see the face ID page you can disable the require attention feature so it can unlock without you needing to look at your phone directly and incoming notifications will play at lower volume if you are looking at your phone which is cool and it's great for app purchases and password managers it just makes life much easier without needing to remember things you know just look at the phone and be good the screen is amazing and I love true tone so it calibrates the temperature of this screen based on ambient lighting for a more pleasant viewing experience it's true that the notch is huge during media playback but two-to-one aspect ratio videos are becoming more popular to maximize that viewing area without spilling over the knotch gesture navigation is pleasant and natural to use I don't miss the on-screen buttons and all of my interactions just feel fluid I love the camera for the natural color reproduction with amazing highlight recovery and slightly boosted shadows because of the new HDR processing and have really enjoyed the 2x zoom for some cool compositions that I find myself using constantly and the portrait mode to the most part has this clean cut out of the subject would naturally simulated bokeh although sometimes it's a miss and you have to dial back the f-stop to save the shot I actually prefer the selfie portrait mode too that delivers a more pleasing image now the last bit of my experience with the Xs has to revolve around us and it's weird how we've all assumed this to be like a more stable ecosystem because for the first two weeks it sure was not the case we've all heard that apps are better optimized for iPhones and Google even makes their apps first on iOS but YouTube studio app that an app that I use on a daily basis to respond to comments was lagging so much and it was like that for a really long time until the latest iOS update it is developer specific I know but still quite annoying it has been patched out on latest updates and this is the only instance of the app kind of lagging behind or is everything else Instagram Twitter and all the apps that are used on a daily basis a running fluid now lack of customization aside you know iOS is locked down like that so we can't really complain but I haven't found any new 3d touch functionality so it's mainly pointless except for a flashlight intensity disabling true tone for example and keyboard navigation widget selection is still incredibly limiting for example I'd love a steps counter instead of who's viewed my profile you still cannot reassign the two shortcuts on the lock screen the flashlight is handy I'll give them that but the camera is pointless since you can already swipe to the right to access the camera at least the notification system has been fixed with grouping of items and easy navigation from the notification screen so my productivity with Xs is slowly approaching that of Android phones and while the Xs charges like a snail unless you give Apple more money I've been very happy with battery life reaching almost six hours of on-screen time on a heavy day wireless charging is of course present and so should your desire for a wireless pair of headphones it's just something we have to accept or buy the missing dongle and so my entire tennis experience has been improving you know it was a rocky start in the beginning but it has gotten better with updates contrast that to my Android experience where it's kind of the opposite everything sent a smooth sailing and over time the experience deteriorates and I feel like it's all about finding an absolute winner between iPhone or any Android smartphone but looking at which side you can settle on that they'll satisfy more of your own expectations and right now the iPhone Xs is my perfect size phone with my perfect camera with iOS limitations that I'll just have to accept all right guys so that is my review of the iPhone Xs let me know if you've recently switch sides and what's your experience been like I'm a Dmitri thanks so much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content I will see you in the next video oh yeah I was gonna say well I mess at you later",

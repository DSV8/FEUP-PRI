    "transcript": "This is probably the dumbest possible way to play Metroid Prime Hunters. And shockingly, it's actually kind of fun. With a Joycon in my left hand, I can make Samus jump around and shoot and stuff, and with my pinchy fingers on the right, I can make her look at things. The only thing is you have to remember to look at the lower emulated touchscreen just long enough to pinch, then you're free to look wherever you want while controlling where Samus looks. And that will continue working until you unpinch. That a word? Anyway, does this make sense to do at all, or am I just an idiot? That's correct.",

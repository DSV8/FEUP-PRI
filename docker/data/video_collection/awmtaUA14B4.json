    "transcript": "hey guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and I'm back here to talk more about processors from Intel and it's actually starting to becoming a weekly thing for me but that's actually a good thing AMD's Ryzen CPUs lit some series fire under Intel's butt and they quickly came up with a skylake X if you're interested in the performance view you can check it out right over here but today we're talking about coffee Lake I can have my coffee first I love the taste of coffee every day in the morning that's what gets me up and running but you know what I mean I guess there's that hidden joke I don't know I really don't know coffee lake actually you might remember as making a video on explaining Intel's upcoming a generation of CPUs on the ultrabooks and the lower end desktops if you're interested in more information you can check it out right over here now even though skylake x processors cost more money than many of you can afford and the mobile low voltage coffee lake processors are a few months away Intel's eighth generation coffee lake CPUs are on their way to desktops very soon and next week stay tuned for our full performance review of these new CPUs because I can't quite share that information just yet but Intel did allow us to share some preliminary information regarding these new chips so let's get started cooler master master keys keyboard line-up is now available in three sizes to fit within your space with large medium and small boards with either beautiful RGB or pure white LED illumination a little something for everyone make it yours with a master keys probe by Coolermaster looking at the high-end coffee lake processors first the lineup is headlined by the i7 8700K which is supposed to take over from the 7700K it is important to remember that the actual differences between cable ache and coffee lake are minimal from a core architecture standpoint but these newer CPUs use Intel's 40 nanometer plus plus technology allowing them to hit higher overall clock speeds and core counts without significantly increasing power consumption or heat output this is why with the 8700K Intel is able to have clock speeds up to 4.7 gigahertz 6 cores 12 threads and 12 megabytes of smart cash while still having a TDP of chosen 95 watts that's pretty incredible what isn't so incredible is the corner intel has placed himself and with pricing the 8700k will retail for about three hundred and sixty dollars which places it right among eight core risin some processors and that could be an issue for some productivity tasks it also makes me wonder what was the whole point with Kaby lake x I mean looking from a raw performance standpoint coffee lake seems to be a much better platform compared to Kaby Lake X and it's gonna be a lot less expensive to so Intel what is really going on anyways back to the specs of 8th gen the i7 8700 is basically the same processor but without and unlocked multiplier lower clock speeds and a TDP of 65 watts I'm expecting we will see this one in a lot of pre-built gaming systems like the i5 7600K it replaces the new i5 8600K is really meant to be the value leader of this lineup it offers high clock speeds and a native six core die so it should be much better than cable akin performance I'm really excited to take a look at this one since it actually costs more than the six core 12 thread Ryzen 5 1600x without offering more processing threats well those higher frequencies win the day for Intel again I'll find out soon where things get much less confusing is in the lower end I five and I three product lineups since Intel has done a pretty good job with limiting the number of processors they will be introducing I would actually say the i5 8400 is probably the most interesting of the entire coffee lake launch for people who don't care about overclocking it isn't unlocked which is too bad but there are six cores and a turbo frequency of 4 gigahertz that 65 watt TDP could even make it a good fit for a mid-range HTPC or small form-factor systems and intel has ensured it doesn't cost a dime more than these 7400 the only major challenge could be once again with Andy's wives and family since the 1500x cost the exact same amount of money it can be overclocked and even offers aid processing threats yex if you really want budget-minded overclocking from coffee lake things stay really expensive guys it is only $15 less than the 8400 and has two less threads but the i3 8350k is what you will need honestly I just don't get intel strategy with the 8350k even the 7350k was a complete waste of money and and just resources to be honest now if you look at the competition name DS Ryzen 5 1400 might be a better choice compared to the cpu because it offers eight processing threads and it seems to be a much popular choice among gamers right now it really seems like Intel's launching these new CPUs without taking a look at what's happening with Ryzen and I guess we'll have to see how all DCP is stacked up with one another when we put them through our test bench finally there's the i3 8100 and the massive $55 gap between this CPU and the 8350k seems to indicate Intel isn't done launching coffee lake processors just yet but if you want a lower-cost quad core chip this might be a good fit even though Intel still isn't offering all of their coffee lake processors and unlocked their overclocking abilities have been drastically improved things like perk or overclocking real time memory latency control and extended PLL trim controls are all included and there's some expectation that clock speeds will be able to reach well over 5 gigahertz for the K series part unfortunately these overclocking features along with the enhanced power delivery needs of coffee lake processors and their ability to run at consistent 26 66 megahertz memory speeds means that once again Intel is asking you to purchase a new motherboard yeah I know guys this is getting very frustrating and that excuse doesn't really add up especially when you consider the new z370 generation doesn't really offer any benefits over z270 all of the platform's primary lanes comes from the processor itself and there are still 16 of them that much is rising but what z370 doesn't have is native support for key technologies like USB 3.1 gen2 and nvme storage devices those can be added through third-party controllers linked to the chipsets PCI 3.0 lanes but that could cause slowdowns when compared to the direct access those devices have on AMD's X370 and be 350 chipsets but what I can see is that motherboard venders are coming out with some really strong looking Z370 boards for instance take a look at this gigabytes or as gaming 7 and it takes all of their lessons from z270 and improves upon it in every way there is USB 3.1 gen2 connectors triple and two slots a high-end ESS saber audio tag and terrible three I'll likely be using this board for a complete build in the next few weeks sales day tuned for that but how does this all translate into performance while Intel claims coffee lake will offer up to 32 percent faster 4k video editing and 25% faster in game frame rates than cabling of course some of those performance benefits comes from the additional threats on the i7 8700K but it also sounds like DCPS should operate it consistently higher clock speeds - and that means someone with an older Sandy Bridge processor should really look into coffee lake maybe we'll let you know more about the performance once coffee lake is officially launched on October the 5th until then let us know if you're excited about these new processors from Intel also if you're coming from an older Intel or AMD base system is coffee lake or Z to be semi appealing or would you perhaps lean towards AMD which means you know rise in the next 370 in the future let me know in the comments down below i'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to subscribe for more similar content and we'll see you in the next one",

    "transcript": "- Hey, it's Nick Statt with The Verge and we're here checking out the Asus Mothership. Now it's best described as a portable gaming desktop. Now what exactly does that mean? Well, it means that you can take this top cover here and detach it entirely as a portable wireless keyboard. So with the keyboard detached, it basically becomes a desktop machine. Now you've got a 17 inch display, it's 144 hertz and then a three millisecond response rate. So it's a, you know, up there with the best gaming monitors you can buy. It's not 4k and it's not a touch screen, but, you know, the things that matter to gamers are gonna be the 144 hertz and the three milliseconds and it's got those. The Mothership is essentially a desktop. It's got all desktop components and it can be played like a desktop. So you can of course use this nifty wireless keyboard. It's got a cool RGB setup going on here, it's got a built in touch pad, but you don't need to use this keyboard. You can use your own gaming keyboard and obviously you can bring your own mouse to use. All the components are in the back and it's all encased in aluminum and that includes the back of the keyboard cover as well. It's not gonna be cheap. It'll probably run quite a few thousand dollars more than your standard gaming laptop. We don't know exactly how much it'll cost, but it's designed to be a niche product and Asus is designing the Mothership as kind of the top of the top. It's really the best it has to offer in this experimental portable desktop package. The whole device really just is very experimental looking and it's really cool honestly. I mean, I've never seen anything like this. I don't know if I personally would spend many thousands of dollars on a device like this, but I appreciate what Asus is doing here. It's really novel, we might see this kind of hybrid device more in the future, especially now that Nvidia is making it's mobile RTX graphics more widely available. You can get that powerful desktop performance in a smaller package. It might not look like the Mothership, it might not work like the Mothership, but this is really just a kind of a proof of concept of what you could really do if you pushed everything to the limit. If you wanna see more gadgets like the Asus Mothership and other wacky gaming accessories, machines, weird experimental concepts like this, keep it locked to The Verge on YouTube at YouTube.com/TheVerge. We'll be at CES all week with more to come.",

    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is, where we have a very special guest on Who Wants to Be a Movie Millionaire? And that is the one and only Emmy-nominated Jake Roper from \"Vsauce3\". Jake, how's it going, and how is your Emmy? - Well, I don't have one, physically, 'cause I was just nominated, I haven't won just yet. - I thought we only had Emmy winners on the show. Not, okay, fine. - Sorry, my bad. (laughs) - (clears throat) Emmy-nominated Jake Roper. How's it going, my friend? - It's going swell, how are you, Austin Evans? - I'm doing really well, and I'm ready to test you on your movie knowledge. So of course, we did a little video together last year. It was called \"Can You Survive Alien?\" And in that, you chopped my head off. So as punishment, I'm going to make you look silly by not knowing many famous movies that you've most certainly seen before. Are you ready to play the game? - Oh, yeah, I'm so ready to be horribly embarrassed, can't wait. - So the rules are very simple. So Matt and I have come up with a list of 12 of our favorite movies, as well as some of the favorite movies around the office, and we're going to ask you two questions. First of all, the name of the movie, and for your second, a round of bonus points, what year the movie came out. Now, we're going to give you a handicap of plus or minus two years, so if a movie came out in 2000, I will accept 1998, 1999, 2001 or 2002. - Ah, that's how math works, okay, thank you. - For that, you have been deducted one point. Now you're only getting a one-year handicap. - No. - So for previous episodes of the show, we've shown people tech, for example, and we would censor out the logos. But obviously, that's not really possible, so this time we're showing you pixelated screenshots from movies. Some of these are very iconic shots. Some of them are actually a little bit difficult. So are you ready to play Who Wants to Be a Movie Millionaire? - [Matt] Nope, we gotta go over the wager. - Oh, the wager! I always forget the wager. Okay, if you are feeling so inclined to get a little wagery with me, we have a running bet on the show. If you are able to get half of these questions right, so basically, you have twelve questions, each with two points each, so if you can get half or more, so 12 points, throughout this entire game, then you will get the honor, the privilege of tweeting whatever you want from the \"This Is\" account. However, if you were to say fail and not get enough points, then we would have the ability to have you tweet us out a cheeky little link to the episode is this a wager you would like to partake in my friends? - That sounds very fair. - Okay, all right, then let's begin with Who Wants to Be a Movie Millionaire. That just sounds, it doesn't sound like I got, I got it. Who wants to be a movie trivia millionaire. - So wait just a, TO real quick, do I get to call Ken if I'm scared or not scared, I guess, if I need help. (laughs) - You are 100%. I usually mentioned that in the middle of it, but you're correct. If you are feeling stumped, and you trust for some reason, the illustrious Ken Bolido, you can use your one earlier life line, Phone-a-Ken. But just keep in mind that with 12 questions, don't burn it too early or burn it when you want because he's probably not gonna be very helpful, but you can try to talk to your son, my tabloid just the most call over. - Yeah, as long as it's an enemy I feel like we're set. - Alright with moving number one, let us begin. - This looks like MS Paint art, but the movie is \"Mad Max Fury Road\", in the year, oh fudge buckets. Okay, the year would be, I'm trying to remember the Academy Awards, 'cause I won bunch and I was very excited. I'm gonna go with, came out, fudge. I'm between two years whether close enough, or falls within that margin of error. I'm gonna say it came out in 2016. - Jake Roper from \"Vsauce3\", you're 100% correct. It is \"Mad Max Fury Road\" from 2015. That's well within the margin for error. So you can see how this game works, Right, we're gonna have some, selectively modified screenshots from various movies to give you a real sense of what we're looking for. One question down, 100% success. Are you feeling good right now? - No. - Excellent. Time to move on to movie number two. - Oh wow, it really it's like, Matt got a hold of MS paint and or, learned how to create art in Minecraft, is what this looks like. But this looks like a very famous scene, of Michael Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis. So I'm gonna go with Halloween. I know it was in the '70s, probably late '70s, it was kind of the start of the slasher movie genre, I mean not the start, but it helped really propel it. I'm gonna go with, see I'm between, but it's still within the margin of error. I'm gonna go with 1977. - Emmy Award nominee. - Austin. - (laughs) You are 100% correct, is in fact Halloween from 1978. This is a good one. I thought this was pretty tough. I did actually not get this one at first when Matt showed it to me. The thing with this one is because there's so much negative space. It's kind of like what exactly is happening here. But you absolutely nailed it. - Oh yeah, look at that, crying Jamie Lee Curtis. See at least I couldn't tell in the pixelated version, that she was crying so that one was new. - There you go. Well, you know what, extra points for authenticity. I'm a little bit afraid right now. You're doing way too good here, so we're gonna move on to number three. - Oh boy, okay. All right, I'm gonna go with, okay, I think I know. I'm gonna guess that that is, it looks like Kevin Hart from \"Jumanji\"? Does it \"Welcome to the Jungle\" or the \"Next Level\"?. It looks like a junglers text. So I'm gonna say it's \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\". And that movie came out in 2017. - Jake, I'm afraid to say that with question number three. You're 100% correct again. - (laughs) Don't do that to me, the suspense. - So, of course, as one of... Well, you did an episode on \"Jumanji\". That was what, number four or five you did? - Yeah, I think that was the fourth episode. - Fourth, so with this one, the idea was we were trying to trip you up, but obviously that completely failed. Okay, I'm very afraid now that you're gonna get like 100% success rate here, you're already halfway to victory you're on question three. - Don't be scared, just let it happen Austin. - Matt what do we do if there's no watch time in this video 'cause Jake got all right, and people leave after two minutes. Do you have a back up plan? - [Matt] Delete the channel. - Oh, we finally get to delete the channel. All right, let's delete the channel after the next question. - That looks like Daniel Craig from the movie \"Knives Out\", which I guess came out this year 2020. - This is a \"Knives Out\" for 2019. Yes, you're correct. (laughs) This is this is very bad, Jake. - [Matt] Take away the handicap. - Okay, so you know what I've just heard from Matt, you no longer have a handicap because you're destroying us so much. - You can't do that. (laughs) You set it up at the front. - And then we break them in the middle when you break our game. Alright, so since you were saying so far ahead, you have zero room for handicap on the year. Dude, you can still get so many of these wrong and be just fine. I have confidence in you, if you just get all the movies from here, correct. You're still gonna win. - Oh, so okay, just to be clear. If I don't get the year, I don't get two points I only get one point. So each part of that question is worse. Okay, that's fine. - Jake Roper, you are on the edge of elimination. It's time to move to the next question. - I don't know what this voice is. But I really hope you just do that forever. Oh, boy, okay. This one's gonna be difficult for the year. All right, I don't wanna be overly confident 'cause I find that confidence is just... it ends up hurting you when you're trying to succeed. Which is why I just always assume that I'm garbage in everything. But this isn't a therapy session, Austin. That's for our Thursdays at 3:00 p.m. - (laughs) Every Thursday. - Well, here's the thing this could be, you guys could have really thrown a curve ball at me. 'Cause I'm gonna say that it's \"Back to the Future\". And it's Marty McFly on stage during the prom. However, it could have also been the scene from \"Back to the Future two\", but I don't think that you thought that far ahead. So we're gonna say is \"Back to the Future\". And the year that it came out, fudge. I don't know man, 1985. - I'm not even gonna pretend to have any drama where. Yeah, you were 100% correct. It is 1985 and fun fact, of course 1985 is the year in the movie. So yeah, no, we did not think far enough ahead to give you any kind of trick questions obviously. No problems, you know what we need to do right now. We need to up the ante. We need to up the stakes because you're doing so well. How confident are you right now? - Not at all. - What do you mean your flawless so far? You even got the year exactly right. - There's still seven more questions. I'll be confident when it's over. - Okay, you know what, we'll do this. If you get every single one of these correct. We will make a video of your choice, you can do whatever you want with, how about that? We're literally scrambling to cope with these 'cause no one has ever done this well on our show right now. - I mean, I can tell you right now the video is gonna be all of y'all, everybody currently that's a part of this eating hot wings. - Fair. Okay, all right. The rest of the rules still apply though you need to get the year correct for the rest of these movies. But we will eat the hot sauce if you get the names of the movies. - Okay, sounds good. I like this. - All right, let's move on to movie number six. - Oh, wow, this is a pretty ooh, this is a pretty close one. Okay, so this one's gonna be difficult, 'cause I know that that's Sigourney Weaver, and I know that it's an alien next to her face. However, that photo is. I don't know, specifically the \"Alien\" film that it's from. I know it's probably from \"Aliens\" or \"Alien 3\". She had long hair in the first one in the second one. Okay, I'm gonna go with \"Alien 3\", which I think came out in 19... Oh, goodness, 1993. - You're correct. Although, it is 1992. This is bad. You know what we have to change the name. We're gonna call this does Jake Roper know movies, I think the title now is, Jake Roper does know movies. - No one's gonna click that. - Movie number seven. - Oh, come on gang, this is \"Die Hard\", this is a John McLean in the air vents or air ducts I should say in \"Die Hard\", which this is, see now here we go with the date. Let's see, but they're very excited about the telephone in the limousine. Okay, ah, I'm gonna go with this is wrong but 1988. - 100% correct, I give up, I give up. That literally like, all right, never before have we've been broken so thoroughly. Although in hindsight I do realize that this is a thumbnail for your \"Die Hard\" case you've had the movies episode so to be fair it's pretty, pretty iconic. But yeah, no, literally dead on. - Yeah, I mean if it makes you feel any better. You guys are doing a really great job. We clearly didn't make this one hard enough. All right, let's move on to movie number eight. - Maybe in the future. Don't don't choose movies that I probably watched a bunch because I made a video about them. - We try to, that was the whole point. Like so much of this game is about testing you on like how old do you know your old movies, your old videos, your old tag like stuff that you should know. - So this is \"Ghostbusters\". That's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Now the year is gonna be tricky. Ghostbusters, I wanna say it was relatively not super early '80s but definitely before 86 I would say, 'cause we had Sigourney Weaver. Oh, okay, this is probably wrong. No, I'm just 1983. - Whoo, all right, 1984 I'm going to consider that to be a success for us. You only get one point on that one. - [Jake] Yeah, those were the two was between 33 or 83 and 84 is what I was juggling between. - At this point you're at one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 so you can get every single movie wrong from here and still have two extra points. - Can I spend those on like a slap bracelet or something? Or is this like Chuck E Cheese, how's that work? - No, but you still need to get four of them correct to make us eat hot wings. - You do have to tweet out anything I want now, right? - I do have to tweet out whatever you want, yes. But it's time to move on to movie number nine. - Ooh, okay, this one's a little tough. Purple and blue, there a lot of hues. Okay, can I give Ken a call? - You can give Ken Bolido a very special call. - Hi, is this Ken? - [Ken] It is. - Hey, Ken, this is Jake Roper. So I only have about 15 seconds left. And I'm on this question on this show that Austin Evans is making me do and I just wanna ask you, do you like \"Blade Runner 2049\". - [Ken] If it means me eating hot sauce, I don't. - Oh, that's unfortunate. I actually, it's one of my favorite movies in recent memory. But it's all got for you Ken. Alright, so Blade Runner 2049. And I think it came out. - Oh, God, this is so bad. (laughs) - And I think, see this one's gonna be tough again too, 'cause it's between two years for me here. I remember I saw it in New York. So I was living in New York at the time, which was 2017 for the most part, but I was there at the beginning of 2018. But I would imagine that this kind of film wouldn't come out in January or February because it's a big one. They wouldn't just dump it. So I'm gonna say 2017 is when the movie came out. - I'm not even gonna pretend anymore. I've given up, yeah, you're 100% correct. I thought we had you for a second. I thought we had you for a second but you know what, it is a very iconic scene and I will totally give you that, this is a great movie. This is actually one of my suggestions. Okay, well, Jake, it's looking pretty good. However, I do have to say there are three questions left. You're absolutely killing it. But you have to get all three of these movies, right. Let's move on to movie number 10. - Yeah, okay, this is \"Men and Black\". This is after Will Smith helps deliver the baby, on like the Long Island expressway or something. \"Men in Black\" came out when though, goodness gravy. I remember, so I'm just going back what I remember seeing, I remember seeing it in theaters and I lived in Colorado at the time. - Like a lot of people when they've been playing this game had been like, \"Oh, I remember because this is the camera I was shooting or this or that,\" but you have such like specific detail on like, which theaters you were in, like, what time period. I mean, I'm legitimately impressed. - Oh, movies are just very important to me. They like raised me as a kid, just like Will Smith helped raise this squid baby for a brief moment in time. Before he got like, sucked back into the car. Anyway, okay, 'cause this was after \"Independence Day,\" I think, is when this movie came out. And I was like, super pumped. 'Cause I was like Will Smith, I'm probably gonna be off by a year, but I'm gonna say 1997. - Yep, that's the year. So I'm just gonna keep marking on my little thing. Look at Jake, he's so good at movies. We should have asked him, I don't know what. Okay, if you could do this game again, what we asked you that actually difficult? - You'd quiz me on Austin Evans videos. You clearly have never watched any of those. - I actually don't really understand what your channel is about. - Let's move on to movie number 11. - We got some people in a car. It looks like they're wearing sunglasses. They're also wearing suits. So immediately I wanna thank \"Blues Brothers\". I'm trying to look at it. Hold on, I'm just gonna set up my phone and yeah, do you not see two people? Hold on, I'm walking further away from the cameras or from my phone so I can see it from a distance. Okay, you know what, I'm gonna roll the dice. This is probably wrong, but I'm gonna go with \"Blues Brothers\". And I have no, 1977, I have no idea. - On the year, you're incorrect, on the movie you are correct. It is the \"Blues Brothers\" and Jake. You're currently at 11 of 11. And if we were playing by the usual rules, which of course we're not because we decided to make it more difficult and you haven't failed. You would be at 21 of 22 points correct right now. - I feel like while you're doing this Matt is just trying to make harder images for me. - He's literally photoshopping, he's like Ms painting right now like dot dot dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot dot. The year is completely optional at this point, obviously, feel free to guess but you need to get the name of this new movie correct. This next movie correct. Otherwise, you are not going to get the pleasure of watching us eat disgustingly hot wings. Jake Roper, Emmy nominated, filmmaker, director, writer, and generally handsome person. Are you ready for question number 12? - Sure, I'm very nervous, very nervous. - All right, let's do it. - Oh, goodness. See, this one's tricky, 'cause I know that's Obi-Wan Kenobi. But here's the problem, this is a really tricky one. See, this is a little bit unfair 'cause he looks the same in all three movies. - You've gotten every question right? I don't think you get to say anything about being unfair. (laughs) - It's a little unfair 'cause it could be \"Revenge of the Sith\" it could be \"Attack of the Clones\". Or it could be the first movie, waiting isn't gonna solve anything. I don't know which, I'm just gonna go with \"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones\". - Jake Roper you've gone 21 for 22. On the final question you are incorrect, it is \"Revenge of the Sith\". - No. - We don't have to eat hot sauce. What is up, we're the real winners here. You may have completely destroyed our game and made us look like complete idiots. But we finally got one right mother fucker. - Yeah, look at that. Now that it is not pixelated. I can 100% tell that it's still one of the three prequels. - (laughs) Jake, you have been a pleasure to have on the show. Would you like to decide what you want us to tweet right now or would you like to do that later? - I was thinking about this the other day and I thought to myself if I win what I want Austin to tweet and actually had a really good one. Oh, I remember, I was trying to buy time. I remember what I want you to tweet. You know that photo of your nipples that I always send to you on your birthday. I would like you with no context, nothing written. Just a photo, that photo of your nipples. Just that. (dramatic music) - Look, the Jurassic Park. (dramatic music) (funny music)",

    "transcript": "- Well, well. Back so soon? You must love tech news. Honestly, it might be a problem. You should talk to someone. For some reason, chip companies are intent on pretending that the horrific stock shortage of the past few years is just not happening. So it sounds like NVIDIA may reveal a new RTX 3080 air... Really? A new RTX 3080 variant tomorrow. This new 3080 is going to have 12 gigabytes of VRAM, up from 10 gigabytes on the current model. I thought I was gonna do a list. That's the end of the list. That might sound a little overkill, the 12 to 10, but with some games demanding more than 10 gigs to run high-definition textures, like \"Far Cry 6\" being a good example, the move does make sense as there should be some demand for a SKU with extra memory. No word yet on the official release date or MSRP, probably because talking about those things wouldn't make any sense, just like everything else in this world at the current time. It's senseless! It's not sensible. If you've been waiting for a more affordable 5G iPhone, it sounds like Apple is gearing up to tempt you with an updated iPhone SE. - [Riley] Yes! - The news comes from a member of the Bloomberg Apple Insider Club, I've been trying to break in for years, that claims the new phone will be unveiled in March or April. Don't expect too much in the way of radical redesign, as it sounds like it'll borrow heavily from the iPhone 8. Apologies to the small-handed among us who miss the original SE's iPhone 5-ish body type, but c'est la vie. - Aw. - Buy a Mini if you like the small bodies, I... As mentioned, the phone will have 5G, as well as a new CPU, likely the A15 used by the current generation of iPhones, so you won't be missing out too much on performance. Currently the iPhone SE goes for 400 bucks, so hopefully we won't see much of a price increase for the 5G model, 'cause otherwise you might as well just strap a Starlink dish to your phone, you know? Just carry around the 5G... This is stupid! Who wrote this joke? If you own a Honda or Acura, glance at the clock inside your car. It might be trying to gaslight you into thinking that it's actually 2002 instead of 2022. The glitch appears to be quite widespread, appearing in cars with model years from 2004 to 2012, in both North America and the U.K. The glitch seems to reappear every time a driver restarts their car, so resetting it manually, it doesn't help, unless you love long trips. This behavior is truly toxic. Apparently the issue has its roots in the cars' navigation systems, which weren't programed to deal with GPS time rollover correctly, because GPS uses only a limited number of binary digits to indicate the date. The counter rolls over every 20 years. Honda says it's trying to figure out possible countermeasures. (sighs) What is this? Cyberwarfare? Just display the right time. Fake news! Oh boy, here comes Riley again. - Now it's time for Quick Bits, brought to you by Storyblocks, the resource that helps creators bring their stories to life without sacrifice due to lack of time, budget, or equipment. Do you know anyone who has an infinite amount of those? The answer, logically, has to be no! Storyblocks has over a million royalty-free assets with a wide array of diverse and inclusive content for you to choose from. With an unlimited all-access plan, you'll get unlimited video and audio downloads instead of paying per clip. What do you think these are, NFTs? There are subscriptions for every budget, all the way up to enterprise licensing. So check out Storyblocks today at storyblocks.com/techlinked. - Only the chosen can channel the essence of Quick Bits. Learning this skill took me years of training. My parents made me do it. It sucked. They gave me steroids. If you're fortunate enough to own a ray tracing-enabled GPU from NVIDIA, Team Green just announced that 10 additional games are getting RTX support. These games include \"Rainbow Six Extraction,\" \"Escape from Tarkov,\" and \"Hitman 3.\" Some of these titles will feature increased RTX support, just so many reflections, while others are getting it for the first time, and they're honestly just happy to feel included. We already know that AMD's Zen 4 processor lineup is set to drop in the second half of this year, but now it looks like we're finally getting engineering samples showing up in benchmarks. These Ryzen 7000 chips have a full megabyte of Level 2 cache, double what you can find on Zen 3, so hopefully we can reach (beep) you levels of cache in Zen 5 or 6, so we don't have to think about it anymore. - [Riley] Hey! (beep) you! - OLED TVs are notoriously expensive, but what if you could print your own? Researchers at the University of Minnesota think you'll be able to one day, as they've developed a 3D-printed flexible OLED, although it's only 64 pixels and required a five-figure printer to manufacture. Still, though, it could open up exciting possibilities down the road for DIYers, both for repairs as well as home projects where you could just whip up a screen from scratch. Or, more likely, just more regional fabs for these things. Sega looks like it might be backing down from its plan to sell NFTs following criticism from fans. This story again, but from another company. The NFTs were going to consist of music and visual art from games, but Sega's CEO said he didn't want to proceed with the plan if the perception of it is simple moneymaking, and that is certainly the perception currently. It seems like Sega hasn't fully canceled its plans yet. It's just waiting for the culture to catch up. It's at least reevaluating these plans. Maybe consider selling physical collectibles? Just an idea. People seem to like it. And after eight long years, it looks like another \"Mario Kart\" game may finally be in the works. According to an industry insider, \"Mario Kart 9,\" which is not yet the official title, is being developed and has an unspecified new twist. It's German \"Mario Kart.\" I mean, I hope after all this time, the next \"Mario Kart\" would offer us something new, but hopefully not NFTs. - [Riley] Peach saving Mario? - Who wrote that? I like NFTs. So that's all, folks. Come back on Wednesday for more tech news. If you have a craving before then, try going for a run or putting your tech news patch on or something. You know, you need to manage your pain.",

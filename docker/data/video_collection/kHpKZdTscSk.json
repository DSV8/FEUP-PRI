    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] Today I'm gonna tell you a story about how I skipped an AppleCare repair process for a $10,000 computer. (metal drops) By using a piece of metal. (beeping) (upbeat music) Hey guys, how are you all doing really? That's just great. I'm doing pretty great today too because its story time with Krazy Ken. Once again, it's a little after action report of a big tech misadventure I had recently. Now it happened so fast. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to document it for you guys entirely, but I will go over what did happen. I was working with the iMac Pro, yes, the exact same one I set up when I infiltrated Jony Ive's white room. If you'd like to watch that, feel free to give it a look. But then something weird happened. So after I set up the computer, I had the actual iMac itself removed from that foot and mounted with a VESA mount to one of those arms you can put on an office desk, right? So I did that and I used it that way for a few months. However, I then needed to put the foot back on because I actually needed to travel with the iMac. But for some reason, when I try putting the foot back on it wouldn't fit. So it came off just fine, but a few months later trying to put the foot back on, it would not work, why? Well, I had no freaking idea until I looked closer at the holes on the top of the metal. It looks like there was some damage, and the aluminum was warped in such a way where the holes, were the pins were line up were somehow smaller than normal, and that is why I could not get the foot to lay flush in the computer, and I couldn't reattached it. But somehow the VESA mount bracket thing would still work just fine, I don't know, that worked just fine, but the foot wouldn't work. So I'm like, what is going on? And why can't I put this back on here? But here's the question, how the freak did the metal get warped? When I had the foot removed, it literally sat in an office cubicle for months, nobody touched it, I don't know how it got damaged. And I think Quinn from Snazzy Labs had a similar problem with his iMac pro foot as well, but that kind of escalated because the Genius Bar actually effed it up while trying to put it back together. So maybe it just got effed up during the removal process and I didn't notice, maybe these feet are really easy to damage, I mean they must be easy enough to damage for Apple's own genius team to break them, so crazy old me probably broke it at one time too. I was working with the tech support guy, I don't wanna point fingers at him, but maybe he also damaged it, I don't know. But we needed to get something figured out. So, I had my tech support companion contact Apple. The thing is under warranty, so they'll repair it for free. But to make matters worse, I needed that iMac Pro in like four days, because I needed to travel with it, to bring it somewhere for a film shoot. During one of those days I'm allowed out of the lair. So Apple could repair it for free, but we'd have to bring the computer to the nearest store, and then they'd have to do repairs, maybe get a replacement foot, I don't know. But we wouldn't be able to see it for likely at least a week, maybe two. And that was not an option. So I have this $10,000 computer sitting here, and I can't freaking use it because I can't attach it to the foot so it will stand up. We're still talking with the Apple support people through this chat application that they have on their website. And it was interesting because they asked for a photo of the foot, and we showed them a close-up photo showing the damage. But they actually wanted a wide shot of the whole foot, like they wanted to see the whole thing in a wide shot, whatever. So we did that. And I believe that was that, nothing else really extravagant happened with that because they were like, bring it to an Apple Store. And normally that would be fine, but time was of the essence. - Bullshit! - So, I thought let's fix it ourselves. (laughs) Sure, it's a $10,000 computer, and we're using like a dollar piece of metal. But we can do this. What if we just file down the aluminum a bit and get the foot to fit. So I try this rat tail file, doesn't really fit. I tried this other file, doesn't really fit either. So and then I tried this teeny weeny weeny 'widdle' file. It actually like just barely fit in there. I just kind of filed the metal down for a few minutes, and viola, it worked, the foot reattached to that beautiful $10,000 iMac Pro, and everybody was happy again. We bypassed the whole Apple repair process, and I was able to take the iMac Pro to the video shoot, and everything was hunky-dory. So, how exactly did it happen? I have no idea. Could Apple have fixed it? Yeah, probably, but not within our timeframe. We had to improvise, because fixing the foot is not something that will be restricted by the T2 chip. (laughs) Oh we are gonna be controlled by robots someday. Anyway, so the lesson here is just use what you have when you can, if Apple allows it cause we don't know how they are with their repairs, isn't that right Louis Rossmann? That's getting tough. But this one works just fine, so happy ending. I don't think this has just happened to me, but if this happened to you, let me know. And if you have any other stories, I wanna hear them too. So that's all I have for you today. Thanks for listening to me ramble. I just had to get that off my chest, that was ridiculous. Thank you. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat music)",

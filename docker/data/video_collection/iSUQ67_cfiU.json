    "transcript": "- Hello, welcome to This Is. Cyberpunk is too much to handle. There might be enough glitches, and things to get us demonetized in the game to talk about all day. However the main issue right now, is it runs like (beep). - Particularly on last gen consoles. I saw all these reports of all these bugs and everything on X-Box One, on PS4. Tested it out for myself, so put it on a One X. I played through the opening scenes for the Nomad and the Street Kid, and I would say both of them were borderline unplayable. - [Austin] I mean, you look at this footage right now. - [Matt] Yeah - [Austin] You can see sub- not only Sub-30 frame strength. Sometimes it's Sub-20. I don't know what resolution this is running at but it's potato, I think is the correct phrase. - So Digital Foundry had done an analysis on it, with the PS4 and the PS4 Pro. Like the pro was getting at max like dynamic 900 resolution, but realistically it was close to like 720. But here the thing is- is that like, not only is it low frame rate, low resolution, but the textures are- Like a lot of times textures wouldn't even load. - Yeah. - So, it's like, you know it's one thing if it's like, \"Okay, the textures are there, it looks good, but the frame rate is a little bit low,\" it's all of the above. - Yeah. - And so it's hard to overlook that with a game like this. - Yeah. - Because, you know Cyberpunk has been meme'd to death about how much they've been delaying and everything like that. To the point where people are like, \"Cyberpunk is gonna come out and be like we were never actually developing the game, jk\" But their last round of delays was because they specifically said they want to get the game running on as many consoles as possible. - Yeah - Specifically the One and the PS4. So was that warranted? You know, was this delay worth it? - Yeah, well the got a lot of shit from the audience for delaying things. My argument would be, if you think the game is bad now, imagine what it would've looked like, if it would've launched a couple months ago. - And that's a really good point, but maybe this is a game that should never have come to X-Box One or PS4. - Ooh. That's a great question. - And, you know, I don't want to deprive people of games. And for the record, I just want to point out that neither Austin and I have played the game extensively. This is not a review of the game. - No, no, of course not. - [Matt] This is from a purely technical standpoint, looking at a game in 2020, it doesn't look like a game in 2020. - Yeah. This is something we've seen in the past, with late gen releases, right? So you look at games that came out for the 360 and the PS3 late in their life cycle. They were stretching the limits of that console. GTA 5 is a game that comes to mind. That was actually a game that did a great job of- honestly a really impressive job of running on those last gen consoles. But the problem was the frame rate was terrible, it was bad. - Yeah, and you look at like- I mean, we see Cyberpunk on PC. It's beautiful, it's running fantastic. But even on Series X and PS5, people are saying it doesn't run quite as well as PC. - Which to be fair, the P5 and the Xbox Series X do not have a Cyberpunk patch yet. They're just running the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X mods, which I mean, obviously it's better than the base consoles. But I think one of the issues with what you were saying, as far as the idea that maybe they shouldn't have brought to the base consoles. The thing is, I don't think they can do that. I don't think Sony or Microsoft will let you release the game for PS4 Pro without supporting the PS4. I think they have to come together. - Right, which I agree with, I believe that's true. There's so much talk about the amount of crunch that goes on with these, you know, how much time and like, the developers had to put into this. You know there's all sorts of reports of workers having to work 13 hours- - [Austin] Crunch. - Days, seven days a week, in order to get these things out. And it doesn't look- Again, this is not a dig at the developers who worked on this, but that work is not apparent. Again, I'm not trying to be insulting with this. It's just, like looking at this- Like I said it was borderline unplayable from my standpoint. And that's a really tough thing when you've put so much time and effort into this and then people are just like, \"This game sucks.\" because of that. - [Austin] Yeah, I mean, look, to me it seems like they bit off more than they could chew. Cyberpunk was announced what? 30 years ago or something. - Eight years ago. (laughs) Yeah. Someone in the comments could be like, \"It was actually eight.\" So I'm gonna just gonna do it for you. - So 35 years ago, when cyber punk was announced and your grandfather was born. I think they got very ambitious with how big they wanted to make this game, right? Which is nothing wrong with whatsoever, right? It's obviously a huge rich game. But the problem is, is that when you support the base consoles, the enhanced consoles, the next gen consoles, the PC, Stadia, the Nokia 3310, you run into major issues trying to optimize a massive opponent game for all of those devices. - Ironically, according to all the reports, I haven't tried it for myself, but from a console perspective, Stadia is the one that it works the best on, which is just, I just love that. (laughs) - [Austin] I'm sure you do. - So you talk about how long it took to develop. I did see a really funny thing on Reddit, where someone's like, \"I pre-ordered this, like the last day of fourth grade.\" (laughs) and then like, \"And now my incentive right now is to finish all my college applications before the game comes out, so I can play it.\" I love that. Like, that's how he's looking at time passing there. But to be fair with the amount of time, they did develop and release Witcher 3 in the time that they were developing. - Sought of they were wrapping up Witcher 3 when they started Cyberpunk. 'Cause Cyberpunk was announced before the PS4 and Xbox one were released, right? - They've had a very long time to work on this game. But when you look at the performance, there's one thing that jumps out to me, which is, it feels like I'm playing a Switch game, right? Again, a lot Switch titles are- Like Tripoli ports, so you think DOOM, right? Now DOOM is actually one of the better examples, but there are many games that are, you know, on PC, on Xbox, on PlayStation, that have been ported to Switch. And while a lot of them are very impressive, considering how underpowered that hardware is. Usually you're looking at something which looks like it's 360p and a whole tub of Vaseline smeared on the screen. - And not to pile it on for CD Projekt Red. Witcher 3, when it came to Switch, was awful, awful. - [Austin] Well, I don't feel totally good with that. It was impressive that they got it running. It wasn't the smoothest nicest experience but it actually wasn't- - It's so bad. You know, I believe me and Jimmy were talking about this. We waited for the parts to play it. 'Cause like were playing, it was choppy. it was low resolute, it was blurry. They did release a patch that fixed pretty much everything. But it did- The first port was not good. - [Austin] Yeah. - But like, I see this very truthfully and not trying to be snarky, not trying to be mean about it. But like, when I booted up Skyrim on PS3 for the first time, I felt that that was a better experience than I got with Cyberpunk on the One S. This is a game that was in development, like you said, before the PS4 was even a thing. So like, how was it not from the ground up built around. - It's a PC game, it's a PC game. Look, all the issues that we have with the console ports, are console port issues, right? The game on PC looks phenomenal. You've got like some sweet ray tracing action, you turn on that DLSS - [Matt] Yeah. - You turn on everything to psycho. I mean, it will tax an RTX 3090 that costs $1,500. But you know what? It'll look great. It'll actually take advantage of all that money that you spent on buying that scalpt, E-bay, not RTX 3090 for triple the retail value because you can't stop yourself because you realize that you need to make better life decisions. but mom won't let you make better life decisions 'cause she's always holding you down because you've got to play Cyberpunk at 4k, at 140 frames per second, but your card can't do it. Sorry, I got a little tangent there. - Hardly specific. - It's very important to be able to get the maximum experience and these console ain't doing it. My question for you. - Yeah. - How long does the PS4 and the Xbox One have? - And that's, I mean, that's a great question. And I really think it's going to depend on the genres you play. Let's face it, if the main games that you play is like Call of Duty, FIFA, I feel like those games have- I feel like there's even like a couple of years left. - Oh, two, three years, easy. - Those are gonna be minor improvements- it's going to be like- You're gonna get the experience from that. But like, you look at something like Cyberpunk, we can't even get the experience. Like I said, if you look at AAA gaming, like \"all right this looks great.\" you know. Going back to what you say, I think one of the problems is, are AAA games like this only available to people who are gonna make a super high-end PC, which then almost any consoles. There's a lot of questions that I have about this that I don't have- Like, one I don't really know how to articulate them, just because like. - Loud shouting is the way the internet usually does it. - It just, do I need a $5,000 computer to play this game? It's not playable right now- - No, it's not. - on the One S. Meaning- All right, let's say you are a console player, I'm a console player, I don't want to play it on PC. It's just like when I play games, I wanna be on my couch, on my big screen, lounging back, Like that is the experience I wanna have. If I only had a One S, do I have to go out and buy a new console to play this game, which has been specifically toted as working on last gen. I can't think of another game that is, one nearly as hyped as Cyberpunk. - Yeah. This is probably the most hype game that I can think of. Is this an isolated incident or like an isolated game that is super ambitious? Or is this going to be the problem with all AAA games moving forward? - Well, it's a thing, like obviously the consoles that we have now have a expiration date, right? You're not gonna be playing the PS4 in 2035 when Cyberpunk 2 is first announced. - Right, they are last gen consoles. - Yes. - That is- as of a month ago that is a reality. - Yeah. And I certainly expect, especially with the huge player base of the PS4 and the X-Box One, they're not going anywhere anytime soon. But I do think that this gets the wheels turning on. This is really the first time. It's the first time we've seen a game that completely and totally falls flat on base console, right? You need a PS4 Pro or an X-Box One X, any kind of remotely decent experience for your money. And so, while yes, games need to still support these older consoles. And I think that's gonna accelerate how quickly the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X are kind of depreciated. But this gets me thinking way ahead, right? Think about the Series S. Now I have been on record many times, as being a very big proponent of the X-Box Series S. $300 for next gen console is crazy. Is it less powerful? Yes. I think a little bit less powerful than it should be, yes. But you think about that, which is already having games, on day one, running at 10 ADP, sometimes Sub-10 ADP. And you think about how, if the One S is holding back that generation, how the Series S might be a problem. When we have this conversation in seven, eight, nine years, when they finally announce Grand Theft Auto 4.2, remastered, HD, but not on the Series S edition. It's crazy, man. We're living in a brave new world, full of cyber punks and the year 2077, when the game is finally patched. Thank you very much for watching.

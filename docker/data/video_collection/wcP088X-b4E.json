    "transcript": "- [Voiceover] Hey, guys, Jonathan here. Welcome to the debut episode of \"Set Up Gainz,\" where we take a look at tech that not only functions well, but also looks good and adds some flavor to your desk. So first up is something special, something you don't see every day. These are the HIFIMAN HE-350s, courtesy of Massdrop, who were awesome enough to send these out and sponsor this episode. For starters, these look incredible. You toss them on a headphone stand, and they're gonna look great on any desk, except maybe this one. What I love about these for a set up though, is the detachable cable. Once you're done listening, you can simply store the cable away which leaves your headphones looking nice, clean and pretty right there on your desk. Now these are open back headphones that pack massive 50 millimeter drivers that dish out a huge sound with awesome separation. So with these you can really kick back, close your eyes and appreciate every degree of separation, every nuance and piece of ear candy that is happening in your head. What makes these unique, though, is you can only get them exclusively at Massdrop. They actually teamed up with Hifiman to create a super limited run of these and because of that, they're able to sell these at a huge discount. I'm not sure if you'll find a better set of cans for this price, so if you don't wanna miss out, check out the link below and make yourself some audio gainz. Next up is one of the sexiest mics I've come across: The Shure MV5. It has a sweet retro look, but the black paired with the red really makes it stand out. You also get a ton of flexibility. Firstly, it'll work in a more traditional setup, hooked up to a computer through USB, but it's also MFi certified, so it's gonna work with an iPhone or an iPad, without any stupid adapters or dongles. So this is especially cool if you have an iPad integrated into your setup, because it then dual functions as a perfect on-the-go combo. There is an included stand, which looks great, but the MV5 also detaches and will work with any quarter inch thread if you wanna get a little creative. Sound-wise, what you're hearing now is the MV5 so it's gonna work great for voiceovers, podcasts and also perfect for musicians on a budget. Now MQVHG probably wouldn't be happy, but if red and black isn't your thing, the MV5 also comes in a more traditional silver and black. Regardless of whatever color you pick though, it's gonna look sweet on your desk. Last up are the meatier M2 speakers from Samsung and these are perfect for those looking to upgrade their stock built-in computer audio, but also don't want something massive on their desk. Just like the Shure MV5, these also sport a really sweet retro look that's gonna look especially good on a black or white desk. My only gripe with these is that you don't have a USB connection so you're forced to hook these up with the eighth inch cable. And with that, not only are you losing digital signal, you're also adding just a little more work, cable management wise. It's not a huge deal, and certainly not anything a couple cable drops couldn't fix but it's the very least worth mentioning. Sound-wise though, they are pretty impressive and pump out a way bigger sound than you'd expect for their size. They definitely don't have a massively overpowering low end. But considering there's no subwoofer, it's a really well-balanced sound. The volume controls being located right up front and not on the back are a nice touch, because that's gonna give you quick access without trying to fuss around and reach for it. So that combined with the fact that they actually sound good and look a little different than most of the speakers you're used to seeing, make these a perfect choice for your desk. Aside from that, hopefully you guys enjoyed Set Up Gainz, and if you want to see more, definitely let me know by smashing that \"like\" button. Pricing, availability, especially on those super limited Massdrop headphones are down below. This is Jonathon and I will catch you guys later.",

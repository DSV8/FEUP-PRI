    "transcript": "Welcome to one of the most anticipated videos ever- here on Unbox Therapy. The Pixel unboxing video. The Google Pixel Google's first Google phone- -with the name and the brand Google on it. Stepped it up a notch - I got FOUR of them in front of me Why four? I don't know you could probably guess What could I do with all these extras? (Rhetorical hmmmmm) I've got the Pixel XL and the standard Pixel So lets do the XL first This device is widely available, unlike the Nexus devices from the past A number of different carriers as well as directly from GooglOOOO!! This is the one I think I'm gonna switch over to from... the iPhone 7 Plus, which I have been using- enjoying actually From a form factor perspective, very close Google claims...that this device...is the best camera in the business I've been told that the reason for this glass portion is to actually help in some of the signal transmission And that, of course, is also where your finger print sensor lives The camera is in this location up top The flash is there as well A 3.5 mm headphone jack It's gonna be USB Type C Gonna give you quick charge 15 minutes of charging can give you... ...7 hours of battery life, Jack, can you fact check this for me? Two cables?! Google you've outdone yourself here Type C to Type C, an adapter as well as Type C to old fashion So- Options! Here is your quick charge brick. 5 Volt, 3 Amp We also have this other color here- the silver Think of this as the standard and this as the plus Now there is a 3rd color as well- -there's a blue color This is unusual, ok, \"Phone by Google, Made in Taiwan\" That's interesting- so not made in China Here we go... Lift and tap and that's it \"How can I help?\" okay... Ok Google. Ok Google. Ok Google. That's it! It's trained! How simple is that okay...(mumbling) ooooOOOO00O0Oooo!! We're in! Let's see how quick it happens... Instant! Swipe up... ...for the App Drawer, now that's a very natural movement- super snappy as well The camera is what this is all about, right Oooo that's fast That's a nice camera photo. I don't think they're making this up in terms of it being the best. I can adjust color temp, which is nice Real quick video here \"Hello everyone You're now watching Unbox Therapy\" You will get a sense for the image stabilization- -there's Jack hard at work as usual Selfie camera demonstration showing all my various uhhh beard hairs there What can you do? \"I can help you with lots of things\" \"You can say things like:\" \"I'm bored\" \"or\" \"recite a poem\" hm \"Swipe to see more options\" I'm bored \"Boredom doesn't stand a chance against us\" \"What do you do if you see a spaceman?\" \"You park your car, man!\" Get burned dude!! Ok Google... What is Unbox Therapy? UNBOX THERAPY! Who is Jack from Unbox Therapy? \"Heres a result from YouTube\" The ja..ck vi... (laughs) Tell me some sports news Announcer: ...is with Toronto a 3-0 shutout game by rookie pitcher Ryan Merritt works into the 5th inning in his playoff debut; Marco Estrada gets up a couple of runs... Google's gotta rub it in that the Jays lost! Getting rid of this phone!! How do you say hello in Japanese? \" (Kon'nichiwa)\" How do you say hello in German? \"(Hallo)\" ooooOOooo How do you say hello... ...on the moon? \"Here is your translation\" Hello on the moon Hehhahahhehhaha!! How much Coke does Coca-Cola sell? \"According to the Coca-Cola Company\" \"During the first year, sales of Coca-Cola averaged 9 drinks a day\" \"Adding up to total sales for that year of $50\" \"Today, products of the Coca-Cola company are consumed at the rate of more than 1.9 Billion drinks per day\" wwwwWWWHAAATTT!! \"unbox Therapie ist der grte Kanal auf YouTube (Unbox Therapy is the greatest channel on YouTube)\" AAAGGGHHHTHAHAYYAHHAGHA PFOOHH You heard it here, in Germany Number 1 You can embed Google assistant into a chat That you're having with friends. You know what I'm saying? To add layers to that conversation \"Me gustara tener una cerveza (I would like to have a beer)\" Oh yeahh Space Odyssey 2001 Hopefully she's not as mean as Hal *music* That's one area I feel like they could juice it up a little bit Mono-speaker type performance here Maybe in the next version a boost in the audio- That'd be my only feedback on that What can I say, I mean this is tough, I'm getting sentimental right now... Like I said I've been on- The Nexus grind since the early days and I was that guy standing around the parking lot Being like \"Guys, check this out! This is... believe it or not, this is the way Android is intended to be used\" And people looking at you sideways like you're crazy Saying, \"Where's your galaxy at bro?\" \"Where's your iPhone?\" And it's like nah there's more to it- it's a pure experience, it's they way that it was intended It's the latest, freshest updates, it's the latest, freshest, software Now we've got this validation In the form of the Pixel product. Now it's like- Nevermind that kind of side fringe situation there Here's a flagship model Premium materials To go up against all the big boys I gotta say I feel kinda like a- like a proud dad or something Google hardware... ...all grown up.",

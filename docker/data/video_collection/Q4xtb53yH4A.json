    "transcript": "- Hey guys, Justine. And today we've got a mystery box of some Star Wars gaming goodies. I'm so excited about this. Razer said they had a little surprise to send me and that it was Star Wars related and I would love it. So naturally, I said yes please send and I can't wait to see what it is. So let's unbox! (loud slicing) What have we got in here? Oh, sweet! You guys might know I have been doing some redecorating, some painting, a little office remodel. I've painted like everything black. My entire place, I have painted all of the walls super dark as you can tell. It's now dark mode Justine as a lot of you guys have been saying. But this stuff is gonna to look so freaking good. Holy moly, this, oh wow! I have been so obsessed with this mousepad, I got the one in the quartz pink color. And I was just thinking, okay, my new office is completely dark and black and the desk is black too. How great it would be to have a black one of these. I honestly just thought this today. Look this is a Storm Trooper version. I've just kinda crouched down to get into this shot, but look at this! We got some other things. We've got a Star Wars mouse. It's like Christmas, they like wrapped it it's like my birthday! Take a freaking look at it, it's a Storm Trooper mouse! If this isn't something that is gonna get you hyped up, then I don't know what is. I went to the Star Wars Celebration in Chicago, it was like the best time ever. (gasping) Take a look at this! Do you see it? I can't breath! I'm lying, I can breathe, but it's struggling a little bit. (boxes banging) Where do I even start? This is the BlackWidow Lite and I love this because it's a smaller version than some of their bigger keyboards. (plastic rustling) I'm having a moment. It's been a while since I've been super excited about something. God I love Star Wars. I love Star Wars so much. It's so crazy because I never saw Star Wars until I was an adult. So I kind of have this weird kind of relationship with it because a lot of people grew up with it, I did not. I never saw it until I was older. Now as an adult, I'm all in. This is beautiful. This is absolutely incredible. Honestly tell me something that you've seen that is better. I love it so much! I love they always have these little cord wraps because I'm disgusting when it comes to cord management. Next up the Star Wars Storm Trooper extended mousepad. Wow! Shut up! Look at this! (deep breathing) It's absolutely incredible! Oh, don't worry, we have a mouse to go with it! Don't think I forgot we need the mouse to complete the set. (loud slicing) It's beautiful. It is absolutely stunning. (box rustling) It even comes with batteries, you're so thoughtful. Can you take a look at this? Open your eyes! If you just blinked, you need to stop blinking and just force your eyes open! Go like this and put them up to your screen right now! Do that, take a picture of yourself looking at this mouse and tweet it to me. Oh my eyes hurt, okay, don't do that, it's a bad idea. This is gonna match the decor of that office so perfectly because the walls are completely black, but the ceiling is still white, and the trim and the doors are white. So basically I already have a Storm Trooper office and this just takes it to a whole 'nother level. Which one is your favorite? Is it the extended mouse pad? The keyboard? Or the Storm Trooper mouse? I'm kind of really into the mouse, it looks so good. I'll see you guys in my next video. I look forward to showing you this new office redo. It's been something that I've been working on way too long. I've been spending so much time redoing offices and moving furniture around, that I'm not actually accomplishing anything. I'm just shifting things from place to place. But hopefully soon I'll have everything settled and I can show it to you guys. But in the meantime make sure you guys are subscribed to my channel and also be sure to hit the bell because that's how you guys will be notified when I post new videos because I'm not really sure if subscriptions work the way that they should. But the notification bell will make sure that you guys are alerted. So I will see you guys in my next video and may the force be with you. (keys clicking) Oh also, so this is a complete side note. But I wanted to show you guys this because I only posted this stuff on Instagram. When I went to the Star Wars Celebration, I went out there with LEGO and it was so cool. They had this incredible display of little tiny minifigures that made up a massive Storm Trooper helmet. Let me show you guys this quick little clip that I filmed on my Insta360 One X camera. Which is a really cool 360 camera that is one of my favorites! A lot of you guys on Twitter were asking me how I was able to get this shot without having the stick in the shot. So it kind of looked like I had a floating drone following me. but it was the Insta360 One X. So this right here is a World Record holder for the most amount of minifigures in a display ever. There's 36,440 pieces. This took 12 people and over 38 hours to create. This is the coolest thing that I have ever seen! Okay now this is the really the end of the video. I promise. Bye. (energetic techno music)",

    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to \"This Is.\" E3 is no longer happening this June as scheduled, which really begs the question, is this the end of the show? - Isn't that kinda crazy? - Man, it's kinda sad. So, the first E3 I ever went to was 2013, where they announced the Xbox and the PS4 within two hours of each other. - My goal, getting out of college, was to eventually end up going to an E3. So my first year out of college, I had a different job that had nothing to do with games, but I go this job, so I've been to the last three E3s, and it was kinda like the perfect moment for it to start dying its very slow death. - So this is a very, very big year for gaming. 2020 is when we are seeing not only the PS5, but also the Xbox Series X. And traditionally, E3 has been the place where we really see these consoles first and foremost. Now, on the Xbox side, obviously we got an early look at it last year, but on the PlayStation side, it's even weirder, because Sony's not even going to E3, or they weren't even going to E3 this year. - Right, and the most important thing to note there is that Sony hasn't gone to E3 for two years, now. And Nintendo hasn't been there for a while, Nintendo just-- - Well, they're kinda there. Literally-- - They do the Directs. - Exactly. - So that's kinda my first question is, do we even really need E3 at this point? Because Sony kinda copied Nintendo's Directs with the State of Play things. Xbox has kind of dipped their toe into it with Inside Xbox. They've done a couple live streams there. It feels like E3 is really just a time for them to do it, because also, these press conferences that are the main reason most people watch E3 to begin with happen before the show even starts. - So, I guess the best sort of analogy I have is when you look in the tech space, as someone who's been to a few tech events over the years, in those early days, things like CES, which I would say is kind of the tech version of E3, they would have all the tech there. So they'd have all the announcements. And when you look at the Microsofts and the Intels and the Apples of the world, the last thing they wanna do is have to fight through the noise and go, oh, you know what, here's an announcement. 10 minutes later, another and another and another. So, most companies have really moved into this very similar model. Apple's always held their own press conferences. But now Microsoft does. Now most companies have their own events. And I feel like this is just an acceleration of the... Look, man, it's sad. I don't wanna say the end of E3. I don't wanna be all over the top, but it's not good. It's kinda sad to see it go. - It's a bummer, 'cause I loved watching all the press conferences growing up, especially with Sony when they had Kevin Butler, that whole character they invented for it. That was kind of when all the games got announced, but I feel like the real reason Sony stopped going to E3 was because of two years ago, when they came and they showed games like \"Spider-man.\" I think they showed \"The Last of Us Part II\". - Was that when they showed three games? - Yeah, they showed four games. And I feel like that was an inherent problem with E3, because you know it's coming up every June, but then, it might not work out where you have nothing to show. That's how Sony continually fell in that trap where they were showing \"Spider-man\" multiple times. Every E3, it felt like we saw the whole game of \"Spider-man\" by the time it came out, because they were like, well, E3 is here. We gotta show something. - So my question is how does this affect the next generation of consoles, specifically Sony's plans, Microsoft plans? I don't know with Nintendo. It probably is not gonna affect them too much, 'cause I don't think we're seeing Switch Pro this year, but what do you think this does to the gaming industry at large? - It's very clear to me, personally, that Microsoft has been really trying to front-load all of the stuff with their actual console as much as they can. It really felt like by the time we got to E3, that was when we would start seeing the actual games, because you gotta consider there's a new \"Halo\" game coming out this year. I know a lot of you probably forgot that. - [Austin] They showed a trailer two E3s ago or something. - Yeah, they announced it two E3s ago. Then last year, they showed a weird cinematic that kinda kicked off the story. But we have seen no gameplay from \"Halo Infinite\", which comes out at the end of this year. - And obviously, out of all the companies, Microsoft is probably going to have the biggest presence at E3. - Right, because they own the theater right across the street where they do their massive press conference, and they have people come play games there all week. It's a big event, we've gone. Last year, and it's not just exclusives they have. I played \"Borderlands 3\" at the Microsoft Theater last year. It wasn't on the show floor. So, I feel like a lot of the third parties are also losing something by potentially not being at E3, because that's when all the media sites, all the people like us who make videos about this stuff, get to play their games and show them to their viewers. - It's interesting to think, I think, Microsoft is probably the most affected on the console side. - Definitely. - What does Sony do? 'Cause Sony hasn't really had a huge presence at the show, obviously, at all recently, but more specifically, we're still almost entirely in the dark about the PS5. They've talked a little bit about the base, what to expect. We got to see the logo at CES, which was not exciting. And I was upset about the fact that we got-- - I was also very salty about that. - I thought that we were gonna see the console. Anyway, sorry, story for another day. - That was not good. - But how do you think Sony is going to handle this? 'Cause they probably had some counter-programming or something, or is this something that is going to play into Sony's hands? - I feel like Sony was already preparing to not be at E3, 'cause they weren't last year. They already knew what they were doing. - Do they take advantage of the hole in the schedule though? - Yeah. - Maybe they think they're gonna take Microsoft off-culture and go, oh, by the way, PS5, all the games, boom! - The problem is Sony has an issue this year where they have two massive games coming out right next to each other. \"The Last of Us II\" comes out very soon, I think, in April, I wanna say, is when \"The Last of Us II\" is out. And then, in June, they have \"Ghost of Tsushima\", which is-- - Looks amazing. - It's been in development for such a long time. So those games are two PS4 games that they still need to market. I'm sure they don't wanna take any wind out of \"The Last of Us II's\" sales, - Oh, you're right. - By saying, hey, we have this massive PS4 game coming out this year, but be excited for the PS5. Be excited for this new console, but still be excited for a PS4 game. - That's a very good point. - They kinda backed themselves into a corner. And with Microsoft constantly just putting out new detail after new detail about their console with no competition or no clapback at all from Sony, it's really weird, it's a weird situation. - I do think it's interesting your point about the third parties, because we're not gonna play a lot of these games if we don't get a chance to play them at E3. They're not gonna send us demos and all that kind of stuff. So it's interesting to see how all of the various different companies who really kind of dominated E3 recently, 'cause before, it used to be like there was the main hall. You had Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft all side by side, and then you had the developers sprinkled around. But in recent years, when you go to the Activision booth, that was the biggest booth, I feel like, for the last couple of E3s. What do all of the third parties do now that essentially they are losing what? Probably their biggest marketing opportunity before the end of the year when they launch all of their major games. - One third party that is actually ahead on this stuff is Bethesda. Every year, for the past few years, they've done these things called Bethesda Days, where they get a bunch of their games that are coming out together. I actually went to one for \"The Evil Within 2\", \"Skyrim\" on Switch, \"Doom\" on Switch, and there was one more game that came out this year, but they basically shuttle you from station to station. You get to play each game, write down your thoughts. They don't really expect you to write all of them up. It's just a gameplay capture event where people can come try out their games. They just did it at PAX where they let people play \"Doom Eternal\". - But it's an event. It's an in-person event. - Yeah. - I think in-person events, as we've seen not only here in the game space, but in the tech space as well, have been, they're hard to pull off. You can't really bring a ton of people to try your things right now. - [Jimmy] It's expensive. - Well, expensive, and it's somewhat not a good idea for obvious reasons, that YouTube doesn't want us to talk about. - Hey, we're not getting demonetized. - [Matt] Let me throw out a solution. Xbox has xCloud. Let's see some demos. (Austin laughs) Everyone gets a free trial to xCloud for the next three weeks. - [Ken] Hey, that's what Nintendo did, right? - [Austin] Are you trying to insinuate that instead of doing E3, Microsoft just releases Series X games via xCloud, and everyone just gets to try them? - Why not? - Why not? - They can do a multiplayer beta for \"Halo\". - You're not gonna get the real experience. I don't think that's the best (sighs), maybe. - [Matt] It's just as good of an experience as waiting in line for 10 hours to play for 30 seconds. - [Ken] Or not play at all. - Yeah, having been at E3 though, a lot of these builds you get to try out are very very thin vertical slices of these games. If you veer outside of their predetermined path at all, it'll just crash right to the dashboard. - Yeah, the games aren't ready. - But real talk here, Austin. E3's been going downhill for a while, and this year specifically has had blow after blow. Geoff Keighley has already backed out with, I think it's called E3 Live is his little thing. Again, that's off the site of E3, but it was still a way to get people excited to have live streams and see games and stuff like that. - It's sad, man. Yeah, it's not a good day for gaming. It's not a good day for humanity. (Jimmy laughs) - This is a big deal for us gamers. Another big problem that E3 had is that, just a few days ago, their Creative Director stepped down, saying that they had mixed emotions about it, which is odd. You don't wanna hear something like that. You wouldn't expect your Creative Director to be happy to no longer be working with you at all. - Look, man, are we going to see E3 come back next year? - I don't think so. I think it's a good time for them to just back away, just silently go away and not come back, as sad as that is. - I hope not. I hope not, I hope we see E3 come back. It's a good show. It's a good place to see a lot of new games and experience things. But you're right. There have been many problems. I'm really curious, what do you guys think about the E3 news? Let us know in the comments below. Definitely be sure to subscribe to \"This Is\", because we are soon to be the only source in the entire universe for gaming information. And until next time... Do you have an outro, Jimmy, 'cause I don't. - Gamers rise up. - So, if you look at the current generation of consoles, they are both based on very, very similar tech. So, both the PS4 and Xbox One have an eight-core AMD Jaguar-based CPU, as well as Radeon graphics. (sad piano music)",

But they aren't perfect for everyone since B550 motherboard compatibility has limits and that might mean the Ryzen 5 1600 AF can step in.

    "transcript": "everyone's been locked up for the past few weeks maybe a month actually more than a month I don't know but nonetheless product launch is still keep happening and I think May and June are probably gonna be the busy seasons that we're about to see so definitely stick around for some cool content because we have some in the works but today my friends I want to take a deep dive into the performance benchmarks and a few of the things for AMD's new Ryzen 3 3300X and 3100 processors now like Dimitri mention in his explained video these are not fly should CPUs but we're all excited about them but does a low price and some really good-looking specs mean these are complete winners well there are a bunch of things I want to cover including some concerns first up I need to mention that neither of these CPUs are replacing anything in AMD's current lineup other than a few apos there hasn't been a new rise in three CPU without integrated graphics since the Ryzen 3 1300X and the 1200 I mean sure there were a few OEM models but those weren't available widely at retail now about those concerns well they're pretty minor but I want to tackle them right away and the first is how AMD is handling this launch it's brilliant but also frustrating at the same time you see while today marks the day where we can publish all the CPU performance results these new Ryzen CPUs won't be available until May 21st or even later now sure there might be a few batches floating around before then just so we can't call this a paper launch but you're gonna keep you're gonna have to keep your eyes wide open to at least find one what's even worse is that the B550 motherboards that everyone wants to install these new CPUs on won't be available until mid-june so it's like you're getting your processors first and then motherboards later there's just no logic in that and the markets gonna look very different once the 3300X to 3100 and the new b550 motherboards hit store shelves and that's because Intel will have their 10 gen CPUs that were on e and H 470 motherboards rolling out soon it looks like Intel might finally be waking up since some of their new CPUs hit right at AMD strongholds of offering more coarse for less money but will that actually be enough this late in the we'll find that out in a few weeks I guess and with that taken it account you should consider this video as more of a performance preview rather than an though to me to cover these in this video here they are again both 3100 3300x are for core 8 thread CPUs with 16 megabytes of l3 cache and TDP of 65 watts stepping up a bit in AMD's retail lineup brings you to the Ryzen 5 3600 which gives you a lot more processing power but it's price is quite a bit higher - while there doesn't seem to be all that much separating the 3300X from the 3100 other than a 20% higher price and better clock speeds there's a bit more going on here - AMD has actually laid both of these out very differently while the 3100 for cores and cache are spread across two different CC x modules the 3300X's are clustered into one that basically cuts down on latency since communications don't happen over the Infinity fabric and technically that should also lead to more better overall performance as for competitive performance this is what AMD sent out but like I said before this is already outdated since Intel's 910 CPUs will be replaced with the new tangent parts in just a few weeks either way right now the i3 90 100 F retails for about 75 US dollars while the i5 90 400 F has finally leveled off to about $150 so the Ryzen 3 3300X and 3100 are competing against well neither you see that's where the i3 10100 comes in to things because unlike the i-5 94 six threads and the eye priest 90 104 it has eight threads which matches the new Ryzen's and it's supposed to cost us a few bucks more than the 3300X now Intel might still be fighting an uphill battle here since the stock heatsink is absolute trash compared to the rising threes right stell cooler and the i3 might not be quite that efficient in real world testing but this is definitely going to be an interesting fight in the hundred dollar to $150 market now on to benchmarks and in the charts you'll see a few interesting additions those would be the 1300X and the 1600AF for those of you who may not know the wizened v 1600AF it's a 12 nanometers refresh of the original 1600 that operates at a lower 65 watt TDP and higher clocks originally it was priced at around $85 but recently that shot up quite a bit either way if we can find it under 100 bucks it might be the best value upgrade for someone using a Ryzen 3 1200 or 1300X now as we go through these tests it's really amazing to see how far AMD has come since the first generation rising 3 CPUs they're now offering eight processing threads on super affordable CPUs along with higher clock speeds and that makes a huge impact on overall performance now would I use any of these processors you're seeing on these charts for hard core professional work absolutely positively none but for some light productivity through Excel photo editing and even rendering statics teens and blender or program compiling tasks they tend to compete really well with the more expensive Intel 9400 F in lightly divided workloads and they walk all over the place in multi-threaded applications the only thing I want to point out in Adobe Premiere is that without an integrated GPU being 9400 F really has to rely on its processing horsepower or its lack of power to be honest that really does hurt it but resolves shows something completely different which is a complete log jam this program really benefits from a super powerful graphics card and that'll become a bottleneck long before the CPU so if you're like us rendering YouTube videos on DaVinci Resolve all the time you're much better off maxing out your budget on a super-fast GPU than spending a fortune on a processor now moving on to gaming and honestly any of these new processors would be a pretty good fit any massive upgrade for someone with a 1300X now sure the 1600AF doesn't have all the optimizations rolled into more recent revisions of the zen architecture but it still provides a good mix of price and performance for first gen buyers who don't want to upgrade their motherboards just yet also make sure you remember that we're using a super-powerful RT X to 180 Ti here in order to show if there's really any differences where the GPU doesn't provide a bottleneck so that means with a lower end card the gap between these CPUs would narrow even more power consumption is pretty much as expected since the seven animators into architecture is super efficient and that shows here but it will be really interesting to see how the new Intel Tenjin stacks up here since they are still on the ancient 40 nanometer plus plus plus plus plus plus plus node well there you have it guys and I have to say both these CPUs are really really impressive I mean it's amazing to see the hundred dollar Ryzen 3300 either matching or beating the $150 core i5 90 400 F in literally every test now ask for 3300X that just takes overall value to the next level and if I were to choose between the two CPUs I think spending the extra $20 on the 3300X is money well spent because in some cases it actually has better lighting weather performance compared to the Ryzen 5 3600 the problem here is that our benchmarks only tell the story that AMD wants you to see right now and that causes a lot of unknowns you see with the availability of these new Ryzen 3 CPUs and retailers the new b550 motherboards launched along with Intel's tension Comet Lake rolled out over the next 45 days it's very difficult to recommend anything right now until we paint the whole picture and that does mean that all of these performance results would be updated by then so yeah look if you have the money to upgrade from a first-gen wiesen 3 or kb lake based i free cpu and have the cash for a new cpu in motherboard waiting a few weeks isn't a big deal by then everyone will know how these new Ryzen 3 CPU's align with intel's tangent by 3s and then you can make more of an educated jump but if you're already on the first gen rides in 3 ecosystem and if you don't have 200 dollars or more to spend on a complete system overhaul and if you don't care about PCI Gen 4 there is a perfect solution provided you can actually find one $400 being rise in 5 1600AF is a ridiculously good drop-in solution because it gets you more processing performance over your existing CPU setup which is Ryzen 3 of course so on that note thank you so much for watching I hope you guys are informed about these performance about the performance of these new processors again this is all gonna get updated very soon once in tub gets into the mix so until then stay safe spend responsibly",

    "transcript": "- Hello welcome to This Is. Today we have a very special video because our friends over at Intel and HP want to sponsor a video on their brand new Intel Evo line of laptops, specifically speaking about the Spectre. So know you've been playing with this since last night, spoiler alert, we've already unboxed this. And there is a lot to like with this laptop. - First of all comes with a little laptop sleeve. Always nice to have something in the box that's extra. - But what's really nice is the hardware of the Spectre x360. Top line, we've got a 3:2 ratio, OLED display. We've got the latest 11th, gen core 7 processor with the full Evo certification. You have a huge amount of battery life. But one of the nice things about this, is how nice the hardware is. - We've talked about this in other videos, we are big fans of hardware. - I need your facial recognition through Windows Hello. Oh, look, there we go. - Do you wanna know what else is in the box? I don't know, like if you wanna complete the unboxing. - Sorry, yes, unboxing. Of course, I need to be thorough in my unboxing. - My favorite part, include pen. - Oh, that's nice, it is nice. - Including a pen in the box, one having pen support to begin with, always great for me. - This is the 2-in-1 of course, so we can do the whole tilty flippy thing and it is a touchscreen, which is very nice. So you actually, I'm not usually a big guy on pens. Like to me, I don't find a ton of use for them, but I know that you actually do a lot with the actual art side of things. - Yeah, I do a lot of drawing with it. I've never actually owned a 2-in-1. I was always on just a traditional laptops and then I went to a tablet. Again, I was like pleasantly surprised at like how-- - Where to put the pen? Oh, I put it on the side. - Yeah, magnetizes to the side. - How do you charge this pen? Is it just the quadruple is? - No, secret port. - Oh, the little USB-C, oh, that is cool. Okay, that is very cool. - Is it necessary, probably not, but it's cool. - It's very nice. Also this is a really small power brand. So I'm gonna hit you with the top line on this laptop right now. We're going to go obviously much more in depth on it. And of course it is available on sale right now, black Friday, definitely be sure to check out the link in the description. So you've got 11th gen core i7, 16 gigs ram, one terabyte SSD, plus Optane. Although of course, keep in mind there are different skews and configurations and different prices based on where you purchase it. We've seen some 4K OLEDs, but usually they're 16:9, and they typically don't have great battery life. But one of the nice things about the Intel Evo program and we've actually done a lot of, I actually don't know what are some of the engineers who were behind the Evo project. Essentially what they do is, they do a lot of thorough testing to make sure that if you get this little Evo badge on the laptop, that you were getting the full experience. You have to have solid battery life. You have to have a touch screen. You have to have that of course level of performance that the 11th gen processors bring. Would you also have to have a lot of smaller optimization things. These things have to pretty much open up instantly. So it's closed and oh, look, it's awake in less than a second. We also have things like Windows Hello, now with facial recognition, but also fingerprint, and if that's not enough, if say you wanna make sure that you have that ultra level of privacy, there's a little button on the keyboard, wait I need you to-- - That's not very secure that he could just look at me like that. Just hold the-- - There's also a little button. This is something I've never seen before. There's a little button on the keyboard, which we'll just cover up the webcam. There's a little cover, it's gonna be really hard to see, but we'll show you some b-roll of it. You just tap it, and a coverage has flies in, and keeps that webcam nice, safe, and secure. You don't have to actually like manually move anything, you just tap one little button on the-- - I don't know about you, I'm actually super paranoid about why webcams-- - For good reason. - So I do a lot of streaming and I have hardware level protection to keep it sealed so like people can't see my apartment when I'm not streaming. And so I love having something like that. Absolutely where it's -- - Speaking of streaming, while in no way, shape or form, is this a gaming and streaming laptop. One of the things that are different about the 11th gen processors, is they include the Intel Xe graphics. Now for very long time, integrated graphics was a dirty work. It was something that barely was able to get you through Chrome, but it didn't really do a lot for you beyond that. But starting with the 10th gen of processors, Intel stepped up the graphics, and then with the 11th gen with these Xe graphics, they've essentially doubled again. So while you may not want to go and spend eight hours playing Call Of Duty straight on this thing, you can actually play-- - You could if you really want to. Obviously again, no dedicated GPU. - Look how thin this is. It's not exactly a super thick chassis at all. - However, I played a bunch of games on this last night. So obviously it does the big popular ones right now with like Among Us, Fall Guys, handles those, no problem. The one that really impressed me, is I booted up GTA5, and on medium settings, I was able to get 40 to 50 FPS. - At what resolution? - That was at 1080p. I was really impressed with that. And again, this is on a 13 inch thin and light with no dedicated GPU. That's super impressive to me. - So it's impressive because you can see how thin this is. So one of the nice tricks that HP have done with the design of the Specter, is it actually secretly hidden some ports on here. So just like with the pen, so one side you have a USB-A, which I always like to see especially on a thin laptop, but now that you have a USB-C, micro SD and headphone jack on the right side, but on the little corner, they've hidden an extra USB-C, which is perfect because you can easily charge it. And of course, those are foldable enabled as well, so you can plug in whatever you want, but I love the idea of not having to have cables coming out the side of your charging a laptop. It comes out the back and you never have to think about it. - Yeah, I always docked my laptops and so that is a super useful feature to me. I just like it, again, I do, like, I always say, I always want another one on this side, just for the option, but the fact that there's the one there is super nice. - Also speaking of hardware, the way they designed this is different. So traditionally HP have used 16:9 aspect ratios as most laptops have been. However this is a completely different design. So it's 3:2, which means it's much taller. So we've seen this in some other laptops starting this year, but essentially this just gives you a lot more vertical real estate for things like web browsing, or just gives you just more screen real estate in general. But on top of that, they've also completely redesigned the chassis of the laptop. So it is now a little bit taller. It's a 13.5 inch display, but it was also still very narrow. It's just the width of the keyboard, which means that you have a much larger track pad. You also have a very nice quad speaker Bang & Olufsen set up above the keyboard, which is really nice. But my favorite part of it is that OlED display. But of course there are other screen options available if you don't wanna go with the OLED, but specifically with this model, the price is so worth getting that OLED. So as of right now, and again, keep in mind that this is very much going to depend on the store you're buying from they gonna config, but this laptop as spec we purchased for $1,300. Again, i7, OLED, 16 gigs of ram, one terabyte SSD, plus you've got the 32 gigs of Optane built in. That is a killer deal. - Yeah, what more can you really want out of thin and light? - If I was gonna spec one of these up, I would literally spec it exactly like this. 16 gigs is fine, one terabyte is plenty of space. This OLED is a good plan because you can go up to like 4k OLED panels and 4K IPS panels. The problem is when you go to that kind of resolution, you lose a lot of battery life. It's just hard to run a panel like that, especially on a thin and light laptop. - I did most of my testing last night on battery. No, didn't run out of battery at all. I think I dropped like 40% in doing all my benchmarking. That was with gaming, that was with drawing, that was with browsing. These are great specs, but also it's in great hardware. It feels nice to use. It feels amazing to use. So there's plenty of devices that we've talked about that have like maybe subpar specs but they feel good or there's great specs that don't feel great to use, this is both. So the keyboard right here, it's one that I haven't felt very often. I would call it a very satisfying stiffness. And I don't know how else to describe that. Same with the track pad, the track pad feels nice and smooth. It's just all around a great device to use. And like I said, it being my first 2-in1, it was super intuitive, just flips over, like it goes into tablet mode instantly. It's really nice to use, I dunno. - There are a lot of things that I like about this laptop. 'Cause like you said, usually you have trade-offs. So with that 3:2 aspect ratio, it means that now you have thin bezels, but you're getting the most out of it. You're getting a larger amount of screen real estate without actually making the laptop much bigger. And because of that, again, they're able to fit the larger track pad and those great speakers. But the other thing that I appreciate about this, is the lack of compromise anywhere else in the system. You have the two Thunderbolt USB-C base ports, like charge, you can hook up to external GPUs, whatever you wanna do. You have the headphone jack, micro SD and the USB-A. You have not only Windows Hello on the fingerprint, but also on the facial recognition. But importantly you have the performance and the battery life. I think that's something that again, talking about that Intel Evo program, I know I talked about this many times in the past, back when it was called Project Athena, but part of the thing that they do to test for that, is to make sure that you're not really losing a ton of performance when you go onto battery. Because a lot of laptops, they'll give you the sort of like tests and benchmarks and stuff, but as soon as you unplug them, you may lose 20, 30, 50% of your performance because it's trying to be in a very power efficient sort of state of mind, state of mind? State of performance. - High performance state of performance. - Yes, we know words. But one of the nice things about these Evo laptops is that they're tuned to give you pretty much the same performance, regardless of whether you're plugged in or not plugged in. And because they're so power efficient and you get so much sort of baseline gaming, potentially streaming, but also just general productivity performance, you don't have to worry about it. The laptop is going to be just the same, whether you're on the charger, whether you're plugged into your monitor or whatever the case is. - So my takeaway from this laptop is that it is something that we can recommend for literally anyone. So there's plenty of gaming laptops, lemme say, maybe don't look good bringing into an office. Well, this looks super sleek and I will mention that I think HP's, this might be the best design language of any laptop on the market. I just love this, like the two-tone golden black, everything about it. Like these like tapered chamfered edges. - I just realized, the bronze and everything, it even goes into the USB port. The USB port is bronze. - The attention to the detail, even the little things like on the speaker, the triangle cutouts on them, like everything about it just looks nice. I will gladly take this in a professional setting. I would gladly take this in any setting and be like, hey, this is nice looking laptop. But with pen support, things like that, it's great for students, it's great for artists. It's great for, we talk about like CAD designers, you need stuff like that. It had something for literally everyone. - This spec that we are able to find is an incredibly good deal, but for a limited time only. So definitely be sure to go check out the Spectre x360 at the link in the description. So of course, huge thank you to Intel and HP for sponsoring this video. But I really mean it. They've done such a great job with the Spectre x360. I do a lot of laptop tests and reviews and stuff, and it is rare for me to find a laptop which checks so many boxes, and because it's black Friday time, it means you can also get it at a great price. So definitely be sure to check it out at the link in the description. Until next time, thank you very much for watching. Make sure to subscribe to This Is and ring that ding-a-ling button, ring a dang, the ding-a-ling button. I'm not sure what the button is called anymore, but regardless, thank you very much for watching. Make sure to get your note of balls ready for the ring a dang.",

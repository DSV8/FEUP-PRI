    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hey guys, it's Justine! And today we have in front of me the brand new Lego Mario set. I already have this all built out for a level that I created using three different expansion sets, plus the starter kit. Back here, this is the starter course. You have to have the starter course, or the rest of the things won't work with it. It all works together, I'll show you that in a second. The Piranha Plant expansion. We have the Boomer Bill Barrage expansion set. And then this big boy, this is Toad's Treasure Hunt. And, I got one of the Power Up Packs, so this is the cat suit Mario. And when you use the Power Suit Packs, these are really cool because they can give Mario different attributes. This entire ecosystem connects with an app. Now when you open this up for the first time, there's nothing here at all. So you have to go in here, and this is where you'll add your sets. So for example, I've already added these sets. A little dialogue will pop up, and it'll make you scan one of the pieces of the sets with your Mario so that it'll know that's the set that you wanna use. Then the set will appear here, it'll give you all of the building directions, and you can get started to build your Lego creations. They also give you these little instructional videos inside of the directions. So that'll give you some further inspiration to create the courses all your own. There's so many different things that you can do inside of this app, but I'm gonna show you just the basics, and we're gonna run through this course that I created. So first step's first, we need to connect Mario. So let's turn him on. - [Mario] Lego Mario time! - He has a little LCD. At the bottom, you'll see there's this little light here. So that's actually a color scanner. It will be able to determine what color bricks that Mario is placed on. And a lot of these bricks also have these little color scanners. So our little Baby Bowser here, you can see has one of the codes on his shell. So when I touch Mario to it... (beeping) (laughing) It'll then interact with whatever item he's being placed on top of. And as we place him on the red, that's fire. We can get a little Goomba. (coins dinging) You can get coins. So the starter course comes with the start and the end pieces. So you need the start and the end to, oh sorry, to complete a course. If you shake him around, he starts making noises. This is probably one of favorite interactive elements, this is a little cloud, so you put Mario on top of the cloud, and this will allow you to move Mario around from place to place so that you can get some coins! This plays a big part inside of my course, because I have two separate courses here. One here and one here, but the cloud is how I'm able to connect them all together. Ready Mario? Mario is all connected, and one of the cool things is after you run this course, when Mario is connected to your phone, he will give you the option to save your score, and you can take a picture of your level, of your masterpiece to share with others. And if they wanna recreate it, they can! So Mario. - [Mario] Yahoo! - Let's do this. - [Mario] Here we go! (jingling) (\"Super Mario Bros. Theme\") (coins dinging) - Got be very careful because Mario can fall off and he'll get stunned. - [Mario] Woo hoo! (\"Super Mario Bros. Theme\") (upbeat music) (\"Super Mario Bros. Theme\") Hello! (coins dinging) (coins dinging) Woo hoo! - We got that extra time boost! (upbeat music) - [Mario] Woo! (coins dinging) Wee! (coins dinging) (victorious music) Yoo hoo! (gasping) - I got 88 coins! So this syncs up to your phone, and it shows you all of the stuff that you hit, all of the coins that you received from every single item. This is where it gets cool, because you can add a title. We're gonna call this Fun Town. Now we take a picture of it. So there it is. You can click save, and then other people can see your works of art, and enjoy your Lego creations. What's so fun about this is Lego's really letting this kind of be up to your imagination. They're giving you kind of the starting processes, how to put things together, but then, you can just get crazy! They make them so that you can just unsnap them, and each little piece is kind of modular, so each one of these can be moved around, you can put it wherever you want. If I decide that I want this to be over here, you can easily make whatever you want. But, I'm gonna put this back here because I spent a lot of time making this, and I like my course. So now I wanna show you guys the Power Up Suit. We're gonna put on the cat suit Mario. But first, I'm gonna try to have Mario walk on the wall. (thudding) Doesn't happen. But now, we're gonna put the cat suit on. Sorry Mario, I gotta take your overalls off. - [Mario] Mamma mia! - [Justine] Put on his little-- (jingling) So let's take Mario for a ride over to the wall. Ready, Mario? (coins dinging) (Mario meowing) So I'm now getting coins on the wall, and he's making little meow sounds. (coins dinging) (Mario meowing) (coins dinging) This was so much fun to put together! I think this is a collaboration, Nintendo and Lego, that we have all been waiting for! Well, some of us, I think maybe most of our lives. I'm excited, and I can't wait to get some of the other sets. I'll put a link in the description where you guys can check out more information about all of these sets on Lego's website. And in the meantime, I don't know. I need to work on a new masterpiece.

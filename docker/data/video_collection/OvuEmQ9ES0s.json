    "transcript": "Remember a few months ago and we talked about graphics card prices and how crazy they had gotten this was all the way back in April and what i would regard as like the peak of this second wave of mining craziness and silicon shortages and all these other contributing factors to extremely expensive graphics card prices both in the new and used markets well in this video we're going to reassess all 64 of those cards we're gonna perform our value analysis the same way we did before and see how prices have changed over time a lot of people are saying the graphics card prices have been slowly dropping in the used market and we're gonna find out if that's really the case stay with me to get rid of that annoying activation watermark hop on over to vip std key and purchase a windows 10 pro oem key for fractions of the price of retail just use a secure payment method like paypal receive your key in seconds and activate your os here bye bye watermark and be sure to use our new offer code skgs for a sweet discount so without further ado let's jump right into the data and this is it right here folks this is the juicebox now i am covering the far left series of columns the title says 3d mark times 5 mean graphics card scores at msrp so all this does essentially is juxtapose msrp and scores that we gather from the public 3dmark time spy database now these scores you're about to see are median scores so for each card you have a certain number of data points right these are the different entries everyone you know that has a 3080 that runs a 3d mark times by score that entry will be cataloged in their database and then 3dmark takes all of those scores for that particular card and creates well they call it like a weighted meme but i asked for clarification and they said this is more like a medium because they're rolling out extreme outliers especially in the cases where extreme overclocking yields very very high scores that are unrealistic for most users and that's what you're seeing here so you've got the score column right and this is in descending order so the highest graphics card score in 3dmark time spy was an rtx 3090 at 19 858. we're going to compare that to the msrp which was 14.99 in this case and then we're going to create a value and that value is simply a ratio of score divided by msrp that gives us a ranking and the lower ranking is actually going to be worse in this case so don't don't be fooled if you see a ranking of two or one that's bad you want a higher value so you want to be ranked the closest to 64. so you can see for instance the rtx 360 ti with a score of 11 933 and an msrp of 399 gives us the highest rank score 64 and a value of almost 30. now i had i did not take into account back in april the rtx 3060 i believe when i was gathering a lot of this data it was not released yet uh so that's why it's not here the 30 60 debatably even a better value uh card i haven't crunched the numbers but it's going to be up there but for all intents and purposes the 360 ti is one of the best in this list but again we're assuming msrp and if you're looking at any price anywhere recently you're not going to find it for 400 bucks just it's just not going to happen so we've got many other cards to look at here you can see the titan v right i mean three thousand dollars great but it's only it's only a little bit better than a 3060 ti so that's why it has a really really low value score uh some other kind of average ones rx 590 that's got the score of 47.72 and an msrp of 279 you can see it's 1710. now this chart here is obviously biased towards newer cards because in general as tech advances you you tend to get better value with every generational leap right so if you compare pascal to maxwell value all price is equal pascal's going to be the better value than maxwell if it's not something's pretty wrong now this next chart i'm going to show you actually looks at prices from back when i was gathering data when we released the video in april now i have it listed as april 2021 when this data was gathered but it was actually gathered a bit earlier than that it took a few weeks to collect all this data back when i was first uh ranking everything so it says april just know that it's a little before that but uh early 2021 circa and here we are so check this out so i have every graphics card ranked originally by msrp in value from best tours so the 360t i remember was the best value card at msrp but you can see when we account for sale price on ebay and this is average sale price the most recent 10 sales that i could find that were legitimate that did not involve uh broken or defective cards card sold for parts etc but legitimate cards that actually worked i can see that they were selling on average back then for almost thirteen hundred dollars now this reassessed value brings it down to just nine from remember a bit earlier it was you can see in this chart right here it was almost 30. so that uh that kind of leap is not good and that tells us that the 3060 ti is not so good of value anymore when you take into account actual ebay sale prices which is what esp stands for now some of the better value cards back in early 2021 included the r9 380 x which only had a score in 3dmark time spy a median score of 30 20 but they were selling consistently at the time for around 120 bucks or so so you get a value of 25 which rivals that of the original 360 ti value at msrp and that's why this one is ranked in green so this would be one of the better value cards we're not looking at raw performance okay this is not a raw performance analysis we're looking at performance per dollar that ratio is super important here i wouldn't recommend you try playing 4k aaa titles with an r9 380 x but if you're looking for good bang for your buck relatively speaking so this accounts for all graphics cards being sold at the you know these crazy prices most of the time in 2021 um relatively speaking this is a good deal okay that's what it means now if you compared this price right here 120 bucks to a year ago these carts were selling for quite frequently under 100 so this wouldn't be a good deal if if that's how you're comparing things but all this price says and this corresponding value here is that compared to the other cards in this chart at these listed values at this current point in time which again was early 2021 this r9 380x was actually a good deal and we're gonna see if more recently around august 2021 if this in fact still holds or if this price has gone up or down and of course change the value the median scores i didn't reassess because cards at large aren't getting much worse in terms of performance over time uh and since most people were already benchmarking these three or four or five years ago we wouldn't expect most of the scores to change this late in the game now another great card in early 2021 from again a value perspective was the r9 fury x which was selling on average for about 200 bucks many of you pointed out this might have been because the theory x included the aio right and those aios often fail after four five six years who knows it's kind of a game of russian roulette really uh and uh so that might be why the price was so cheap but if you were willing to take on that gamble you could get a pretty great value card again with respect to other cards in this list at around the same time period i saw a couple bad cards just going to run through those real quick the titan rtx was pretty awful so that was a 6.22 and the gt710 was uh 3.84 i think this is our worst performer here you can see it only scored 192 in 3d mark time spy and uh yeah and fifty dollars i mean that's that's a pretty big rip-off when you compare it to say the gtx 750 ti here 750 ti scored about 10 times higher well not 10 times higher it was 192. so about six seven times higher but it's only twice the price so that's why the 750 ti is ranked higher 12.82 than the gt710 at a 3.84 so you're getting four times the value more or less with the 750 ti at this current price i know this may be a lot to take in for some of you and and the numbers can be a bit um especially on the right side of this chart the numbers can be a bit ominous looking um the numbers on the right are for a separate analysis that i'll go through later for standard deviation and creating a normal distribution curve and that'll just help me kind of visualize things for my audience a bit better at the end of the video but for now we're just looking at the value which is again simply a ratio of performance and price and instead of using msrp this time around we're just using the average sale price on ebay now this chart right here is the meat potatoes of this video we're going to answer the question have graphics card prices dropped in mid 2021 by analyzing this chart and this data actually took quite a bit of time together believe it or not you know doing creating averages filtering out the the mining cards that are valued a bit less again the cards that don't have display outs and things like that uh of course i admitted those because those aren't relevant to gamers i also omitted again the cards that are uh either defective or just being sold for parts maybe it was just coolers of certain cards you want to get rid of all those because again you can't game with just a cooler so the rtx 3060 chai let's start here for example now score didn't change again 11 933 uh we have an esp though of 950. now how did this change with respect to what we saw earlier in 2021 well esp earlier was 1300 so the 3060 ti has definitely come down since early 2021 but the value is still highlighted in yellow so this is a conditional formatting technique here and it's going to compare all these different values against each other the better values are going to be highlighted in a darker shade of green the worst values and a darker shade of red now an example of a card that is not a great value as of august 2021 is the radon 7. you see the score has not changed again this is the same score that you saw in the two previous charts but the esp is now 1400 giving us a value of 6.33 that is awfully low and if we compare this to early march 2021 you can see the radon 7 had a median price of roughly 900 dollars so it gave it a higher uh value score back then for some reason the radon seven cards have gone up in price maybe there's a small shortage of rate on seven cards for whatever reason there's like a peaked interest in them maybe they're better for mining who knows i don't know much about mining i haven't ever done it before but um you never know i mean this is this indicates that there are you know shifts in preference for certain cards especially when you're in a market that is saturated with miners as much as it is gamers now a few cards that are doing quite well right now are the gtx 960 this one surprised me a lot so 960 prices have come down to about 100 bucks this still isn't what i would call a good price with respect to how things used to be pre-mining craze pre-silicon shortage etc but this is much better than it used to be you see the value is quite high here again with respect to other cards in this chart whose data was gathered around the same time around mid not mid august but early august 2021 uh the r9 290 i believe this was still a good value in march uh you can see the median price is around 150 bucks that gives us a value score of 20 almost 25 and then the r9 fury for around 200 bucks is also a great value at 24. now again i'm not saying these values would have always been great obviously a year or two ago things were much different and a year or two i wouldn't have told you that a gtx 960 for 100 bucks was a great deal but with respect to other cards in this chart for data gathered in this snapshot of time it's not bad if you have to buy a card consider that if you're only worried about value and i see a lot of cards as of august 2021 are kind of in the middle here they're all labeled like a yellow color more or less maybe a light shade of yellow or a slight shade of green some cards are okay deals the rx 470 is not bad at 18. the gtx 1070 ti at 400 bucks i mean that's still geez it feels weird saying this is a okay deal but uh again with respect to other prices and other value propositions out there uh in this at this current time uh 1080 tf400 bucks isn't awful uh and then you have some that are kind of just you know yeah they're not they're not very good like gtx 1050 150 bucks i would say that anything under 15 you just shouldn't look at at all if you consider yourself a value person the r9 380x again still looking pretty good at 20. uh we've got uh we've got the gtx 960 of course the 970 even is it's getting there about 200 that's the median price i found it gives you a value of 18 and then the gtx 950 for about a hundred bucks 19 that's that's pretty good right now if you stuck around this far in the video i think you're in for a treat because i i prepared a few different scatter plots a few different graphs that will really help you visualize uh what all these numbers mean in these charts with the exception again of the normal distribution data which is off to the right in each that i'm saving for the very end so here we go so this plot ranks value against score now the score is the median 3d mark times by score so we expect the more powerful cards will be placed further to the right along the x-axis and the better value cards will rank higher up along the y-axis so some of the worst value cards like this titan here uh it's it's obviously a really bad value it's actually the worst value if that's the only metric we're ranking here and then it's also not really a great performer it's not a great score it's an older card so that's why it's positioned a bit further to the left now by comparison the titan v is still a very bad value it's actually only slightly better in terms of value than the titan relatively speaking but it is a much more powerful card and that's why it's positioned a bit further to the right ideally you want something positioned up here but not too far to the left if you're worried about you know higher in-game resolutions and settings and things like that so the 3060 ti is a really great sweet spot so is the gtx 1650 super um the 1660 super is really great as well and then we have the more powerful cards that are much more recent as well like the rtx 3070 rx 6800 600 xt and 3080. a couple cards that are not necessarily good values but that are really powerful are the 6900xt and 3090. again this is at msrp okay so to take what you're seeing here with a grain of salt this ideally is what we'd be dealing with and we were dealing with this more or less a few years ago now we're about to change charts and we're going to keep the same x and y variables right the scale is going to slightly change on the y axis i try to keep it as similar as possible but it does change just a tad i'm going to move my camera out of the way here so you can see what happens so we've got the uh max y score here's 35 at msrp and this is early 2021 again it says april but this was actually most of this was gathered in early march if i recall correctly so you can see the general trend here a lot of these cards are much worse values given their current or what were current at the time ebay sale prices we have pretty much every well every card should be the same at the same location on the x axis so take this 30 90 for example it's just just in front of the 20 000 uh score mark and if we switch on over you can see it's still in the same position on the x-axis but it has dropped considerably on the y-axis because again we're taking into account um actual sale prices over msrp and since the sale prices are higher the resulting value is lower because the sale price is in the denominator of each of these ratios you can see i included this trend line here and it's on all three of these charts i'm going to show you along with the equation the slope in this case is positive y intercept of 12.3 or so this suggests that there is a positive relationship between value and score so the newer cards are typically going to be better values right but also the more powerful cards are going to be better values now that's that's kind of a trade-off right because newer cards are typically also more powerful that's one of the reasons why the slope would be positive but an interesting note is that when we take into account ebay sale prices in early 2021 that slope shifts to a negative one so the relationship between value and score is uh is negative it's inversely proportional so as value increases score tends to decrease or conversely as score tends to increase value tends to decrease now this works twofold again because these older cards are usually going to be a bit cheaper uh if they're you know two or three generations old they'll still be cheaper than the way they sold for at msrp even in this kind of market so for example the gtx 950 here has a value of 18 19 or so but if you look at msrp that 950 is uh somewhere where'd it go oh there it is at 950. right so the the gtx 950 actually was lower at the msrp chart and is higher here but that's because the 950 is selling for less now than it was at msrp so that's another explanation for why this trend line is negative now i want to show you august 2021 because this this is also very interesting so kind of keep a snapshot of this in mind and we're going to switch now check that out you see how everything shifted up so very very obvious and i made sure the y axis was the same here i'm going to take my camera off screen so we've got y axis up to 30 starting at zero i'm going to switch back to earlier in 2021 you can see look at that massive shift downward the further back we look uh so this is definitely clear evidence that cards across the board are becoming better values and the only change because we didn't change score the only variable changing here is the price so prices are coming down because again price is in the denominator that is why the value is going up the later we look and in this case august 2021 is is pretty much present time that is why these are all positioned higher on this chart so that's really good news i want to look at some cards in particular let's see what the change was some of these actually went down in value and i think that again just depends on the trend so for example the radon 7 graphics card was somewhere in here right right in the middle and then you can see if we switch to august it actually dropped it fell way below the trend line and again this could have to do with a number of things i i don't know if radon sevens are particularly great mining cards they weren't particularly great value gr gaming cards when they first came out but uh there's just maybe they're just few of them in circulation or maybe there's a ton of people who are suddenly interested in them so the price was driven up and as a result the plot here uh was pushed down much lower along the y-axis another few interesting observations you can see the r9 380 and the r9 fury x were actually really great value cards relatively speaking again with respect to these other uh values here at this point in time uh back in again march or so 2021 but then if we transition to august they suddenly kind of well i'm gonna blend back in a bit the three the 380x actually um is nowhere near as good a value as it used to be it's around 20 now right here if you can see my cursor and the r9 fury is still pretty good um but uh the arnhem fury x which was one of the two that was way up here is is much lower as well i doubt that our video back then was the sole reason why these dropped but it could have played a part so it's kind of interesting now there are a few cards in these two charts that didn't change price at all which means that their positions on these plots didn't change either for example the original titan here uh did not move at all between early 2021 and you can't see it's kind of blocked by whatever this card is looks like a 1650 or something and here all right it's not moving it's the same same position and there are a few cards like that i noticed that the gtx 750 ti as well didn't change in price so that's why it doesn't move here but a lot of other cards did definitely shift uh upward along the y-axis suggesting that value has definitely increased overall another interesting note here the trend line for august is starting to flatten out the slope is now negative dot zero zero zero two whereas before it was negative point zero zero zero three uh so that that now that mathematically explains why the the slope is uh a little flatter it's not as steep but we would expect an ideal market again for this slope to be positive because of the the natural aging of tech and how newer tech tends to be more valuable borrowing any crazy amount of inflation between snapshots so we've obviously got quite a ways to go yes prices have decreased that has resulted in higher values across the board with few exceptions but we're far from ideal and we won't get there until you have an equilibrium of supply and demand in a sense that you don't have this disconnect between how much supply is being supplied how many how many cards are being produced and how many people are hoarding cards taking advantage of wholesale opportunities and pawning off individual pallets and things on ebay etcetera it's just it's ridiculous what is happening now but the only reason it is happening is because we don't have enough of the raw supply on the market to meet the demand from miners and gamers and that brings us to this chart right here we're going to talk about normal distributions i'm not going to explain what this is in detail i'm not going to run through this is not a statistics course i don't intend for it to be just know that values further to the right will keep it super simple here are better they are they're better values they're the ones you want to look out for sometimes two three standard deviations outside the mean positive standard deviations which is good in this case so i'm going to switch to this version of the chart which i denoted i'm going to get rid of my camera there we go okay so further to the left here then these are bad you don't want to buy cards further along this side of the curve so we have gt 710 this one's no good titan rtx at this point in august no good right on seven for whatever reason that became a really bad deal same with the titan cards that are not great i mean you're not like it's not the worst deal in the world but it is definitely not spectacular with respect to other cards in this list rtx 3090 rtx 3080 gt 1030 if you want an ultra budget card i mean at least you know this one's better than the gt710 at this point in time you can buy them for a price similar to what we have listed and then we have the original titan now moving over here we have the deals that are they're okay i mean they're not bad but they're not super good either you really only want to pick something from this list if you are not okay with any of the cards here to the far right so something like a gtx 1650 super 1660 super 1660 ti r9 390 rtx 2080 super this can be the one of the more powerful cards in this uh this section of the chart um these are they're all right you know again if you don't want any of these over here buy one of these if you have to buy something again i'm not encouraging anyone to buy anything right now but if you absolutely must buy something and none of these will do it for you maybe you want something powerful like a 2080 super i've noticed that these prices have come down quite a bit they're still not great values again with respect to what we would have expected maybe a year or two ago but compared to other cards in this list at this point in time on ebay they are not too bad now some of the best cards you can find right now from a value perspective again just in this time period we're not comparing to previous prices in previous areas of this graphics card market the r9 380x is a really good one still the gtx 960 is a really good one still especially if you can find the 4 gig variant r9 290s are still really good these will run pretty hot so be prepared and then r9 furies as well again older card but it packs a decent punch for the price it's going for on ebay relatively speaking so i hope this video has shed a bit of light into the current state of graphics for prices in mid 2021 i would say with very few exceptions yes graphics card prices in the used market have definitely come down somewhere in the realm of 20 to 30 maybe 35 percent uh and that is i would say substantial i mean compared to what we were dealing with in february march this is definitely a breath of fresh air but it's not it's not fresh to the point where i'm like go out and buy things you know these these prices are still elevated if you told me they were going to be this expensive a year ago or well maybe a bit further back than that i would have said no way those are rip offs but compared to what we were dealing with earlier in the year these prices are definitely headed in the right direction i just realized i put us awest no idea what office is oh that is cringe sorry about that it probably says assist up here too i think i copied and pasted it oh no it says april okay yeah so i just um i just typo the august thing there we go um so yeah the the other thing i wanted to say that i did mention earlier is that this snapshot these prices are only taking into account u.s sales if a card was sold from germany or from canada wherever those markets are different they have different access to cards especially in their local markets and even if they're shipping internationally i just didn't want to consider them i think it's only fair to look within our country because we have different rules to play by in a lot of cases different supply amounts to play with and different demand even as well so if you live in the us and you thought this data was super interesting and helpful let me know in the comments section below also by giving this one a thumbs up i would appreciate that even if you're international and you like seeing the data juxtaposed um that feedback would be appreciated if you thought it was too much if you thought it was just like all thrown at you once or it was disorganized whatever you can also comment that down below it's okay um i didn't mean for this to be super professional the presentation was just kind of supposed to be off the cuff and uh more like oh look i just gathered this data let's go look through it together like that that's what i was going for but hopefully the charts at least helped out a bit maybe help you visualize the things you were seeing uh the the scatter plots at least hopefully that helped you um kind of grasp what what is being presented here it's easier for me to understand it because i'm the one that made the charts but i i can understand how you know just a bunch of numbers can seem uh like a bit much i've i've been through it in school i know what that's like uh anyway again if you liked the video thumbs up i'd appreciate the feedback subscribe if you haven't already that would be cool join our public discord service link below check out our

    "transcript": "Hey there in this video i figured i would give pc building simulator a shot i have not ever opened the game not a single time i've never actually even owned the game until just recently it was on sale for free it was 100 off on the epic store and i figured why not and what better time than now to give this game a shot seeing as though you could have picked it up for zero dollars and zero cents so this game if you're not aware allows you to build PCs virtually if you have an itch to build computers and you just maybe don't have the time or the funds to keep doing it over and over maybe this game will take care of that for you and i'm going to give you my raw impressions in this video we'll see how it goes stay with me phallus if you're in need of proper grooming get set up with manscapes performance package 4.0 you'll find their lawnmower 4.0 included which boasts a sleek waterproof design wireless charging and advanced skin safe technology for a smooth trim pretty much anywhere and as nice compliments you'll also get their weed whacker for ear nose trimming deodorant and toner for keeping fresh and much more get 20 off plus free shipping at manscape with code \"Salazar\" at this link which you can also find in the video description so without further ado let's get right into the game opening it for the first time now here we go hey i dig this music that's ain't bad at all quality what are we doing on oh yeah fantastic that's what we're talking about i have an RTX 30 what is this is a 3080 ti in here we're going with a fantastic in the 1440p resolution let's see how that goes so career new game wow i thought this was just like a sandbox but i guess there's like a storyline to this interesting okay so we're gonna click here because we have nothing else to click and let's see what happens welcome to pc building simulator to begin go to your pc by the doorway and open the email program on the desktop you've got mail whoa okay uh so this is a WASD kind of uh kind of sort of like Minecraft feeling interesting we've got a box i need to go to the pc and i need to click email wow this is actually pretty cool this is it's like it's like a virtual pc in a game uh it's it's kind of a it's like i'm in the matrix all right so this guy needs his wow this is like the fixer flop series this guy is wanting to pay a hundred dollars in labor and he needs me to remove viruses all right so this is it let's go ahead and how do i how do i click ah i can pick oh okay okay whoops i just turned my computer off i did not mean to do that i hope i don't need it okay it was making noise i was wondering if the fan noise was coming from the game or if it was like static or something but i guess it's coming from the pc that's pretty realistic okay so let's uh let's figure out how to do what we need to do here so left click to work on the pc and then what is this so that's the power cable nice and then another usb is going to go up here all right cool so insert thumb drive where where is that oh that's where it is okay and yeah we want to connect it back here look at the pc start spinning all right the only thing i'm kind of what the heck what a startup sound the only thing i'm kind of disappointed by is the way these cables look they look a bit they look a bit freaking weird but other than that i mean this is pretty cool where's our there's our virus scanner so it's scanning for viruses you must restart your computer for yeah i'll go ahead and do that these sign out sounds oh my gosh so we've scanned all files let's go ahead and clean files and there we go all done so we removed viruses we can back out of this now and we need a place in the delivery area okay so can we turn this system off now yeah okay so shut down oh my that's that's never that's never gonna get old okay so the system has been shut down we need to disconnect everything so we're gonna remove that remove that take my thumb drive back remove that and remove that and i don't think there's a place to actually like physically switch off the power supply so this is good to go now we can grab this let's see how do i okay yep that's it whoops and we're gonna put it right there i guess yes collect a reward now you just need to collect your pay go to your email and hit collect all right give me my money oh crap i gotta turn this thing back on where is the power button oh i guess i should uh learn to read it says p to switch on the pc there we go and now we can sign into our email so i can get that moolah oh my gosh these sign-in sounds how on earth okay collect all right made 100 bucks that was that was really freaking easy ah okay we've got more inquiries in the queue let's see this guy says i need some more space to back up my files could you install a 500 gig hard drive please i'll bring it around first thing this dude wants to pay 480 dollars in labor 50 budget install more tony easy store 500k am i reading this right is that a 280 job just to install a hard disk drive and initialize it heck yeah i'll take that so we need to buy our components we're gonna go to shop he needs an easy store 500 gig hard drive or better you know what you're paying a lot of money here so i'll give you a one terabyte how about that let's see we don't have a one terabyte well sorry dude looks like you're sticking with that there and let's see view cart we gotta time our delivery so same days uh yeah next day that'll be that'll be fine and we'll just click uh yeah bye now cool let's see what we got here broken graphics card he needs it replaced GTX 970 maybe the one of those xi'an ones i love how these are like just some bs i've never heard of this this is real i'm sorry but this is not a us brand i can drop it around first thing tomorrow morning cool sounds good i'll accept that and i need a xi'an gtx 970 gamer so let's go ahead and order one of those let's see graphics card wait do i have enough money oh crap crap i'm gonna have her pc for an extra day or two i forgot i don't have any money i have five bucks you know what though it is really cool kind of being in charge of all this you have to watch your funds you have to kind of keep track of when things are coming in when things are coming out so there's logistics involved obviously finance and then just the general pc part knowledge um this is this is a lot more layered than i thought it was going to be i legit thought this was just a sandbox pc builder but there's actually like there's actually a good story to this and and this could definitely get more intense the deeper you get into it so uh i'm i'm hooked i really am oh my gosh look at the boxes yeah uh let's see which one is which so this one needs that 500 gig hard drive so that one we can fix pretty easy so set that there and then which one of these i guess it's just yeah it's just okay it's three boxes but it's just one thing okay great and let's see here what do we have inventory storage i don't want to sell that i just i need that so let's see uh left click on this pc remove side panel wow this is actually this is really cool i am so impressed with this connect hard disk drive to the power supply okay that's cool so i don't need to order cables that took me a second and uh yeah i think it is ready to go and i guess we can double check to make sure that that hard disk drive is initialized oh that startup sound this thing is ready to go so we can power it off unplug everything and then we're just gonna bring this back to the hallway because yeah it's uh it's good to go whoops i keep clicking the wrong button there we go nice that thing is done i feel like this is not the right step because nothing is happening maybe it's be oh no it did work okay you said that you just have to keep aiming it in places until it finally goes away there we go and with these viruses taken care of we can power the system back off and i think we are good to go yes so we can install the side panels where is that going to be yep yeah there we go okay so we'll install that and tighten these down now i'm curious if i like intentionally sabotage this if i like forget to include the dust filter that i took off of the top is that possible and if so what happens if i forget let's see she'll probably write back saying oh you forgot my stuff can you send it to me and it's going to cost me some money that's what i imagine will happen so we can step away oh no incomplete case okay so pc status yep that's why uh so we so we can put it there but it's not going to be collected because i didn't actually finish the the build yeah this one here we can collect on because we already installed that collect nice so 330 total that makes up for the cost of the hard disk drive and our got 300 bucks in labor to install a hard disk drive jeez and a broken graphics card that's what we haven't touched yet this one yes so because we haven't completed the case yet we can't technically claim our uh our payment for that so let's bring this one back i was just curious what would happen and let's see we can install it's gonna be down here this yes okay now she's ready i'm gonna bring her back over here right and now we can collect payments that's going to be here and give me that hundred dollars i appreciate you whoo what is this oh 1050 ti from zotac okay so these are brands i'm starting to recognize now can i order this graphics card now i believe i can so we can add to cart and let's do next day delivery since it's already kind of late anyway it's not going to matter too much click buy now and that will show up tomorrow do we have any other folks needing work nope not today so i think we can clock on out of here our parts have arrived and we can bring this to the table let's see here she needs the graphics card replaced we need to install the 970 so click here we'll remove this graphics card how do i oh i need to remove this first okay wow this is this is so detailed it like it won't even let you remove the card until you get all these screws out of the way just like in real life who would have thought so remove that and now we're gonna install go to graphics card and we'll click on this one yes right there okay looking good and now we just need to make sure that the system boots up again i think we can tighten this back down and we can connect all this stuff whoops cabling let's forget there's a separate tab for that and with it all hooked up let's give it a shot looks good we get a picture out what do we have here yes good old omega systems intro that's what i'm talking about back over here and then i think we can claim our reward for this one let's see where is it right here yes collect all right this is big money boom look at that 665 bucks now in our account see i'm not very good with computers but mine isn't working properly it's been getting very hot lately and running slower and slower i don't think i can hear the fan anymore it lives on the floor of my dusty office oh geez oh the perfect pcdc candidate if you do have time to replace the fan then please pick the cheapest one i can't afford anything fancy her budget is 10 bucks so we're um yeah we're gonna have to skim by with this one but she's willing to pay 260 dollars for labor for whatever reason uh that's fine that sounds like a good deal and then what else do we have here uh hi i'm giving my daughter my pc and she needs lots of ram apparently she says she needs 16 gigs and i've currently got two and uh four uh two gigs and four ram slots gotcha got showcased she needs 16 so we need to dump i think we can just take this stick out and then we'll just buy i don't know two 8 gig sticks and call it a day we can accept this one and what's this one here leveled up oh we've unlocked some processors and things wow look at all of this these are all brand items here too that i recognize it's very cool to see these brands in this game this is this is pretty awesome well i've got to say this has been very impressive and i have just scratched the surface it seems like with this game so uh who knows what we'll find later on i am definitely intrigued this is something i could i could just see myself playing in past time it's probably gonna annoy lisa because i am so into it now but uh i'm curious to see how much money i can make i mean there are actual tasks involved here and again i thought this was a sandbox i didn't think there was any real purpose other than just building pcs but you're more in like the pc repair business you're troubleshooting cleaning things fixing things again handling logistics ordering replacement parts this is really cool this is like virtual business here you're running a company so do i recommend this game absolutely 100 percent it is definitely worth it for free of course you have nothing really to lose other than some time if you don't end up liking it in the end but i i really feel like you will even for 10 bucks i would have bought this game if i had known that there was actually some storyline to it i would have definitely tried this much sooner than i did there's also a free build mode so again if you're into more of the sandbox style building where you're just kind of coming up with creations on your own that is also available in the game but i like career mode there's just so many layers to that it reminds me kind of like a i don't know sim city where i'm like planning cities i have a budget i have to keep track of you can raise and lower taxes and things like that it's it's multi-layered and that just i mean that really makes it for me so if you want to check out this game and i really think you should if you have some free time i will have it linked in the video description i don't think it's going to be affiliate link or anything like that i don't think you even can in the epic store if you can i just have no idea how to do that it's not worth it anyway i just want to give you guys a chance to try it out if you haven't already and maybe this video made up your mind maybe you saw what you saw here and you're just like now i don't think i want to give that a shot but if you liked it i i definitely think you should try because i had a lot of fun and i've only been playing it for like 30 minutes so uh plenty more hours are gonna be devoted to this game i can i can guarantee you that thank you so much for watching this far into this video if you enjoyed this um just kind of like leisurely stroll through a game i've never played before let me know i appreciate those comments in the comments section leave a like consider subscribing and i'll catch you in the next one my name is greg thanks for gaming with me",

    "transcript": "And one of the things that you need to do as a hacker or network engineer is to understand some basic NMAPs. Let's talk about NMAP right now why do we care what ports are open because if we're attacking the system usually we're attacking the services behind the ports it's a way to know what's being run on that system now I can begin the process of say doing Wi-Fi hacking which everybody wants to do right everybody wants to hack their neighbor Wi-Fi and we're not going to do that. Hey everyone David Bombal back with Occupy The Web. We are continuing our series looking at Linux Basics for Hackers this is a fantastic book Occupy The Web I'm so glad that you're doing a video series complimentary to the book great to have you back what are we talking about today? Thanks David it's always an honor to be back on the the best IT and cyber security Channel on YouTube. Today we're gonna talk about uh networking from Linux. We're going to do some simple networking and do some simple networking commands nothing too complex but we're going to kind of introduce those people the people who are new to Linux and what commands are key in uh in doing any type of work in over a network from Linux. So we're working from chapter three of my book Linux Basics for Hackers. I also want to point out that there's not a whole lot of networking in that book that it certainly assumes a little bit of networking capability if you're not familiar with networking I have a book out called Network Basics for Hackers you might want to take a you use that as a reference. Good book, good book yeah. Okay thank you and so let's go ahead and start with I've logged in to a shell now one of the things that I showed earlier is that I changed my terminal or my shell to a bash shell you might have remembered that I did the Kali weeks. So in an earlier episode I showed you this command kali-tweaks and I'm going to go back there just to kind of remind you in case you haven't seen it before so kali-tweaks allows you, you can see on the the fourth line here there's shell and prompt right here configure the shell and command prompt so I'm going to go ahead and you can see if I I scroll down here I'm just going to go using the down arrow key is like default login shell and you can see mine has already been switched if you're you know new to to Kali and you haven't made this change in the most recent versions you're probably in the Z Shell now there's nothing wrong with the Z Shel as a matter of fact some people think it's superior to the bash shell the reason that I'm using the bash shell is because if you're learning Linux and you want to go out and and use you know another operating system like Ubuntu or Red Hat or Solaris what you're going to get there is you're going to get a bash shell and so I prefer that you learn the bash shell and then maybe later on you can switch over to the Z Shell. Most of the most of the things will work in both shells but let's not complicate things let's stick with the bash shell my book assumes you're using the bash shell because the the older Kali had bash shell only so I'm going to stay with the bash shell so you can switch over go to apply and now I'm going to go and and exit and go quit and we're out of there okay. So we're working in a bash shell now and I just the reason I do that is that we're going to use the bash shell in a later uh tutorial here and write some basic bash scripts so to be consistent with the book and to be consistent with what you're likely to see in the work we're going to use the bash shell if you like the Z Shell there's nothing wrong with it Z Shell but the Z Shell is only being used in the Mac OS and in Kali that's basically the only places you're going to find it every place else you're working in Linux or Unix you're probably going to run across the bash shell so let's stay with the bash shell. So one of the the most fundamental commands that we're going to see in networking is ifconfig that's interface configuration ifconfig and you can see that when I do that right I have a number of interfaces mine I've got a few other interfaces on here, yours all right is going to be eth0 probably is the only one and loop back these others that you see on my screen are because I've got Docker and some other things on here well maybe we do uh a tutorial on Docker in the future. That'd be great actually yeah. Some other interfaces Docker is becoming increasingly important these are the ones that you are probably going to have. So this is let's go through what we what we see here we can see the inet okay this is the internet address. Now if you're not familiar with internet addresses let's take a look and it'll break it down for you. And this is basic IP addressing so the numbers are four sets of decimal numbers so these are often referred to as octets because there's eight bits to each one of them the entire address is 32 bits there's one bite or eight bits that's an octet for each one of these numbers so these numbers here are decimal base 10 representations of the base two or the 01s okay that are actually represent presented in the machine. So we have four octets and that's what we have here this is actually what's referred to as IPv4 which is the original Internet Protocol addressing scheme we're in a process of switching over IPv6 but that's still happening. I'm gonna say that's been happening for the last 20 years right? Yeah for more than 20 years right exactly. So it's gonna happen tomorrow right that's right for 25 years we've been hearing that right? So that's why I'm just teaching IPv4 when everybody accepts IPv6 we'll switch over to that beneath it you can see the IPv6 address you see looks significantly different okay but this we're not going to delve into IPv6 here because really most of us are still working in an IPv4 environment and if you don't know one of the reasons that we have these two distinctions is that originally when the internet was set up there was only four nodes on the whole internet and uh and now you know there are billions in billions of nodes. The IPv4 system is limited to 4.3 billion IP addresses and there are seven and a half billion people on the planet right and many of us have multiple IP addresses so there's just not enough IP addresses if you're only limited to 32 bits so this address here is 128 bits and it has a lot more IP addresses but we'll get to that maybe in a later um tutorial. So over here we have the netmask and a broadcast address you know that's maybe we should save that but you take a look at my book Network Basics for Hackers but this is basically the net mask determines how many nodes we have on the network that's what this does here this is really comes down to understanding subnetting and then this is the broadcast address and where this does here is it sends out this says if you want to if you want to talk to all of the nodes on this network you send to this address here that'll send it out to all of the nodes or the clients on the network. So this the most basic kind of command just understand what's going on uh on our this is probably the most important right here is understanding what IP address we have right so here's our IP address. A lot of people will complain that you don't use IP address right because a lot of people are saying you should use IP address rather than ifconfig? Yeah the there's so right now we're in a kind of transition between ifconfig and IP yeah IP is considered to be the the modern way of being able to that's either way is fine you know I've been doing this a long time I've been using ipconfig or ifconfig ipconfig works in Windows systems ifconfig works in Linux and Unix systems but you can go and use the ifcommand which is you know is more of a modern way of doing it I still prefer ifconfig it might be that you know I'm old school and I've been doing this a while and but I'd like ifconfig and here's IP right and here's you can get the IP address and all of these other switches that you can use okay these options and so here you go so I can go IP Address. I think it's good to mention that this because sorry to take us on a tangent but I see that sometimes ifconfig doesn't is not installed by default for instance on a okay I know that in some distributions of Linux you actually have to install the tools to get to use ifconfig um other by default only IP address works. We can see see that if we just did ip address all right instead of ifconfig which is many people think that the if command is going to replace the ifconfig and it probably will eventually but on Kali at least it's in both of them are available to you one of the nice things about the IP commands you got nice colors right so it makes it easier to read then uh and don't worry if you don't have some of these interfaces I I've installed them this is what you should have is the loopback and the eth0 or Ethernet0 right and you can see that we have the ip address here, okay the broadcast address here. Next what I want to show you is iwconfig this is for wireless interfaces so if I just type iwconfig it will ignore all that other stuff you just show me information about the wireless interfaces so let's go there and you can see it comes back says hey you don't have any Wireless interface well this is a question that I often get from people and that is well I'm connected to my Wi-Fi how come I don't have any Wireless interfaces well the answer is is that the virtual machine takes that WiFi connection and basically converts it into a wired connection so it goes into your host machine as a wireless and then the connection between the host machine and this is a guest machine your Kali here is a wired connection it appears as a wired that's what eth0 stands for is Ethernet not wireless so if you want to go ahead and do like Wireless hacking you need to go ahead and put in if only if you're using a virtual machine if you're using a physical Kali on a physical machine you don't need to do this only apply lies to a virtual machine so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add an external USB wireless adapter and then connect it to my my Kali and you'll see then that we'll get a wireless interface okay I'm connecting it now and there it pops up the nice window it tells me and I want to see it says connect to the host or connect to the virtual machine this one here is Kali 2023 so it's real recent and we'll go ahead and connect it and let give it a minute because sometimes these virtual machines take a minute or two to complete the connection process and then let's go I'm going to up arrow and do iwconfig and you can see there it is yeah wlan0 now I have a wireless adapter connected to my Kali virtual machine. Now I can begin the process of say doing doing wi-fi hacking which everybody wants to do right everybody wants to hack their neighbor Wi-Fi and we're not going to do that I'm joking of course. Of course. Of course but we'll look at in the later tutorial we're going to go through in this class we're going to go through Wireless both Bluetooth and wireless but right now I just wanted to show you how you can discover your wireless uh device just like we discovered our ethernet devices. Now we might want to be able to say change your IP Address obviously your IP Address is being is being leased to that's what the term is used leased to you by a DHCP server so on your network there's a DHCP server it's Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and it gives out IP Addresses to everybody on the network it's assigned to you and then it assigns a uh it assigns that IP address so that when you go out to the internet it can then match that IP Address to the external public IP Address and then when the traffic comes back it can go ahead and then match up your traffic and send it back to you. DHCP is is actually pretty simple concept but sometimes it can trip people up um that's basically a way of giving everybody on the network an IP Address and and making sure that they knows what everybody's IP Address is that is what's referred to as Dynamic IP Address. Some cases you may want to set have a Static IP Address that means an IP Address that's always the same this will come up sometimes when you're messing around in your virtual machines for instance if you're trying to you have a victim or target system and you have a your Kali attack system sometimes you might just want to put them on their own simple network with Static IP Addresses and so you can change that there's other obviously we'll get into it later there's other ways that you can use Static IP Address but if you have to change your IP Address you can do so here you can do ifconfig all right and remember that this is going to set you up with a Static IP Address which means that your system system will not be able to talk to the internet but it can talk to other systems on your little Network so I'm going to go ahead and change mine mine is uh what is it uh I can change it to anything I can go let's change it to 192. 168.1.101 all right it comes back operation not permitted and that's because I have to give it a sudo to be able to change that I have to have the root privileges all right it's going to ask me for my password and now if I go ifconfig we should see that it has changed. Let's up arrow a little bit here and we can see there it is. I like it that it's holding the network mask and the broadcast address for you that's nice. So the problem this will work fine on your local area network but it's not going to allow you to go to the outside world. One of the commands one of the first commands you need to know and being able to do any kind of work over the internet as a hacker or a network engineer is ping. Ping is just sending out a little packet to the target and then waiting to see whether or not it responds it's it's a ICMPEcho Request then it comes back with an ICM Echo Reply I know there a lot of terminology there but basically all it's doing is it's sending out a packet to the target and then waits to see whether or not the target responds. That way we know that that system is actually up and running running and that IP Address is valid right. So one of the things that you can always test to see if you have outside connectivity okay outside of your little virtual world here is you can go ping google.com this will always tell you whether or not or you could have any other domain but Google's a good one to pick on and all this is going to do is going to send out a packet to google.com and then see if it comes back and you can see that it does not come back with this Static IP Address I can work within in my Local Area Network but I cannot work out on the internet just kind of keep that in mind. So if I want to go back to a DHCP Assigned IP Address we have a command that's called DH client dhclient.eth0 right there we go and what this will do is it'll go back out to the DHCP server and try to get an IP Address and assign it to this interface. So IP Addresses are not assigned to the machine they're assigned to an interface in this case our interface is named eth0 so that's the one we want the IP Address assigned to. If we look up above remember eth0 right had that IP Address right we had changed it now we're going to say we we want to go back to a dynamically assigned IP Address that's going to give us access to the outside world we hit enter says operation up permitted because I have to give it a sudo and we just wait a little bit okay and now let's go and go ping Google and we can see we can ping Google all right. Nice demonstration I like that yeah. If you if you change your IP Address and you can't get to the outside world go DH Client or sudo dhclient right and then if we go ifconfig now we should see that that interface it still shows it at as a unfortunately still shows that as have that static but obviously it's not using that one sometimes it takes a little while for it to change but by we can test to see that's it's uh configured by simply saying yeah here we are we can go out to the outside so we're no longer using a Static IP Address it sometimes it takes a little while before it actually changes it but itdoes work so that's the important part. Then what we might want to do is DNS basically it's the protocol that we use to be able to convert IP Addresses into domains right so we don't have to remember all these IP Addresses so we don't have to remember that Google's at 142.250.217.142 right I don't care how good a memory you have you're not going to remember all those IP Addresses and so the internet Gods put together a system called DNS where basically what happens is that the IP Address gets converted into a domain name okay okay so that we can just type in google.com and not have to remember what the IP Address is it does it translates the domain into an IP Address because the internet is based upon IP Addresses right it's not based, there's not these names floating around the internet there's IP Addresses that are available on the internet and the DNS service converts what you want microsoft.com, kali linux.org, google.com into an IP Address and then reaches out to that IP Address so that's how we go ahead and do that. Now we can go ahead and explore the DNS we're using a command called dig and so we want we can go ahead and go Microsoft oh let's heck let's pick on Tesla everybody loves to pick on Tesla now it used to be everybody loved to pick everybody used to love to pick on Microsoft now everybody's picking on on Tesla so we'll pick on Tesla too and since the Elon Musk is the richest man in the world he can take a little bit of easing. So let's go and go dig tesla.com and what we find out when we do that is that we find out essentially I just use let's go back to the command dig tesla.com ns name server and so we can see here the name servers for Tesla we can also use the same command I'm going use up arrow and go mx and I can see the mail servers for here's here's the mail server for Tesla. We can also then go ahead and well let's talk about let's talk about something that's that's often overlooked in uh in a lot of people's understanding of how their system works whether you know it or not there's actually what's referred to as a host file on both your Windows systems and in your Linux system that your system looks at first before it goes out to a DNS server. So let take a look at that let's take a look at that file go sudo mousepad and we're going to go /etc and well first of all we're going to look at this case let's look at the DNS server what this does is this file tells the system where to look for the DNS server and you see it right here the name server is 192.168.107.2 now yours might be different everybody's going to be different on this all right and this is where it's going out to look for your DNS server on your network. Now you can change it to for instance you can change it to whoever your ISPs DNS server wherever your corporate DNS server is in this case because I'm using a virtual machine it's using a virtual machines DNS server. So I can I can go ahead and change that DNS server by just putting in say I've forgot whose DNS server this is Google's DNS server yes Google DNS server and we can go ahead and save that file and then close that file and now if I still go say ping google it should still work yep. So I'm using a different DNS server now and still works so sometimes you know you might want to use a DNS server that's closer to you to get a faster response time DNS by the way uses UDP in the traffic between you and the server all right so this can be important when you're trying to analyze traffic between you know on your network if you're looking for like Port 53 which is DNS and you're looking for TCP traffic you're not going to see your DNS traffic right you got to go to look at the UDP traffic. Now we're talking about doing some basic networking and one of the things that you need to do as a hacker or network engineer is to understand some basic NMAPs. Let's talk about NMAP right now NMAP is a real simple tool it was it's been around for over 20 years and basically what it does is it goes out to your target tries to determine whether or not what ports are open why do we care what ports are open because if we're attacking the system usually we're attacking the services behind the ports it's a way to know what's being run on that system this is one of the first things you do in active reconnaissance there's lots of information you can get from passive reconnaissance from third party sources but ports being open you can get that from Shodan but Shodan sometimes is a little bit old you'll find sometimes when you go to Shodan to find out what ports are open you know Shodan scans the world and takes a few weeks before it catches up so sometimes the data is a little bit old. Also if you're talking about your own Local Area Network and you're trying to scan your Local Area Network NMAP is a good way to find out what ports are open. Ports usually mean services behind ports what service are run behind those ports. So NMAPs a great tool let's go ahead and just do the nmap -h let's see yep there it is -h for the NMAP screen this is the NMAP help screen there's a lot of information here but really we can boil it down to real simple all right. So basically NMAP is the command NMAP the type of scan that's the s some other options and then the target so that we can basically do a scan uh NMAP then the type of scan dash lowercase s and then usually an uppercase letter here's the scan techniques right here the ones that you probably should be most familiar with are -ss -st and -su there's lots of others that we can do and they get a little fancy these Xmas scans and what have you which for whatever reason you know all of the hacker books talk about the Xmas scan but exactly you're you're you're not gonna you're not gonna find it very useful all right despite what the books say all right. But here's the basic example right here all right is -v -A and then the specification for the target it can be either a domain name or it can be an IP Address I've got another system on here that I let me get the IP address this another Kali system right over here and we're going to just use NMAP on it all right the IP address on it is 192.107.141 so let's go and ping it make sure that it's actually up okay because you can't hack anything that you can't ping well that's not true that you can't hack anything that you can't connect to and the reason I backed away from that statement is that I was going to say. A lot of network Engineers, security Engineers block ping or they drop pings so just because when you send out a ping and it says the host is not up it doesn't mean that it's not up it means that it may mean that the network engineer has done the smart thing which is simply dropping the pings right so you can't tell whether or not it's there but that gets into a little bit more advanced stuff than what we're doing here today and we we'll address that in another this just tells me that I can ping that machine which means that I can connect to it now as you know there's PCP IP is uh these are the protocols that are most widely used for connection over the Internet they've been around for a long time we talked about the IP Address but also what we need to think about is is the three-way handshake this is the three-way handshake that's in ECP so what it does is that when it sends out when you you're the client when you send out a packet to any server the first thing it does is it sends out that packet with a flag okay set SYN flag we'll look at what that is in just a minute a SYN flag going out to this server that says I want to basically I want to open a connection to you syn's probably short for synchronize so send out of packets with the SYN flag set if the server is accepting connections on that port okay on that IP Address it'll come back with a SYN-ACK so that has two flags set on it and then you will come back and send out all your packets after that with an ACK set up all of your packets after that that will have an ACK connected to it. So that's what's referred to as the three-way handshake of TCP/IP right. This is a way that we connect to any server before we go ahead and do any any work okay put any traffic on a server first thing it does is it has to go through this three-way handshake this can be useful information to us as hackers Network Engineers because we can use this information to determine what ports and other information about this system we know a little bit then about what the three-way handshake is so let's take a look at the TCP/IP header. Here's a TCP/IP header and you can see this is It's a combination here of both this is the IP header remember these are two separate protocols there's the Internet Protocol and there's the TCP protocol and usually they work together not always but usually they work together right and on the IP protocol the thing that's most important for us to point out now is that you have a source address and a destination address but when we get down to the TCP header this is where we define the source port and destination Port that's where is it going to and where's it coming back to? You can see we'll talk maybe more later about the sequence number and acknowledgement but what I want to point out right now these right here, these are the flags, these are the way that's defined in TCP/IP by the TCP/IP gods they've defined that the way that a system tells another system what its intentions are is by setting these flags so that if I want to open up a connection I go SYN okay that's says Hey I want to talk to you all right and then the system will respond back we saw this earlier with an ACK, a SYN and an ACK all right and then everything on that established connection has an ACK flag. These are simply an area in the TCP header where is a single bit it's either on or off. If it's on a one that means it's a SYN it's in this position right here the SYN Flags without going into too deep about it you can see here there's a one here that's a bin flag this means I want to close the connection and then you can also see here that there's a reset that's what rst stands for and basically this is the way that a system will communicate back to someone and says hey this port that you're trying to connect to is not there, it's not open, it's not available for business, so it's a way to to say nope you're in the wrong place. And so NMAP uses this information we can NMAP is built to use this information to help us determine what the target looks like so let's go and do a simple scan of our other machine over here now I'm going to use the simplest type of scan and probably the most useful type of scan this is the st scan this says scan and use the TCP three-way handshake the reason that this is the best scan is because it is probably the most reliable so it give us the best information so it goes out to each port and tries to make a three-way handshake remember we saw that the SYN SYN-ACK ACK if it can't make a three-way handshake then it says the port's closed. If it goes out to a port and it gets a reset back that means I'm closed I'm not open for business you know this is not a place the wrong place. So let's go ahead and look at this other machine and go 192.168 what was it 107.141 was our other machine you see it right there and if we do the NMAP scan on it it comes back and says oh Port 80 is open port 80 we know is HTTP. Now I think that there is another port open on that machine that's uh I think there's Port 53 open sometimes NMAP will make a mistake it does do that okay it's not perfect but sometimes if you're pretty sure there's a port open you might want to just go put the -p that says just check that one port okay. When I do it without a port number what it does is it goes and checks the top 1,000 ports so this is important to note as well right so is that it only goes through what's the most commonly used ports the top 1,000 you know that ports are have 16 bits that means there's 65,536 so that's a lot of ports 6,500 655,536 I got it right this time I think and so rather than scan all of those rather than scan all the ports it just does hey let's just go check the top 1,000 so when you're looking for maybe a more obscure port it's not going to find it because it's doesn't look there but you can always tell NMAP go check this port and I'm going to say I'm gonna go check Port 53 right is DNS and let's see if it's open no it says it's closed. So let's go back over to the other machine and open it. Now what I'm gonna do over here is I've got Apache running on this system yeah and I'm gonna clear my screen okay so on this system here what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up just a little tool it's built in the Kali and a lot of the other Linuxes and Unix is called Netcat okay and Netcat is a tool that's real simple that will allow you to open up a port for listening or for connecting it just opens up a simple TCP connection so if I want to open up a listener on this machine I can go at netcat listen okay on port 53 and let's say Port 53 uh it says permission denied do mean means I have to use sudo. Okay so what it's done is this now opened up Port 53 but waiting for somebody to connect to it right it allows me to connect to it now if I do my NMAP scan right let's just do a quick scan again and you can see oh look at that I've got Port 53 open all right so this is a way that we can discover what ports are open on our target system. It's not perfect but it's a good simple tool that allows us to determine what's what's out there. Now one of the things that you'll see when using NMAP is that in this case it uses it says Port 53 is open right here sometimes it'll say closed and sometimes it'll say filtered which means that there's a firewall there or sometimes it'll say I don't really know it's either open or filtered or it's closed and filtered we don't we can't really tell from the information that we've gotten but it's one of those two so but it also tells you since this port 53 is open it tells you that it's a domain server or a DNS server. Now what NMAP does is it uses the default services so if it finds Port 53 open it says oh that's a DNS server right because that's what that's what 53 is used for but we know just from a minute ago that that's not true so it's only going back and giving us the default service on that port and sometimes not accurate. If you want to get a more accurate view is you can use the -A switch okay right here and what this will do is it'll go in and probe each one of those ports and try to determine exactly what service is running on it and what version of that service is running on it this simply is saying oh it's Port 53 so it must be DNS, it's Port 80 it must be HTTP, it may not be because as you know a network engineer can put any service on any port so for instance you know your particular organization might put HTTP on 80 that's commonly used right so you can put anything on any port this just shows you the default service for that port and sometimes as a network engineer it's advisable to put your services on something other than the default Port why because a hacker like me when I go and scan your system and I see Port 3306 open I go oh that's my SQL I know you got my SQL running on your system thank you very much. But if you go and put that same service on Port 555 I look at that and go I don't know what that is right until I scan deeper. So if I go ahead and scan a little deeper here this takes a little longer because it's doing more work it's not just sending out the three-way handshake it's actually probing to determine what's what's out running on that so it comes back and looks like it didn't know what to make of Port 53 which is understandable because it's simply netcat but it did give me a lot more information okay about the Apache server it told me what version it is what operating system it's using and it tells me what the default page looks like and it says it works and anybody who's used Apache web server knows that that's the default page as a matter of fact we can take a look at it and let's go use our browser and connect to that machine and that's the that's the default page for Apache if you're so 192.168 uh 107.141 so if I go ahead and use a browser I can put in the IP Address if I'm if we're trying to connect to Port 80 or 443 is a default for HTTP and HTTPS you don't have to put a port number in. But if you're trying to go to a different port you must put the port number in it would be like this like 80 80 like that but in our case we're just trying to connect the port 80 so we don't need to put any port in at all and just hit enter and wait there it is that's the Apache 2 default web page. Later on we get later in both we we'll play a little bit with that Apache server. Apache is the most widely used web server in the world NGINX is coming on fast, light speed uh IIS those are the major ones but Apache's been around for 25 years or longer and it's still the most widely used it used to be like 60 70% I think now it's down to about 40% but still widely used and it's free and you can use it on your system and we'll we'll make some basic web pages later on in class all right and this can be really useful as we'll see u in doing a lots of Nefarious work on your network. So that's what it looks like from the attacker perspective. Now let's go over to the victim and let's open up a tool that everybody should be familiar with you know it's a tool it's one of my top 10 network engineering tools and as Wireshark, I'd include NMAP in that top 10 as well NMAP you need to know the basics of NMAP you to know the basics of Wireshark if you don't it's going to be really hard to be successful in this field. So let's take a look at a Wireshark I can just go ahead and let's go to I can just do it by going wireshark right like this I don't need to go to any GUI and it'll start the Wireshark and here's Wireshark right here and let's go ahead and and tell it what what interface I want to work with okay eth0 and you can see there's nothing coming up on it oh here we got no we got some little this is all kind of you can see this is Dropbox Discovery some other graphic that's on there takes a little while to come up. Now let's go over to our Kali system and let's go and first of all let's just ping that system we talked about pinging right let's see what that looks like from over here. Can you see these here this is this is coming it's coming from my attacker system to my target system it's going back and forth It's going ICMP Echo Request, Echo Reply you know from one IP Address to the other IP Address and this is this is a really really useful tool that you should become familiar with and notice that on Linux the pings will go continuously until you stop them. In Windows system they'll send out four packets and that's you know stop in in Linux systems you can see it's still going it'll just keep on going until you stop Linux and Unix. Now let's go ahead and take a look at the NMAP scan so let's go ahead and send that and let's go back over here and you can begin to see that the protocol has changed from it had been ICMP to TCP and it's trying to go out and determine what ports are open. If you look closely you'll see that it's going through multiple ports here and is going to try to discover what ports are open and then what uh services are being run on those ports right? You see that here's the FIN ACK here's the ACK here's a FIN ACK, ACK, SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK that's that one flag that we talked about in TCP that I think you should be familiar with but surprisingly a lot of people are not you can see the ARP okay. Yeah ARP basically is going out and discovering who has what IP Address on what Mac Address and that's what's going on so this is a a really really useful tool this is the live feed you can see here here's DHCP going out here we can click on any one of these packets and it'll go and show us more details we can expand each of these notice it's the DHCP is using User Datagram Protocol Source Port 68 destination Port 67 and over here we can see here's the IP header and all the information about the there and then down below we have it in hexa-decimal and an ASCII over here. ASCII is what we refer to as human readable language right stuff that is using you know it's using letters that we know and familiar with all right. Exactly. Uh let's see here's here's our scan also I want to point out yeah I want to point out that you know a lot of hacker books talk about using -sS right to do a scan and that's great okay the difference between an sT and sS scan is that in sS scan doesn't open up the three-way handshake it does not open up the three-way handshake why is that important because generally the web server right will make will log the IP Address of anybody who makes a view a three-way handshake that's true but the security devices on the perimeter of the network are recording everybody's IP Address so watch here so this is our stealthy scan that every one of those hacker books says you need to do if you want to remain anonymous but if I go over here let me get the there we go and watch what's happening yeah I'm not very anonymous I can see exactly your IP Address. So any idea any idea that the sS scan is stealthy and that's what a lot of the books call it is the stealthy scan really it's it's actually a SYN scan but a lot of books call it a stealthy scan because your IP Address is not going to get logged but in reality your IP Address is just as visible with a sS scan as itis with an ST scan. So my thoughts are it's it's a waste of time doing an sS scan because it's not hiding your IP Address it's still going to be discoverable here you can see that even a Wireshark it's showing me the IP Address from that from that scan. So it's not very stealthy but so just kind of take some of the things that you read in some of those books not my books but other people's books take their take theirs with a grain of salt because some of the things just don't work and this is one of those things that I know just a it's a minor thing but I know I've had students in my class go why don't you use an SS scan why do you use an ST scan wouldn't you be more stealthy with an SS scan the answer is no I'm not more stealthy with an SS scan. So just it's you know it's not going to hurt to do an SS scan but it's not really you're not going to benefit at all from it because any kind whether it be an IDS, whether it be a firewall, whether it be the network engineer whether it be any type of device that's watching the packets is going to see your IP address right that's that's it's attached to every packet. The only thing that it's doing is that it will not make a three-way handshake so the web server won't log your log it'll still see your IP address it just won't log your IP address. That's why it's important to know Wireshark right because there you can see what's actually going on versus the theory in a book. Exactly so here this theory is you know if you use the SS scan you're stealthy we use Wireshark we can see we can see that the IP address is totally visible on the target system. So um that's pretty much you know the two of the most basic tools that we want to go ahead and be familiar with I'll put it on my top 10 cyber security tools is Wireshark and uh NMAP, I think David you've got other speakers who' have done videos on both of these subjects. Yeah Chris done, Chris is a big Wireshark guy, so I'll I'll link some of his videos below if you really want to get into Wireshark at like crazy detail detailed level have have a look those videos. He's got some great videos on your your channel um and then NMAP I think you have some NMAP videos as well and we also we do that as part of our introductory level classes at hackers rise but those are those are two of the you know the key tools we learned a little basic networking, we learned how to discover our IP Address how to change your IP Address. Oh one other thing that we might want to do let's just kind of keep is that we can changed the Mac Address as well just got just go to see that yes we can we we changed our our IP Address but we might want to change our MAC Address. MAC Address is the globally unique address that is attached to every Network device. And one of the reasons that you might want to change your MAC Address is that well for example if I was using somebody else's or trying to use somebody's else's Wi-Fi access point generally the network Engineers who set up Wi-Fi access points one of the the card of rules is to be able to keep it safe is to limit who can connect to the Wi-Fi access point by MAC Address so okay I've got 10 people in my office I take I get all their MAC Addresses and then I put it into the Wi-Fi AP and say only these people can connect to the Wi-Fi but I can go ahead and change my MAC Address to look just the same as one of those people who have are allowed to use the Wi-Fi. How do I do that? Okay first thing we got to do is go ifconfig ifconfig and we're going to go eth0 that's my ethernet adapter I'm going to take it down and it tells me that I have to use sudo to do that right it doesn't want just anybody doesn't want anybody taking down, it wants only the root guy or gal the root user okay? So now my Ethernet adapter down if I go ifconfig it's not going to show up there you can see it's not there anymore I've taken it down. Then what I want to do is use the same command use sudo of course because this is stuff that the system doesn't want just anybody messing with and then I go eth0 and then I'm going to assign it okay a hardware address okay and then let's use a real simple and easy to distinguish hardware address this is MAC Address we say Hardware Address we're talking about MAC Address this is a globally unique address normally you can see here here's one right here this is for the Wi-Fi adapter so it's usually in hexa-decimal so it uses it uses zero through nine and then a b c d e and f all right and so I'm just going to sign it a a random number like matter of fact let's go ahead and now let's do let's do the eth0 and we want to assign it that IP address says it cannot assign the requested address let's change it to there we go it it recognized that my 00000 address was not a legitimate address all right. Now let's assume that this is an address that I've discovered that is on the white list of the AP Whit list is the addresses that can connect to it so now that I've changed my hardware address I can connect to the Wi-Fi AP as well so now if I go go ifconfig eth0 up all right and of course I have to use the sudo. I can see you've been doing this for a long time because in the old days you just root right. I I've I've been doing it for a long time and I've never really fully adapted to having to use sudo all the time because I'm yeah as a hacker I'm usually always operating in root mode uh and my still my inclination is the switch over to the root user and just do everything from there but in teaching classes I think it's probably a good idea to use sudo so that the students don't go ahead and switch over to root and then end up getting themselves packed. So now let's go ahead and do ifconfig and now let's go up to our eth0 if it's there it is and you can see I've change the MAC Address all right. So let me repeat why is this is important because many of the security Engineers who set up Wi-Fi access points put in a white list based upon the MAC Address based upon the MAC Address and so it keeps everybody out but the people who have those MAC Address if I know their Mac addresses and I can show you in the future tutorial how you can discover them then I can simply emulate, I can replicate their MAC Address on my system so that my system looks like one of those systems that's allowed to access the Wi-Fi access point it's also really useful for wi-fi hacking not only for accessing but for Wii hacking because sometimes you need to replicate a in a user's MAC Address to be able for instance to knock them off their Wi-Fi sometimes you you can knock somebody off the Wi-Fi AP or use their MAC Address to be able to do things to the Wi-Fi ADP that will help you hack that system. That's brilliant Occupy The Web thanks so much for sharing you know I amI always say this someone who really really knows what they're doing can explain it simply and you you know I love the way that you can bring it down so you obviously know huge amounts but you explained it in simple terms so you know really appreciate you doing that thanks so much. For everyone who's watching please put comments below stuff that you want us to see or stuff that you want to see, stuff that you want us to cover we've got a whole bunch of ideas Occupy The Web I really appreciate you doing this thank you. Thanks David I always appreciate being on your show and I look forward to our next meeting.",

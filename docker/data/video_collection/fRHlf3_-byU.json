    "description": "PURCHASE THE XFX AMD RX 470 HERE:   OR THE MSI VERSION HERE:   - The RX 470 is often overlooked thanks to the presence of the RX 480. However, if one can find the 470 for around $160-$170 USD and is interested in either 1080p or 1440p gaming, I say \"Look no further!\"  FACEBOOK:  TWITTER: @GregSalazarYT INSTAGRAM: @GregSalazarYT  Subscribe to the channel!

    "transcript": "you want the clear-cut no BS 1440p RX 470 benchmarks I want as little film to edit as possible just being honest here i purchased this XFX RX 470 from bestbuy last week for 160 US dollars killer price for sneaky performance it's often been advertised as the 1080p sweet spot graphics card but if we make a few compromises that I personally believe are worth making the RX 470 can be an entry-level 1440p gaming card as well the test bench ,an i7 5820k @ 4.6 gigahertz on an X99 taichi from AsRock and 32 gigabytes of Trident Z ddr4 from G-skill huge shout-out by the way to thermaltake for this epic set up more on that in a separate video the RX 470 here will be running at stock out-of-the-box additional overclocking Headroom is minimal anyway the card will also be sporting the latest crimson relive drivers available on amd's website are you ready here we go let's jump right in with GTA 5 first while maintaining a high graphics preset that's everything under the graphics tab set to high that can possibly be set to high with the exception of both anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion boom 62 FPS on average 40 on the low end frame times were also very consistent and flat a few tiny spikes here & there thanks to a slight GPU bottleneck but overall acceptable scores something else i do want to mention swapping the 5820k for either a 67 or 6600 k or their kaby lake counterparts with an identical frequency will yield very similar frame rates next up Witcher 3 very GPU intensive and this chart shows it. I didn't want to chop into graphical settings anymore than i did at this point just comes down to personal preferences 56 FPS for the average even so 37 is still a decent minimum what we don't want to see something like 20 or 30 on the low end which would indicate a stark contrast and compute potential for this specific game AKA a severe bottleneck in street terms battlefield one to my surprise tolerated the mid-range polaris GPU in this case the 5820k's 12 threads all 12 of them are working very hard as is the graphics card but this is a good thing it indicates a beautiful optimization over 60 FPS on average with infrequent dips to the mid-forties I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game not because I'm good because I'm most definitely not but because it's always smooth no matter what i do to the pc in question I even down clocked this exact cpu to 1.2 gigahertz and enjoyed my experience more on that in a video right here now let's move on to a very CPU intensive title my favorite cities skylines in this instance frame rates were as expected if 22 seems low it's because it is it's completely normal though replacing the RX 470 here with a gtx 1070 changes literally nothing which means that our cpu is calling the shots see this video here for more details i love benchmarking this game because it utilizes resources in unique ways let's end on another good note how about a racing game this time around Forza 6 apex chances are if your computer can run windows 10 it can run Forza 6 but in-game graphics are still top notch and in the high settings preset burning rubber around the wet top gear test track 67 FPS on average fifty one for the minimum very narrow range which is exactly what we want to see keep in mind that these benchmarks were in 1440p all of these benchmarks had they been in 1080p all of these settings could have been bumped into the ultra territory with similar FPS so that's that the clear-cut no BS cookie cutter benchmarking run of the AMD RX 470 if you appreciate this quick and dirty style format video give this one a thumbs-up give it a thumbs down if you feel like complete opposite or if you hate everything about life be sure to click that subscribe if you haven't already I'll catch you in the next video this is Salazar studio thanks for learning with us",

    "transcript": "I have got one of the coolest Wi-Fi devices. One of the most common complaints is probably the Wi-Fi is slow. Big shout out to Matt and Mac from Ekahau for organizing me a Sidekick 2. But let's have a look at this Sidekick 2 we'll open this and there you go Sidekick 2 nice portable device which allows you for instance to use your iPhone to dynamically detect what a building looks like and then help you improve the Wi-Fi. The barriers to entry for Wi-Fi have been lowered dramatically through the Sidekick 2. I've got it connected to my iPhone 15 very simple create a new project as an example, say start now and run just go and then it can pick up what my room looks like and then it can work out the Wi-Fi coverage in this room. I could then inspect the Wi-Fi information. In the real world you're obviously going to walk around and do a proper site survey this makes it much much easier. Hopefully I'm going to show you a lot more in upcoming videos big thanks to Matt and Mac once again.",

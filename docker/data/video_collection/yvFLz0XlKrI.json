    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here, back with another video And today, I'm very excited to be looking at what must be one of first all in one pack 4K 360 cameras. I mean look at it, you can... ...this thing is unusual. After I have unboxed this and used this, I will have a separate upload in full 360, so you can experience what this looks like. A lot of people don't know that YouTube supports 360 video. But one of the drawbacks has been the fact that it's relatively low resolution, on some of the pre-configured packaged 360 cameras. This changes that, because this has 4K now. So you've got more resolution to work with, hardly ever a bad thing. Shall we do the dance? Now it looks like this is also... a little bit rugged It says 2 m' 6 ft shockproof. freeze-proofed to -10C, dust proof, splash proof It's also got NFC, Wi-Fi built in, and 12 mega pixels CMOS sensor. So... This is the core... of what's gonna makeup your 360 image, it's these two SP 360's. Look at those guys.. Now that is a substantial unit, now what I like immediately, nice tactile legit buttons. not a touchscreen. So you can switch the mode... this looks like a menu button Big red record button and then a Wi-Fi button as well. And it feels rugged NFC Logo... so it does support NFC I am assuming that's going to be to pair it up to your smartphone. A standard tripod mount, in this location here, HDMI outlet, a USB to charge it up, as well as a micro SD card slot. And it also looks like a couple of microphones on the top So this is interesting... it's looks to me like there is multiple Mic points on this unit here. Now it opens up on the bottom, looks like the battery just slots in. So that's one... that's two Who know maybe one day, all of your Unbox Therapy videos will be in 360. And if you want to spin the camera around that see Jack, then, you can. (-____-) Or can you??? This is a little micro fiber cleaning cloth, for your lenses. Look at the size of those lenses, you're going to need it. A dedicated charger ... you can just have it charging through this and keep an extra battery charged that way. A standard power brick with USB on one end, 1,250 mil powers two of them, two cameras, makes sense. Place to keep everything. Ooooh! and there's your micro USB cable. Nice!... a little spherical lens cap. Oh... wow! If you wanted even something more rugged, You would screw this one on to protect the lens itself. That's interesting! So it looks like we've got three of these little units. Now let's go ahead and look at the accessories box, over here. This looks like you could mount it on a drone if you wanted to that would be nuts! Mounting this thing on a drone... 360... in the sky? What are you a bird, now? This looks like a suction mount. Here is a remote that straps to your wrist like a watch and has complete controls for the actual camera. This guy allows you to mount the cameras back-to-back, That is a robust selfie stick, by the way. That's like... police officers in certain parts of the world they walk around with these babies but, they ain't taking pictures. You have a dual tripod mount, so this is going to be to mount both of the cameras Check it! Little door... and... you go ahead and tighten that up. (happiness) 360 time, Oh My Goodness!! That thing is no joke. I'm into this. If really kinda gone after with a different approach.(unclear) If you're wanting to see footage, a video will be uh... available for you to watch and really experience the 360 thing In this case, in far better resolution than what is available, at least to me in the past, so definitely go check that out. Perfect Pitch black (oohing)",

    "transcript": "- The power of the sun! (makes power up noise) Back in the year 1949, a man heard a very fast baby say it's first word. He said, \"Adidas.\" And that's when John Adidas had the idea to found a company that makes sports apparel, like shoes and pants and now headphones. Ooh. Today we're gonna be taking a look at the RPT02 Sol headphones from Adidas. I don't know if it's supposed to be repeat, I assume it, but I've been pronouncing it 'arpet' like carpet. So what makes these really interesting is that they're solar powered. Yes by the god's rays they cast down upon the Earth, you too shall listen to music through his goodwill and actually it's the sun, nuclear fusion, UV radiation. On the top of this, on the headband there's a whole, there's like a solar panel, which is a pretty neat. So what features does Adidas have on their headphones aside from the solar panels? Well they have one powered by light. We covered that. Two, built from recycled plastics. That's cool. Three, designed for durability. Four, up to 80 hours of stored play time. And five, they have intuitive controls. And because they're actually solar powered, they don't include a charging cable. Luckily you can still charge them via USB C. Now an interesting thing about this is that Adidas obviously doesn't make headphones, so somebody else is making it for them. It's a company called a Zouindustries. They're behind Marshall, like the AMP company's headphone division. They also make Urban Ears, which I haven't seen a product from in a long time, but I remember like maybe six, seven years ago, Urban Ears were like really popular, because they were like a style focused headphone, and now there's a lot more competition in the style focused headphone. And here they are. One of the things I really like about how these look, is first off they have this cool texture all along it. It's a consistent theme across the top of the headband. And the other thing I like is the weaving of the fabric that goes on the headband on the inside and on the ear cups. It's very reminiscent of some of the really cool kind of weaving patterns that are on the upper soles of like a lot of their shoes. So these kind of remind me of like the like Yeezy Boost 350s, or some of their Ultra Boost lineup. You have like a solid weave there, with this cool mottled pattern that goes into like this full cross hatching. And they do another cool thing that they do with the shoes which is like having a bottom layer that's colored. So as you can see these have these little specks of this like neon green that's coming through, because these are actually removable, the fabric, which is great, because what are you gonna be doing with these headphones? These are really designed for, you know, what Adidas wants you to do, sports. So you can take off the whole piece, you can wash it. This is just solid plastic. You can also take off the headband, come off, and the same deal. You can take the fabric off and wash it, which is great because you're gonna get sweaty in these, especially if you're like, I don't know in the sun going for a run, which is what I did with them. This whole headband is the solar panel. It's this textured plastic that they have. It doesn't look like your usual solar cell. There's an, there's adjustments. It's this textured plastic that allows you to adjust. I think the way they put the labels is really cool too, which is great because you may get these a little mixed up. Another thing that was smart about what they designed is that you can see that here, there's a USBC port, and if I took this off, notice it'll pass through separate from it. So they actually have a label on the inside of the ear cup and on the inside of the headphone, so that you can line 'em up when you're trying to get them back on. So you might be thinking, \"Hey these are pretty small ear cups,\" and that's because these are on ear headphones as opposed to over ear headphones. Whereas these have a lot of clamping force, and they go right on your ear, so that when you put them on and you're moving around, they stay relatively in place, which is great when you're running, or if you're doing movements like, if you're the gym doing movements like lifting and stuff like that. Like they say pretty firm. I had no issues. My usual gym and workout headphones are the Beats Solo Three, which are another pair of on ears, they're about the same size. So on the controls you have this a one button, it's a multipurpose button. By default one press is that it lights this little light here up. So what this is is that it's your light meter, it tells you how much charge you're getting in from the headset. So if you're like in direct, full sunlight, you'll see this turn on and all three layers will be lit up. On this side, this is kind of neat, it's a joystick. It's like a, you can go up, down, left, right or press. It's like the navigation nipple on the back of your, it's like the navigation nipple on your back, on the back of your monitor. It's like the navigation nipple. I didn't have any issue controlling things accurately, but I did notice like when I was wearing these and laying down on the couch, it might push up and like push this in a direction. So it's like my videos kept changing. I was watching YouTube videos. - These just look like socks. - I know. Well they look, I was gonna say they look like the uppers on a lot of, like a lot of runners. - I mean Adidas does make socks. - Yeah, they also make runners. Did you not know this? Is this news to you? - No, I've had (indistinct) - Okay, I was like Adidas makes shoes, man. That's like their thing. Well we'll talk about that after our sponsor.

Use the code LINUS at the link below to safe 10% today. Let's look at these headphones. So these have Bluetooth 5.2, they also have Qualcomm Aptx HD, for that high quality audio, as well as I believe AAC as their default codec. With the iPhone, I think they just default to AAC. LDAC would've been nice to see, especially on a new pair of headphones. I understand if that might be a little bit of a high power codec and you wouldn't be able to benefit from it because these are solar powered, they're supposed to sip on it, you know they give a little sip sip. They also have IPX4 sweat resistance, so splashes, sweat, it's gonna have you covered there. I would've like to see a little bit of a higher IP rating for water, just because if you're like, I don't know, getting soaked out in the rain on a longer run, you wanna just be sure that these are gonna be okay. Especially if you don't have a place to stash them. Like if these could fold in to be smaller, that'd be great, 'cause the whole point is I want to toss these in like my gym bag and have them be as small as possible, and I'm carrying as little on me as possible. Sadly they don't fold, so this is the size. And they also don't come with a carrying case, which at their price is very disappointing. Speaking of price, 229. Compared to my Beats, which are 199, but like they've been on the market for a long time and you can get them for just substantially cheaper. I saw 'em at Costco for 150, that's when I bought, or I guess 180 Canadian was what I bought them for. So like 150-ish, probably less. And now we're gonna take a little listen. Psych, I've already listened to these so I don't need to do it right now. I have a few thoughts on them. One is that they have a lot of bass, like a lot of bass, which is great for when you're working out because it's, you want that pulse that kind of pushes you. I think that these sound amazing for all of the music that I'm listening to in my pumpin' playlist, which is, you know for pumpin' iron. They're not detailed, they're not reference at all. And I say out of the box, they're way too boomy, but they have an EQ in the app which we're gonna take a look at in a moment, and you just crank that down, it sounds a lot better. You still get that oomph, but it's not overpowering and destroying the music. I usually get annoyed when apps are kind of essential for headphones, but this case, I think there's, it makes a better point. When you get into the app you can see the drain and the charge that's currently happening to the headphones. So right now they're draining because we're in a studio, there's no sunlight, and there just wirelessly connecting. If I start playing music on it, you can see that the power usage increases. And down here it has historical data. So you can see like in the last six hours how much charge and discharge there's been. So they've been off for the most part, and they've just been slowly, just a neutral level discharge, just because batteries slowly discharge over time. But if we take it outside, like if I run outside right now, you should see, you should see it. You'll see the app, it'll show me how much sun it's getting. So you can see I've left them literally on the ground outside, and you can see in the app right here, that says plus 6.7 milli amps. So that's because it's actually currently charging. Because we're playing music, it is discharging, but if I go and I, if I pause the music just down here, we'll see that the power was just going down. It was at 10, now it's at six. Yeah, there we go. It's turned yellow. So as you can see we're now gaining charge. So it does depend on your angle towards the sun as well as the conditions. When I had perfect sun on it over the weekend, it was charging at about 30 milli amp hours, which is not fast at all. I left it in the sun for like two hours, and it went up from 50% to 56%, which is really not much. But if I was running outside right now, I'd be losing almost no charge. And if it's actually sunny out, I gained charge. I gained battery on a run I went on. I went from 53 to 54%, which is nuts. And speaking of battery life, these claim 80 hours, which is kind of crazy but also really hard to test, because if you literally leave these anywhere near a window they just charge. you use them in the sun outside, they just charge, I was unable to make them drain. I got them and when I unboxed 'em they were at 51%. I used them for a couple of hours inside, they dropped to 49. Then the moment I had, like there was any sunshine in the room, and I wasn't listening to them, they started charging just passively. And by the end of the weekend they charged to like 58, 50, 60%. And that was with continued use trying them out. It's really neat. Honestly as long as you have them like out and about, which makes kind of, I guess kind of lends credence to the idea that they don't give you a case, because you're gonna just leave them out in the sun. That I, I would worry about like maybe some of the degradation of the other materials in here. Leaving things in the sun is pretty famous for you know being bad for stuff. Other things in the app, you have an equalizer, you have some presets. You can also just make a custom equalizer. You can see this is how I've made set my equalizer. This is what I thought sounded the best. Bumped up a little bit in the higher frequencies, and turned everything down really low in the bass. I have a couple of issues with the app. So one thing that I find really annoying about this, is that it has a permanent notification icon in my shade that tells me that my headphones are connected. I know I can, I can turn off the notification shade but it's so stupid. Why, why is this here? And the worst part is that if I disconnect the headphones from turning them off, the app will still stay up here. You can change this button. They call it your action button, so it allows you to take, so single press or hold is always tied to checking the lighting conditions, which is dumb, 'cause if they're on my head why can't I press that once to do something? Like just I'm not, I can't look at it. You can change it to double press. And these are your three options. You get three options. Default voice assistant, Spotify, and Adidas running. Why are you limiting me? I get the idea of like, you know integrating it into your running routine. So the Adidas running app will allow you do like segments. So this would like could start and stop a segment, or pause and resume your running. And with Spotify you can just like have a button so that like you go, this is my workout playlist, I just want my playlist to be played on shuffle, and it'll just automatically integrate with Spotify. Why can't you integrate with, integrate with other apps? Also why is the default voice assistant the only options? It's just like, it's just you could give me other things that aren't covered by the joystick. With your multidirectional control nipple you get power, a long press for power, longer press for Bluetooth, one press for play, pause, right and left are skip, up and down are volume, you don't get anything like fast forwarding or rewinding through a song you can't scrub anything. Would be nice. So yeah, I guess I got a little angry there. I did get a little worked up and I'm a little hot. This RGB sweater from lttstore.com is a getting me a little bit sweaty, so hence the name sweater, but that's just 'cause it's warm down here. It's great in almost every other circumstance. Not too hot, not too cool. Lttstore.com. (makes kissing sounds) And this is a mic test of the Adidas RPT02 S-O-L's . Do I sound like a robo-caller, or do you get to hear the details of my sultry baritone? Let me know in the comments. Would I recommend these at $230? Yeah, I think they're actually pretty good at what they do. Their build quality is quite good. It is all plastic but still feels very strong, very premium. The fabric covers are great for being able, to just easily being able to wash them because you're gonna get sweaty with these. And I think that they're pretty comfortable. I mean any sort of on your headphone is gonna suck especially if you wear glasses, and your ears are gonna get a little sweaty, but that's why you got all this fabric here. They sounded pretty good, and the charging works a lot better than I thought it would. It charges really slowly, but it charges faster than it discharges. And if you want to charge faster, you do have the option of USB-C. One thing that would've been nice is if they had like an auxiliary input, so I could listen to them attached to something, and then not use any of the battery at all because with all of the charging and discharging cycles, I would wonder if 80 hour battery life is going to degrade pretty quickly. And then also like I don't know how the battery longevity is going to be affected by it. I think they're pretty good. They're great for working out. They've nailed that aspect. Compared to my Solo Threes on sale, these are a bit of a hard recommend. If you're gonna be buy- if you're looking for something in this price range though, that's specifically for working out, I think these are great. They've nailed the features that you want to see from a exercising headphone. And I really enjoy these because I don't like putting things in my ears when I'm running or when I'm working out. You get all the body noise when kind of plugging your ears. These end up being a great option. Some of you might be like, \"Oh, there's no noise canceling.\" Well you can't do noise canceling with on ears, and they actually do a pretty good job of isolating, anyways. I would, I don't know, I like them a lot. I think they're really good, and I think they nailed what they set out to do. The price is kind of expensive, and I think you really have to be the judge of whether or not you want to spend $230 on what I'd say is a dedicated exercise pair of headphones. Thanks for watching Short Circuit. If you like these solar powered headphones, maybe check out James's review of the Urbanistas. They're solar power headphones that he did not like as much.",

    "description": "Follow my stupid antics on Twitter:  On Tuesday, Apple announced the new iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X at the new Apple Park campus' Steve Jobs Theatre. With a new all-screen design, iPhone X looks pretty greator at least, it has finally caught up to the Galaxy S8, LG V30, and other flagship phones from this year. The most immediately noticeable omission is the home button and Touch ID. Apple has moved to a gesture-based user interface. At first, it sounds pretty neat! But the more I think about it, the less convinced I am that it is going to be better than the classic home button. I suggest an alternate design I wish Apple would have considered.",

    "transcript": "Watch this dramatic video that I posted on Twitter and then we'll talk about it. I don't know anything about user interface design So maybe I'm completely off base here But the new iPhone 10 just seems idiotic Instead of pressing the bottom of the screen like a home button like we've done for the last 10 years and like you still do on their other new phones You have to swipe up swiping up on these phones and on every other phone get you to Control Center But on here it takes you to the home screen to go to control center. You've got to swipe down from the top right. WHAT?! On this phone swiping down from the top right takes you to the Notification Center, Which you can only do from the top left. It just seems silly. For the last 10 years they've told us this is a home button. This area is a home button with the iPhone 7. Look at this This is a button right so it's not physically moving It's pressure-sensitive, but it still simulates a home button Press they have this wonderful 3d touch engine that they've had for the last several years. That's better than everything on the market Why not use this your pressure-sensitive screen to simulate a home button? Press just push that hard and it takes you back to the home button You can still swipe up for Control Center. You can still swipe down for notifications. You very apparent ease in your whole life IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE...... Based on the number of likes and retweets that this thing got I'm not the only person thinking this now Let me clarify for those of you that are still a tad confused I'm not suggesting that Apple should have gone with a virtual home button like a few sites have rumored for iPhone 10 That's ugly and it's a waste of space No, do you see that little nub that Apple put at the bottom of the iPhone 10 screen? I propose that when you 3d touch that area it simulates a home button press. Basically the galaxy s 8 implements this perfectly. I can still tap content at the very bottom of the screen But as soon as I hard press, I get home You don't lose any screen real estate and you don't mess with the tried-and-true formula of the home button Honestly when Apple moved to iPhone 7 and moved away from a physical clicking button I thought this is where they were going Trying to retrain people that have made a habit out of the home button for the last 10 years seems silly especially when it's just for the sake of change a A tiny 3d touch home button area could have allowed everything to stay the same. One press and you'll go to the springboard, two presses and you'll get to the multitask app switcher, and a long press takes you to Siri now I'll explain why I think Apple's method is dumb for several reasons in just a second But most people who tweet it at me to disagree said generally the Apple didn't try this nearly Focus groups. That was me and I'm sure you didn't say like I'm sure you're lovely people. I apologize Of course Apple does there are a multi-billion dollar company? there are entire departments filled with dozens of people at Apple whose entire career is to study the apex between profit maximization and user experience I mean, I'm just some college-age numbskull with a YouTube channel but Don't think for a second that Apple is infallible or that they don't make mistakes or that they don't do stupid stuff for the sake Of marketing. Do you remember the third-generation? IPod shuffle. Yeah, the one with no buttons in an attempt to make this sexy tiny little music player They removed all of the buttons and put them on to the included headphones if you wanted to use your own headphones Would you probably did because those ones sucked you'd have to buy your own? Dongle to add buttons to your iPod without a dongle the iPod didn't even work it completely ruined the user experience and it was all because Apple wanted a sexy little product that looked amazing that was tiny in their advertisements and guess what people hated it and they reverted to the bigger iPod shuffle with buttons on it for The next generation they make mistakes. Now. I'm not saying that iPhone 10 is the next third-generation iPod shuffle It's going to be a success and I'm very excited to own one. However, this same principle of marketing Usability applies when the iPhone 6s came out there were only two advertisements that specifically highlighted 3d touch Despite it being the single biggest new feature of the iPhone They stopped advertising 3d touch and shifted ads to hands-free Siri, which wasn't even exclusive to the iPhone 6s Why did they do this? Well because it was hard to show people on TV the difference between a firm press and a tap You have to try this 3d touch engine to realize how cool it is It's way easier to show swipes on TV than it is to show a pressure-sensitive screen and that's evidence in the iPhone 10 swiping around the new iPhone 10 UI and the commercials looks fun and cool and new and efficient and different and it makes you feel Like you need it, even though it provides a worse user experience Now you may be thinking okay, you're being dramatic swiping up on the phone to go home. It's not hard in fact It might even be faster than a home button press and you know what you're probably right the home gesture isn't really the problem it Actually reminds me a lot of the late palms webOS Which basically invents many modern creature comforts that we enjoy on both iOS and Android Now the problem is not really with the home button It's the multitasking and control center, which is messed up because of the home button in the Verge's hands-on coverage of iPhone 10 Nilay Patel fuddled around with the multitasking on his hands on video The app switcher requires you to swipe up and then hold it to enter the app switcher mode Which seems a lot slower than just a double home button, press the most annoying problem However is control center Which I don't know about you but I use all the time with this new big screen and the tall body You can't reach it with one hand Even marques Brownlee's enormous hand looks like it would struggle reaching the top of the status bar without Shimmying his grip up the phone or without needing to use a second hand now Android manufacturers have learned this and most of them allow you to pull down the Notification shade when you're on the home screen without needing to reach to the very very tippy top of the device Lastly a few niggles Siri on iPhone 10 requires you to hold the lockscreen button Which again requires you to change your grip from its natural position more importantly though? We also lose parity across iOS devices Accessing control center is now different on the iPad than it is from the iPhone 7 Which is the same as the new iPhone 8 but is different from the new - 10 it's becoming fragmented So I said on Twitter Sure Apple if you want to use this new gesture based system fine, but change it on every iOS 11 device So at least they're the same - which many of you responded well Why would they go to a gesture based system when the other devices have a better home button, and that's exactly my point Apple is it wrong? And I'm not right? It's just an opinion and I would love to hear yours and my spot-on am I way off base? Let's talk about it Sibley in the comments section down below if you liked this video be sure to give it a like if you think I'm a big bumbling idiot that other button seems to work okay too Subscribe for more awesome tech videos like these but as always stay snazzy. See you later folks",

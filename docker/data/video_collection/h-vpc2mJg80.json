    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and I'm here with Ro. - Hello. - Today, we are celebrating the release of a new phone by Samsung. (gasping) (exclaiming) - Party, party, party, party, party, party, party. - At this point I know you guys have probably seen a million unboxings, because a lot of people got it early. I did not. But, I just got my pre-order in. - Oooh. - I opened it, and I brought it over to Ro's house, because I thought, I wanted to show you this phone, and just have your reaction to it. - Oh my gosh, I love this. - But I... - Welcome to Ro reacts... - I have two phones, though. - To technology. - Two? - Yes. They came out with a bunch of different phones. - Oh, they're different colors. - They are, yeah, this one's a little purple. - Very cool, oh purple. - And this is the S20 Ultra, which is actually their higher end line. So this shoots in 8K. And you know what else? - Shut up. - Yes, so you... - 8K? - On your freaking phone. - You're gonna, it's like, you're gonna see through my soul. - You're going to... - You can't even see my pores, you're gonna see through me. I mean how can you get more than 4K? I don't film in 4K because the file size is humongous. - The only videos that I have... - The file size is this big. - That aren't in 4K is when I'm here shooting with you. - Oh, wow, these are your downgraded videos. - Listen, no! But listen. - Justine I feel so bad. - I'm gonna get you on 4K. No, no! - I'm like your lowest (sobs) - Oh my gosh, no! Okay, so the thing is... - The only videos Justine shoots not in 4K are with me. - But... - I'm kinda flattered, and at the same time... - Listen! - I also feel terrible, - No! - I need to get a new camera. - If I wasn't telling you right now that this wasn't 4K, you wouldn't know. - Yeah, is this 4K or not? - This is what I... - We were just April Fools-ing you. (chuckles) - The thing that I think you would like about shooting in 4K and still editing in a 1080 timeline, is... - Okay, what? - We both love punching in to get like expressions... - Yeah. - And silly things. - Yes. - Cause it can't hide it. - So you wouldn't have much quality loss. So you'd be able to... - When you punch in? - Yes, because you're still shooting in a 1080 timeline. - Wow. - But shooting in 4K you'll have so much more to work with. When you're ready, - Okay. - to do a little upgrade, let me know. I could make a whole video about it, a whole series. So there's like a wide angle, an ultra-wide angle, and a zoom. And, this is something that was incredible, they did a demo at the press event. You can do 100x zoom. In a photo. Like, - 100? - Do you know how far away that is? So this is .5, this is a wide angle, so you can see Ro's incredible set up, which is awesome. - Look at these lights. - This is 4x. Oh my gosh, okay, so, here's 10. (mumbles) Here's 30x. Look how zoomed in. - You could take everything I'm doing. - I mean, you can, I can see into your, oh my gosh, look, I can see your new blender over there. - My blender. Ooh, the quiet one. - There it is. - Okay, can you see my gum? - Yep, I see it. (laughs) Oh my gosh, how funny. (mumbles) And what I like that Samsung is doing is they're really kind of pushing that technology forward. Like, look, this is the 100x does not look that incredible, like it's not like, \"Wow, this is an impressive zoom lens. \"Like this is, something that really is impossible to get.\" You can still get the shot. It doesn't look great, but you can still do it. - You can still see it, you can get it. Literally, I'm... - So let's maybe shoot a little 8K video here, which will be downgraded to 1080, but... - Yes. - I want to show you guys Ro's set up. - 1080! - Because it honestly is so good. So here it is, you've got your lights. - We have two little Kinos in the corners, - Nice reflection. that bounce the light off of the ceiling. And then we have two big Kinos in front of us, which counteract cause we're backlit. We are completely backlit cause this is my real backyard outside. And so if you don't have the big Kinos in the front, we are so dark, we're like shadowed. You can't even make out our faces. Even when you bump the brightness on the camera, - Yeah, it's, you can't. - It's major shadow, I look like I have like a beard. They make it so even if you're filming at night, still looks like it's daytime. - Yeah, it's crazy, you can even put them outside. The thing with this it too, is it is 8K. - How much storage is that gonna take up? - Well, you can expand... - That minute video. - this phone up to 1.5 terabytes of storage. They also have a feature where you can do Quick Share now, so it's kind of like Air Drop for Android. - Mike's gonna want this now. It shoots in 8K, he's gonna be like we can just film with that when we do vlogs and stuff, he's gonna love this. - I see him, I see him over there ordering it. - Can you see him? - [Mike] I do want it. - They also have a pink S20 that came out, I was hoping that it was in the... - (gasps) Pink? - It's a beautiful color. - Shut up. - Yes, look at this color, it's perfect. - (gasps) That's pretty. Oh, that's a good color. - I know. Yeah, they also have a little baby blue, basically like the color of my shirt right now. - Dear designers, whoever picked this color, I approve. - Beautiful. - This is a great color, this is beautiful. - I just wish they made it in the higher version, this is the lower end model, but... - Oh, they only have it in one? - Yeah. - Oh, it's like a limited color thing. - Yeah, but it's okay, I'm struggling with it. - We have a visitor. We have Blueberry Muffin everybody. Okay, so I have two dogs. We have Cookie, who you saw. And then this is Blueberry Muffin. - Well, this can actually be a good test... - Okay, you can sit here. - to try out this thing that they have on here, it's called single shot. And what's cool, oh, sorry, single take. - [Together] Single take. - This is really fun because this will basically shoot like a ten second clip, and it'll give you a bunch of content out of that. Ready? - Okay, what do I do? (relaxed jazz music) - And then, oh, try a slightly different angle. - Was that gross? - Did you not like our angles? - I was just spitting out, I was spitting out my gum. - It didn't like our angle, okay. - It thought I was gross playing with my gum. Okay, let's bring the puppy in too, then it will love the puppy. - Okay, ready? - Okay, wait, wait, wait, okay. (calm jazz music) (laughing) - She's making pig noises. (kissing sounds) - So now look at this, this is so great. So it'll give us like a little video. (bouncy music) And then it gives you like different ones, so this is the one that it thought would be the best. I'm not sure if that's like the best face that you've ever made? - I think it's a winner, winner. - It's you know, oh my gosh, look, it did like a little crop as well. That's cute. - See, it likes puppies. - And look, it gives you a couple different options. So this is kind of fun if you're just like, doing something? - Oh, so if you just have a minute, and it can make a bunch of different medias from that... - Yeah. - What's it called again? - It's called single take. Here's the one that we did before. (bouncy music) Just being silly. I think I like this one better, actually. This one did a good job. - I mean, it's great. - Look at that, it added a beauty filter and everything. - Gorg. - Thank you Samsung. A lot of times when I go to take a selfie on Samsung phones, I'm like, \"Wow, why do I look so good?\" It's because the beauty filters are on. So yeah, it's really fun. Obviously I'm such a huge iPhone fan, but like, I still always have a secondary Android phone. So the secondary phone that I have been using has actually been this one. - Ooh, the one in another color, I saw that. - Yeah, this one is called the Z Flip. So what's cool about this, is it freaking folds. (claps) - Shut up. - It folds! Like look at this! - I thought you were breaking your phone. I thought you were going crack, I was like (gasps) - I mean I'm not that strong. What's crazy about this is they developed this very thin sheet of glass, and it's really pretty impressive. So they had the Galaxy Fold that folded like this way before, but then they just recently came out with this, and I didn't think that I was actually going to like it as much as I do, and I really like it. - Wow, can I hold it? - Yes. - Okay, how aggressive can you be with this flip? - You can be, I mean, I don't know I haven't really given it like an aggressive test. - I'm kinda wondering like, can I be Ro in high school? Cause Ro in high school had a cellphone that flipped closed. - Me too. - And when I was like mm-hmm (jabbering), and then I'll be like, (claps). And I love that, it was so satisfying, like that's how I would end a call, I'd go snap. - So satisfying. - I'm very concerned about it. - So this is certified up to about 200,000 folds. - Okay, the color is cool as well. - It's a great color. I want to show you something else that's really cool. When you double tap the power button, which also, by the way, doubles as a fingerprint sensor. - Do not tell me, I can't handle this. - Look, it's us. (gasps) And you hit the volume button... - Are you kidding me? - And it takes a picture. - This is taking a picture? - Yeah! - Are you serious? - And then I'll flip it open like, hello! Opens up the camera already. - You don't even half to... - That's us! Like look how cool, like feel it. You can definitely feel the crease. (stutters) - I just can't believe it bends. - I thought that it would be annoying, but like you don't even realize it's there half the time. Like, I wanted to be that person that's like, \"I see the crease, this is annoying, I don't like it.\" But I couldn't be that person because it didn't really affect me much at all. - We have a food setting, very important on a phone. - Samsung does do a really great job of having like different auto settings. - Everybody I know takes pictures of their food, so I like that there's a food setting. - I wanted to show you YouTube really quick before we... - Ooh, show me, show me. - see anything else on here. So what's neat about this, is all right, let's see here. I was like, I figure Ro probably has a new video out, where'd it go? - I tested my dog's IQ. - Oh my gosh, here's your little video. And what's great is, again, we can fold it, - What, what, how are you doing it, shut up! - Yeah, so you can be like scrolling down here, and watching the video up here. - Are you guys seeing this? This is... - They probably have already seen it, but... - You can scroll here. - I just love how excited you are about it. - This is literally like a mini laptop. - Yes! - Like the smallest little laptop, like look it's my size. Oh my gosh, Justine, look at me, do I look like I'm, like, on my little laptop? - It also reminds me of like a compact, like a makeup mirror type thing. - It is, it's that size. It looks like, you're just like... - So when we go into the camera setting, we can do (mumbles) - Oh sorry, it's still on the food setting. I got really excited. - But you flip that up, and it basically is like a little tripod, which is kind of neat. And, this is really neat. I didn't realize... - For your pictures, it's a tripod, so you can film yourself. - It has gesture control. - Shut up. - So if I, okay, oh! - Oh! - So that, oh shoot, it's still going. Okay, put your hands down. So it has gesture control. So if you start waving at it, like it'll start the timer. Ready? - Okay, wait. (calm piano music) - It's really fun. - I love this. - Like I like this phone so much more than I thought that I would. It's really fun. - I love this. - It's just fun, like, just, ah, I really, really like it. This could be great for Tik Toks. The other day I was making a Tik Tok, as I have been doing. And... - I follow you on Tik Tok. - I was going... - I follow like ten people. - I was going crazy, actually I should maybe show it to you, and catch your reaction for this. - Oh, let me see, I want to see what you've been up to. - I had to get my other phone, sorry. (bouncy music) (chuckling) - This is why... - You are moving so fast. - I love Tik Tok. (rap music) I was actually losing my mind. - Did anyone see this? (laughing) - But, when I was doing this, this couple inside they were like, they didn't even phase them. I said, \"Just making a Tik Tok.\" They were like, \"Yeah, that's what we thought.\" I was like, I'm so glad that we are in a time that I can be weird and do weird things, and they're okay with it. - You were literally jumping up so fast, and they're just like, - Yes, ah. So, I guess that's really it. I just wanted to show these to you, I love bringing over new tech and showing it to you. - This is so cool. - What do you think? - I love it, I'm really into this, I am, I want to know, when this screen will give out. - I will let you know. - But it looks really good, and I actually don't mind the little bump there either. - Yeah, it's not really that big of a deal. - No, it's so little. - Yeah. - You know, it's very minor, and it's so satisfying. - Well guys thank you so much for watching. Ro, thank you so much for lending your reaction to the new Samsung phones, this is so much fun. - So cool. - If you guys have anything that you would like me to bring to show Ro, tech-wise, cause I feel like I've got a lot of really cool things that I think you'd be into. So, - Yes. - Let us know in the comments below. - Let her know, I want to learn about everything. - Make sure you guys also go check out Ro's channel, we have so many videos that we've made together in the past. - A lot. - But I will put all of her links in the description below, and that's it! The video's over! - That's it! - Bye-bye! - You've seen it all! (jazz music)",

    "transcript": "while the hello good people Shh oh look what we have here so this is the new Corsair low noise case the 678C so you know what guys I am rooting for silent cases you know I want their population in the market to grow a little bit and this is exactly what we have here with a 678C a very easy name to remember but of course minimizing your system noise is a combination of things like your fan rpm the rest of your hardware and the case is at play as well and how turbulent the airflow might enter and might exhaust the case and just how covered up your intakes are but then if everything is covered up then you have to increase the fan rpm in order to get some airflow in there so let's see how this $200 case stacks up for cooling and noise right to this the legendary hyper 212 CPU cooler from cooler master now comes in this breathtaking matte black finish the included Silencio 120 millimeter fan delivers great airflow and reduced noise plus you can pick up an RGB version of this cooler as well learn more about the hyper 212 Black Edition and its RGB sibling down below if you are feeling adventurous with your wallet make sure to check out description for all the goodies thank you very much all right not to disappoint you this early in the video but the Carbide 678C feels kind of lazy and uninspired especially for the price point and this is where this whole pricing conversation comes into the equation which is so important because the competition at $200 is fierce right now so I feel like this is just mispriced because maybe it's $120 this would be like you know a nice general standard enclosure but it's $199 instead and if you do want a low noise case definitely pass this one because cooling performance is just not on par to other cases that are cheaper and have better cooling and also about the same in terms of sign now for $200 were you expecting an aluminum brushed front panel maybe but this is just plastic perhaps you were expecting some non-generic sound dampening material nope it's pretty standard here perhaps you were expecting some tasteful integrated lighting nope everything is bare I do appreciate this movable tempered glass side panel that you can remove for easier installation however the front panel can only open on one side and that only 90 degrees and unlike what's practical design cases where it can actually swap the panel to open from the other side depending on the orientation of the case here you are limited to its default orientation and for those who care this is probably one of the only cases in 2019 to have a five and a quarter inch drive bay at the top maybe for a blu-ray player or something like that and it is removable if you need the additional clearance at the top for radiators or fans now the case comes with three 140mm fans running at 1300 rpm one intake at the front one intake at the top in the center right beside the CPU cooler and one rear exhaust and this is probably the first time ever where I see the top fan mounted as intake well you probably can guess why this whole front element is yeah it's a choking hazard so there are no ventilation strips on the side of the front panel and the only sort of gap you have is at the bottom and that's not a lot of air for the front intake and thus you kind of rely on the top intake instead to deliver some that fresh air for the CPU cooler with the compromise that your GPU gets quiet toasty and speaking of the top we have a magnetic dust filter up here and with plenty of airflow options with up to 360 mm radiator support for the top and at the front but here's a little feature if you want to make a toasty oven inside this enclosure you simply close off that top section with a plate the benefit of course is it will you know lower the noise level in this configuration as your components die in their own heat and your ports are fine and dandy with a Type C Gen 2 dual USB threes power reset and the combo headphone / microphone jack there is a massive dust filter at the bottom that you remove from the front nice and convenient and as for the interior is quite roomy and I do appreciate the slightly depressed motherboard tray so the rubber grommets on the side are slightly angled which makes cable routing slightly easier I don't like the frame around the PCI slots where they're not cut out but instead you have to fit your screwdrivers through the holes which can make for a really inconvenient installation of your graphics card the power supply shroud is perforated in multiple sections with a front cut out for the radiator to fit through and for storage we have these floating drive caddies that will further restrict any airflow trying to get your main components and they do remind me of another approach from another company but I'll just be quiet they are secured with thumb screws at the back and the unfortunate thing is that we only have two of these covers that go in place of the hard drive cages so for example if you remove them then those holes will still be in the frame with nothing to put in that space and of course I had to remove them for better air flow but there's nothing to cover them so any cables and everything else will be visible that is behind the frame so that makes things here you're looking kind of messy and at the back we have this single SSD cage with three slots that are spring-loaded so a complete the tools design but I sometimes like to route my cables around like the middle SSD so I like to remove that and put my cables there but because it's one single piece you cannot do it unless you remove the whole thing and there's also a fan hub for six fans which is nice it is SATA powered and you can plug in the pwm cable into your motherboard for all that RPM control and so having this overview in mind what makes this case so special for $200 you know you'd think maybe fantastic cooling or perhaps the quietest operation possible well neither of those is the case and so looking in the system temperatures were the fans running at a thousand rpm so we can compare that to the massif is-2 and the Phanteks P600s you can see the Corsair 678C it doesn't do that great in terms of CPU and GPU temperatures in comparison to the other two cases and even when I maxed out the fans to 1300 rpm the GPU is still quite toasty and the CPUs are hotter versus the massif is two and a fantex cases which are running at slower rpm which leads us to the noise performance and yes the closed front panel definitely delivers quieter operation at 1000 RPM simply because there is no air flow turbulence that you can hear but when the front is open especially at 1300 rpm that side noise profile has got quiet loud and actually that is because of the top fan and I'm gonna let you listen to what the top fan sounds like at 1300 rpm with the dust filter in place and it removed because there's so much turbulence happening with the dust filter that it's actually generating some noise that is unpleasant versus when the filter is actually removed and I'm going to have to reinforce my point again that this is a mispriced case $200 it does not deliver better cooling it does not deliver quieter operation versus something that is $50 cheaper and those cases are not even designed for a silent operation like the you know the massif is do for example and so in conclusion the carbide 6 7 8 C is uninspiring it's bland its overpriced kind of disappointed all around but if you've ever built yourself a quiet system what has your approach been like trying to brute force air flow into it with increasing rpm because of all these you know restrictions or go the other route of lowering rpm but in a completely like open enclosure so there is no you know turbulent noise for the airflow while still giving you enough cooling but yeah let me know what you think about this enclosure in the comments let's you know try to be civil while this thing is quite disappointing I'm a Dmitry thanks so much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content right over here and yeah we'll see you in the next video",

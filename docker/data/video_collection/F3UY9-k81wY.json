    "transcript": "Welcome to Scrapyard Wars, where Luke and I compete to build the best computer on a fixed budget. We get to play with an enormous $800, including a hundred bucks to spend on whatever we want from our sponsor, Jawa. You're not building just a computer, you're doing a full gaming setup. So like monitor, keyboard, mouse? Yes. Desk, chair. Desk? At the end of the week, our setups will be put through the ultimate gauntlet to find out who wins Scrapyard Wars. First deal. Am I going to get away with this? The voice, you have to change the voice. Sorry. So we're, yeah, we're here to pick up the PC. Oh, thank you very much. Okay. Thank you. Great. Okay. Yeah. No problem. Should be good to go. Thank you very much. We can just wait outside if that works for you. I'll just wait here. Hello. Hi. No problem. Take your time. You seem pretty good with those machines. How do you find this? That's a cool screwdriver. Oh. Where'd you get it? Hi, Mango. Her name is Mango, right? Sorry, he's a door-to-door salesman or? Do you have the cash? So one, two, three, 400. Thank you very much. One question for you. When did you figure out who we were? I saw your car in the background, unfortunately, and it's a very distinct wrap. But the deal was not affected by real. Okay. Didn't really know until you guys come out here and saw the car outside. Okay. Tell me. Would you be able to tell? I think the eyes are kind of a dead giveaway. That's my makeup artist right there. We hired a professional from the industry to come in and that's the schtick this season. It's a nice screwdriver you got there. Yeah, it's been pretty good. I haven't lost anything, thankfully. That's okay. There's bits available. From where? Lttstore.com. That's right. You better believe it. You know what's funny? We were like, we saw the screwdriver. He brought it out in the box. I was like, hmm. Yeah. How's the screwdriver? That looks cool. And then he was like, yeah, it kind of looks like you. I was like, we got busted. You know what? As long as it doesn't affect the deal, then it's legal. Yo, that's pretty good. Do you want to know the best part? They were literally across the street from the labs building. What? I literally got in the truck and just went, boom. And they were like, oh, you're from Linus, right? I'm like, yep. It's free though. Cause we already agreed to free beforehand. The deal was already made. The deal was made. I don't want us to be cheating, but yeah. There's a little bit of sus stuff. There's soundproofing on the underneath of it. And there's a bunch of like white splatters. We can clean it. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No black lights. One of the guys agreed to $500 for a 3080. That leaves us with $194. There's a decent amount of systems available at around that price. Usually i5s, i7s around like seventh, eighth gen. Power supply is going to be our issue. Some of these brands I've never heard of. So that does sketch me a little bit. You know what's not sketchy though? Buying from Jawa. Jawa is an online marketplace for buying and selling new and used computers and parts. And Jawa vets their verified sellers to make sure they're providing the community with top deals and service. And best of all, you're protected every time you make a purchase through the Jawa money back guarantee. Check them out using the link in the description and enter their Scrapyard Wars giveaway. More on that later. Bye. If they're like seven years old, throwing a 3080 on it might be a little oof because of the big spikes, right? It does. But if we have three of them, it's redundancy. Each PSI power connector is a different power supply. Would that be three power supplies? And then one for the motherboard, one for the drive. So we ended up buying like five power supplies. We go get a power bar and it's just part of the build. You have to have this power bar. He's going to look at the computer at the end. He's going to be like, why are there five power cables coming off of this? I just don't know if it works. Everyone is saying don't do it in forums, but nobody's saying you can't. The one we're getting recommends a 750 watt. Yeah, but for a system with one in it, like how much power draw is just a 3080 taking? 320 watt, according to Zotac site. So we could get away with like a 400 watt. So if we find- No, you can't. No way. No, no, I'm just saying just a 400, just for the GPU. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This will work. We are fairly committed to multiple power supply. We also need to be ready to kill our babies and move on from this idea. Tom, am I allowed to drink? It's hard though. All right, should we have a look at what we scored? Okay, yeah. Cause I never got a close look at it cause I was pretending to not know what's going on. Okay, we're just going to pull over right here. So we have a full system basically without storage. Right, six core processor, 16 gigs RAM. This GPU is going to go cause we bought that one on job already. So what that means is Sammy, we need to start creating listings for any of this stuff that we are not going to keep, like now. Cause we got to sell this stuff. I didn't tell you this, but I'm $80 over budget, right now. The good news is the total stuff that we're buying for $780 is about $1,150 worth of stuff. Okay. However. We're probably going to have to sell it soon. So we have to undercut ourselves. And so we have to sell it for less than 1100 bucks. Yeah. How do you want to do division of labor here? You take it out and I can make the listing look pretty. Okay. You might have to dust emolate that a little. So do you want to grab pictures then? Yep. The RAM we're keeping, I don't think we can afford this cooler. The other system has a stock cooler. So we're going to use that instead. Do you, do you, so Schmied or do you, you, you got this? She's got this. I just want to get these listings up as soon as possible because coming in under budget at all is reliant on us selling at least some of it. Oh God. This is definitely dirtier than I initially realized. No judgment though. No judgment. Okay. Are you ready to take the next picture? Yeah. Okay. Do you want to grab that? Oh my God, a snake. Kidding. Okay. So this GPU is going to go. Let's get the back panel off here. You have man hands. Can you hold this? Oh, you know what we should do though? We should clean the goop off the bottom. Make it look shinier. Oh no, don't touch that. It'll get all over your hands forever. Should we post it right away? Or can we wait until I clean it up and make it look nice? No, no. We're going to clean it up right now. We got this. Don't even trip. Okay. Hi. Sorry. Yep. Technically legal what we're doing. A little weird, but legal. Weird. Yes. There's also dust on the outside. I'm working on it. Any luck? Is it working? No, you're breathing it all in. Next time you drink water, it'll taste like dirt. So let's put that on the dirty side. Okay. She kind of cleans up pretty decent here. Yep. Oh, I guess I'll probably write the posts or you know what? I can help you. I can transcribe it. Wait, do you get car sick? No. Nice. So I can dictate when we're in the car and you can post. Okay. We got this. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. We ended up with a hard drive that I wasn't expecting. Oh, I told them we'd give it back to him if we found any storage. Oh, for crying out loud. It's the biggest one. Bloody hell, Daniel. That was his name, right? Yep. This power supply we're keeping. So there's no point extracting all of this yet but the case is going to go. I think I have enough photos. I think this. The photo's like on the Porsche logo. Yeah, but then if we try to get a better price, they'll be like, you don't need that money. Yeah. And if Luke sees it, he'll know it's us. Yeah. We can bait Luke and then ghost him. That's the best. It's not actually about saving money. First, I'm going to clean this CPU. This CPU is going to go. We've got another one that's almost exactly the same. It actually boosts a little lower but it's a weirdo 4500 that most people don't seem to have heard of. So they're going for a lot less. So I'd rather take the small performance hit and get the most money back possible. This CPU is one of the most liquid things we have. It should be really easy to move. Do you feel ridiculous yet? Yes. Good. That means you're doing it right. Hold on. We might want to do this but this would be the sketchiest possible. They have LTT edition Noctua fans. It would be very hard for them to not recognize us. Duke and was it the young Mike or whatever? What is it? What is it? AMD Ryzen 5 4500. Oh. It's only a 430 watt power supply. Do you think if we say, hey, no hard drive, no Quadro. No power supply maybe. In a case? No case. I mean, you could go for it. It should be like 125 bucks. Posted 18 days ago. That's a long time ago. Why isn't it selling? That's one stick of memory. Maybe that's why people aren't buying it. But like maybe the guy's willing to take the RAM out too. It's like, hey brother, we really just need the motherboard and CPU. Everything else can go away. Honestly. We don't need the GPU. We're back. You forgot your hard drive. I was looking for it in there and I couldn't find it. It was in the hard drive sled. Do you happen to have the mounting hardware for that CPU cooler for like other sockets? Oh, I do. And since I'm at it, the motherboard box as well. Do you have the motherboard accessories? All right. Success. Awesome. See you later. Have a good one. Man, that worked out great. Oh, look at that. We've got thermal compound and everything. We appear to have the full compliment of mounting hardware for our cooler. Let's take a photo of our combo. Okay. Ah, oh my God. Okay. We still gotta get the case. I'm just gonna do a quick wipe down. Don't worry. We got this. It'll be worth it when we see Luke's crying face at the end. He'll cry real tears. Interesting take on a friendship. Look, if you can't delight in the tears of your friends, then you know, really what is there in life? A lot of other things like food. But imagine if you could season your food with Luke's tears. This is the best place to do this. There is no better method. Also, the fact that Linus had his LTT key chain out. Yeah, that did not help. Do we have everything we need? Oh, son of a gun. Daniel! I feel bad. But I really need the modular cables from this power supply. Hello, we're sorry. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Sorry to be a pain in the butt. I promise not to knock on your door again. I'll ring the bell. Okay. It's older, but it has more cores and more threads. It's a Ryzen 7 1700. So it's first gen Ryzen. That's pretty good. But it comes with the motherboard, 16 gigs of RAM. That's pretty good. 750 watt power supply. That's amazing. No GPU, nor storage. That's fine. 170. That's amazing. It's 3.7 gigahertz turbo at eight cores, 16 threads. Do you think they're going to have eight cores? They'll probably beat us on CPU. I don't feel like they're going to, they might. I don't feel like they're going to get a 3080. This was listed four days ago and he says he's unable to test it, unfortunately. But like 170, and that gives us the rest of the system. Cause it's 16 gigs of RGB RAM, bro. I don't think it's necessarily the best thing we could possibly find. This other system that I found, where we'd have to like, hopefully get him to take some things out of it, like the Quadro and stuff, which is way less likely, would be better, but it's less likely. This one sounds pretty realistic. Like even if he didn't take a deal with us, it works. Cause it's the whole rest of the system. So we should start moving on that. This guy's in Coquitlam. Do you want me to low ball him or do you want me to say, hey. Before I low ball, I always open with, is this available? I can pick it up. Either tonight or tomorrow. Basically be like, I'm committed. I can come to you and get it. I'm not one of those people asking for delivery. And I have cash. I can give you now. Our success hinges on selling some of the components that we bought. Cause we've got a lot of duplicates in our first two deals. So Sammy is working on getting all of our posts up on Facebook marketplace right now. We're going to land back at the office and she's going to have about half an hour more overlapping with me, where we can kind of plan out the rest of her night. And then she gets another three hours. So she's going to go pick up our next deal pretty much right away when we get back. And then, dude, I have no idea beyond that, Sammy. We're going to have to figure that out. Oh, you can monitor if people want to buy our stuff. The guy on the one 3080 wants to pick it up after 6pm tomorrow, which doesn't work. We were supposed to deliver the systems to labs at 6pm. Could we get it after 6pm today? That is then for sure locking us in to this. And we're like, we're, we're in deep brother. That means tomorrow is going to be- Yeah, but we would have some time to find another system. Sure. Okay. Can I pick it up today? Okay. Title. Corsair Carbide 275R. Computer case. I would go gaming case. Or yeah. Oh yeah. PC or computers. Cause people would search, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So gaming, PC, computer case. Yep. Let's go full SEO baby. Yes. Let's go. The dude wants you to pick up the 3080 at 6.15pm. Today? Yeah, that's fine. I can do it. Are we committing to it? Are we committing to a 3080? Oh man. I think this decision is going to make or break if we win Scrapyard Wars right now. Yeah. Hi, I have other people offering full price. Can you do 200 an hour ago? Oh, my second deal backed off on the $20 discount. I suspect the other person offering full price is Luke. It's a really, really good deal. I'm a little surprised he found it though. But at this point, I'd rather pay the extra 20 bucks knowing that I'll just have to sell a little bit more and know that he's not getting that deal. It's a really good deal. Okay. We got to focus in pretty hard on finding a system because right now we actually have no leads that have responded. This guy's selling a Ryzen 5 3600 for 65 bucks but just the CPU. So it's like, we need to find- You can find the rest of the platform. Let's go. I found a motherboard for 120, which would put us at 185. So we'd need $10 for RAM and power supply. Like maybe if I talk them down, we'll get lucky. But the guy who listed the CPU listed it four minutes ago. Message him, try to talk him down. It's worth it. We don't have anything right now. We got to chase everything we possibly can. We got a hit on our listing. Which one, which one? On the CPU. Already? They're friends with 18 people, including your wife on Facebook. Wait. It's Luke. It's Luke. What a piece of. Nice try, Luke. Yeah, I got him. Oh, okay. I messaged the CPU guy and I said, hey, I have cash and can pick up tomorrow. He just responded with, nice try, Luke. Wait, but now he knows it's us. Oh yeah, maybe we shouldn't have said that. His name is John. Who is this guy? Wait, John. Isn't that Linus? Isn't that Linus' name? He saw it, unlucky. We should have wasted his time. Oh, that sucks. I thought we had a real bite. I wonder if he doesn't even have it yet and he's pre-listing it. Hi, John. Buyer name. Would you take 40 cash for this, for the CPU? 40 bucks. I can reply with 55. What did we list it for? 65. Do you wanna check what the other listings for the 3600 are on Facebook Marketplace? Because I think we're already the lowest. Other people are listing it for 60. Let's offer him 50. We can do 50. Yeah, don't say we. Oh. Oh. Check Facebook Messenger. Check Facebook Messenger. Which one, which one, which one? Check Facebook Messenger. Holy s**t, dude. We're back in it, brother. Let's f**king go. Okay, so that was the guy who had the Ryzen 7 1700 and a 750 watt power supply and 16 gigs of RAM. For 170 bucks. For 170 bucks. Meaning we will have 25 bucks as wiggle room to do like- Keyboard, mouse. 1700 is so good. I think it's good. It's a little old. Got another bite on the Corsair case. I thought the case was gonna be hard to sell. You must've taken great photos, Sammy. Yes. Maybe the Duke should have chosen to be a king. Then he would have a crown. Are you gonna be fielding messages all night selling this stuff? Cause like, I can't believe how active these posts are. It can't be real. I can reply to multiple people at the same time. Got that Zoomer energy. Love it. Do you just sell CPU, GPU and case or do you have motherboard too? Yeah, I got a motherboard. We have a motherboard too. No, we- I'm sorry. I can more or less guarantee you they'll have a better processor. Are they gonna have a better GPU? I mean, they do have a better processor right now. They have a 3600. And they're selling it. Them selling a processor has me pretty concerned. All right, well, hold on. So what all is he interested in? Can we add it up? Because it occurred to me with how we're kind of pricing things according to how it is on Facebook and then like discounting a bit. I don't actually know for sure that we're making money. Like I haven't checked, you know? This listing is being reviewed. Did someone like report it? Did Luke report it? That would be quite the move. I'm worried they're gonna make the benchmarks like super lame, like really heavy, like storage and CPU based, which like no one will ever do or use or care about. You guys in the comments can show how upset you are. You would want a 3080, right? Right? And you can have it. If you want a shot at that 3080 and Luke's entire system, you're gonna wanna check out Jawa's giveaway campaign for Scrapyard Wars. Every week, they'll have new prizes to give away, including Jawa gift cards, a prebuilt gaming PC with a 4080 Super and some super secret prizes to be revealed later. So go get entered using the link in the description. Gotta go. Yeah. Wait, we may not have actually, oh, this may not be smart. Maybe that's why so many people are messaging us though. Maybe our pricing is a little bit too low. A little stressed. This may have just been an exercise in- Doing the math. Swapping cash back for cash. Okay. We'll be fine though, we'll be fine. Let's get the 1700. That power supply alone is for our whole system. Let's just send it. You wanna pick that up tonight if possible. Yeah. So like 615 is the GPU. Where was the GPU? Did the guy get back to you? Oh, he hasn't responded after you sent that 20 minutes ago. Do you think he's faking selling stuff? He just read it right now. I watched him. Should I just ask him if he wants me to pick it up now? I say I got off work early. He's in Richmond. Okay, so I need to do that. Yeah, I got off work early. I can go pick it up now. I'm doing a lot of driving. I'm driving all the way to Richmond to pick up a 3080. I'm then driving all the way to Coquitlam to pick up that Ryzen 7 system. I need to go ask accounting to break this into 20s because I don't really wanna show up and be like, do you have 30? Yo brother, I got hundos. Yeah. Day two, starting. I got the GPU yesterday and I got the full tower. The guy did recognize me, which was fun. The haircut didn't work. You were still okay with 170 though. That's what you agreed on. So I'm not using my influence to get a deal. Dude, I can't believe it. I never thought this day would come. And we bought it for literally what he listed it at. Yeah. Because we suck at bargaining. We haven't tested it yet. We're gonna test the GPU in the computer, make sure it works. We have $25 left. We still need to get keyboard, mouse, mouse pad, and chair. We really need to verify the GPU works. Yeah. How'd it go? The seller from Craigslist, they haven't responded. So I tried texting them again. Hopefully they'll reply. They're not replying to me. And I text. So I went and I sat in his lobby and kept emailing him, hi, I'm here. And then eventually I picked it up. We have it right here. I didn't get to like plug it in because we were in the lobby. Otherwise I sat there and I hit refresh until 9 p.m. all night to see if we got more messages. We didn't really get many. So I'm a little worried about selling right now. We need to buy more stuff before we can even sell anything though. We don't even have storage. Oh, right. So we're going to pick up storage at around 11:20. Okay. And we're gonna pick up a keyboard at 11. We still need a mouse and monitor and a desk and a chair. A desk? Desks are free. You just have to find one where the person is available. So here's our 3080. It's quite dusty, but the guy told me he like just pulled it out of his computer to go do the sale. So I'm hoping that's accurate. Oh crap. Is it long enough? Okay. It's a snug fit, but it does fit in the computer case. That I'm not worried about. We can always make things fit. The power supply that it comes with, I opened it up. It's 750 bronze from Thermaltake. We're pushing the limits here on like if this GPU is going to be fine. Didn't even realize we bought such new hardware. Still has the plastic peel on. Look at that. Brand new case, basically. Andy would be disappointed I peeled it, but you know what? That's fine. All right, let's power it on. Oh. Okay. Switch was off. Let's power it on. It kicked off a lot of dust. Do you hear that? That fan does not sound healthy. I think it's this front one. Hey, there you go. There it is. Ryzen 7 1700, eight core processor. Got our 16 gigs of RAM. So our memory, 2133. Not the fastest. Definitely not the fastest. That's pretty slow. But you know what? We have a 3080. I found us a desk. It's a solid wood desk. Oh, that guy lies. That's not solid wood. Oh. I saw that one. Those are MDF desks. You know what? At this point, I think we might just have to go with it though. Can you throw in a chair? Yes, but they are old. That is okay. I mean, we might as well. If we don't want it, we can find another one. So I need to go get that keyboard like now. I should be done very shortly. It's 40 minutes away. That's gone up since I looked it up. I can message them. Okay. I don't think we'll make it in time for the SSD, Linus. I may lose this one, but damn it, I'm gonna look good doing it. He said 1110 is the latest he can do. Gotta leave. Okay, we gotta go then. I'm coming. Okay. Now. God, we need to get these products listed. Can I take apart a computer in the back seat? I guess we're doing that. Hey, look at that. This NAS build. How's one of those old LTT edition NFF12 fans Hello? Good, good. How are you? Good. I talked with my boss, so are you available tomorrow at my shop? Ooh, unfortunately, no. It would have to be today. That's the tech shop that we called yesterday, calling back. I worry that this place is gonna know my voice though, cause I've definitely called her. You can have me do it. What was your name? Luke. Luke? I think it should be fine. Okay, awesome. Thanks. Sorry for being difficult here. Oh, don't be sorry. 11:30 this morning? Okay, great. Okay, so we might have some pretty major curve balls, cause that's the shop. And they could potentially have a keyboard mouse for us, which would save us the 10 bucks. Some audio thing, probably not. But they would also probably have DDR4 RAM. So if we really want to, we could look at the speed and go to 32 gigs, or we could find faster memory. Might also be a possibility for a platform swap. Yeah. This could like, dramatically change things. According to this board, it says it has an NVMe slot. I don't see it though. So I don't know if it's on the back or under the GPU. So I'm gonna pull this back out and take a quick look. Oh yeah, there it is. Okay, cool. I also am gonna take out the RAM. I want to see what speed we have on this, just so when we go look there, maybe they have faster, or if they have similar, we could potentially go from 16 to 32 or something. A lot up in the air right now. So I took the RAM out. It actually does support up to 3200. So we could just enable XMP and hopefully get that full performance. Much better than 2133 or whatever it was. How are the listings going? I might have a buyer for a bunch of stuff. This name guy might want RAM, CPU, case, MOBO and GPU. Okay. He's making me kind of a low offer, but we are over budget right now and we need some money. We just need the SSD. We need a monitor. Monitor, that's the thing. Literally doing the makeup on the way there. This is quite funny. I love this. A little bit of bouncing. All right, banking right. Nice. Okay. Nice. Okay, well, we're here. All right. I misspelled outside three times. Okay, well, that's never better. How do I look? Great, never better. Hi, for the keyboard. I don't have cash on me. Can I e-transfer you at all? Okay, so it was $10, right? And can I take a look at the keyboard? Thank you. Do you want to try it out? Do you think you'll like this one? They have the WASD gamer. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Let me know if you get it or it should be sent. Yeah, thank you very much. Have a good day. Okay, thank you. I don't know, he glass tapped me a couple times, but I'm not sure if he suspected anything. I need the address for the second place. Oh yeah, for sure. Sorry, yeah, for sure. And can you let them know that we're on our way? We'll be there around 11:25. Hi, this is Duke. I'm on the road now. The current ETA is 11:40. Does that still work? Yeah, sure, I'll let them know I'll be there. Is your name Luke or Duke? Duke. Duke, okay. It comes up as Luke, so did I get your name wrong? Oh yeah, that's a weird thing with Facebook. I actually changed my name quite a few years back, but Facebook sometimes just doesn't, it sends the old one, I don't know. Okay, yeah, I'll let them know. So you said you're gonna be there at 11:40? Okay, sounds good. I never messaged him on Facebook. That's caller ID. Yep, yeah, I was like, no! Well, we'll see how this goes. We're good? Yeah, I'm just gonna powder it. Man, buddy here wants $250 for a Ryzen 3600 with cooler and motherboard and the Corsair case and eight gigs of RAM and the 1660 Super and the CX430 power supply. That pretty much leaves us with only like kind of worthless stuff. That's basically all we can sell. That puts us back in the green though. How much in the green? By like 80, 90 bucks. I'm gonna do 250 with the Cougar case. I'm gonna say final offer. So we keep the nice case from Daniel. Yep, it'd be nice to be able to move all this to one person. We don't have like a week to dick around selling to half a dozen different people. Where the hell is Dunbar Community Center? He wants us to go all the way out to Vancouver. That is in the middle of nowhere. I don't live in Dunbar. Should I offer to come all the way to Dunbar for an extra 10 bucks? 10. 15? 15. I'm being a fair guy. I'm a fair guy. Oh man, we are bang on time for this guy. Let's go. What is this for? Hello. Hello. Hi, nice to meet you. Yes, this is John. Hi. Yes. Can I get you to put in your e-transfer? No, cash only. Oh, we have a hundred. Oh, okay, perfect. So John, I did test, and they sent you the screenshot of the test. Oh, good. You see it on the messenger? Yeah, yeah. Okay, great. Do you want to give him the cash? Yeah. 80 bucks? Yes. Thank you. I'm kind of in a rush. Oh, no worries. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Have a great day. Thank you. Okay, thank you. I'll walk slower for you. Hi, young lady. Hi. I don't think I got mated either of the last two. No, no. I was like a little sus, because he like smiled a bit too much. Yeah, I think he was just friendly. Hey, Tom. Hey, Tom. Right there, buddy. All right, rock on. Let's go. All right, bye-bye. Let me find out if this- Name. Guy, if we got a deal with him. Have we confirmed a time with the desk guy? He said anytime before five. Hell yeah, that's super flexible. Okay, that helps a lot. Where is he at? Somewhere in Surrey. Okay, beautiful, beautiful. You know what? We might pull this off. All right, so we are almost at the computer shop. I am getting progressively more worried that they're going to recognize me, but I will be going in with Lindsay, who is my sister. Yes. Okay, yeah. Your second sister. Yeah, and we're building a computer for our other sister's son, our nephew, Ryan, who is seven. Here's the whole, I got to add in the hat. This is the full ensemble, which is not a word I will be saying while we're inside. A biker would never say that word. No, I don't think so, yeah. It's a full get up. This is a get up. This name. People offered $10 fee and meet in the afternoon. I think we might have to take it. I guess if that's the best we got, that's the best we got. And ruthless. He's getting a great deal. The good news is his deal wasn't as good as mine. So I'm still out ahead. Let's go. One thing I will tell you about- Name. Is he is not getting these Noctua fans. I'm going to swap them out for the fans that are in that other system. I got five Noctua fans in here. He's getting zero of them. Oh my God. See, I was afraid of this. Our mass storage, Sammy, is going to be a mobile two and a half inch hard drive. Look at the little thing. Hello. We are here. I've got to leave you guys behind now, but we're going to go in there and try to get it done. Which is something he would say. All right. So keyboard, mouse, desk pad, speakers. Chair. If they have a chair, you could get a second power supply just in case. If there's RAM that's like similar speed or like slightly slower, but we can get more of it, that might also be better. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then platform swap if, I don't know, they're recycling 11th gens or something like- You don't think they'll have an AMD? We never dealt with AMD when we built the systems, unless they're recycling someone else's computer. Okay. That is AMD. All right. Let me try to hide the mics real quick. Yeah, make sure mics are hidden. I'm like so nervous. I don't know why. I'm not even going in there and I'm the nervous one. I'm wearing a wire, dude. I think I'm just going to have one wire coming down, but I honestly don't think they're going to notice it. I think him going in with Lindsay is actually going to help a ton too. Okay, cool. See you guys in a bit. You ready? Yeah. We'll make it work. Yeah. Or we won't and it'll be funny either way. My name's still Lindsay, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're still going to be okay, but we have to go like now. No, it's stuck on CPU. Are you kidding me? Oh no, no, no, no, no. This is bad. Are you murdering innocent civilians? Yes. That's the mentality we need in Scrapyard Wars. Duke.",

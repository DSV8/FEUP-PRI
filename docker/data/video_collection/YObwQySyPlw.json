    "transcript": "Can these 2 phones ping each other? Ping is a way for us to test connectivity between devices notice the IP addresses silver phone has IP address 10.1.1.10 yellow phone has IP address 10.1.1.17. So I'll start the Ping and what you'll notice is the pings are failing. Some people might say well they're not connected to the same Wi-Fi network but they are actually both connected to the same Wi-Fi network they however don't have a default gateway configured but does that make any difference? In this example it does because they are actually in different subnets the subnet mask is 255.255.245.240. if I changed that subnet mask to say 255.255 255.0 on both phones what you'll notice is pings will start succeeding because they are now in the same subnet. In this example they don't need a default gateway configured they don't need access to the internet because they're in the same subnet they can ping each other because I changed the subnet mask in networking it's important to understand subnets.",

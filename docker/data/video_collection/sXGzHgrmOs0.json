    "transcript": "- Hello, welcome to This Is, we have a pair of AirPods on the desk. Can you spot them? They're slightly larger than normal AirPods. They're maximum strength. - Not quite. (laughs) Not quite at all. So at least maybe Apple wants you to sell you on that. But obviously these have been getting a lot of buzz recently because they are retailing for a whopping $550, ladies and gentlemen. - That's like a PS5 and-- - A game, or no, a controller, - No, a controller is-- (inaudible) (beep) These are the brand new AirPods MaX. So neither of us have tried these at all yet. So this is going to be our first impressions of what seemed to be some of the hottest headphones that looks like an Apple product. (laughs) Wow. That band, feel the band. - Oh, I love that mesh though. So that, three seconds and it feels like it's going to rip. I don't know if that's the case. - No, I don't think so. I have a little more faith in this than probably you do to be fair, but it does look like it. But the thing is is that like, this feels like the mesh that you would have on like a back of a chair, maybe just slightly softer. But at the very least for comfort level, I can see why this is so soft. Where do we wanna start? - I dunno. I mean-- (laughs) It's a case that comes with the box, right? You can't complain about something that comes with, okay. (inaudible) - Now... - What is this? - They're just protectors for the, okay, look, you're spending $550-- - I thought that they were white. - No, it's not two-tone Austin. - I think you appreciate this more, don't you? with just a straight-- - You can swap them out though, you can buy the other. So these are all magnetic-- - Oh, wow. That comes off way easier than I thought. These actually look and feel better in person than I had thought. I could see where Apple specifically, not anyone else why Apple specifically would charge a premium for this. Okay. There's a lot to talk about with the AirPods Max. Not the least of which is the PS5 plus 10% price. However, let's put the price aside for a second. Let's go into this with an open mind together as a big happy family who of course, already subscribed to This Is and have rung the ding-a-ling bell. And let's take a look at the AirPods Max for what they are - Yes. - which are a pair of Bluetooth headphones. So we have the mega watch-- - The digital crown. - Yeah. I will immediately say I like that 'cause I hate the stupid touch controls. - Oh my God, we'll get to that in a second. - That noise cancellation is nuts town. Holy, wait, hang on, wait, talk. - Test test, test. Hi, hey guys this is Austin. - Wait, keep talking. - Okay. Hi, my name is Ken. Welcome to the YouTube channel This Is, where all stuff happens including-- - That's nuts. So it sounds like my head is in like a box or something. Now, Matt, I know Matt was concerned 'cause I know for some people when it comes to active noise cancellation, you get that sort of like that pressure feeling. - Right. - I get that with the-- Let's go on and see it feels like there's like almost something kind of pushing on my eardrums. It's aggressive. - So for context, we have listened to a lot of over here active noise cancelling headphones. The ones that we've tried specifically most recently are the 1000XM4 from Sony that we tried on Mystery Tech actually for my birthday in September. And that's what I'm going to probably compare these to. Those are the ones that I feel like a lot of people use right now in the market. At least the chimes that you hear and all of the sounds and whatnot are very similar to what you get with the AirPods Pros when you switch between that active noise canceling. Let me hit the button again. - Hello. I am talking to you right now. Move your head around and hear how different it is. You almost feel like the 3D spaces it cuts my voice out from different sides, right? - A little bit, I'd say that these aren't as aggressive as the 1000XM4 though. - The 1000XM4 in my opinion are too aggressive, they-- - They actually feel like they're like sucking your ears out. Like that's how aggressive-- - You're really loud right now. - I mean active noise cancelling. (laughs) Gotta have to. I think that this is a right balance. It's very similar to what you get out of the AirPods Pros. (clapping) - I got a white noise generator, hang on. Let's test this. (laughs) - Wait, is that racist? - Hilarious. Is that racist? - They are racist. (blows) - I can definitely hear it, but when I play music, which I haven't done the syncing yet for this. It would probably cancel out at around like 30% volume I feel like. I kind of felt this with the Samsung Galaxy Beans Live and it almost makes everything around you sound bassier. - I do think the aesthetics and the comfort, which to me feels pretty decent. - Right. - Let's try the headphones connected to an iPhone. We can try the spatial audio, but let's just see how these things sound. - So it is cool that the AirPods Max shows up on the phone as would any other pair of AirPods, right? But they show up with the exact color that you have. So noise control, all of this is pretty much the same as AirPods Pro. - Ken is definitely going to go deaf one day if he's not already like 8% there. Okay. Here we go. - Alright. (inaudible) - Go ahead, hit us with the hot take. - The problem that I'm having is that it's hard to compare these with the Sony 'cause they sound different. - So the Sonys are bass heavy. I think that helps with travel. It helps to drown out a lot of like noises that you'd hear say like an airplane or on a train, right? These do a great job of canceling out voices around you. Which I think it does a better job of doing that than the Sonys. If you don't like bass heavy, if you want something, these are not neutral, to be fair. These are a little more V-shaped. These have really good highs and really good bass but it's not thumping your ear. So while it doesn't sound as warm, I do like the way that these sound. I just don't know detail wise if we're losing anything, if it's any better but at least in terms of signature, they're definitely different and I think they sound good. $550 is still a lot of money for-- - Hook me up. - Yeah. Go for it. - Hotel California, our classic headphone testing song. I like that. - Whoa, wait, what is happening here? What's happening here? What is that? - I'm using the crown. (laughs) (beep) - I can actually hear a little bit of bleed but it's not as bad as I would've thought for where are we at? We are currently at 95 to a 100%.` - Everything about them is good, is decent, is solid. I don't have any like superfluous, like, Oh my God, I can't believe, it's just like, that's a good sounding pair of headphones. - So now let's talk about a little bit of the more abstract things. They're more abstract for us, for Apple it's not. Build quality, name, aesthetics-- - Quality is very solid, with a couple of questions. Obviously this is day one. How these hold up over months, especially with the carrying case that it comes with. I'm a little questioning because I mean, so I assume this is aluminum, right? - Yeah. That feels totally fine. If you throw this in a bag with other things, maybe your keys, you might start to see some dings. There's also the stainless steel parts right here for the band, it looks well-built. But at least in my experience with using stainless steel stuff on Apple products, like say my iPhone 12 Pro Max, I've been getting scratching on the bottom. So that can also, I would assume if it's the same kind of coating and whatnot, that'll probably be prone to scratching as well. Obviously again, we talked about the top mesh, which is probably the softest bit. This can probably get pinched by some things. If you have like pins or keys or something that hit these, they might start to fray a little bit. There is quality stuff that we won't be able to tell right now 'cause they're new but down the line-- - I will say these are the nicest pair of headphones under like several thousand Dollars I've ever touched, right? - Everything about them feels premium, feels very high quality-- - (inaudible) Like material design, right, like-- We know where their strengths are at. But as I'm sure a lot of people will say, even I have to kind of talk about this for someone that appreciates Apple material design. I have to even talk about this. I don't think it's worth the extra money over competitors just for that. - The AirPods Max are clearly good, but for less money than this you could buy a pair of 1000XM4 and a pair of AirPods Pros. That is such a better overall setup because for me, and this is again very much speaking personally. I much prefer the idea of having a small pair of Bluetooth earbuds in my pocket at all times. These will be great if I was on a plane. If I was sitting down and doing this kind of stuff for extended periods of time. - At $550, this is very obviously a luxury product. It's a luxury tech product more than it is an actual utility that say an AirPods Pro and 1000XM4 could serve. - I don't think anyone who purchases these are going to be disappointed, right? I mean-- - You know what you're going into. - They do what they say, right? They don't promise that they're the greatest sounding headphones in the world. They don't promise they're the most expensive or the cheapest or anything like that. They promise that they bring all of the advantages of AirPods, great noise cancellation, certainly better than the actual AirPods. - Absolutely - Great noise cancellation, good sound, great build quality, all that kind of stuff to you. They do what they say on the 10. I guess, where I'm kind of a little hung up on them is that it feels like it's almost a little bit of a middle ground. They charged a lot more than other headphones that are very similar in pretty much all aspects. But if they would have been able to push the envelope, if they sounded 5% better, I think it would be able to be justified. To me though I do prefer the sound of these over the 1000XM4 but by a very small-- (inaudible) - I'm very light in saying that like I prefer the sound of these versus the 1000XM4 in the sense of sound signature and whatnot. I don't think that is worth the difference of 200 bucks. - I wanna listen to something with a spatial audio. 'Cause that is one of the main selling points that you obviously get with sleek standard AirPods but also with the AirPods Max, I think it might be better. - I wonder if that would be a killer feature for this, actually. - Let's try it out. So if you're not familiar, AirPods Pro actually, in a software update not too long ago, included spatial audio, which essentially virtualizes like a 5.1 surround sound setup. So essentially it can detect where your phone is and where the actual headphones are. And as you move around the space, you should be able to hear the music or the sound all around you. So for context also right now is listening to Disney Plus Mandalorian episode one on the AirPods Max with the spatial audio enabled. So right now he's moving his head. He's trying to get a sense of where the audio is in his space. Apparently judging from his face, it looks like it's working. So... - That's pretty impressive. I've actually not spent a lot of time with spatial audio on the AirPods Pros, just give that a try. Essentially they take any kind of surround sound, 5.1 and up I think to Dolby Atmos. - I haven't tried this with AirPods Pros to be fair. I haven't gotten the full immersion. I don't have Disney Plus, I only watch stuff on like Netflix and stuff that don't have spatial audio. That is really good. - Yeah. That I think is the key feature here. These are almost more so better suited for things like movies, for things like TV shows. - Did they just make these headphones, oh, wow, I'm really loud. - Did they just make these headphones for Mandalorian episode one? (laughs) Again, this is gonna sound really fanboy. And I am to a degree, a fanboy, but I want to try to approach these with some kind of a reasonable mentality, right? That's a really good demo. - Yeah. - That's a really good tip. I don't know how realistically you'd be using this all the time, but even if you're watching like things like Disney Plus on your phone, like in bed and stuff like that's... - They're built well, they sound good for most purposes and with the spatial audio, that is a game changer but realistically let's just take a half step back here. How often do you listen to a movie or TV show with full surround sound and headphones on a four-inch phone or five-inch phone? - But if that is you though, even on an iPad too, but if that is you though, and you try these in a store, I can see why someone would be sold on these. Like you go to an Apple store, pick these up and do the spatial audio demo that maybe the Apple sales rep will pull up the best example of it, right? Maybe they'll pull the Mandalorian episode one. That would have sold me on the headphones right there. Like for me personally, I'm not saying that's for you. Maybe not even for you, though you had a good time. Maybe for Matt over there, he's a little more judgmental. (laughs) I'll say I'm impressed by that. - So what do you think, are the AirPods Max worth the $550? Would you rather have a pair of 1000XM4, an AirPod Pro or a PS5?

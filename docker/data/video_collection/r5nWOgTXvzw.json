    "transcript": "- Oh, wow. (pretends to fumble) - If you dunno who the Republic of Gamers are then you're not a member, loser. And the only way to get involved is to buy these. That's not true, anybody's welcome in the Republic of Gamers. This is ASUS ROG Delta S Wireless. This is the newest entry into their Delta series of wireless headsets. And ASUS was kind enough to sponsor this video and send us over a pair so that we could take a look. And what do we have inside? Ooh, it's headphones. I guess we should probably, before we get to the headphones, do the packaging. So as you can see right on the front, we got some symbols, we got PlayStation 5 support. That's awesome. Discord certified. And what is that Team Speak? Do people still use Team Speak? These feature dual mode wireless connectivity, which means that it's using Bluetooth or you can use a 2.4 gigahertz wireless adapter. Which means that you can use this with pretty much anything that you own. You can use it with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, your PC, your Mac, your Nintendo Switch, and even your mobile phone, which is awesome. You got AI beamforming microphones with AI noise cancellation. That's two Ais, okay? That's a lot. Comfortable, lightweight design, battery life and fast charging. Up to 25 hours of battery life with a 15 minute fast charge providing three hours of use. That's actually pretty good. Okay, let's take a look. (box lid smacks table) Wow. (chuckles) This is an interesting like textured plastic, okay. Welcome to the elite Republic of Gamers community. Okay, in this box is some paperwork, and also a, Ooh, a braided USBA to USBC cable. If only I had bananas around me for scale. - [Person Off Camera] I do. - Oh, In the trees. (jungle beat) Okay, yeah, yeah, so you got one banana, two banana, three banana, four banana. Four and a quarter bananas, which is about a meter. So you have like this, and it's not just gonna be the metal part of the USB, it actually goes all the way in. Which is great cuz that's nice and secure. And you're way less likely to break the port. That's a really nice touch, I really appreciate that. And so also in the box, we have these spare ear cups. These have a polyester fabric exterior and a protein leather interior. It's the same protein leather that makes up these entire ear cups. What protein leather is, it's just plastic leather, it's another term. Which is great, because I think vegan products are cool as well as we've gotten really good at making fake leather. And the fact that you get two choices of two ear cups, this is great. These being fabrics should bring extra breathability which will be really relieving for those who get really sweaty ears during game play. I don't have that problem, but I've heard your cries, viewers. And I know that it is a problem for some of you, so I'm keeping an eye out. There was a guy on Twitter who reached out to me and so think about you right now, buddy. How do I get them off? Oh, they just come off like that. So these just have like kind of a plastic wrapping. Usually headphones will have more of a plastic structure on the inside of these. And they'll like kind of clip in or magnetize in, especially on the premium end headphones. So here you just kind of slide it in around the edge. Okay, this could be better. (chuckles) I'm regretting taking them off. Now that we've just gotten into the headphones, we'll take a look at the headphones. They appear to have an all plastic construction with metal for the headband. They got a decent amount of flex. They're 318 grams. These feel lighter than you'd expect at first glance, but the plastics they're using actually feel quite nice, and look premium. And are also rejecting fingerprints pretty well, which I appreciate. Got that kind of that angry glare for the ROG logo. (growls quietly) The exclusive 50 millimeter ASUS essence drivers. The nice thing I can see right here is that they're actually tilted a little bit ahead. So what this is doing is that this is bringing the driver in a little bit to direct the sound right into your ear. So these use beamforming microphones like say like your AirPods. The microphones are all the way over here, but the sound comes out of your mouth out here. Which is why ASUS hasn't enlisted the power of AI to help with the beamforming microphones. So basically they're gonna be using AI for their noise cancellation, which is like the same thing that you'd expect from Discord. Like their Crisp noise cancellation or RTX Voice. We're gonna see something like that in these headphones. So you have a switch for your 2.4 gigahertz, your Bluetooth. This is a function button, so this will do like pause, play, skip. This is a microphone. And then over here is an audio control knob, allows you to turn your volume up, turn your volume down. And if you press it in, it's gonna mute your microphone. That's a great spot for it, actually, I really enjoy that. And then over on this side, we have a little house for your dongle. Ain't that cute? Okay, so putting them on, you know there's not very much clamping force. Like they barely seem to really be putting any pressure on the side of my head. And if I try and get more clamping for us on the top, then it kind of just pinches at the top. And then it feels like it's opening up at the bottom here. These on my head don't fit the best. But I will say that there's lots of space for my ears. My ears aren't touching the ear cups at all. They're not touching the actual drivers, or the inside of the ear cup. Sound isolation is not amazing, but I'm also like. When I'm gaming, I'm usually, and I'm wearing headphones, I'm usually talking with other people. And I can find like too much sound isolation to be isolating, and then it feels like I'm yelling all the time. Maybe I am yelling right now and there's actually good sound isolation, but who knows? So I plugged in the dongle, I've turned the headphones on. It stopped blinking, so I think it immediately found the dongle, which is super great, super quick. Let's see if Windows has seen it. Ah, it does. It's identified as the RG Delta S Wireless. We in boys, we in. Update all. So yeah, you will have to download an AI noise cancellation audio software. So you can see that when it's looking for pairing, it has a blinking light. Pair, cool. And it reports the battery life. Let's see what codec we're using. It is not reporting me a codec. I don't know what codec it supports for Bluetooth. We're just doing some quick listening impressions with the Bluetooth. This is gonna be music. Not really the main intention of these headphones, but I still stand by the whole idea that if it's a good set of headphones, it's good for everything. If it's bad at music, then it's bad at whatever it's supposed to do. I wouldn't call this an excellent listening experience for music, but that's not really the intention of it. And you can tell by the way it's tuned. What this does is that it's kind of cranked up the really low base notes, like really low we're talking like below 30 Hertz. So you get nice rumbles and like, from explosions and other deep like gunshots and sound effects like that. They've also cranked up the high frequencies. So you can hear more details and things like say like footsteps in gravel. So you can tell if somebody's gonna be coming up and approaching you. Sound stage, for a close back headphone, they're pretty good. There's a lot of directionality to the sound. Things are placed very well. And it feels very clear where they are. Let's switch from playing to music to gaming. So, I'm gonna switch from this to the new mode. It found it immediately. Also something that's nice is that it tells you what's happening. It's not just a series of weird sound effects that you have to learn. It just says connected, or it'll say Bluetooth. I really appreciate that, that makes it way easier. Wow, okay. There's actually a lot of stuff in here. Not only can we change the bit depth of our audio, you get 16 bits of 48,000 kilohertz. In the app we have various different EQ profiles. Virtual surround base boost, compressor, voice clarity, a noise gate for a microphone as well as different levels of noise cancellation. This is a lot of features. Reverb, I don't want that. Interesting, so there's a lot of different EQ options as well as a built in 10 band EQ, which is very nice. It's great to be able to change it and make things sound exactly how you want them to. We also have the virtual surround sound, which we can. Oh, it has a demo in it? Let's see it. There we go, it's working now. So what it's doing right now, if we wanna test the virtual surround, it's just like a guy shooting a gun endlessly and it's panning from left to right. I assume it's supposed to be going around in a circle, but it's showing us only in stereo. When I turn it on I have virtual sound sound. Before we get into game, we're gonna do some testing with the mic to give you an idea for what the mic quality's gonna be like. We have got a fancy new speaker here to give a bit of a better idea of what like traffic noise and stuff like that will sound like. Just a really worst case scenario. - [Voice On Speaker] Bluetooth device one connected. (sounds of engine revving from speaker) - We're gonna take a listen on the, on the speakers. Okay. So this is me talking with some sound in the background. This is without AI noise suppression. We're now gonna add in the AI noise cancellation. This is the AI noise cancellation. That's really good. That's really impressive. Can you hear me? Oh, Oh. You can hear the po. This is the AI cancellation at mid. How does that sound? Can you hear it? Is the background stuff being cut out? I don't really know. How about the AI noise cancellation at high? As you increase the level of noise cancellation, your voice is gonna start to sound less and less natural and more robotic. Because taking out sound is really, really difficult. So you might find that depending on the situation you'll probably wanna go with like the low AI noise cancellation. Because it might have the best performance trade off for you. Now, this is the microphone with me typing, and I'm typing pretty hard. And then this is the microphone with the noise cancellation on low with me typing. And I'm gonna just be talking to you because I'm playing a game. Oh, got gem 'em. Schnell, throw a grenade. Ooh, I'm ultimating. What else does gamers say? Let's go. You know, the directionality of the sound's pretty good. The lots of impact in the bass. It's a little bit, there's a lot of detail in the highs to a point that they might even be fatiguing for some people. It's like a lot of like. (makes crunching noise) Lot of those high, the sounds of blades and guts are very pronounced. Yeah, and I'm not even using the virtual surround. We'll give that a second to try the virtual surround out. See if that makes things a little bit more immersive. I find the volume's default, a little fatiguing. Luckily there's an EQ, so you can really tailor the sound to however you like it. We're using the virtual surround now. Again, it's a nice to have. It might be more effective for you. I don't get a lot of use out of it, so. (shotgun blasts from game) Yeah. (zombie groaning) Apparently these don't have any RGB. Which is a bold move for ASUS. I was really expecting more than just a blue and a red LED that would indicate status. A pretty solid software experience. I know Armoury Crate can be hit or miss for people. I've had good experiences with it. I think it's pretty good software. Surprisingly great microphone performance on these, lots of features. A $200 price tag, that puts it in a very competitive segment, you know, competing with a lot of other gaming headsets. Thanks for watching, and thanks to ASUS for sponsoring this video.

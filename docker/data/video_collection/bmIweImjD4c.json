    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, it's Justine! And it is about a year anniversary since I moved into my new studio. And do you wanna know how many things that I wanted to do when I first moved in here that I haven't done? Yeah, that's right. A lot of them. Thank you to AMD and Corsair for sponsoring a portion of this video. But one thing that I have done over the past couple of weeks, is I decided that I was not going to do anything else, no other work, no playing video games, until I cleaned and organized my studio. Now the main reason for this is one of the rooms I had dedicated to be a podcast studio and, well, it never actually ended up being a podcast studio. It was kind of overflow storage. So I got all of that stuff cleaned up. I got my new gaming office, and soon I'll have my editing suite all set up. But to celebrate, we have a new gaming laptop in the studio today to check out. I'm so excited about this, when I saw the creative brief and how awesome this looks, I could not wait to get my hands on it. Now, as you guys know, a few video games have recently come out, \"Call of Duty\" being one of them, so I've been playing that a ton. And I'm gonna be traveling for the holidays and I don't like traveling with my console, so I'm really excited because a lot of the games that I've been playing recently are cross-platform compatible, so I can still play with my friends who are on consoles. So let's open this up and check it out. Okay, what do we have here? We have a T-shirt, that's a sweet, little treat. We've got our power brick, power adapter. Oh, we have a mouse pad, and this is actually very, very nice. This is like an industrial, high-quality mousepad. I'm hyped about that. Here it is, oh yeah. We still have another gift. There's another gift before we even get to the laptop. Hello, a laptop cover. (gasps) This is beautiful. First of all, can we just talk about the color scheme? This matches my new office. I actually painted one of the walls pink. This is gonna look so good. Look how pretty it is. (cheerful music) This is the Corsair Voyager a1600 AMD Advantage Edition laptop. It has an AMD Ryzen 6000 Series processor with AMD Radeon RX 6800M mobile graphics. This display is so beautiful. It's a 16-inch QHD+ display with 240-hertz refresh rate for super responsive and smooth gaming. These integrated S-keys right here are powered by Elgato Stream Deck software. I love using the Stream Deck on my desktop, but now I don't even have to bring it with me when I travel. It's right here and easily accessible when I'm streaming. I also really like Corsair's iCUE software that lets you customize your system's look or monitor performance, and even update any of your Corsair devices. It's super quiet due to vapor chamber cooling and has support for three simultaneous external 4K displays. It's got a full HD webcam and noise-canceling microphone array, so you're ready to stream right out of the box. (mellow music) I mean, this thing's beautiful. I mean, this is my aesthetic 100%. So now that this is all set up, let me show you the rest of the office and what's been happening here behind the scenes. Jenna, have you seen my new laptop? - I was just, I had my little eyes on it because it's very nice. - [Justine] I know, I'm really excited about it. - [Jenna] This is cool 'cause you can like-- - Okay, do you know what this is? This is integrated Stream Deck. So when you're streaming, like, these you can custom make them do whatever you want. So Jenna is here. We're gonna set up the new podcast room, but the problem is there's literally nothing in it. There's no lighting, we don't even have chairs. So you guys are basically seeing the beginning of the podcast room. - Yeah, I've got my little eyes on what's happening here. This is cool. - Dude, I know. I'm real excited about it. Of course, we can play \"Call of Duty.\" - Ooh, we've been playing. - Mhmm. I'm gonna take this home for the holidays and play from here. It's gonna be great. So let me show you guys what we've got going on here. So this is basically like my gaming room, which we'll talk about that in a bit, but this is the podcast room. It's empty. Let's make this a new home. Got a bunch of our gear here. Everything has been freshly organized. You love podcast days, don't you? Wow, very loud and echo-y. (mellow music) - Table, mic. - But I was thinking. - But that's a boring, white wall. (mellow music) Oops. - A tree. Try probably that side. (mellow music) I think it's bad. I think it's bad. - Let's see. - So you're gonna kill me, but I think it looked better on the other side. - Ah! - I know. It's much better, it's actually better, there's even more space there. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. (mellow music) Whoa! - Hey, everybody. - But that leaf is so close to your head. (laughs) - I know, I can sense it. (mellow music) - Yeah, I think this looks... - Looks great. - Or maybe these could move forward more? I feel like I need to move over a little, and so do you. Da da-da da, da-da dum The big reveal - Isn't it nice? - This is so temporary. Like, so many things need to change. It looks pretty decent on camera, but I've got my little laptop stand here. We're gonna get this fully tricked out and it's gonna be awesome. I'm so excited. But everything seems to be set up enough to make a functional podcast. Are you ready for this? - Yeah, this isn't in the shot, we can buck it. - [Justine] You look great. Where's Matty? - He's under the desk. - [Justine] Come on, she's got a bed for you. - [Jenna] Go see. - Look, you're included. - Go ahead. - [Justine] He is gonna end up on your lap. - [Jenna] That was kind of hard, that was a hard scratch. - Hey, guys, it's Justine. - And I'm Jenna. - Welcome to the \"Same Brain\" podcast! Let's roll that intro! (hypnotic music) It's so great, okay speaking-- - The new \"Warzone 2.0,\" woo! - Okay, so here's the thing. All right, so I just got this new laptop. I'm actually super excited about this. - It's so cute. - It's this Corsair Voyager. Now, like, look at this thing. First of all, I opened this up and I lost my mind. Like, look how beautiful it is. - It's so nice. - Like, this color, it's, like, printed on, but the way that it's printed, it looks like real. And then, when I flip this around, this has these built-in S-keys, and those are linked to, like, the Elgato Stream Deck. So you basically have an integrated Stream Deck. This is like ready to go, it's so great. So I'm bringing this home for the holidays. - It's really, really nice. - Yeah. - And it's not that heavy. Does it have a built-in SD card too? - It does. - Nice. USB-C, USB Type A. - Mhmm, it's great. It's really, really nice, and it matches my new office I got painted. (mellow music) And here's the final office look. And yes, my printer is sitting in the corner with some printed out papers. I do need to get something to fix that. But here's my desk. This is the whole setup that I have with the new Corsair Voyager. I absolutely love the look of this. The LED lights are such a nice, fun touch. But the best part about this is the fact that I can use external monitors. So I have two monitors hooked up to this currently, as you can see here, this is where I'm gonna be playing my game. And this is my old Stream Deck, which I don't need to use anymore, because I already have one built into the Corsair. Not only do I use the RODEcaster for the podcasting, but I do use it for my stream setup. And I know I'm playing on a PC, but I'm using a controller. Judge me if you would like, but I don't really care, 'cause I like to play with a controller. And here's the setup from behind. I also wanted to test it out playing directly on the laptop and mirroring it with the monitor in the background. And here it is, it worked great with a mirrored display. And I also wanted to try it out without the mirrored display, which is mostly how I'll be playing over the holiday season. This was such a fun video, hope you guys enjoyed it. I'll put a link in the description if you wanna get more information about the Corsair Voyager. And I will see you guys in my next video. (mellow music)",

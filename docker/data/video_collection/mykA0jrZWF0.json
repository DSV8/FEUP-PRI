    "description": "2019 RTX Gaming Laptops are the best gaming laptops we've seen to date but are they REALLY worth it? Cheap GTX Laptop -   Gaming benchmarks of RTX laptops show some impressive numbers and can do RDX ray tracing and DLSS but when compared to the older 10-series laptops they look quiet expensive  Background Music: Fili - For Momma  If you want to support the channel, consider a Dave2D membership by clicking the Join button above!

    "transcript": "NVIDIA's RTX Laptops are finally here and brands are making them brands are pushing them out but before you buy one, before you consider purchasing one of these RTX devices for 2019 there are some things that I feel like people should be aware of before we go into it I feel like we need to look at some performance matrix these are fire strike scores I'll talk about frame rates later this is kind of a relative performance between some of the GPU's for 1080p gaming okay, so a lot of the conversation here revolves around price it's not the only thing here but it is an important thing RTX laptops are very expensive the RTX 2060 laptops are starting around $1500 and it's not just the price point it's the fact that the features that you're getting the benefits that you're getting with these new RTX devices are not well showcased on laptop hardware so let me explain the screens on gaming laptops are usually 1080p screens you have like 60 Hz screens, you have 144 Hz screens some of them this year are 240 Hz screens, which is crazy fast but they're still 1080p screens the whole gaming laptop industry is just filled with 1080p screens which is perfectly fine for gaming but the problem is that RTX laptops showcase their stuff best at the higher resolution 10 series GPU's were already awesome for 1080p gaming like look at the GTX 1060 laptop playing Fortnite, PUBG, Call of Duty Black Ops 4 all of these are over 60 fps on high graphic setting at 1080p and you can easily get higher frame rates if you want to drop it to medium or low graphic settings and remember this is with the $800 or $900 gaming laptop like you can buy a GTX 1060 gaming laptop for 800 bucks right now in 2019 and you compare it to these new 20 series laptop these are a lot more money but the performance increase doesn't line up very nicely with the price increase so let's take an RTX 2060 laptop as an example so we take last year GS65 for $1800 or the new GS65 for $2100 the performance for 1080p gaming is very similar between the two and if you go ham you get like the top of the line 2080 Max Q you're still stuck on a 144 Hz 1080p screens so you literally can't see the extra performance in most games so these RTX laptops support ray tracing and DLSS and I was able to play Battlefield V on ray trace graphics and the frame rates on the 2080 Max Q are not bad but I still think it's way too early to pick up an RTX GPU just for ray trace graphics I just feel like more developers need to pick up on ray trace capabilities I feel like some of the RTX 2060 laptops are reasonably priced I mean they're not cheap by any means but you're getting decent value for 1080p gaming anything more powerful than that like the 2070 Max Q and higher those configurations feel really expensive and until we get higher res screens or just way more ray trace games I just don't think that RTX laptops are a good value for most people and that's really would RTX is for like higher resolution gaming and ray trace gaming without that and that's like not really available right now in the gaming ecosystem that we have without it it just doesn't feel like a good fit last year in 2018 it kind of feel like the golden age for gaming laptops we had 10 series GPU's we had 6 cores CPU's we had really fast 144 Hz panels like a lot of new technologies combined together to make this like crive factor or just really good gaming laptops and companies were competing each other with price that was a good time in 2019, companies still have to make new things they still have to sell a new things but it doesn't mean you have to buy it right like the 2018 devices are so good and I'm not saying that RTX laptops are bad they're really good but last year GTX 10 series laptops were already really good almost to the point of being too good because right now in 2019 there is nothing really compelling to make me say like hey people should be buying the RTX 20 series laptops over the 10 series laptops especially their current pricing again, not that RTX laptops are bad but it's just unless you have a ton of cash and you really want to be like the early adopters for ray trace games I feel like 10 series gaming laptops are just such a better value Okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it, see you guys next time",

    "transcript": "(electronic ding) - So is Lit Mobile a scam? In short, yes. But there's a little more to it than that. That's what we're here to talk about today. (lively music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? Really, that's just great. I'm doing pretty great today too, because we're gonna dive into Lit Mobile. The ads are everywhere again. This is not the first time these things have popped up. - So Lit Mobile just sent me this solar wireless battery pack. I'm excited. Let's see what's inside. - Those amazing, annoying and repetitive ads are from Lit Mobile. And there's some fishy stuff going on here with this company. But who exactly is Lit Mobile? Well, let's take a look. The ad campaign is selling a power bank, which can charge devices wirelessly, also with USB ports. The key feature however, is the built in solar panels. So in a perfect world, you can charge the power bank with the magic of sunlight. Sounds pretty good, right? But as with anything that sounds pretty good, it's probably a piece of (beep). I was wary the moment I laid eyes on this business and I didn't really know what it was until I started doing a little more digging. But the first thing that set me off was the video ad itself. In the video, the setting makes it seem like a tech reviewer has received a demo product of the Lit Mobile power bank, and they're simply making a video review. But the ad never shows the reviewer's face and it never says the reviewer's name. - (reviewer) I really like the build. It's got hand grips on the side. It's shockproof and water resistant. The power bank has 20,000 milliamps, which can fully charge your phone up to eight times. - (Krazy Ken) If I were making an ad with a celebrity endorsement, let's say with the incredibly handsome MKBHD, I would show his freaking face. Maybe Lit Mobile try to do that. Maybe they reached out to content creators, but everyone said no. Maybe the product just sucks. So it's really easy at this point to assume these are all just actors. My favorite part is when two different reviewers say identical things in two separate ads. - (reviewer) My favorite part of this device is that it charges my phone wirelessly. There's a red light indicator at the top, to let you know that your phone is charging. - My favorite feature about the device so far is that it charges my phone wirelessly. So there's a red light indicator there at the top and when you put your phone down to charge, it turns green to let you know that you're charging. (bright music) - (Krazy Ken) And the forced flowery language just gets worse. - (reviewer) Lit just sent me this solar charger with battery. Let's see what's inside. The solar panel has five V, three A charging capability. You can connect up to three chargers together to get 15 Watts of solar charging. - (Krazy Ken) The big red flag was the lack of continuity between ads. My favorite example is this. - (reviewer) On the back of the device, we have a bunch of solar panels which can charge the battery bank in about 60 minutes. - (reviewer) I love all these solar cells. This power bank takes 90 minutes to charge via wall and six to eight hours via solar. - What's even more misleading is that their YouTube channel labels these videos as reviews. That sounds fair, right? Yeah, they're not just ads with actors anymore. The titles are directly misleading. You know, maybe this is the case. Maybe there's these people that are good at marketing and they made a crummy product and they're making some mistakes. I like to give them the benefit of the doubt. And before I continue, I just wanna say, I'm not trying to defame anybody here, so I'm not gonna call out anybody's name individually, and I'm not gonna talk smack just for the sake of talking smack. But the more I looked into this company and their products, dude, the more I saw a lot of fishy stuff going on here. So, let's take a look at their presence on the web outside of the video ads. (air whooshing) The next red flag I encountered was when I Googled Lit Mobile. The top result from the \"people also ask\" box was, \"is Lit Mobile legit?\" And right below the box, literally right below the box are two links to the Better Business Bureau, and one of them is full of complaints. Many of the complaints said that the company Lit Mobile completed transactions and took money, but never delivered the product. Other complaint said there was no response from the company when the customer reached out. And some people said they actually did receive the product, but the product sucked. Big surprise. Oh yeah. And they're also F rated. (audience clapping) But worry not, the team is actively replying to your complaints. On the flip side, I did receive a comment that seemed to be from a happy customer. So maybe there's some redeeming qualities here. Let's take a look at their website. The next red flag, literally in red, is the 60% off scarcity banner for a spring sale. Don't worry, I'm sure everything will be 60% off in summer too. There's also the spin to win gizmo on the website, which is a total turnoff for me, it's just a squeeze page to get your email address for the most part. And my favorite part of this website are the reviews popping up. At first glance, my brain immediately goes, \"yeah, I'd bet at least half of these are (beep)\" I found one by Tom M. \"Okay. Looking good Tom M.\" and I came across one by Miriam V. \"Okay. Your son likes the product. \"Great. \"I guess he can nap a few times while it charges.\" Then I see a review by Nelson S., a verified buyer who left a five star review. - (reviewer) So you click on that. It takes you to this address here, and this is their post. It's a verified purchase. Playing closely attention to this image, you're actually gonna see that it's my video from YouTube that they've taken away. - After seeing all of this evidence get lined up and then that fake review piled on top, my brain went from \"Oh, these are a bunch of startup guys \"just living the dream and they're in way over their head\" to, \"this is a con operation.\" So I did what any reasonable person who's armed with this knowledge would do. I went ahead and bought one. So the website lists the Wireless Lit Solar PowerBank as a $99.95 product. When you add the item to your cart, you get the 60% discount. Great! I doubt I'm ever gonna receive the product, but Lit Mobile, this is my promise to you. If you actually get me the product and it freaking rocks, I will demo it in front of my entire audience and I will give you guys praise. But if it sucks, I guess I can always return it with the 60 day return policy, or is it 30 days? The jury is still out on that one. And if things get really bad, I can always call your exceptional support, right? - (automated voice) Seven, nine one. The number you dialed is not in service. (phone beeping) I'm screwed. Aren't I? Well, if this doesn't work out, I can always go to Alibaba and buy a 2019 innovative JD-T19 for $10.69 which looks awfully familiar to the Lit Mobile power bank. Lit Mobile, heart to heart time, I know everyone wants to live the American dream and many people want to start their own business and put food on the table and just make the world a better place. But you and a bunch of other companies need to hear this right now. Consumers, aren't stupid. You can put all of these scarcity things on your website, and you can make all of these video ad campaigns that you want, but we're not stupid. We're gonna catch on eventually. And that's exactly what's happening right now. So on behalf of everyone that you ripped off, this is me Krazy T Ken saying, you are a sack of (beep) Lit Mobile. But I digress. Prove me wrong. Send me that product and I will demo it in front of everybody. And if it's really good, I will apologize publicly in front of all of my audience and I will give your company praise and take it all back. So this is your chance to redeem yourself with a real influencer who's not just faceless and excited to unbox your product. So that's where things are right now. We'll see if the product ever does arrive. And for you guys watching my transmission, don't buy from these guys, don't buy from Lit Mobile. But I am curious if you have, I do wanna hear your horror stories or horror stories about any other bad company you've purchased from before. So go ahead and leave those in the comments down below. (electronic beep) As for everyone else, thanks for sticking with me. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat music)",

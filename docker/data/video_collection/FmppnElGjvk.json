    "transcript": "But I mean, look at this thing. It's like a little space marshmallow for your face computer For $200, on top of the $3,500 Vision Pro. This is obviously very silly. But there is something great about things that are this silly. And I just love it. It's all puffy. You know, it's. like NASA made it. You open it up. It's got little blinders for the Vison Pro. Put it to bed. Slide the Vision Pro in here. Push that forward to lock it down. Battery goes in here. Zip it up and put the cable in there. Comes with a little bag for accessories. I'm going to put the dual-loop band in there in case someone wants to wear that. Close it up. Zip it. And you're ready to rock.",

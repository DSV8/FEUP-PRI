    "transcript": "- The world without cables is sooner than you think. We checked out the PeakDo Wireless HDMI last year on LTT and it had really surprisingly good results actually. It could only do 1080 P60 or 4K 30 but it was good. Like there was basically zero input lag and it worked as described. It got us a like 30 to 40 foot range or something like that. The big difference though between this and the PeakDo stuff we used last year is the PeakDo thing's a transmitter and receiver on its own. This is a wireless display and it's got a battery built in. So, I mean, that's like zero wires, basically. Whoa! It's not very heavy. That's it. It's tiny. It's like 13.3 inches, but this is also a touch screen which, not gonna be used by everyone, but it's a cool feature nonetheless. There's not much in this box. We've got a sheet. It tells us that we've got a power port and exhaust port. So there's this like this puck that we'll see pretty soon here. And that's your dongle that pairs on the device itself and then it transmits that to the screen. So there's got to be a receiver built into the screen I think somewhere. The way this works is it's using 5G millimeter wave, which is basically the higher end of what 5G can do. And it's got crazy range and it's just zero latency. But it suffers from one huge issue and that's interference. If you've got a line of sight, it's awesome, like it actually works really, really well. But as soon as you put anything heavy, like honestly, if you just put a second display in between this and the other transmitter, it's probably gonna cut out. You might not get a full loss of transmission but you will see like a chop here and there where it has to catch up. So yeah, just make sure that even if you're at range, don't get a bunch of stuff in between you and the receiver and the display or it's not gonna work very well. Charging brick, 'cause you always need more of these. So we've got USB-C to A, this is probably for charging. That goes with our power brick and then we've also got another USB-C cable. And then this is HDMI mini to HDMI, I'm guessing. And then here's the puck, here's the transmitter. 5G can operate between 24 and 100 gigahertz in their frequency spectrums. But this has got a little 60G stamp on it. So I'm pretty sure it's operating at about 60 gigahertz. Let's get this wicked peel. - [Andy] Yeah, that peal is so bad. - Oh, I mean that's the display. It's got a really handy kickstand on the back actually. This is super stiff. I am a little worried that over time, from using it a whole ton, it's gonna loosen up and it's not gonna be as good, but it's not bad. It works pretty good. And I think there's rubber feet. Yeah, there's a little bit of rubber on the bottom too. You can see where they've got the battery. I would be willing to bet that it's right along here, it's the thickest point. But they've done a really good job of incorporating everything. So it's also got the IO. We've got a head phone jack and then what looks like USB-C. Oh, it tells me right here. OTG. What does OTG mean? I honestly don't know. And then what's this button do? It's like a switch. Oh, is that for like a menu? - [Jono] Is it USB On-The-Go? - I don't know. On-The-Go, maybe. The other side also has a few in ports. There's a power, then there's a type-C connector, and then there's our HD, so our really small HDMI. So I guess if you wanted to, you could just hook this up to whatever. Say you don't care about the wireless feature and you just want a small screen 'cause your switch is a little too small but you want something that's still portable, you can totally just plug it right into this guy. So this probably the receiver on the back here. So wherever you set up, just try to make sure that you've got a nice direct line of sight from this guy to this guy. So there's not much else to do except turn this thing and game on it. But first a word from our sponsors, Zoho CRM.

It's not that complicated though. Basically it does need power for most things. One of the cool features it has is it'll actually use your phone's battery to power the receiver. I don't think the switch will let it do that though so we've got it hooked up to a power source. And then from the USB-C side of things we're gonna go to our switch, because that docks via USB-C display. How do I turn you on? There's this OSD switch on the side here. And sometimes it likes to work real good. Oh, there it goes. Cool. Hey, cool. Oh, one thing to note is that when it's flat, it is still working with the receiver, oh, no signal. I didn't turn the switch off. Oh, I think it's trying. Please, there we go. Hey, all right, all right. So yeah, I mean there you have it. Boom, look at this. Nothing, nothing, no wires go into that at all. Boom, fully wireless experience and it looks really good though. And there's like zero input lag. The only latency I'm really feeling is the switch itself. I'm pretty sure Dread runs around like 30 FBS. Oh, yeah, see, as soon as I go to hide the receiver, it starts to have issues. So you've got to tilt it up like this. Yeah, it's mad at me already. If we had this not aimed at the camera and we had more of a line of sight like this, I bet you it'd work great. We'll show you a better example in a little bit. Ultra HDR, what the hell? This thing is Ultra HDR? Oh right, it's a touch screen. I keep forgetting that. Wait, is it though? What, yeah, okay, that's working. Oh, it has some trouble. Oh, okay, so HDR actually does make a huge difference. That looks worse. That's way too blown out. Auto's probably your best bet. You can turn the cross arrow on. Battery info, sharpness, yeah, that's just fine. But you can change a bunch of color like RGB pickers and stuff which is actually pretty impressive for something like this. So Andy just had me turn down the audio, because guess what? It's got speakers. That's right. Which is actually a pretty nice feature on a display like this because I mean if I'm using something like this, chances are you could be using this in the bathtub, frankly, like, \"Oh man, that's actually sick. I wish I could go take a bath and just play. I don't wanna bring a switch into a bathtub, that's just a terrible idea.\" But hear me out, you have the screen somewhere else that you can still see obviously, and then you have your switch somewhere else, and then you just got the controllers. If you drop the controllers in the bathtub, who cares? That's fine. I mean, sure, maybe you have to buy a new controller but that's not beyond the world. - [Horst] What's this? - It's a wireless display. - [Horst] By whom? - Ava. - Ava has an exhaust port? - Yeah. - What do you plug into the exhaust port? - Exhaust. - Look at, what's this? - It's my laptop. Is it trying? - We're setting up multitouch. - Oh, my God. Look, it's doing something. Yay. Wow. - Whoa. - Look at that. - [Horst] Hold on, hold on, hold on. - Oh, (beep), I have six Teams notifications. - Busy boy. - [Nicholas] But yeah, it's connected to my laptop just fine. Oh, it's having trouble. - Oh, no. - So basically, the receiver is on the back here and the transmitter's right there. So the problem is we're trying to show the camera but then we put the receiver flat on the table and then it loses signal. That's not because of the device. It's actually pretty good as soon as it's actually online of sight. It's great. - Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to think about the justification, because you think about the size of that thing, it's in a tabletly form factor. - Yeah. - So I could see how someone would think- - Like a, no, I don't wanna make it flat. - It could sit there flat, right? - Yeah. - And then it doesn't work. - It's a little finicky when you start losing connection. When you fully lose connection. - Yeah, but this thing is like, oh, no connection. So it's a little bit inconvenient. - Yeah, if you just get in the way a little bit, it'll chop a little bit but if you full on break the connection, you have to reconnect everything, which is fine. It's not the end of the world. - How does this computer work? - I don't know, windows is hard. - Critique windows all. - [Jono] Oh, try to use the touch display. - [Horst] Oh, yeah. Oh, whoa. - So that's super cool. The touch like totally, you closed the laptop. - Why? But it's going out of a- - It's probably set to shut off when that's closed. - Why? - It's only on this reflect tab. - Oh, much better. Here we go. - Oh, my God, Andy. - And the question is, Andy's such a great guy, will the touch screen work? 'Cause I to espresso display which had touchscreen functionality plug. - Is that where LED stands for, liquid espresso display? - Yeah, actually. - Wow. - Andy, why is this not going in this plug? Is this plug broken? - [Andy] Nope. - Wow, you're just- - [Andy] You broke my Mac? - No, no, it's just a stiff cable. - All right, boom, software update. Let's do the software update on Monterey. - [Nicholas] Hey, why isn't that working? - No, I don't think that's gonna- - No, it doesn't work, with windows it worked just fine. So maybe that's a big thing is if you're an Apple user and you wanna use the touch screen, maybe don't get this. - Okay, so this thing's like, I wanna watch a movie off my computer and I don't have any apps or tablet to use Plex or something. - Well, sure, but I wouldn't use this for watching movies. I would use this for portable gaming kind of. Say I want to play on my computer but I wanna do it from my couch and I don't have a TV or I don't wanna plug into my TV, 'cause then I've got this weird cable running all the way from my TV to my PC and I'd much rather just have a little dongle sticking out somewhere on my desk. - Right, okay, I'm gonna play a song. I'm gonna try playing a song through the speakers. Okay, ready? - [Nicholas] Yeah, switch it back. (upbeat music) - [Horst] Oh, yeah, that's so good. - [Nicholas] No, it's not. It's really bad. - But you know what? It's a thin scream, they're really hard to get good speakers out of. Well, I'm done. I have no more thoughts anyway. - Yeah, it's cool. - Okay. - See you later. - [Andy] Bye Jonathan. - Goodbye. - [Andy] So one thing that I'm currently curious right now is can you power that thing with a power bank? - Oh, yeah, it's totally working. I mean, it's trying now, but there it is. Yeah, boom. (background cheers) All right, now we wanna check out the range. So any of you who watch the PeakDo video, you might remember that this is basically where we tested that stuff too and it's hooked up to Andy's camera right now and I'm watching myself on the screen and it's a little weird, but I'm just gonna keep going back and I'm actually, I know that this has crazy good range. It's fine. We're totally past 20 feet now. It's still good. Yeah, this thing's okay, but here I'm gonna go behind the wall, oh, it stopped. Oh, it's having trouble kicking back on. Sometimes you got to unplug it, plug it back in. Oh, there it goes. (Nicholas laughs) Yeah, cool, there I am. Neat. It stops working as soon as I change the receiver direction and point it that way, but it works pretty good. because it's up such a high frequency, it's basically not going to get interrupted by a whole bunch of stuff. It takes a lot of juice though. Like that thing is getting hot and this isn't too bad, but it's just the battery. That's why it has all those vents on the back, on the bottom. So if you're gonna get one of these, don't tuck it away somewhere both because of the line of sight and because it's just gonna get crazy warm. Probably not gonna start a fire, but it's not something you wanna toy with really. For the 13 inch one that we've got, it's 1080p and it's like $590. So just shy of 600 bucks for a 13 inch screen, it is 1080p 60 at least. If you want to go higher than that, you can get 4K on the 17 inch screen, but it's gonna cost you even more. It's gonna cost you like $1000 to get that. So I really don't see this being for people who wanna play games too much unless they're traveling constantly and they need some kind of portable display. Otherwise the main place I see it being used is in camera dens. Like right now, this is great having a little portable monitor like this. If we were filming outside or something, we could have this setup and just put our monitor in a little table somewhere and that way we can actually watch ourselves and make sure that we're getting the shot that we need, especially if you're by yourself. If you're by yourself and you've got to set up on a tripod and then just walk away, having this with you so that you can look at yourself and make sure the shot looks good, super handy. I see that being a much more value oriented position. Whereas for gaming, I don't know, I don't think it's worth it. But to each their own. If you have a use case and you really want one of these, I mean, hey, it's a pretty cool product, nonetheless. And maybe in the future, the price will drop and we can see a lot more wireless displays coming for pretty much every use case, maybe even high refresh rate gaming monitors. You never know. Thanks for watching. This is the InnLead Ava Wireless Display 4K or 1080p depending on which model you get. And yeah, if you wanna check out any other monitor, short circuits, feel free. There's a whole bunch. We just did the ViewSonic Mini-LED. That was great, fun monitor, looks a lot nicer than this. (Nicholas laughs)",

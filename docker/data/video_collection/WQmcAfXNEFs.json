    "transcript": "So you guys know I'm always on the hunt for gadgets especially gadgets that can solve problems. You recently heard about these Apple wireless earpods, they're calling 'em AirPods, these things that are completely wireless earphones. And I've also been making videos about these \"fully wireless earphones\" for a while, and truthfully, the vast majority have sucked. I'm talking about things that go on each ear independently and have no cable connecting the two of them. So, when Apple announced these \"AirPods\", I immediately had some apprehension regarding the design. Regular earpods don't really fit in your ear that tightly to begin with. It got me to thinking and searching and wondering what had been going on, then, I stumbled on these guys right here, from Amazon just over 40 bucks, but they have good reviews and I was like \"wow, could these be a good, inexpensive alternative \"to not just those AirPods, but other contenders \"in the fully wireless earphone space?\" \"Axgio Dash Wireless\" I'll link 'em down in the description so you don't need to remember that weird product name. Travel case with the earphones inside of there. Cable to charge them up, and then... some interchangable ear tips so you can get the right size also a tiny little user manual I'm gonna leave that out for a moment because, man, in the past I have had some nightmare pairing experiences. Now, one thing that you're gonna notice about these that is much different than the AirPods is they have an ear-hook on there, so these guys are going nowhere. So, for fitness these ones are going to be a lot more reliable, I would assume. So, there's a charge port on each one. The cable is a single USB on one end, but then two micros on the other, so it's a single cable. Mini user manual! Am I in for a nightmare or not? Volume up and down. The middle button is called a \"multi-function button\". There's also a microphone which I almost missed, so you can speak through this in the event that you do get a phone call. \"Choose one of the two headphones randomly \"as a main headphone.\" \"Press MFB for 2-3 seconds.\" Okay, that's this middle button here. There we go. So, when this guy flashes blue and red, then it's in pairing mode. So you wanna pair one up and then move to the other. \"Axgio Dash\", okay cool. Paired! I heard it say connected. Okay, now second headphone, there's no need to go into pairing mode, it just has to be powered on. And then, when you wanna power them off, all you need to do is power off one and the other one will automatically power off as well. If this works, that is... Lightyears better than the last time. The earhook goes over the top, same thing on this side. And that's not- that's not going anywhere with the earhook on there. -attempt to play some music here... These are WAY louder. My biggest complaint on that last pair was volume. The volume here... is WAY better. [music plays from earphone] How about that? Fully wireless! You can share. Give one to your friend. Gimme a second, Jack, I just need to hear a few more. Gimme a second. ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME I'M TOO LOUD?! I'mma check the range. [door slams] [music plays from earphone] These things are sick! These are sick! Like, in a good way I mean! -fit on securely, they sound good for what you're paying, lots of low end, lots of volume. What can I say? I'm gonna tell you something, I think these are gonna be out of stock real quick, because this is the promise right here, the fully wireless earbud. The fully wireless future! We're a step closer.",

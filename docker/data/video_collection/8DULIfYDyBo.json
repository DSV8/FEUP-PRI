    "description": "Dave2D review of the Alienware M15, the best gaming laptop from Dell for thin and light performance. Alienware M15 -   The M15 is 38% lighter and 17% thinner than the Alienware 15. Loaded with the GTX 1070 MaxQ and i7-8750H, it still brings excellent performance for modern games.

    "transcript": "Hey! How's it going? Dave2D here So Alienware laptops have been around for a while. There are normally a little bit bigger, a little bit thicker Normally a bit heavier than others gaming laptops out there. But recently they announced the M15 This is their 1st thin and light gaming laptop Which kinda goes in the opposite direction with everything I know about the Alienware But they have also done something really impressive this year That i didn't think they would be able to do They have good thermals in this thin and light laptop So here it is, this is Alienware's new 15 inch thin and light gaming laptop And i put a picture of this up on twitter And a lot you guys were asking Does this have the same kind of build quality and durability as their regular Alienware laptops? Because that's what Alienware is been known for over these years. Really good build quality, really tankie laptops and is this as well-built, is this still a tank? Structurally i am going to say yes. It's not super thin If you compare it to stuff like the GS65 or an AERO 15 or Razer Blade those are thinner, this isn't crazy thin But it is significantly thinner than there previous generation And if you look at the build quality across the chassis This thing feels completely different from those other devices There's no flex from the chassis The hing is really well built The top panel has the same kind of finishes as the previous generations with the light up Alienware head logo The inside has this soft touch material But it feels a little bit different this year than it did in previous generations So that actually feels like it could last longer It reminds me of this stuff you see on a higher end Lenovo laptops It feels like it won't degrade over time The bottom panel also metal and I mean like a solid metal This is like It's legit This is the type of stuff you see on really well-built laptops It's only like thin alluminium that can flex easily It's built like an Alienware Feels like an Alienware It's a tank The technical specs are solid to the 2018 gaming laptop that has great components They basically took their Alienware 15 and fit it in to this thinner and lighter package Just running two drive on this unit fast ones",

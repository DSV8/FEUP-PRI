    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is Austin. This is a $120 laptop and I'm going to find out if it's any good. I recently did a video on back-to-school laptops and while there are some pretty solid cheap options, some of you guys wanted to see me go even farther, which is where the RCA Cambio comes in. At $120, this is the cheapest, brand new laptop tablet thing I could find. Taking a look at the box, it actually doesn't look too bad. We have an 11.6-inch screen, 2GB of memory, as we all 32GB of storage and it does come preloaded with Windows 10. I like on the box that shows it has four different modes, laptop mode, display mode, tablet mode, and presentation mode, but it's a two-in-one, not a four-in-one. Cardboard quality. Aw man, this is gonna be a fun video. I have a good feeling about this one. Well actually, you know what? It's reasonably heavy. It's actually not too bad. This might be the cheapest plastic I have ever seen. It has somewhat large bezels, but it actually is for a good reason. Because of that, they are able to fit what looks to be a full-sized keyboard, although the trackpad is maybe just a little bit small. For ports, this guy has a mini-HDMI, a micro-USB port, headphone jack, power button, a full-size USB, as well as a tiny Windows key. Even though the plastic and the build is definitely cheap on this guy, it actually doesn't feel too bad in the hand. The weight's about right, it's nicely balanced, and there's not even a lot of flex. I mean, sure I wouldn't wanna pay $300 for it but if you can get past the actual build, it's not bad. This guy actually doesn't have the worst specs in the world. It's powered by a quad-core Intel Atom Processor, 2GB of memory, 32GB of storage, and have an 11.6-inch display like this unit, where most of the Cambios I've seen have a 10.1-inch screen. So what exactly can you do with a $120 laptop? Well normally, I would try to do a few standard things I do with all laptops. However, Mr. Jimmy Champane has some other thoughts in mind. You have a list of demands. - [Jimmy] Yeah, but they're not from me. - \"They're not from me,\" okay. - They're from the gods. - Challenges from the gods, edit a photo. Select to focus, yeah. Let's just focus on Ken's back. So yes, it can edit photos. Challenges from the gods, play one game of CS:GO. This is a revolutionary gaming experience. I feel like after everyone plays CS:GO with this for the first time, they'll never be able to go back. [Ken]: Are you shooting with the \"up\" button? Challenges from the gods, play Minecraft Pocket Edition. All right, so I can actually say that with Minecraft, this is actually kind of playable. I mean, yes, I have to turn the graphic settings down and lower the chunks, but it's actually not that bad. Of course the biggest problem is this trackpad has no left and right click dedicated options, so I just have to tap to click, which is not great. Challenges from the gods, watch one HD video. Wow, not only does this work, we can actually play 1440p YouTube. Okay, all right, I mean, it's a 720p screen, so. Challenges from the gods, draw with the touchscreen in MS Paint. That's pretty impressive. This is Ken, in case you guys are curious, but Ken is super cool and he wears his hat slightly sideways and then he's got a big frown 'cause Ken is never happy 'cause he doesn't believe in me. There we go. Successfully painted with MS Paint a very true to life picture of Mr. Ken Bolido. Many, many tests, long arduous tests end. Are the gods pleased? Your head is out of the frame right now. So many tests later, are the gods pleased with the power and performance of the RCA Cambio? - Actually, you got all but one. It was CS:GO that we couldn't do, right? - Yeah. - That's it. And you were able to play CS:GO. - 15 frames per second with the trackpad is exactly the way that everyone should play CS:GO. So, should you buy the RCA $120 Windows laptop tablet thing? It actually isn't that bad. No, it's not the greatest thing in the world and if you can afford, spend another $100, you're gonna get something that's a lot better but it's better than I expected. So, what do you guys think about this guy? Let me know on the comments below and I will catch you on the next one.",

    "description": "Link to the Article --   Want to extract text from the Images?   Do you know Google Keep is the best Free Online OCR reader in the market! With Google Keep, you can extract text from any image whether it's a printout or in a digital form.  Why use Google Keep instead of other OCR reader  #1 Accuracy -- I have tested this same image with few popular OCR reader in the market like -- EVERNOTE, CAMSCANNER PRO, ONENOTE, and ONLINE OCR etc. And I got the most accurate result from Google Keep.   #2 Google Keep is free  #3 No need to install any app, it works from the web version i.e. keep.google.com. Overall you can use it on every device you have.  The only downside is, you need an active internet connection to use it.    [Resouces]  I use Audio from YouTube audio library.

    "transcript": "now, we're going to start off with a quick tour of the current office space and I do want to preface it by saying that it's particularly bad now because of all of the like moving stuff's in the way it's not normally this cluttered and I I already feel like a teenager making excuses after being caught masturbating by their parents but it's not normally this hoarder NY so this is what I see when I come in through the door every morning obviously there's a lot less crap standing around but yeah this is this is more or less it now to the side here this is an area that kind of builds up clutter I usually like bring in stuff put it here and then use it although this has all been used so maybe once every three videos I'll like kind of clear a bunch of this stuff out and then next to that is like the TV thing that we used for a little bit uh I'm pretty excited in the new office there's like a great space to set up a lounge uh where I can have like a TV and stuff on this so I think that's going to look great and here is the AliExpress mer PS5 which Anna is still very upset about she wants me to change that out basically every time she sees it uh but it it's just living like this cuz it's memories you know now this desk setup you see a lot this is where I do most of my testing it used to be in the room of which we shall not speak which we'll we'll have a look at a bit later but that's kind of Madness but for the setup I've got a PC that I normally use for all of the testing and then if you kind of move stuff out of the way there is a really wild cable situation going on on there because I kind of keep having to change things out here and then the cables just build up over there so I'm going to have to find a better way to deal with that at the new office so that it doesn't end up looking like Cleopatra's hair it's not Cleopatra Medusa Medusa's hair there we go and then this is the main desk where I do a lot of intros and like tear downs and stuff next to that we have like the camera Nook which is also quite messy but this is where I store all of my camera gear this spot used to be a lot worse before I moved a bunch of stuff into the room of which we shall not speak uh which we'll we'll look at soon but uh at the moment it's actually not that bad now unfortunately because of how this office is laying out I've had to use the area by the window as like storage Mass Madness because there's like a beam over there which means I can't get like lights and stuff under it and it's kind of a problem because it's forced me to turn this office into a bit of a cave because well I I can't really access the window for like desk setting up and stuff which has led to to this you can see there's a lot of stuffing going on here this is like the primary storage area in the office and every time I have to get something from in there it's like a real problem so I I I tend to just ignore a lot of that stuff uh but again it does vary in its intensity sometimes it's pretty neat back here and sometimes it it looks like this yeah wow I feel a bit like asmin gold here but this is like a mini fridge area which I've never used cuz that fridge is extremely noisy but uh yeah it's just taken up a lot of space monitor yoga mat exciting stuff through here you can see a lot more storage Madness which is like my editing area so let's go have a look at that now I am a little embarrassed by this area the main reason that I like hoard stuff in this way is that every time that I get rid of things or sell them the moment that I sell them I end up needing it for a video and have to Reby it which is super annoying and it's kind of morphed into not not a not a great habit of like storing a whole bunch of crap and by crap I do mean all like really dope Hardware uh but there is a bit of a system at least so this is where the graphics cards live kind of in a gray scale descending down into madness there are CPUs up there motherboards over here power supplies are down here over here are my storage bins this is just miscellaneous crap the same goes for in these uh they've been very useful but as you can see they've been they've been overflowing for a while next to that is where all of my editing happens I have my ls50 wireless over here I really like these speakers I got them used off canu Audio Mart for a really good deal and they're just amazing I love them a lot and then I just have this single uh 4K 27 in I think this is an Acer Predator that I've had for ages uh I still use the the vertical Mouse because it's just so good for Cobble tunnel and stuff now the editing system lives down here next to more cable Madness it's it just descends into this really quickly cuz I have to change things out a lot and then you just give up on organizing it kind of 5 months down the line and then it turns into that uh but the system in there has uh 12 900k in it is the CPU 64 gigs of ddr5 so real beastly CPU setup for all of the video editing and the graphics card kind of changes but at the moment there's a 40 70 TI in now I've turned off the light this is normally the state that I go into it in I don't use the the like office lights in here cuz they're a really terrible color temperature so I usually edit in this format and while I'm editing whenever I want to be reminded of what a hoarding animal I am I just kind of look through this window and then you see that going on there but I I try and ignore it I try and kind of peek through there instead and then finally there is my inspirational displate living over there I bought this one this wasn't sponsored have we done a sponsorship with this plate before I don't think so now we're almost at the end of the tour that feels a bit like I'm revealing something deeply terrible about myself but uh now we need to get to the worst part which is the room of which we shall not speak this room went from where I did testing to where I just stuff a whole bunch of crap and the reason was there was like a lot of construction happening on that side of the wall so it became super noisy and unusable in here so I just moved a bunch of clutter in here so that I could have a neater main space now this is where I stack all of my stands and like camera stuff this used to live in that other Nook uh so getting it out of view made it a lot easier for me to pretend like the space was neat on camera and then next to that we've got some track racer boxes uh the Sim racing rig is is one of the big points of clutter in here other than all of the other crap uh but yeah here it is as you can see it is huge this was very exciting to to do a video on I have added to it a bit and yes I am distracting from the room but uh I did add like a manual transmission to it which has been really fun especially for driving older cars you can actually shift manually it's very exciting but once we move to the new space I will do a follow-up video with a VR implementation for this so look out for that next is my caddy where like the screwdrivers and thermal paste and stuff lives this goes through various stages of neatness yeah other than that there are some PCS down there uh the PC that I use for the SIM racing rig is like my summer gaming PC this foam wall has also been a complete nightmare when we first moved in here I was like wow this is going to be a great way to get some nice texture on the wall for like you know background and shots but it just doesn't stay on the wall they keep falling off so over the first 2 years we kept having to stick them back up but eventually we just gave up and this is kind of how the walls deteriorated over time I'm not going to do this again at the new office this was this was way too much effort to deal with and then above my huge pile of B quiet fans and VGA monitor we have some more displates again not sponsored okay so now that we've come to the end of me bearing my soul of all of the crap I've been hiding off camera for the last 2 years in various States um now comes the very exciting part of moving this nightmare to a different space ah okay well I guess we start with the graphics cards wow those boxes really do fill up that crate [Music] [Applause] [Music] fast I think with these graphics cards there are a couple of them that I do actually have boxes for uh unfortunately the 4090 isn't one of them this this came out of a system so I I don't know how I'm going to transport this but let's just put it aside for now oh no I don't know where the box is for my waifu [Music] Ram Anna found that and she was asking where where the MacBook Pro is now you can actually in this shot see the MacBook Pro you need to look lower no stop it I I I had to quickly move it out the way but don't worry don't worry you have to quickly move it out the way like mons like six months ago but don't worry don't worry the MacBook Pro is being protected by the Asus zephrus on top of it so it's fine like it was for those of you that are concerned both of the laptops are still in pristine condition they they may have been stuffed in a hole but it was a safe comfy hole that they were both very happy with okay well this infinite pit is slowly deteriorating uh we're going to go for lunch now we've made a bit of a dent but yeah it's still so much left there oh my word aios take up so much space in these boxes there's like three aios and two fans in this box and it's full so annoying and there's just so many of them [Music] [Music] still it is the end of day one we've done a lot we've got a whole bunch of camera crap over there we've actually got access to the window now which is really nice I feel bad that I uh like I didn't use the window I don't think I used this space as well as I could have but I've explained why that was kind of difficult to use I've got piles of these boxes going on so these like this entire pile that entire pile and that entire pile is pretty much all just the stuff on the shelves but as you can tell most of the crap from the shelves is has been put away these are some empty boxes that I haven't been able to find the stuff that goes in it but yeah this is the end of day one I think we've made a lot of progress to get everything ready for the movers on Monday and we've still got another day to get the rest of it done I think good [Music] progress oh my God that's so and then finally I'm just going to remove the kind of gear shifter so that doesn't get damaged and then I think we're in a space where it should be [Music] movable okay well I I sit before you a broken man today um as you probably could tell not much filming happened because there was basically just two people suffering in silence in the same space together uh so I don't think it made for good content I I can't imagine the movers are going to be very happy when they get here tomorrow because this office is just a bottomless pit of this bear this is what like 500 Tech videos wor worth of content looks like here's the the Sim racing chair with the pedal box which that weighs more than a small Moon it is wildly heavy why does all of the cool stuff weigh a lot I don't understand why um we've also still got a bunch of loose things on desks which we've run out of boxes to put stuff in yeah so here's just more piles of stuff this this this tripod has been super in the way all day like both Anna and I have fallen over it many many many times was it no it well it was it it was meant to be used it just we didn't get around to it um oh Anna we need to not show your feet that's going to make the internet yeah hi hi your feet yeah so this is this is the like path that you walk through to to kind of navigate to the to the different bits of the office yeah I don't know whatever tomorrow moving happens I guess and just like that the very nice movers have left and there's nothing left in here look at that empty space this room which was stuffed to the gills with some racing stuff is now just an empty void with walls that we need to clean there's actually generally quite a lot of cleaning we're going to have to do before we can give up this spot uh and then in here it's also nothing much but my editing PC and and some loose bins which we have to move oh and that reminds me I do need to get my Wi-Fi router from out there but yeah I guess with that we need to spend the next 3 years setting up the new space so um yeah let's go do that and this is what the new space looks like with all of the stuff in it now this stuff remember took up the entirety of the previous office whereas now it is just kind of like a bit in the corner we've also got a huge piece of carpet coming which we're very excited about uh over here there is just lots of space going on uh we're going to set up like more storage over here we're going to have desks here more desks over here and then there's also a bunch of stuff in like the loungy area over here uh which we still need to sort out kind of how we're going to set it up but this this looks more or less okay I guess what's just crazy to me is how small all of this stuff looks in here like that Sim racing stand for example this is what it looks like in this space it's just like a a bit of thing over here whereas in the previous office it took up an entire room so yeah that that's quite exciting generally it's going to be so much less cramped in here I'm super excited uh so with that let's start kind of unpacking stuff oh yeah one thing that I have noticed is that the floor is wildly skew in here so this desk for example kind of looks looks like it's going to fall over this way and it's just flat on the ground but putting that aside I honestly don't even know where to begin with all of this at this point to be honest um I feel like I need an adult [Music] okay so this is the end of day 17 of moving I don't know where we're at now but uh this pile of Madness is still in the middle and it's still crazy I think I'm going to have the main filming set kind of facing that corner uh so that's why we have the carpet here for sound and stuff for that um but yeah very very excited about the huge amount of space [Music] how did that one G carry it [Music] up we'll put this like right here oh oh my word we still have so much work to do here uh it's it's crazy everything's standing around it's been a wild couple of weeks Anna and I are both absolutely exhausted she's busy uh like cutting curtains down to size cuz we we got to be able to control the the light in here um but yeah I mean it it may have been exhausting but we're both extremely excited about what's happening here I think the space is going to be awesome we can't wait for it to be done but we really need a break this has just been a complete Onslaught uh but I hope you enjoyed the video we're not going to see the finished state of the space in here cuz that's probably going to take a couple of months to get to a finished point but it's very close to a place where we can actually start using this space to make videos around all of the setting up and stuff so the normal schedule should start up soon uh but yeah thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed the move thank you very much Anna for all of your suffering and dedication and yeah until the next video bye-bye [Music] h [Music]",

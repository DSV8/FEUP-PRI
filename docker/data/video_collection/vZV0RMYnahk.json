    "description": "With the GTX 1660 now launched we decided to go through our collection of older NVIDIA GPUs to see how this new card stacked up against its true predecessors:  the GTX 760, GTX 960 and GTX 1060.  We threw in the GTX 1660 Ti for good measure too into the 13-game benchmark.  The last 6 years of GTX 60-series cards has been priced between $200 and $250 and this one is no different but is the value equation still there?

    "transcript": "in the last few months there have been a ton of Nvidia launches but we wanted to narrow our focus a bit more and talk about affordable graphics cards the GTX 1660 Ti and the GTX 1660 are both priced under $300 so that puts them in the same conversation as cards like the GTX 960 on the gtx 960 and of course the gtx 760 so that ends your comments in our gtx 1660 performance review video got us into thinking about this little fun video if we took all of these 60 series cards from nvidia from the last few years and benchmarked them what will the results look like one of the words how much of a performance improvement with these newer cards provide if you're still holding on to a GPU that was once affordable but is still you know almost half a decade old honestly this video is more about satisfying our curiosity than anything else so we hope that you enjoy this one but first let's take a quick look at our sponsor the legendary hyper 212 CPU cooler from Coolermaster now comes in this breathtaking matte black finish the included Silencio 120 millimeter fan delivers great airflow and reduced noise plus you can pick up an RGB version of this cooler as well learn more about the hyper 212 Black Edition and its RGB sibling down below alright so I don't want to drag this out for too long so let's take a look at some of the cars I'll be using to keep things simple I'll be narrowly focusing on GeForce GPUs that have been launched between 200 and 300 dollars to chart a possible upgrade path from 2013 until now so this is EVGA gtx 760 superclocked which was launched back in 2013 for about two hundred and sixty-five dollars so a bit more than the $250 referenced version but it had higher clock speeds it was also a good replacement for the gtx 660 series then in 2015 nvidia launched the gtx 960 for $200 and it almost instantly became a hit since it cost less than the gtx 760 while offering more performance and double the amount of memory again i'm going to use the EVGA superclocked version since it ended up being pretty close to $200 nvidia started running into a bit of a price scrape for their next generation since the gtx 1060 costs 250 but man did it offer a huge jump in gameplay performance in some cases it was over 50% faster than the GTX 960 it did end up becoming one of the most popular GPUs of all time and still is at the top of steams hardware survey so that covers the older cards that will be put up against gtx 1660 ti and the gtx 1660 so let's get at the benchmarks starting with 1080p right away at the start of these benchmarks the gtx 960 gives pretty playable frame rates in many of the games it's lower 1% times are good too but as the tests go on it starts to run out of memory capacity in games like shadow of war Warhammer 2 Witcher and Wolfenstein the GTX 760 is really starting to show its age though especially since it only came with 2 gigabytes worth of video memory and its architecture isn't optimized for dx12 I think a lot of people with this GPU ended up getting on the GTX 1060 wagon but if you didn't todays GPUs will be a massive upgrade even if the rest of your system is a bit older moving on to 1440p and it's pretty obvious that while the GTX 960 is still a decent card in some games it's one-dimensional there's just no way it can keep up at 1440p though in some well optimized dx11 games like Call of Duty and overwatch lowering some settings could still lead to over 60 frames per second gtx 760 though it just struggled to 1080p which means you can forget about 1440p unless the in-game settings are turned way down I also want to explain that those fails in some charts was either locked up or and simply wouldn't run likely due to memory limitations the GTX 1660 and the gtx 1660 ti of course offer huge upgrades for the gtx 960 and especially this gtx 760 but like I said before anyone with a GTX 1060 shouldn't even think about moving up to the newer cards since they don't offer enough of a performance boost so far the benchmarks didn't really show anything unexpected even though it's great to see the gtx 960 still being able to deliver playable frame rates and 1080p we can actually see why the gtx 1060 was so popular the performance difference between the 960 and the 1060 was just so massive in comparison to the 1060 and the 1660 but this all leads me to another question with the gtx 1660 at deunan $20 and it's TI variant going for around two hundred eighty dollars and higher which one of those is actually the best value let's start by looking at how much of an overall performance boost you can expect straight up the gtx 1660 Ti and the GTX 1660 provided about twice the amount of performance as the gtx 960 at 1080p compared to the gtx 760 they offer literally the same frame rates as three or four of those cards sometimes even more at 1440p the newer cards really do pull away even further due to their higher amounts of video memory I also want to bring them the fact that if you already have a 1060 don't consider upgrading right now to a similarly priced 1660 card it's just not worth it now that I've said this age let's take a look at the value equation since it's probably what matters the most to anyone who spends just 200 to 250 dollars on a graphics card actually from a value standpoint it's pretty much even between the gtx 1660 and the 1660 ti the EVGA Black Edition cars that I chose go for around two hundred and twenty dollars and two hundred eighty dollars so basically reference price points and that makes the 1660 TI 27% more expensive but it offers somewhere between 25 and 28 percent more performance so if you can afford one of these higher graphics cards it's gonna offer you you know a perfectly linear frame rate increase for the higher cost another thing that he gets brought up in our last video is the gtx 1070 it isn't shown in the charts here but if you can find one for $200 or less that hasn't been abused with countless hours of mining that might be a good option but buying one brand new is just too expensive right now so there you guys have it it's really amazing to see what six years of development has accomplished in these super popular $200-$300 GPU market if you're actually interested in comparing older GPUs or CPUs from the past to the latest generation definitely let us know in the comments down below I definitely had a lot of fun with this and I can't wait to see what you guys come up with I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our boot sequence channel I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

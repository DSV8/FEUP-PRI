    "transcript": "(inhales deeply) (exhales deeply) - What's up, guys? Lew here back with another video. And today I've got something that I found very interesting from the moment I heard about it. Heard about it, no pun intended. I've got a bunch of headphones on the table here, but, really, the focus is in the center of the table. These here are called BTunes, and they're from a company called Voxoa. Hope I'm saying that correctly. These little contraptions here will turn any set of headphones, your favorite set of headphones, into wireless ones using high-quality Bluetooth 4.0. Now, obviously, you're gonna need to use a pair of headphones that has a detachable cable because this here will connect to the opening where that cable would normally attach. Now, they make devices for various popular brands, Bose headphones, for example, but they also make a universal unit. The idea of being able to take a headphone that is not wireless and make it wireless to me is like the perfect kind of scenario because then you're not stuck to selecting only headphones that come in a wireless variant from the manufacturer. Here I've got a pair of JBLs, some Shure SRH440s, some Sennheiser HD8 DJs, and a pair of Alpine headphones that I featured a little while back on the channel. These are all wired headphones. We're about to discover this entire process together. So flipping the box over, the BTunes from Voxoa. Voxoa. Voxoa. Voxoa. Designed in California but, of course, assembled in China. Most importantly, made for you. Bluetooth 4.0, so power-saving features there. NFC Touch-to-Pair, I love this in my wireless headphones. It'll work up to 10 meters. Battery is good for 300 hours of standby and 10 hours of listening at moderate volume. There you have it. Now, chances are you've already got a set of headphones. You might even be listening to this video on those headphones. So here is the device. You are also adding a microphone here as well. Pretty sleek little unit there. A micro USB cable to charge it up, so that's how you're gonna charge it up, and then you've also got a power switch in that location there. Paperwork, just a little bit. Charging, charging finished, pair them up, blah, blah, blah, low battery. A little bit of warranty, and we are good to go. The convenience of Bluetooth is amazing, and with 4.0 and these new codecs, the sound is actually pretty good so I'm hoping that this little guy can compete with some of my wireless favorites. Then I can just carry this around. Okay, I see it flashing now, so let me pull out my phone, hold it up. (hip hop instrumental music) Come on, NFC. NFC, where art thou? Do I have NFC turned on? I do. You're gonna need to be a little bit more precise in this case here. Come on, little guy. Is it user manual time? Did I just move the table? NFC, please. Oh! Nailed it, moved it up a bit. It has to be pretty precise. Kind of wish it was a little bit easier. Which headphones? Let's start with these, the Sennheiser HD8 DJ. Again, this is, it's kind of a universal thing, but it's gonna depend on your headphones. Let's see what's up. Oh, there we go. Little adjustment. Now I'm both earcups. Am I talking loud? I'm a little loud. Okay. (hip hop instrumental music) I feel like I should be able to go a little bit louder. Let me try on these guys here. That's a much better fit. Look at that. This one fits great. Ooh, it sounds better too. (hip hop music) I mean, we're wireless right now, folks. Look. I don't see any wires. Jack, see any wires? One thing I want to mention, volume. I feel like I could use a little bit more. Now, this, again, is gonna depend on your headphones and how much power is necessary to drive those transducers. Did you know that's what, yeah. We're gonna move to these JBLs over here. Okay, now that's a little bit louder on these guys. (hip hop instrumental music) (hip hop music) Ooh, now these guys, okay. These guys feature a 3.5 millimeter jack, so you would need an adapter in this case 'cause this is a 2.5 millimeter. There you have it. I don't know, for me, this fit here on the Shures, that almost looks like it was meant to be kind of. (hip hop instrumental music) To be honest, for most people I think that's gonna be suitable volume. (hip hop instrumental music) I wish it was a little bit louder, but I think that might be me more than the actual device. I think it's kind of cool. Wireless headphones that didn't come from the factory wireless. You made them wireless. To be completely honest, I think I'm into it. Voxoa BTunes. Check it out, I guess. I'll drop a link in the description. Thank you very much for watching. Appreciate your viewership. If you enjoyed this content, make sure to leave a thumbs up down below. Take a deep breath. (inhales deeply) (exhales deeply) And I'll catch you on the next episode. Later, guys.",

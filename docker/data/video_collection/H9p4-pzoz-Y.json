    "transcript": "- Okay hold on, hold on. Everybody just, just Shhh, shhh, shhhhh In your heart, you already know the tech news, but I'm gonna read it to you for fun. - [Producer] (laughs) What's that? - There's been a lot of buzz around the new RTX 3000 series graphics cards, but we just got some news about some other NVIDIA GPUs that would have been called Quadro and Tesla if NVIDIA wasn't apparently retiring both of those names. Yep, the new NVIDIA RTX A6000 and A40 are a couple of sleek looking cards intended for professional and workstation or enterprise use with no latent sounding or automotive sounding sub-brands attached to them at all. Although they have the same GA102 GPU as the RTX3080, and 3090, these pro-level cards come with a whopping 48 gigabytes of VRM. - [Producer] Oh my. - Interestingly the A40 variant is going to be passively cooled so it can be used in high density environments like data centers. Images show, lots of metal fins coming off of the card itself, though it's not clear exactly what prompted NVIDIA 2X the Quadro and Tesla names or if they're gonna replace them with something else. My suggestion is Oucho. It sounds twice as good. - [Producer] Math, - Aiii. - [Producer] Math Joke. - Apple's involved in another lawsuit this time against a Canadian contractor for selling I stuffs without permission. Apparently the contractor in question Jeep was supposed to gip. I don't know how you pronounce that. It doesn't matter. The contract, they were supposed to take apart and recycle Apple watches, iPads, and iPhones, but instead over 100,000 of these devices were resold. While the contractor does not deny that the gadgets were improperly sold, it claims that a handful of employees stole the equipment for personal gain and that their actions were not approved by the company. - [Producer] It wasn't me. - Totally, Apple says that it's concerned about old unsafe products ending up in the hands of consumers, which can be a safety hazard. Although undoubtedly, there are also monetary considerations as Apple wants over 23 million US dollars in damages which as I think about 100 trillion Canadian shillings or something like that. - [Producer] Math. - Facebook is no stranger to heavy government scrutiny, but a new leak has shown that the company is at least a little concerned about a potential doomsday scenario which for them means letting go of any of the personal data that they've spent years sucking into their servers. According to the wall street journal, an internal Facebook document contains a plan for how the social media giant would defend itself, if it were ordered to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, which have been huge moneymakers for them. Although it's unclear whether a breakup of Facebook is actually on the table, there have been rumors that the US government could file an antitrust suit against Facebook before the end of the year, and that Facebook's argument which seems to center around prior government approval of its acquisitions, might not hold up very well in court. Maybe we could all pool our pocket money together and buy Instagram. - [Producer] I don't want it. - Personally, I'm waiting for the spinoff so that they can have a Beyblades battle. - [Producer] Stop. - Get it. - [Producer] Stop it. - Now it's time for the Creek beats brought to you by a Private Internet Access VPN which let you mask your IP and encrypt your traffic. PIA offers over 12,000 servers in dozens of countries and they have no bandwidth caps. PIA is configurable and has a kill switch to keep you in control. When combined with private browsing, PIA can make websites and online services, think you're in a different country and you can connect up to five devices at once. Be they windows, Mac, Android, iOS, or Linux. So try it out at the link below with a 30 day money back guarantee, Creek beats, have you ever tried them? - [Producer] Juicy - They're delicious. AMD Rising continues to gain market share against Intel as last month Steam hardware survey shows that AMD processors are now found in over one quarter of all steam users rigs. This marks over a 3% increase since May, and it'll be interesting to see how this number moves once Zen 3 is released. Getting the Intel AMD balance closer to 50/50. That would be very Zen indeed. (laughs) - That's a good job. - [Producer] I didn't recognize (murmurs) - Good job. - [Producer] Good job. - Yeah good job. The British government has some egg on its face after it under reported pandemic cases by nearly 16,000. Apparently the oversight was due to an issue with Microsoft Excel. The spreadsheet program can only display two to the 20 or 1,048,576 rows. Anything after that, it'll get cut off, hence the missing cases. Yet another example of how productivity software continually finds new ways to frustrate us. Hey, if you're worried that Cyberpunk 2077 might get pushed back again, you can breathe a sigh of release (chuckles) as CD Project Red has announced the game has gone gold meaning that it's mostly bug free, probably we hope. The game is on track to be released on November 19th, so you won't have to wait too much longer to get your Keanu fix without re watching the replacements for the 20th time. - [Producer] Only the 20th, I love that movie. - Spotify Search Function is adding a useful new feature, punching in a song's lyrics will now bring up a list of matching tracks. Apple music has offered the same feature for a couple of years so it's definitely about time Spotify got the same thing. Because I can't keep up with the name of every song the kids are listening to these days - [Producer] So sad. - Just don't punch in anything like the word love because I think it might crash the server. - [Producer] Put it in graphics. One gamer has found a way to put the RTX 3090 24 Gigabytes of VRAM to an interesting use by creating a virtual Ram drive and then installing none other than Crysis 3 onto the graphics cards, memory itself. - [Producer] Why not? - This isn't exactly a practical way to store your games but it looked like a fun experiment and the car did indeed still run crysis. That's it for today. Come back Wednesday for more tech news in glorious 30 frames for second. - [Producer] Why go fast? - Because it's 20% more than cinematic. - [Producer] 144, we'll get there eventually. - Too fast.",

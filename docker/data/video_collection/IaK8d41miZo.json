    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lou here back with another video... And as you can tell, we're in an unusual environment. That's because you're about to watch an unusual video. Today we're gonna find out if the iPhone 6S with it's new and improved and strenghtened display, can hold up the wheigh of this F150. Now it's a little bit lighter than the previous version, in case you dont know, these new models are now built out of aluminum and up to 700 pounds lighter. but... it's still increadibly heavy So let's find out just how strong the 6S is and whether or not it can hold the weight of the F150. Let's do it! Now, this is a gold 6S, factory fresh, completely working... There's the evidence, right there. We're gonna place it face up... Right like this... There we go. Right behind the tire. I think the iPhone might survive and then what? And then what?... You ready? Tell me when... There's a tire mark HaHa... There's a tire mark... YEEEES !!!! HAHAHA... the phone is fine... little bit dirty, let me wave it up real quick Wow! check it out alright... so it held up the weight... no problem-o. Should we do it one more time to be sure... What do you think ? Alright... Right here Once again no problem. So apparently this glass is pretty tough So there you have it! iPhone 6S vs Ford F150 and at least for this round the iPhone looks alright I'm pretty impressed the glass held up the tire. This is not a light vehicle. I mean... is light as far as pickup trucks are concerned, but it's still a pickup truck. So, thank God the iPhone is safe and fine and happy! And as you know, I've got a lot of these, so i'm still coming up with ideas for what to do with all of them. Leave suggestions down in the comments... Thanks very much for watching, leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed this content. Of course this video was ridiculous! That's the point! That's why you've clicked on it. I'll catch you guys on the next episode... ... Later!",

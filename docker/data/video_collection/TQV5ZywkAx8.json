    "transcript": "- I'm ready. Ah, where's the Jerry rig everything knife, has that arrived yet? Zach, where's my knife? Inside this horrible box is the AYANEO Next, the successor to the AYANEO Pro 2021 that I so positively reviewed very recently online as tech tips. The big, biggest difference between the AYANEO Next and the AYANEO 2021 Pro, is well actually pretty much everything. The processor is different. We're moving to a Ryzen 5000 series mobile CPU, although we're still equipped with LPDDR4x, unlike the Steam Deck and the top spec goes from one terabyte of solid state storage to two terabytes, but it gets even more interesting than that. They have completely redesigned the ergonomics of the device to be more in line with their new vision for their products, which is, whoa, to be less dependent on, here we go, like Windows, you know, Windows escape, task manager buttons, things like that and more dependent on their own AYA space, I guess I would call it kind of like a launcher, slash game organizer slash system configuration utility. Please put on gloves to open the next, oh, well, okay. Hopefully they sent a small, actually this does look like, these look like very small gloves. They sent me unit seven. Apparently they don't know me very well. 69 would've been the correct answer AYA. Ooh, well, this is a significant departure from their previous devices. Much bigger joysticks. Much tighter ABXY, oh. This makes the 2021 Pro feel downright loose by comparison. Ergonomics are definitely better but they've still managed to maintain that AYA slimness. So you can see it's quite a bit thinner than this is the 1X player mini and actually, we've actually got the Steam Deck here as well. So it's quite a bit thinner and narrower than the Steam Deck. Of course compared to the NEO 2021 Pro, you do give up some of the pocket ability. That's one of the things I actually really like about it. Oh, that's really nice. It has USBPD for the actual AYANEO and then it's also got an additional five volt outlet, 65 Watts total, USB-C to type A adapters. I guess now's as good a time as they need to go over the IO. So on like the original NEO, which had three USB-C ports, we get only two, but that's still twice as many as the Steam Deck. So we've got one on the bottom and one on the top, and don't underestimate the importance of this feature. You know what, David, I actually find myself depending whether I'm sitting in a chair or whether I'm lying in bed using it, actually preferring the top or the bottom, depending on the situation. - Yeah. - So as a top and bottom kind of person, I really like having the option. - [David] It's called a Switch. - three and a half millimeter jack on the top. How did they not bring a Switch to set for this, volume up and down, power button with fingerprint reader. How do these analog triggers feel? Not bad, little bit of resistance. I think the top shoulders could be a little tighter. You can see they've moved away from the mobile style joysticks to full size joysticks, just like you'd have on a regular like console controller, just like on the Steam Deck and this is an either love it or hate it move. They both have their pros and cons. The advantage is obviously finer control and the disadvantage is that it increases the profile of the device a fair bit. Also on the front, we've got our, whatever these buttons are called for the Xbox. I call them start and select because I'm old. Your ABXY, and then, ah these, okay, so we're gonna have to figure out what these do once we get it fired up here. This video is brought to you by Secret Lab. Secret Lab makes gaming chairs that are engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work or play. Their Titan Evo 2022 chair has four way lumbar support, an ultra comfortable lineup of different materials and more and all their chairs come with up to a five year extended warranty and 49 day return policy. So head to the link in the video description and check out Secret Lab today. I love these portable gaming PCs. They've gotten powerful enough now that you can play like legit high end games on them and this one promises to be really exciting. So it can be equipped with either the 5800 or the 5825U Ryzen 5000 series processor which still has Vega based graphics, though, as we saw in the 2021 Pro, clocked high enough, it can be pretty competitive with the RDNA 2 graphics in the Steam Deck and unlike the Steam Deck, it's got Zen 3 course. That's right, CPU performance on this thing is going to be bananas. Zen three, come on. - Get yours now. - Unlike the Steam Deck, there's no special anti glare coating on the screen but it is also an IPS type panel and 1280x800 resolution. Okay, I'm not gonna be swiping my finger. I think I will just touch the touch sensor. Now swipe with the sides of your finger. Got it. Oh, that's really cool. They have the same quick desktop switching button as I really liked on the 1X player. I gotta tell you now that I'm more used to it, navigating Windows with the controllers like actually kind of sick. Like obviously there's some things that don't work particularly well, but it's not bad. It's not bad. Fans definitely going. What's the weight compared to the Pro pretty similar. That's one of the things that's kind of dragging me down about these is they're really heavy compared to something like an Nintendo Switch and it's like noticeable, you know, like if I'm lying on my side, I gotta be like this. You know, I gotta have a hand down. I gotta turn the auto rotate off. Auto rotate when you're playing like an emulator game or something like that's a really bad time. Apparently there are some known issues with these first units and the production ones will not have the same ones, extra back light bleed. The joystick might be a little off 'cause they're like hand sawed or something. Yeah, one of the big issues with the old one is that these corners right here, this doesn't seem like a problem. But when you've had that in your hand for like 20 minutes, half an hour, an hour, two hours, starts to kind of wear it out. This feels a lot better. I have no idea what I'm agreeing to right now. Oh, shoot, it changed the language to Chinese again. Oh crap. Andy. - [David] We need your help with some Chinese stuff. - Help me, wait no, it's English, it's English, I'm good. - [David] Bye. - Okay, bye. All right, so it collects your games. It supports the Microsoft games and Steam games right now, they're working on adding other launchers and then the assistant is pretty cool. So you can correct your joysticks. You can, what is swick? Oh, okay, that's kind of cute. So that's the replacement for the keyboard task manager, buttons and stuff here. Just like the 2021 Pro they have really nice haptic motors, custom key, current task, yeah, task manager and we can adjust TDP, but we don't wanna adjust the TDP in here. We want to, boo whoops, there we go. We wanna do that from in here. So you can adjust your power profile or fan profile whatever this is, as well as the TDP of your processor. Now I don't know which version they sent to me. So I'm gonna have to check that real quick. But the first thing I want to do is change my display scaling, 100% please. Okay, this is one really annoying navigation issue, when Windows isn't sure whether you're using a mouse or a keyboard, that's something I would like to see AYA address. Here, I right click this, all of a sudden, see the joystick is controlling both the mouse and the selector here. So it gets a little confused. Right, I remember what I was doing. I wanted to know what spec they sent. There's three different specs of this machine. One with up to 32 gigs of LPDDR4x memory. They did not send me that one. Nope, I get the 16 gigs of 4266 and I get, so this is the base model, with the Ryzen 7 5800U, the main difference between the 5800 and the 5825 is that the CPU is clocked a touch higher. Do maternal. It's a classic. By the time this video comes out, I won't have been able to give any impressions on the Steam Deck, but I will say that I hope the speakers on the NEO Next are really very excellent. I can say that the back light bleed is better than the previous generation NEO already, so that's really nice to see. This thing's insane, David. I did, I mean, I don't know what exactly I was expecting but confirmed, Zen 3, a lot faster than Zen 2. I'm getting anywhere from like, I'm not dropping below 60 FPS and I'm on medium. Whoops, I mean that doesn't make me any good at aiming. Unfortunately, desktop computers have gotten to the point where, you know, for most people, for most games, they're fast enough. I mean current GPU shortages aside, but here, every 10%, every 20% performance uplift we get, well 20% on the desktop could be the difference between 200 and 240 FPSs. Both of them are pretty darn smooth. Here, 20% is the difference between 50 FPS and 60 FPS. It's a really, really different gap. So that's what I think I'm experiencing right now. Is that sort of that generational improvement in smoothness. I'm just gonna have to switch to this thing. The fan noise, even in, I think we're in wild mode, yeah, game wild. That is wild. The fan noise is totally reasonable. Oh, that's way, way better than the 2021 Pro. Okay, so now in these more intense scenes, we're seeing dips down to like 45 FPS. Still, that is markedly better than on the previous one and what's cool about this is that I haven't even turned it down to low yet. I'm gaming in medium. fricking do maternal. Sure, yeah, potato can run it, but like a handheld potato. Definitely feeling the stutters a little bit more now. Seriously, still very playable though. Even with my total lack of skill. What, what, what, what, oh, please stop. Man, they told me I was gonna really like this one compared to the Retro Power and I was like something that looks this good, you expect me to stop using it. I'm real tempted. I do like the plastics of the Retro Power better. They've got a bit of a nicer kind of soft touch finish on the back. But honestly, this silver part on the front feels kind of cheap to me, compared to just using the same material like they did on their older ones. But the ergonomics, man, they're a lot better. Holy crap, we're running on medium. Don't expect to go for longer than maybe a couple hours, if you're lucky running like this, but that is 30 FPS solid, Witcher 3 running at medium details. After those couple of early hitches, it's like running well too. Unlike the Steam Deck, it's got a full 22 AD Size M. 2 slot. So. - Perfect. - There's new higher density chips coming, as those roll out, we could see 16 terabyte like gum stick SSDs. - [David] That's crazy. - What a time to be alive. Like when I was a kid, we had the Gameboy, you know, look at this. My kids are like, can I play on the NEO? Do you know how many double A batteries I bought. Ladies and gentlemen. F1 2021 medium details. Okay, I mean, yeah, it's only 1280 by 800, but at this size, it looks great. You know, the bigger joysticks are worth it. They're worth the extra bulk. These are really smooth too, I'm liking them. I like the triggers too. The angle on the triggers could be a little bit better in my opinion. I wish they were kind of, instead of being so flat like this, I wish they were kind of like this to start. This thing is freaking awesome. The only disadvantage is the price, that is where Valve is changing the game. The Steam Deck costs somewhere in the neighborhood of a third to half, depending on how it's configured, but whoa, is this ever cool? I don't know about good option. Maybe check out the unboxing of the Steam Deck. We just did that the other day, we can't show performance yet but that's coming very soon as well.",

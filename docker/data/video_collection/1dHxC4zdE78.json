    "transcript": "- Today we're checking out the Shokz OpenFit headphones, and this is an all brand-new design, and I cannot wait to show it to you. A huge thank you to Shokz for partnering with me on this video. So you might be wondering why is this box so massive for a small pair of headphones? Well, this is actually a PR box inside. I'm not sure what's in here. So let's open it up. (upbeat music) (Justine gasps) Okay, this is a huge cut down version of one of the headphones. Look at this. What? Okay, this is like the whole, this is the size of my face. (Justine laughs) Look at that. And here they are. Oh, we've got a nice little note. \"12 years ago, Shokz entered the headphones space with a mission of making people's lives better with innovative technology.\" Look at this. So the unique thing about this is these are not in-ear headphones. They sit like above your ear, kind of like over top of it, but not inside of it. Wow. Okay, I'm hyped to try these out. Let's take a look at this breakdown. This is like a little art project, so it's got these little slides right here on the top. This is so unique. I've never seen an unboxing like this. This is a breakdown of all of the things that make up the OpenFit Shokz headphones. Look at this. This is really cool. I'm obsessed with this. (Justine laughs) I feel like this is an art piece, and this is gonna be prominently displayed in my office from here on out. Now I also have the beige version, and this is the consumer packaging. So I'm so excited to open these up. If you guys are interested in getting more information, you can check out Shokz.com for a 45-day risk-free trial. That's free shipping and free returns in the US and Canada. Look at this. Oh yeah, the beige look awesome. Oh, they're so soft. They feel like a little pet. Also got a USB-C cable. And you know what these don't come with? Extra ear tips, because there aren't any. So you just hook it around your ear, and then like it goes in your ear, but like not in your ear. It just kind of sits on top of it. Oh my God, my audiobook already started playing. All right, let me listen to some music. (Justine gasps) It doesn't feel like it's in my ears. It feels like it's like, it feels like it's happening inside of my head. (Justine laughs) It's so wild. I don't even know what to say, because it's such a shocking experience, because I don't feel like anything's in my, I don't feel them. It's just like the music is coming out of nowhere. It's just like, where are you coming from? I don't know, 'cause I don't feel it. I'm so confused. My brain cannot comprehend what's happening right now. (upbeat music) These OpenFit Shokz headphones are an open-ear concept in a compact earbud design. Now having these built around your ear leaves the inside of your ear open to keep you engaged with the world. They are made of a dual layer of liquid silicone that gives you a really soft, comfortable fit that basically molds itself to all ear shapes. These are also super light, weighing just 8.3 grams. These are so great for running, because when I'm running, normally I have noise canceling headphones on, and it blocks out all of the sound. So being able to run with these and actually hear car horns, people, it's so much safer, and they're so extremely comfortable, like they're not gonna fall out, because they're clipped onto my ears. These are my new running headphones for sure. The audio is also surprisingly powerful with direct Pitch technology made for OpenFit. It allows for a premium audio quality that perfectly balances bold highs, clear mids, and bass. It uses a proprietary low frequency enhancement algorithm to carry low frequency vibrations directly towards your ear without covering it. Dynamic range control dynamically adjusts the EQ in real time, providing a rich and natural listening experience under any volume. You'll get up to 28 hours of listening, seven hours on a single full charge, and the case will extend it all the way up to 28 hours. All of the controls are on the bud's built-in touch pad that can be customized through the Shokz app. These are IP54 water resistant with a double layer waterproof steel mesh and gauze for additional protection. These are super easy and fast to connect. Just open and connect using Bluetooth 5.2. Now, what's cool about these is because they do have that OpenFit design, it won't take you out of your element. So I'm here in my living room, I might have a knock at the door, or I have some food delivered. I'll actually be able to hear it, and if there's people here hanging out, I won't feel like I'm shutting them out. Now these have an interesting design, because there's no buttons or anything on them. So to get them to pair into Bluetooth mode, you'll just gently press down on the tops of the headphones for a few seconds, and then you go into the Bluetooth settings of your desired device, and then you click these, and you'll be instantly paired. These are so comfortable, and I think that's what's so great about these is I don't feel like something is inside of my ear, and don't have that kind of nagging feeling of just, oops, I just ran off the road. Let me pause my game. (Justine laughs) These have such a unique feel, because a lot of headphones go inside of your ears. They have different ear tips. They kind of just may irritate your ears after wearing them for hours. These I feel like you could wear all day, because it kind of feels like if I was wearing sunglasses. It's just like a slight little pressure right above your ear. It's really hard to explain, but it's so wild, because the sound is so good. It's like it's coming from inside of my brain, if that makes any sense. The other thing that I kind of wanna test is a nap test. Let me lay down. (gentle lullaby music) Let's see what this is like if I lay down. (Justine gasps) Oh, this makes me so happy, because anytime you have in your headphones, especially on a plane, they get jammed inside of your ear hole. Oh, this is so great. You can catch me taking a siesta on that next flight. Did you connect them yet? Isn't it cool? - [Director] It's weird. - I know. - [Director] I was like, oh shoot, the sound's coming from my phone. - Right? - [Director] And I was like, oh shoot, she's filming. And then I was like, wait. - It's in your head. It's so unreal. It's, guys, I just, I wish that I could, am I explaining it okay? I don't even know. It's just such a surreal experience. Thank you guys so much for watching. I look forward to seeing what you guys think of these. Again, they are available in the black and beige. If you wanna get more information, I'll put a link in the description, and if you haven't already, please like and comment, and be sure to subscribe, and hit the bell to be notified when I post new videos. I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye.",

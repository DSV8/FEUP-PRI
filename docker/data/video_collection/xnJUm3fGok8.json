    "transcript": "- Hi, everybody. I'm so glad you decided to join us today. The brains of our new pixel lineup is Google tensor, a mobile system on a chip that we designed specifically around our ambient computing vision and Google's work in AI with tensor, We're connecting Google's AI breakthroughs directly to pixel. So we can push the limits of helpfulness in a smartphone. And this vision comes to life right here in the new pixel six, you can see right away a major evolution in the phone's design language with a distinct new color palette. The new pixel camera bar houses, a completely redesigned camera system with upgraded sensors, lenses and computational photography. You can see the always on display and the expressive adaptive, new Android 12 UI, which we call material you. Pixel six is designed with powerful new security and privacy features, to safeguard your information. And we've made big improvements to boost every aspect of performance from the all-day adaptive battery with fast charging speeds to 5G connectivity for even faster downloading and streaming. Pixel six is available today, starting at $599. And now we're going to talk about a first for us, our first flagship phone for people who want our most advanced technology. The new pixel six pro has everything pixel six has, including our tensor chip and a lot more too. It has a pro triple rear camera system, packed into the camera bar with a new telephoto lens. And on the front, you have an ultra wide front camera that shoots 4K video. It's got a bigger and better 6.7 inch dynamic display that goes up to 120 Hertz for smooth scrolling and fluid animation. While going down to 10 Hertz to save power. Pro includes 12 gigabytes of Ram for speedy performance and seamless app switching and multitasking. It's our fastest and smartest pixel yet, pro has the biggest battery we've ever put in a pixel. And it has a fresh high-end design with sophisticated colors and refined finishes. Pixel six pro is available today, starting at $899. It sets a new bar for performance and helpfulness. You can expect from a pixel phone. - Both phones use bigger, better VR camera sensors and laser auto focus sensor, which helps make your low light photos sharper and pixel six pro has a telephoto camera with folded optics for impressive photos in a small of a form factor as possible. Pixel six has a textured black metal band combined with expressive, but versatile colors that looked like nothing else in the smartphone world. And for the pixel six pro we were inspired by high quality finishes used in jewelry and watches. It's our most refined phone made with polished unit body metal transitioning fluidly into the gorgeous 3D class. The phone feels refined and unique in hand with unexpected color combinations. Pixel six uses a 6.4 inch 90 Hertz display and pixel six pro has a big and beautiful 6.7 inch high resolution waterfall display. Both phones are water and dust resistant with Corning gorilla glass Victus displays. Underneath the display the new pixel have a fastest secure fingerprint sensor for easy unlocking. - Material you is a first of its kind UI breakthrough. First starters, your entire phone UI updates to reflect whatever image you choose as your wallpaper. This system does the rest determining which colors are dominant, which are complimentary and which just plain look good. It then applies different shades to different parts of the interface. The redesigned quick settings provide easy access to more useful controls. It contextually surfaces information you need, right when you need it, like having access to your flight details in your boarding pass right on the lock screen. Tighten them to tens for security core and our new open source trusted execution environment. Give pixel the most layers of hardware security in any phone. And thanks to tensor. We're now able to extend our support window for the first time. So every pixel six user gets at least five years of security updates. This is the new security hub. It's got simple steps you can take to better protect your data. You'll now see indicators right on the screen. When an app is accessing your mic and camera feed and they're toggle, So you can quickly turn the camera and mic on and off across every app and use case. The new privacy dashboard helps you make informed decisions about which apps get your permissions to access personal information. - The tensor chip is specifically designed to offer Google's latest advances in AI directly on a mobile device. - Every aspect of tensor was designed and optimized to run Google's ML models. Starting with the integrated ML engine, the TPU, it was custom made by Google research for Google research, for the image signal processor or ISP. We brought key algorithms directly into the Silicon for power efficiency. Even our choices for CPU and GPU were designed to compliment our ML to deliver advanced computational photography. The CPU cluster is a two plus two plus four configuration. It includes two big arm X one course. The 20 core GPU also delivers a premium gaming experience for the most popular Android games. There's a context hub, that brings machine learning to the ultra low power domain. It enables ambient experiences like now playing and always on display to run all the time without draining your battery. - Let's start with the camera, both pixel six and six pro have a massive new one over 1.3 inch 50 megapixels sensor. We combine adjacent pixels on the sensor to get extra large 2.4 micron pixels. Both phones also have completely new ultra wide cameras with larger sensors than before. So photos look great when you want to fit more in your shot. Pixel six pro has a larger ultra wide front camera that records 4K video. It also has a telephoto lens with four X optical zoom for getting in close, to get that much magnification, the pixel camera uses what's called folded optics. A flawless pros bends the light 90 degrees so that the camera can fit in the body of the phone. And you can get up to 20 X zoom with an improved version of pixel super res zoom. The sensor behind the telephoto lens is even larger than the primary rear sensor in past pixel phones. So you can capture great low light zoom shots with night sight. Pixel six can now run HDR and 4K video at 60 frames per second. That's 498 million pixels each second. Have you ever had a perfect photo ruined by something random in the background? Pixel's new magic eraser can do the job. In Google photos, you'll see suggestions for distractions you might want to remove from your photo. Erase them all at once, or capture remove them one by one. Even if something is not suggested, you can still erase that distraction, just circle them and they disappear. Here's a problem everyone has seen before. Normally this great moment would be a blurry throwaway photo in all it takes four machine learning models, combining data from two cameras to deliver the scene you know, you saw, but couldn't get from your camera until now with face on blur. Pixel six introduces motion mode, which brings a professional look to your nature scenes, urban photos, or even a night out. Typically you'd create these effects with panning and long exposures. With motion mode, just wait in the subway platform for the right moment, snap a photo of your friend, and you have a vibrant artistic photo to remember this moment. - Today. People use the Snapchat camera for so much more. We're excited to announce today that we are partnering with Google on a pixel six feature called quick tap to snap. This pixel first feature puts the snap camera directly into the lock screen for fast and easy access to the Snapchat camera. Just tap the back of your phone twice and you're into the camera. And we're also working with Google on exclusive augmented reality lenses and bringing other key pixel features like live translation directly into the chat feature on Snapchat. Snap chatter's can talk to their friends in more than 10 languages and conversations will be translated in real time. These are the first features coming to Snapchat on pixel six. - Going back decades, camera's have centered light skin, a bias that's crept into many of our modern digital imaging products and algorithms, especially because they're not being tested with diverse enough groups of people. This year one of the advances in pixel six and Google photos that we're most excited about is real tone. We started by working with image experts like photographers, cinematographers, and colorists. We asked them to test our cameras in a wide range of tough lighting conditions. And in the process, they took thousands of portraits that made our image datasets 25 times more diverse to look more like the world around us. First to make a great portrait, your phone has to see a face in the picture and our experts helped us improve our face detection models, so the camera sees you as you are. From there, we improved our auto white balance tuning to better reflect the beauty of your skin tone. And we improved our auto exposure tuning to make sure your skin looks like you, not unnaturally darker or brighter. They also inspired our teams to make advances like algorithmically reducing stray light that can make darker skin tones look ashy or washed out and making night sight portraits, less blurry for folks like me. - Thanks to some outstanding work from our speech team. Pixel six has an on-device speech recognition model that can transcribe speech with incredible accuracy. And thanks to tensor, it does it using half as much power as previously possible. Pixel even automatically adds the right punctuation. So I don't need to specify where to put commas and question marks. The language model also helps with transcription suggestions. So corrections make sense based on what you're saying and to make voice typing as fast as possible. I should be able to do more with my voice, including commands like clear or send. Pixel is smart enough to understand that I don't want those words in my message. I'm sure it's going to be great clear. I'm looking forward to it. The model also unlocks the accuracy of emoji transcriptions, which is so much faster than searching through little pages of icon. I think we're making homemade pasta emoji and ice cream emoji send. With the new speech model typing with your voice is faster and easier than just typing with your fingers. Thanks to tensor and these new breakthroughs, we can do all this on-device without connecting to a server. So it's super fast and reliable. We really think it's going to change how you use your phone. Google's natural language understanding allows us to rethink phone calls to. Now, before you even place your call, Pixel shows you the current and projected wait times. So you can call when it works for you. And when you do call and encounter that endless list of options, like press one for branch hours and locations. You actually don't need to listen carefully, and remember all the automated menu options. Google assistant listens for the details and shows them onscreen for you to tap. Of course, if you still find yourself in the hold queue, don't worry, Google assistant will hang out on the line and listen to the whole music for you. And lets you know, when a real live human is ready to talk. We all have friends or family members whose native language isn't the same as ours. Now I can reply in English and it will show up in Japanese for her. It all happens right on the device in the messages app. So you don't have to deal with cutting and pasting text into Google translate. - So that's pixel six and pixel six pro they're available for pre-order today, starting at $599 and $899 for the pro. Thanks so much for watching today. We'll see you again very soon.",

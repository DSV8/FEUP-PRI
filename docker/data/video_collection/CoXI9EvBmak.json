    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   Ubiquiti AmpliFi WiFi -   This mesh WiFi system aims to blanket WiFi signal across large spaces up to 20,000 square feet. This tech works by adding mesh points throughout the space ensuring solid, unobstructed connectivity. I've tested many WiFI systems here in the Unbox Therapy studio and nothing has come close to this in terms of speed with my current connection.   From the manufacturer -  AmpliFi is more than a common home router: its the ultimate Wi-Fi system. With turbocharged 802.11AC Wi-Fi, AmpliFi utilizes multiple self-configuring radios and advanced antenna technology to bring ubiquitous Wi-Fi coverage to any home.

    "transcript": "Wi-Fi you love it you need it you're probably using it to watch this video right here that said there are a lot of sort of sub-par Wi-Fi scenarios out there that exists in houses Wi-Fi is always competing with obstructions and walls now up until this point I've been using off-the-shelf consumer-level networking equipment ok but I've had my eye on some of the more enterprise type stuff because i am a Wi-Fi enthusiast when the company ubiquity reached out to me found out that I'm actually moving studio spaces in the one that's much bigger they said Lou let us sponsor a video let us send you our hot new networking equipment this is called amplify HD and this baby claims to have solid coverage over 20,000 square feet and I said you know what let's do it you've got the router itself with a touchscreen I mean even got the speed test on the box they know who they're speaking to and then you've got these two mesh units now these are going to place in various locations and these three units will then speak together. Here is a diagram of just what I'm talking about you see the router unit is in the center of the house here and those mesh points are on the fringes creating a blanket like a warm blanket on a cold day. So hot right now is still wire into this guy you can set it up I like this part via bluetooth and an iOS device or an android device. So... Wooo-hooo!! Look at that unboxing experience Wow factory-fresh power USB number of ethernet connection points these here are the mesh points login at all so it's got the the powerbuilt straight into it that's foolproof Jack could set this up ~ahh Jack has a hard time tiny shoes I usually recommend Velcros Oh ma- it's a- BWAA! that's a magnet, HAH! so cable to go from your modem to the router is also a power brick here so the first thing you're going to notice when you plug this in is this display lights up and the next step is to launch the application it finds the router so we are now connected little glowing light along the bottom alright so now i have the router plugged into the modem and I've got the mesh points distributed as well so it is time of course for the critical testing let's let the testing through the talking you can see the reception of each of the mesh points now there is a built-in performance tests as well you can see here now this is going to vary based on your location but that's the whole point of these mesh points whoo-hoo-hoo 150 . 2 megabits per second I saw peek at their you can see their averaged out to 113 by 20 with a 19 millisecond ping now if I go out to speed test here 120 megabit per second on the down now on the old network again just a standard high-end router in one spot and that's it I mean I don't even need to say that I mean results the results speak for themselves right you're paying for a bigger pipe so you might as well invest into networking equipment that supports it this is really something that I wish existed a long time ago every so often that the company reaches out to me and says hey please check out our new thing and then every so often there's something you really wish that existed when you were a kid alright so you've got to check these guys out that's the bottom line better Wi-Fi the proof is in the pudding I don't need to say it because you saw",

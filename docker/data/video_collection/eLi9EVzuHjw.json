    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is. Matt, it's time to go back to basics. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Have you ever been shopping on Amazon and you go to pick out the product you want, and you notice that right at the bottom of the page they say, \"Hey, can I offer you in this AmazonBasics equivalent instead? - The horror! - Well, I don't know about horror because there's a lot of products that it makes total sense to do that: batteries, dish towels, anything that is not electronic. - Batteries and dish towels are your two options? - Those are the ones I get personally, so... - Actually, do you actually legitimately use AmazonBasics products? - Yeah, I mean, like the batteries worked just fine. Something like my mouse pad is AmazonBasics. It works great, and it's a good way to save money, but then you see things like computer speakers or mice and keyboards. - I don't know. - Is that really worth it what you're saving? - So for this, we went to Amazon and tried to buy three Logitech peripherals and then immediately purchased the AmazonBasics equivalents, as well. - So first one we got is the MX Master three. - Literally what most people consider to be one of the best mice that you can buy. - Yeah, this is the gold standard in mice, and then what they suggested was, and I love the naming on all of these. - Oh, no. - So instead of a nice, sexy name like the MX Master three, we instead have the Compact Ergonomic Wireless Mouse with fast scrolling. - Ew! - Yes, but, we also got it in silver to match our MX Master. - All right, let's do it. - You notice that these are actually empty because I already unboxed them. All right, so we got the MX Master three, I mean, this thing is gorgeous. - The MX series has been, they basically had some of the best mice for a very long time. - I mean, I've been using the two for a while. Literally the only thing I thought they had to improve on was that it was micro USB instead of USB-C. - Which is now USB-C. - Correct. - This guy will work over USB as well as Bluetooth. You have three different options, of you moving between different computers, you can literally go from one to three. - Yap, we got our little unifier here. - Or dongle. - Dongle. - The beginning of DongleTown. - There we go, we'll get a dongle in the shot there. Little guy, there. - Listen to that, though. (mouse click) - It's such a satisfying click. - My favorite part about the Logitech series is the scroll wheel. - Yeah, wait play it for me. Let everyone experience it. (mouse wheel buzzing) Should bring in the Amazon option now? - Yeah, so the Amazon looks exactly the same as the Logitech. - Well, okay. It inspired me maybe that's not quite the same, I mean, okay, so I do know that there is a couple of other Logitech sort of, what do they call them the ergonomics series or whatever. like they're a couple of others that look a little bit more like this and that they're a little bit sort of shorter. - You seem to think that I was serious that I couldn't tell the difference between these two! - Oh, I'm sorry about that. I am kind of not happy, although to be fair, this is the compact version, but I'm not really happy with the way that my hand sits here. This definitely just feels a little bit more comfortable. Feels significantly better. - Yeah. Sure it's not a one to one as far as like, we can think that there's a product that is a better comparison. But the whole point of this is that this is what Amazon said, \"This is what we think \"you should get when you're ordering this.\" - How much were these mice? - So this one is $100. It's MX Master three is $100. - MX Master three. - So, the Amazon basic one is $16. - Oh, wow okay, that is a huge difference - That is a major difference. Yeah and I mean, like this one, there's no, argument. This one is just feels better. It's actually twice, maybe three times the weight of this. - That one feels very cheap, very hollow hear that! (mouse clicking) But how much travel there are with these buttons. They feel really not good. There is a back and forward button. But beyond that, there's not a lot of other stuff here. So instead of the infinite scroll, you hit this little button on the bottom, and that will turn on and off your, what they call it? the fast scroll! So I want a fast scroll. Yeah, this is bad for a $15 mouse. - All right, and that's and that's something with a mouse is like, we talked about this with audio and stuff like that. It's not going to be like leaps and bounds. I mean, this is working just fine. - Well, that's up again lets go. Not only do I not even need to install the logic software, although I know you should, because there are a lot of extra features, But even without it immediately is working, it's detecting so we have a little thumb button, we have a couple of little buttons here, which can function as back and forward. You also have your click. It's not like a mouse with tones and tones of buttons, not like an animal mouse or something. We still have a lot of functionality. - I mean, for like graphic design and productivity. This is really good. And so-- - I size though. What do you call it? The side scroll! - The side scroll yeah, which is great, so like, that's one of the things I always miss with, I mean, I used to love using the apple Magic Mouse, just the gesture scrolling. But this one you get that you can still do the side scrolling. If you're like us, you're using them out like literally a mouse for like graphic design, or content creation all day. You want to go with this one. For your home office that you're just checking emails with save the money. Get the Amazon basic one. It does just like it does everything you needed to do. It's not gonna blow you out of the water, but for 16 bucks how can you go wrong? - It's a lot better than I would say like, The average mouse that comes with your computer. - Yes. - Okay. - All right next we have the Logitech K780 keyboard. - Okay. - So this is - What is this? - This is actually a keyboard I use at home. - No, no, what's this like wedge thing on the top? - So this is meant to work with like a tablet or phone. You put your you put your iPhone there, you put your iPad there. So it's three devices, it's great. - I'm curious, my initial instinct is definitely to question why the keys are round. - Yeah, that was a little weird getting used to. when we go to do it. What's recommended is this AmazonBasics keyboard, which again, just has a name like AmazonBasics, ergonomic keyboard. - How much was this because this feels very cheap? - So this one was $28 and it does come with-- - Oh, baby mouse, - Baby mouse. - Okay, hold on let me see the baby mouse. it's wireless too? - Yes with a Unifier. - It's so tiny. Okay, wait, what the, that's.. - Yeah. - That isn't a click. - That's the worst feeling mouse that I've ever felt. - Right, so. - To be fair, we're not here to judge the mouse and now that's broken. We'll never get to judge it. - This is a very quiet keyboard. It is a low quality membrane keyboard though well it to me like it's very squishy. It's fine for a very basic keyboard but... How much is the the price of a stroke? So this is 28 with the mouse right? - So this is is $56. - So the main idea with the Logitech is that it is a Mac keyboard right? - It's both Mac or PC, but it can connect to three devices at a time. - Which is nice. - Which (mumbles) - Have like a home key and everything? - Yes, the AmazonBasics doesn't do that. So this is a great all in one keyboard for if you have a lot of devices. - I would say that I actually don't mind this. It does feel like a little bit meant for more like an iPad than anything else. But if you have one keyboard, you have a couple of devices on your desk. The keys themselves definitely feel better than the Amazon. Not super impressive, but especially if you have a mobile device, I will actually go with that one. - My favorite part about is how heavy it is. - It is heavy. - That it doesn't shift around on your desk and everything. But I'm like I don't like mechanical keyboard. These keys feel great to me. To me, that's mechanical. - [Funny voice] 12 seconds later. - This is not a Logitech keyboard this is a reject keyboard. - Is a mechanical keyboard. You just talked (beep) about mechanical keyboard? - I'm not saying this one. (beep) I recommend do not buying this. - Yeah, I would definitely not recommend listening to Amazon on this one. I gotta say Matt, not looking too hot listening to Amazon right now. - Speaking of listening, we have the Logitech, Mickey Mouse ears, these worth $87. - So actually fairly expensive speakers. - Yes, I gotta say they look really cool. - Yeah, I like the little like, I don't know like, is that just like an inlet on the side here? It looks nice. Do they sound quality, those are real question. - The downside to them is that they actually do not have a USB. - So these are 24-watt speakers. - Yes. - Okay. - Not bad for desktop stuff, but not amazing. Like, I mean, these aren't like reference speakers. You're not gonna, mix all your these. - I mean, there's just some nice sounding speakers. We power for these though, right? - Yes and it's already plugged in. - Oh, look at that. So these do have Bluetooth as well. - Yes, but we're going to use aux because I didn't realize they had Bluetooth. - While these are facing the audience, they need to be facing us. - Yeah I know. - They're not here. Then we got switches. - Okay, just flip it around. - But I mean, I only got so much length. Well, no, that's problem we all have to deal with. (upbeat music) - I mean, so great. - I'm quite happy with these. - These sound awesome. - I would say well above average for desktop speakers. They're not going to blow you away. But for something which is gonna sound nice on your desk, thumbs up. What are the Amazon equivalents? - These are probably actually gonna sound okay but they look pretty, like these looks like a generic Speaker. - I bet you there's 20 other companies selling these speakers just without the AmazonBasics logo on. - So these are USB powered though? - USB power! - That's.. - But I'm wondering can they play like play through USB? - No because it has Aux, I'm gonna assume no - Which is an interesting oversight. Okay, confirmed it does not actually play these through USB, which is a huge bummer. - This is so bright you're right. Why does it need to be, why does it need to be so bright? (classical music) You put in the Logitech Matt (laughs) - I was about to (beep), (laughs) - in my pants with how good these sound. - That sounds really, wait a minute. Why is this one this one (laughs). - Totally mess that up. (classical music) - That's it? (classical music) Dude! - These are max right now. - Hold on. That's max full volume. - So these ones were 14 bucks. - If you wanna buy cheap speakers, buy all means go ahead. But if Amazon is recommending you to get these cheap, crappy, speakers and instead of what are a obviously much more expensive but far superior set of speakers, that I don't like that. - It works for batteries, it does not work for Logitech products. - Thank you very much for watching this episode This Is, make sure to subscribe to the channel and let us know in the comments what AmazonBasics gear should we take a look at next time.",

    "transcript": "I didn't think we were getting one of these. Here it is, guys. The leg. Sorry, no. The leg. I mean, wait. Legion Go. That's right, guys. The biggest, baddest handheld on the block is now in my hands with a gigantic 8.8-inch, 1600p display, the latest AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor, 16 gigs of LPDDR5X memory running at a colossal, 7,500 megatransfers per second, and of course, the big gimmick is, let's see if I can figure out how to get them off. Oh, that doesn't seem like a very good mechanism. TrueStrike controllers, which, like the Nintendo Switch, can be removed from the device so you can pretend it's 15 years ago and you're waggling your Wii. Oh my God. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Scratch that. It's a lot closer to the Switch than the Wii. The point is you can flip out the kickstand, a little something like that, and boom, you've got a portable gaming system that you can use any way you want to, on the desk with the controller, handheld, or even with a keyboard and mouse at this size. There's a lot to love here, but let's back it up for a second and put these controllers back on. Can't say it's my favorite-ist mechanism. A little bit of wobble, but not the kind of thing that I think would bother you day-to-day. Oh, this would bother me day-to-day. Where's my joy-to-mouse? Of course, we're not gonna let ourselves get too distracted by software when we haven't even finished looking at it physically yet. At the top, we've got two stereo speakers, volume adjustment, a USB 4 port, which people have apparently already been hooking up Thunderbolt eGPUs to, a micro SD slot that, ahem, ahem, ahem, apparently doesn't have any overheating issues, looking at you, ally, a three and a half millimeter headphone jack and a super weird power button. We've also got a vent for Lenovo's Legion cold front cooling system, which they claim will turn up the heat on your foes and guarantee smooth, uninterrupted gameplay. Well said. Yeah, your mileage may vary, but while the trigger feels pretty good to me, the shoulder's kind of hard to reach and that's not the only controversial thing about the inputs on this device. The ABXYs feel pretty darn good and I have no complaints about the joysticks, which are Hall-Effect, super cool, but this D-pad, this D-pad has been getting the business online and deserves it. Why does it sit so flush to the controller? I mean, it's not like they had to be worried about the overall thickness. Look how far the analog stick sticks out. Ooh, I like this though. We've got two additional buttons on the back, a la Steam Deck, which is one more than the Ally has on each side. And speaking of the Steam Deck, hey, here's a Steam Deck OLED for a quick size comparison. It's not that much bigger. I mean, it's taller and it's thicker, but the width, actually very similar to the Steam Deck. Oh, I figured it out, guys. That's why we don't need Joy-To-Mouse because of the track pad. Okay. It's usable. Having it is definitely better than not having it at all. I don't know if I can right click. I can't figure out how the devil to get out of Legion space, which we will talk about later. What is this? Okay. This video is brought to you by dbrand. Let's talk about them for a minute. And then I'm gonna rip this skin off and figure out if this track pad just doesn't flipin' work or not. dbrand's tempered glass screen protectors for the Legion Go offer flawless optical clarity, knife resistant, scratch resistance, and each order includes two screen protectors because let's face it, you're probably gonna screw it up on your first try. They have a ton of skins available that are precision cut for the device, including this sick matte black camel one that we've got on here that kind of shifts depending on how the light catches it. Super cool. And they provide installation tutorials online to reduce the chance of you screwing up that as well. It says, say whatever you want about dbrand here or don't, whatever you feel like. They gave me money. Get your skins today at shortlinus.com. Now it's time to rip part of their skin off of this device. I have used their skins on touch pads before. I have never had a problem with it, but you never know. This could be the exception that proves that, oh my God. One of the cool things about dbrand skins is that as long as you actually get under them and don't get between the layers of them, they're super easy to de-apply and they don't leave any residue. Oh no, it did it again. Dang it, it did it without the skin. I think it is kind of a palm rejection thing because once you're on it, you can see it's moving around just fine, but you lift up and just kind of go to, yeah, it kind of struggles. And I've been told that it's hard to right click on it. Oh, seriously? Where's my double tap to right click it? Hard press, long press. Oh, really? You got to hold it for a while. Yeah, it vibrates slightly. Ah, there we go. That is a long delay. Not a big fan, but I am a big fan of having a second USB port on the bottom of the device. This one is also USB 4, and this can be really nice when you're gaming with power plugged in, so it's not kind of pulling on the top of the device. With that said, I do like having the option to plug it in the top if I'm lying in bed and I don't want to mash my power cord. On the, oh wow, this is interesting. On the right-hand side, they've got, look at all the buttons on this mama-jama. Shoulder trigger, the two I mentioned at the back here, a wheel, and two more flipping buttons over here. Do you notice that the buttons aren't the same on both sides? Wait, what? How did I not even notice this? The back buttons are like this and like this. This must have something to do with FPS mode, which all I know about is there's a stabilization disc and it's something to do with the right controller. We're gonna get to that in a bit. First, let's fire up a game. Hello? Click registries, Click registration is not good. They have so many buttons on there and none of them work for mouse. I get it, you want to have a touch pad so that you don't need to have like a janky joy-to-mouse thing and then risk that it doesn't accidentally stay in mouse mode when you're in a game and you want it to be operating in joystick mode or whatever, but your touch pad has got to be better. Hopefully this is something they can fix in software. While we're cutting this in between, do you want to throw the box on the floor? Yeah, I can throw the box on the floor, but not until I talk about the carrying case. Realized I never did the accessories here. That's a carrying case, all right. The stabilization disc. Okay, we are gonna get to this. We're gonna get to this. Also in the box, power adapter. Lenovo claims this thing will go to 70% in just about 30 minutes, which is pretty darn impressive. What do they call it? It's quick charge? No, no, that's Qualcomm, Qualcomm. Rapid charge technology. Super. Oh, sorry, excuse me. Super rapid charge technology. That's a pretty reasonable size for a 65 watt charger. I like, I like. I got it. Are you proud yet, mom? Oh, no. How did I miss that? Oh, that was amazing. Anyway, the point is the screen looks great as advertised, super high resolution, pretty accurate colors overall, and about 99.8% coverage of the sRGB color space. No, it's not gonna have the inky blacks of the Steam Deck OLED, but frankly, neither does anything else except the Switch OLED or anything else with the OLED. The good news is that it'll get to over 500 nits and operates at up to 144 Hertz, meaning that in any games that can run at that sort of frame rate, you're going to be getting an incredibly smooth gaming experience on the go. Of course, Rocket League at 1600p is not one of them, although can I just say the fact that it runs Rocket League at 1600p smoothly at all is pretty darn impressive. Man, if you told me this was gonna happen just, I don't know, a couple years ago, I would tell you no, man, you're crazy. Rocket League will be okay if you turn down the resolution. This is amazing. Like, what are we getting here? This is 50 over frames per second. That's flipping awesome. One thing that's missing though is support for variable refresh rate. So you will neither get the increase in smoothness from using FreeSync, nor will you get any kind of increase in battery life from refreshing the display less often. However, given the 50 watt hour battery that they've baked into this thing, which is more than the ROG Ally, maybe it won't be that big of a concern. Or maybe it will. We managed nearly seven hours in our endurance test, which is running at 800p resolution, 50% brightness, 60 Hertz, playing back a YouTube video, but in our stress test, it managed only an hour and a half. Now, obviously you don't have to run it with all the bells and whistles on all the time, but this gives you some idea of how hard it is to drive such a gigantic high resolution display. Let's launch Legion Space. There's definitely some handy stuff in here. You can adjust your thermal mode. Is this just, whoa, what just happened? Ah, yes, okay. Thermal mode is your power profile for the processor. That's a little bit unintuitive. There's also that weird thing that was hanging around there. Once you get used to it, I'm sure you'll figure out the navigate. Oh, shoot. Navigation in here. Ah, this is important. You can adjust the mode that the display operates in. So 2560 by 1600 is of course the native resolution, but you can run at one quarter of that. So that's half in either dimension in order to make your games run a little bit faster. We tested a variety of games at 800p and 1600p to show you guys that yes, you can run some lighter titles at 1600p, but if you want to take advantage of that 144 Hertz refresh rate, you're probably gonna want to turn it down to 800p, which looks a little bit rougher on a display of this size, but it's still very usable. I don't want this video to just turn into trashing on Legion Space, but like how is there not controller-based navigation in here? Oh my God. Okay, I go to the page for Curse of Monkey Island. Wait, is this, what is this? This is just Steam? What is Games Planet? Anyway, the point is I go back and it just dumps me at the top of this page again. It doesn't remember where I was scrolled to. Wait, am I even allowed out of Games Planet? I already clicked back. It's just flashing. No, unacceptable. This should go back and this should go back. Ridiculous. Wait, what? Do I go here now? No, oh, come on! You know, I get what Lenovo was thinking with this, right? Looking at the landscape out there and going, you know what everyone needs? Another place to organize all their games. Steam, what's that? It's like water, but weaker. How the f*** do I actually get back to this? Is this it? Home, okay, back to home. God, I'm afraid to click on Cloud Game now. It's just the Microsoft website. F**k. What'd you expect? I don't know what I expected. While we wait for this to launch, let's look at all the ways that you can use the kickstand. Well, there's handheld mode, which you guys have already seen plenty of. There's kickstand mode, which I kind of showed you guys before. But then what about if you're playing a two-player game and you make your move and then it's your friend's turn? Whoa. Whoa. Yeah, I mean, wow. You wouldn't have to do this. No, no, no. Boom. Oh, cool. There's an RGB LED in the power button that changes color depending on what profile you're in. I'm in custom right now. And I can quickly change that if I just press this button. And, oh, dang it. Changed my quick settings. Hey, there we go. Ooh, are there lighting effects for the joysticks? Yeah, you should leave those off to conserve battery, but hey, they're there. Oh, hey, speaking of power mode and full fan speed mode, we found that thermals reached very reasonable levels, actually a little bit better than the Ally. And while the fan is pretty loud in full speed mode, in gaming, actually not too bad, even if it does have a bit of a high-pitched tone to it. Yeah, as expected, 800p, not super sharp at this size, but not bad, not bad at all, especially with a little bit of, a little bit of upscaling. To be clear, you'll notice some aliasing from time to time, but it's absolutely very usable. Oh, how are the speakers? Very top-firing. I've heard top-firing speakers that are not bad, actually have a pretty good soundstage. These are not those speakers. I would strongly recommend using Bluetooth speakers or the integrated three and a half millimeter jack. Did I mention the SSD yet? Comes in 512 gigs or one terabyte, Gen 4. I love the big screen, no question. It's big, it's bright, the colors are decent, but it's almost two pounds, guys, of course. You don't have to hold the whole thing. What about FPS mode? Here's the stabilizer. Oh yeah, magnetic, okay, cool. All we gotta do is flip this little switch, FPS mode, and now let me see if I can figure out which way is supposed to be, okay, yeah. Okay, M1, M2, ah, got the trigger, got the bottom trigger. It's hard for me to put into words how unintuitive it is to be holding a controller and using it as a mouse. Did you guys have a lot of success with this? I played a little bit of CS2 with it. The thumbstick does come off the joystick, if you feel it's more comfortable. The thumbstick comes off the joystick, like an Elite controller kind of thing, or? Hold on. Oh yeah, okay, it doesn't seem like that's super. There's a storage in the case for it, so you can like keep it with you, I guess. Sorry, who said they're playing Overwatch with this? Dave2D said that? Hey, you know, maybe it's me, it's gotta be user error, right? How the hell do I get out of the car? Seriously, it feels like, you know, like I got the mouse and the controller and I just got no idea what's going on. I don't know what it is, it just feels like it should be. I don't know, you're in the car. No, no, I'll get out of the car, I'll get out of the car, I'll get out of the car. How do I break? Oh God, oh, I'm freaking... Okay, I'm gonna find someone to fight. This guy looks tough. Are you tough? How do you like bullets, tough guy? Oh. I think the thing that makes the least sense about this is the fact that there's a six-axis gyroscope in this thing. So if I really wanted to aim better, man, I would just use gyro-assisted aiming like we showed in that recent video on LTT. That's a very, very good way to improve your accuracy if you're not great with aiming with thumbsticks. That's right, my friends, all this can be yours for just 700 US dollars. In fairness to Lenovo, yeah, that's about the price of an ROG Ally, and the performance is very similar with some perks like the larger, higher-resolution 144 Hertz display and the fact that the controllers are detachable. It comes with some downsides, the software being a major obvious one, but the good news is software is something that can be improved as long as Lenovo remains committed to this product line. And if its initial success is anything to go on, I think that there is at least greater than zero chance of that, just like there's a greater than zero chance of you subscribing to ShortCircuit. Go, do it now, what are you waiting for?",

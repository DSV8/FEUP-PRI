    "transcript": "well it looks like air coolers might be a regular thing here on the channel if we find cool stuff obviously but then again it didn't really go out that well for Corsair's a500 that we checked out recently but the subject for today's video actually comes from your suggestions in that video it is none other than the scythe Fuma 2 air cooler I actually have to make sure that I don't cut myself because this thing is ridiculously sharp like I'm actually very afraid of holding it like right now because it's pretty sure I'm gonna end up with a lot of cuts after this video get it cuts editing a video cuts that was a bad joke alright so what makes the Fuma 2 special well it's focus is on silence and compatibility but it's also supposed to have some wicked performance due to its pretty unique fan setup and the best part is that it costs $60 which is a lot less than a lot of the other coolers that we've tested I'm pretty excited about this one since it would be popular to have an alternative to some of the most popular heat sinks out there in the market so I guess the only way to find out is to put the Fuma two up against our super hot wanna test system and see what it performs like but first a quick message from our sponsor the new Corsair came out a 5 platinum RGB XT lets you program the six macro keys on the left to work beautifully with stream deck for endless customization while you stream or gain plus P V T key caps a comfy wrist rest and equality k95 body check it out below alright so usually at skip over what's inside the box but site actually includes a full list of goodies so there's a nicely braided fan splitter cable a magnetic screwdriver and a tube of thermal compound with enough for at least three applications there are also three fan brackets so let me explain why this is so important out of the box site includes one thin 50 mm or fan and one that's a standard 25 millimeters the slimmer one is there to make sure that there are no issues with memory compatibility but if your system has enough clearance you can use the extra bracket to replace it with a higher performance one or you could just keep the stock vents and add a third to really maximize performance but there's more to this fan setup than what you might think even though they both move air in the same direction the front fan spins in a counterclockwise direction the middle one runs clockwise according to sight this actually increases static pressure and allows the two fans to operate at a maximum of 1,200 rpms to perform more like they're going at much higher speeds and I can't wait to put that claim to the test so on to the heat sink itself and it's a pretty straightforward dual tower design with aluminum Finnair ace that are capped with a plain black metal there's also six heat pipes which happens to be two more than Corsair uses on their $100 8500 cooler yes I'm still ranting about that thing anyways another nice thing to see here is a flat base that's machine to pretty high standards nope there's no cheaply designed heat pipe direct touch base here which is awesome once the fans are installed I have to give compliments to Seif I'm loving these stealth looks they have going on over here don't worry we'll ruin it with knocked off fans a bit later speaking of Noctua the Fuma 2 size is pretty much the same as the Nhu 12a though it's a bit wider that also makes it a lot more compact than the NHD 12 as for the installation process well I think it's one of the best around because I actually prefer it over anything from not to a be quiet or nearly anyone else I won't go through every installation here since that would take forever but let's just say that the only difference between platforms is that there is a backplate that's provided for Intel 775 1150 series and 1366 sockets whereas on AMD systems you'll need to reuse your motherboards backplate aside from that site provides a system of standoffs and a cross bar type mounting plates that's compatible with every platform basically after these standoffs are installed you just screw down the mounting bar and up to this point it's very similar to knock toast design but when it comes to installing the cooler there's one major difference that makes this thing so much easier instead of there being threaded rods on the cross bars there is a hole with angled guides and this helps the heatsinks preinstalled screws slide right into position without any hassle this is a brilliant easy system and I love it since you can easily get the best possible mount I also have to give a ton of credit to site for focusing on compatibility and it's pretty obvious that they did some serious homework to make sure that the Fuma 2 worked in almost every condition but I do have to mention that this cooler is meant to be only mounted in a left right direction and not up and down on a platform like Intel's 2066 with Quantrell memory the elevated heatsink allows it to clear even super tall memory meanwhile the slim fan means every memory slot can be populated but you need to be aware the D tolerances are super tight I noticed that the lower fins do make contact something else to note is the ass rock next to 99 clx that I used here has a ridiculously tall vrm heatsink and even that wasn't a problem the only slight issue shows up if you want to mount a third fan on a system that has high memory or beyond heat sinks since it will need to be pushed upwards moving on to aim for and there's no problem here either since site swept leaf umma to heat pipes forward to make sure that the main fins are far away from the memory slots but don't expect to install a full sized second fan if your memory slots are fully populated because there's just not enough space okay so now on to performance but before I get to that I do want to quickly go over a few things first up it is very important to note that the two fans on the film a two are set to operate in a maximum of 1,200 rpms which is a lot slower than anything else we've tested here the second thing is that our testing methodology along with all the coolers using this video are linked down below so starting things off with these stocks be testing on the 1098 exc and it looks like beef umma 2 is able to keep up with some of the best coolers available now it's important to take note that this CPU is running around 165 watt TDP which happens to be the worst case scenario for many current Intel and AMD CPUs so this proves that sites $60 heatsink can effectively cool literally any processor currently available but the amazing thing is that it competes with the Noctua D 15 and it beats the u 12 a in terms of acoustics even with the event operating at 1000 rpms it's really really competitive with heat sinks that cost quite a bit more but pay special attention to the nock to au 14s since it costs only a few bucks more than the Fuma 2 and 1000 rpms sights counter rotation fan design seems to be making a pretty big difference since this happens to be one of the quietest CPU coolers that we've come across now this part is pretty cool guys the Puma 2 hits about 50 degrees Celsius which is one of the lowest temperatures but it's fan speeds are a good 300 rpms lower than need t 15 and the U 14s and guess what that leads into that's right it just kills everything else in noise testing by a long shot I can't highlight this enough guys when it comes to performance versus noise the Fuma 2 is literally in a world of its own but now it's time for overclocked testing and the tenon ADX seen running along had four point five gigahertz gets lava hot well on the positive side psych was able to design this cooler well enough that it didn't cost CPU throttling due to high temperatures but 97 degrees celsius is still pretty high and the decibel results proved that it was running at full fan speed at the tests and but honestly it's just so damn quiet at a constant thousand rpm it still technically passes and that's impressive like freely impressive finally at a hundred percent fan speed the Fuma 2 actually manages to beat the u 14s and it runs pretty close to the u 12 eh now remember it's pulling these numbers at much lower noise levels and not only that it only costs $60 guys so I think it's safe to say that scythe has designed a really really good air cooler for $60 but I'm not willing to leave this review here without some more testing with different fan configs so let's start things off with nock to us to nf8 welts this is really amazing and it proves its site closely designed that heatsink and fans in parallel and stock settings and a constant thousand rpm the Fuma 2's regular setup actually wins at full speed the dual knock dose setup pulls ahead but remember two of those knock tours will be much much louder than sight stock vans and they cost just as much as a brand new Fuma 2 and yeah I really don't think spending all that money on upgraded fans really benefits this cooler but I didn't want to stop there because site does include an extra set of fan bracket so I decided to mount a third fan right over here one that doesn't stick out like a sore thumb well this is the cooler master SF 120 M and in our testing it can easily compete against the NF 812 without ruining the Fuma 2's good looks for a $30 investment these stock temperature results are pretty impressive with the triple fan setup hitting temperature levels that are getting closer to 280 millinery nao levels in the overclock testing running the three fans at 1200 RPM the temperature equals the dual knock to a config while noise levels were a lot lower well I guess it's time to wrap this up and I want to level with you guys here the Fuma 2 from scythe impressed the heck out of me it's the lowest price cooler in our charts and it competed really well against the alternatives that cost $40 more so if you're running a more basic system than us with the 10 and 80 XC say for instance you're running an 9900 k or aim DS 39 50 X this should be our go-to cooler and you're actually better off spending the extra $40 on perhaps a better memory kid or a better GPU or something else sure it couldn't hit extreme cooling levels with the overclocked fire-breathing 1098 exc but that was expected since scythe designed it for silence before performance and did it accomplish that yeah it did it certainly did so I'm gonna do something that I haven't done in a really long time and actually give the scythe Fuma 2 the Hardware Canucks damn good value award so where are you impressed with the Scythe Fuma 2 in fact what do you think of that names scythe I'm actually really in love with that because there's something so stealthy about that also I'm glad that I didn't cut my fingers but anyways that's it for me guys thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe hit that notification bell and I'll talk to you guys in the next one scythe like who comes up with these names like I wish I was a I wish I was part of this name making process cuz it's just so cool maybe I should name my pet scythe",

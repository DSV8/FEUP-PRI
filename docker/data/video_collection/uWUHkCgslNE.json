    "transcript": "- When a company tries to sell you something using AI these days, I immediately get a little bit skeptical. It's kind of just thrown around all over the place, especially at CES. And sometimes it's great, other times not so much. So where does NVIDIA's new RTX Voice fall? Apparently, they can use AI and the RTX cores on your graphics card, that you're probably not actually using, to remove background noise and crap from your stream. Like you know, you're streaming along, and you're using these really inconvenient blue switches that are pretty loud for everyone else, but maybe this will get rid of that. I don't know, let's test it out. I don't have super high hopes for this, but at the same time, I've seen some stuff on Twitch from Barnacules that looks really promising. So, I don't know, let's give it a try, see what the limits are. So, setting up RTX Voice is actually really quite easy. All that you have to do is go to this website right here, and click download the app. It should install pretty easily, assuming that you have a RTX card and the driver 410.18 or newer. So you know, probably good there, that was quite an old one. So pretty much all that you get, is this right here. It's this tiny little window that says NVIDIA RTX Voice. You have your input device, your output device and you just select which one you want. So microphone right here, output device default. I think that's totally fine, and then you click remove background noise from my microphone, and you get to choose how much noise suppression you have here. Okay, so this is a sound recording of the MSI GS66 Stealth and me speaking. This is RTX off, and now we are turning RTX on. Okay, honestly I couldn't tell any difference there, because the mic just was not picking up the computer. So, let's try test number two. You know, you have that absolute jerk that's always in your discord that bought some blue switches. And you know, he's just typing away all the time, and with any luck, there's not going to be really any stuff in here right now. We're turning RTX off. And maybe you get a bunch of sounds now. Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah. And you know, he's just typing away all the time. And with any luck. Wow. You actually can barely hear the typing. I was completely hammering it there. Yeah, that's crazy, how much of a difference it is. So, if you're one of those jerks that is using blues, get this right now, pretty please. Oh, we have Linus here. So Linus is going to do a kids in the background test here. - Yep, so we're just gonna try and have a civilized call between adults here while there's screaming children in the background. Okay, guys, go ahead, play games and make noise. Okay so, this is what it sounds like without background noise suppression. Now I'm just gonna go ahead and turn that on. And let's see if that makes a difference. It's on now. Is it blocking out the kids behind me, Alex? Do you have any commentary? I'm gonna go ahead and turn the suppression off again. Does it make it any easier to hear me? - It's really not all that different. You can't really hear the kids in either one. I think that it did cut out a tiny bit when you turned it on. - Okay, I'm gonna turn it back on for a second. - Yeah, tell your kids to be louder. - Okay, so this is more like what I think you're asking for. So I'm gonna go ahead and turn my background noise suppression off. Is it more annoying now? - That's really quite a annoying, yes. - I'm gonna go ahead and turn my noise suppression back on. There, is that an improvement? - Wow. - Or is that basically the same thing? - That is such an improvement, yeah. Oh, it's so much better. You can kinda tell that there's kids. - That does make a difference. Interesting, because, I mean, this is such a close proximity style microphone. That I'd hadn't really honestly expected it to make much of a difference. I don't know if you notice, but I did go ahead and toggle it back off there. - Yeah, they are very loud. - I'm gonna go ahead and turn it back on now, because-- - Wow. - Realistically nobody wants to listen to this. Parents don't wanna listen to this, grandparents don't wanna listen to this, it's a miracle children survived in the wild, quite honestly. - No, yeah, that's actually really impressive. You would think that the children are politely playing in the background right now, when you have RTX on. Where as like, when it's off, it's like (growls). - That is truly fantastic. All right, cool. Happy to help. - All right, thank you, sir. All right, so kids very successful. I'm actually super impressed by that, but can it do the vacuum? Come in here, Mr. Andy. (vacuum cleaner droning) All right, just give her. You have to stay six feet away though. Get back there. Hey Guys! This is my stream coming from my nice quiet apartment. I'm just gonna go ahead and turn RTX on and see if that improves your lives at all. That is so much better. (rhythmic drum music) So we are recording here, and I am making a total racket with this, but if we just go ahead and turn RTX on, I wonder how good of a job it is doing. If we just go ahead and turn RTX on, I wonder how good of a job it is doing. It's actually kinda hard to use a drum at once, and also speak at the same. Ha. But I think I'm doing a not to bad job of it. So, it's like kind of making it sound weird. My voice level is kind of going up and down a whole bunch, but at the same time, you can't hear the drum. So you guys might remember this right here. Its the good old Blowie Matron. This thing draws something like 500 watts at full load. So I'm gonna be really surprised if, you know, RTX is able to get rid of it. So this is just for safety. If you guys have seen our video on the Blowie Matron, it goes up to about 11,000 RPM, and it will legitimately chop your finger off if it ends up there. So hopefully that'll keep it in one place. (fan whirring). Oh, there we go. All right. So we are now current limited at 5.2 amps. I think this thing's able to do about 92 decibels. So you actually don't wanna be around it for too long. So I'm just going to start speaking into this microphone here, and I'm going to turn RTX on. And I'm going to be genuinely impressed, holy, (laughs), if it's able to get rid of that. I'm also just gonna just start playing the drum, because, you know what, we're gonna just make the loudest possible racket. It totally got rid of it. I'm playing the drum and the fan, and you just can't hear it at all. Thank you, Andy. Join in with the noise! That's insane. Okay, yeah, so just go back here. Stay six feet away. The siren. - You want the siren thing? - Yeah, I want the siren. - All right, you asked for it. (siren wails) - Hello! I am speaking into this microphone and I am going to be very impressed if RTX is able to get rid of this. So, we are talking right now. Hello! I am speaking into this microphone and I am going to be very impressed if RTX is able to get rid of this. You can actually tell what I'm saying. We are talking right now, and I'm going to turn RTX off. So I don't know, all right, (laughs). All right so I have to give it to you, NVIDIA. RTX Voice, it is great! We just had a megaphone, a server fan, and a vacuum, and a drum, all playing at the same time, and you can tell what I'm saying. The problem is just that I'm peaking in the microphone. How, did they do that? (laughs) All right, well, I think that's about the end. I don't think we can make anymore of a racket than that. So, I don't know. I hope that you guys have a good old day. That was fun. Anyway, get subscribed. Bye, I'm shocked.",

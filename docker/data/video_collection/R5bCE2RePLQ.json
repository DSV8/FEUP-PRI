    "transcript": "in my last video I built this system which has an RTX 3060 in it and after I finished building it I went onto my local PC shop and saw that they had this graphics card the RX 6700 XT Satan Edition I think is what it's called on sale for the same price I paid for the graphics card in that system which yeah I I think I may have bought the wrong graphics card let's find out today [Music] now not only did we get a 6700 XT but it's even a power color Beelzebub Edition which comes with cooling infused with the power of Satan although doesn't the naming scheme kind of imply the graphics card is gonna catch on fire and burn forever I don't know it's a bit weird but anyway let's open it up let's not think too much about it [Music] wow it's a thick foam [Music] oh it's a heavy boy Whoa on build quality alone I can't believe this cost about the same as that MSI card because this is like all metal the back plate is metal even this shroud has like bits of metal on the side with like high quality plastic and then there's like a big ass heatsink under that what a cord that backplate's making me feel some pretty adult feelings moving swiftly on from my adult feelings specs wise things don't get any better for the 360. the two gpus may share a very similar memory configuration obviously excluding the 3060 scumbag Edition but in terms of core specification the 6700 XT is making the 3060 look a bit malnourished but you know what they say don't judge a book by its render configuration make it fight another book to the death in random gaming benchmarks to determine its worth now for the comparison I'm not going to be using that system in the 3060 in it because well it's a giveaway system so I'm gonna use this 3060 that I found in an AliExpress system instead but with that let's throw this in a system first to the we can get a baseline of what the mistake performance is like and then we'll try out something a little bit more evil now unfortunately I don't have a goat sacrifice themed system for this test but as far as I understand Nez kochan is a demon so I I guess it works oh that's potentially a problem okay so the 3060 fits just although Satan is definitely not gonna fit okay easy solution I'm just gonna remove the middle fan that's reasonable right [Music] uh it still doesn't fit so I guess we're gonna have to use this system which kind of makes more sense anyway considering that it has basically the same CPU in it as that uh White be quiet system quick note I couldn't get the system to Output a signal with that AliExpress 3060 in it so I ended up using the one from the MSI pre-built which I think is a Ventus X2 anyway let's finally get to the testing now at 1080p High settings Battlefield 5 is giving us a lot of frames per second here you can see that we are averaging well over 120 frames per second so yeah I don't know for a for a relatively demanding FPS game this is a great result although it is a 1080p you'd hope a graphics card like this would competently Run games with this resolution so I think 1440p will be a resolution where we can more clearly illustrate the difference between the two gpus but before we get into all of that let's try a more demanding game let's try cyberpunk [Music] now cyberpunk is also running at high settings 1080p here and we're getting well over 60 frames per second so even for more demanding visual Safari style games like this you're getting a solidly over 60 frame per second experience which is good it feels nice and responsive it doesn't look great but that's because I'm running 1080p on a 4k monitor so that's that's my fault it's not the game's fault but let's drop Satan into the system and see what that does wow that is a lot of frame rates that the 6700 XT is pumping out now it is important to remember that Battlefield 5 does love it some AMD booty but it's still very impressive we are consistently bumping off that uh 200 frame per second limit at 1080p High settings I think this graphics card may be more comfortable at a higher resolution but we'll get to that in a second also temperature wise this GPU is a beast we're sitting at about 50 degrees Celsius and interestingly uh despite the Dual eight pins on the 6700 XT compared to the single eight pin on the RTX 3060 the power draw is very similar to that of the 3060. oh we're in the 90 frames per second 6700 XT you spoil us with all these frames so the 6700 XT gives us a reasonable amount over 80 frames per second second and yeah it feels very smooth and nice oh oh oh louder I just I just committed a crime I think with that it's a good point to switch over to 1440p and see how the little 30 60 loser GPU handles that at 1440p we've taken a reasonable knee to the groin of the 3060. we are still above 100 frames per second which is decent but it's not like blazing fast anymore and at this resolution the 3060 isn't as happy as it is at 1080p so moving from 1080p to 1440p on Battlefield 5 drops you out of that frame rate sweet spot for the game at high settings I'm curious to see if the same thing happens with cyberpunk now it becomes even clearer with cyberpunk at 1440p high settings where we've dropped under 60 frames per second now it's still good like 40 to 50 frames per second is a reasonable result and the game still feels fine although there is a little bit of additional input lag but we have sacrificed that 60 frame per second line which gives you such a good gaming experience you know so the extra horsepower of the 6700 XT May really be useful here so let's see what happens with that [Music] wow moving up to 1440p has barely affected the frame rate it is dipping a little bit lower but if anything it's led to better frame pacing uh before the frame time graph is a little bit all over the place whereas now the game feels really smooth also at 1080p the difference between the 3060 and the 6700 XT was subjectively very similar and a blind test you'd struggle to tell the difference between them but at 1440p the difference is a lot more noticeable it is important to note that the gameplay was on two different Maps but I will have standardized benchmarks coming in a second first let's see what cyberpunk does with the 6700 XT at 1440p it's in a situation like this where you can really feel the extra muscle you know with Battlefield 5 at 1080p going from 160 frames per second to almost 200 is barely noticeable it's functionally the same thing but going from in the 40s to the 60s subjectively feels like a bigger difference to me and for the same amount of money why would you not want that but enough of me rambling about subjective gaming experience let's have a look at some benchmarks [Music] so with that I think purely in terms of gaming yeah I kind of bought the wrong graphics card it's pretty crazy that the 6700 XT costs the same as the 3060. it's even crazier that the similarly performing 6650 XT is 150 Canadian dollars cheaper than both these cards although pricing is all over the place at the moment Beyond gaming though there's more of an argument to be made for the 3060 because of stuff like nvank but either way for the giveaway system I will be giving the winner the choice between the two graphics cards let me know which one you choose and why in the comments below and with that thank you for watching the video consider subscribing to the channel and maybe watch another video a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video thank you for watching bye [Music]",

    "transcript": "- The best way to think about Ricoh cameras is to remember what the company is actually best known for: its copiers and its printers. Because for better or for worse, Ricoh is a company that has never been afraid to simply make a copy. I'm Becca, welcome back to \"Full Frame.\" Woo, this is the new $1067 Ricoh GR III HDF. It's a pocket size point and shoot camera with a 24.2 megapixel APSC sensor, and a fixed, super-sharp 28 millimeter f/2.8 lens. It is almost an exact copy of the GR III that came out in March of 2019, but what makes it worth talking about today is that new HDF part of its name. It stands for highlight diffusion filter. Where previous GR III cameras had built in ND filters, which you can think of as like sunglasses for your camera. They minimize the amount of light that's hitting the sensor. The new GR III HDF has a diffusion filter, and this is a Tiffin Black Pro-Mist 1/2, which is pretty high, but I wanna show you what it does. When you put this in front of your sensor, it makes for a softer image and it also spreads out the highlights. You see that, it's pretty cool. Here's what Ricoh's own diffusion filter looks like in the GR III HDF. At night, bright lights like headlights or these stadium lights appear larger and softer, and during the day, a backlight on someone's head might cause a halo effect, and in side-by-side photos with the filter on on the left and the filter off on the right. It can be obvious that this filter makes photos more dreamy by spreading out those highlights. But if you don't ample highlights, like in this photo, it can be difficult to see any diffusion or softening happening at all. This is a highlight diffusion filter that needs a highlight in order to be seen. But then when there are highlights, I don't always love the effect. Like this photo of Vjeran. I mean, it looks like he's coming from the heavens, but then there are other times like in this high contrast black and white scene where the filter added a really elegant sort of glow to the whites. I love this. So much like GR camera systems as a whole. You're gonna have to get to know this filter. It could be really unpredictable and what highlights it makes pop, but I think that Ricoh's decision to swap the ND filter for something else is really smart because in my use of Ricoh GR III cameras, I rarely put the ND filter on because I rarely had a need to stop the shutter speed down, which is usually what you're trying to do when you put an ND on. So having a filter that I use some of the time is much more beneficial than having a filter that I was using none of the time. The problem is, outside of the filter, This brand new HDF version of this camera is the same camera that came out in 2019, and it brings the total number of GR III cameras to seven. There's seven versions of this camera, which means that Ricoh's been making a lot of Ricopies. Per Ricoh's website, when the company launched its very first copier, the Recopy 101, the product's popularity sparked a term. Supposedly folks would say, make a Ricopy instead of make a copy. And with the GR III lineup, they've made a lot of Ricopies. Lemme show you. First there was the GR III in 2019, which set the core hardware and internal specs for everything to come. Then in 2020, Ricoh launched the GR III Street Edition, which had the same internals of GR III, but with a gray body and orange lens ring. In 2021 came the GR IIIx that had a slightly tighter 40 millimeter lens, but otherwise the same internals as the GR III. It was followed up with the GR IIIx Urban Edition in 2020, same camera as the GR IIIx, but gray body and blue lens ring. Then in 2023, Ricoh released the GR III Diary Edition, same camera as the III, but with a light gray finish and a silver lens ring. And now we have the GR III and IIIx HDF with the diffusion filter instead of the ND. For a company whose camera department is on the smaller side, this is a great way to keep folks talking about your camera and to keep selling cameras. You know, you can make small changes to the lens now the filter and the colors without having to overhaul the entire system. But as a consumer, it starts to feel like one of those games where you're looking at two photos and trying to find the smallest differences between them. It's great for passing time, but it's really annoying when you're trying to drop a thousand dollars on a camera. The other problem with this approach is that hardware starts to feel really dated. The back screen of this camera makes your photos look relatively low res, and you really can't see how great of a photo this camera can take by just looking at it. You have to transfer it to a phone or to a computer first. This obviously isn't an issue for photographers who are going to transfer their images anyway, but I worry for a lot of folks who are picking up a point and shoot camera just to use for fun or to get better at photography with. They're gonna look down, not see the results they want, and then they're not gonna pick up the camera again, or they're gonna return it and they should hold onto it. I mean, it's really such a great camera, but increasingly it needs convincing for someone else to believe that. So that's the Ricoh GR III HDF. It is in many ways a Ricopy, but that doesn't make it any less of a great camera. That being said, if you're looking to save a couple bucks, see if you can't get a Ricoh GR III used and then just buy a diffusion filter to put on the front or just wait till the Ricoh GR IV, which, oh man, I'm so damn excited for that camera, and I know a lot of other folks are too. So I'm Becca. Thank you so much for joining me. I wanted to make this video because Ricoh is a fascinating company. They make printers and copiers as you now know, but they also have the Ricoh Theta, which was one of the very first consumer 360 degree cameras. I had one, it was awesome. They have like a stadium somewhere, I think in England, like they're just this huge company that has a lot of small teams working on products. They also own Pentax, which, oh my God, the rumors on that film camera that they might be having come out are getting me stoked. So I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you learned something. I appreciate you so much. We'll see you on the next one. Thanks, bud.",

    "transcript": "I've been told by Eben Upton that the Raspberry Pi 5 is a lot more powerful than a Raspberry Pi 4. What I'm doing here is using hashcat on a captured Wi-Fi password or handshake and I'm going to try and crack it using the Raspberry Pi's. I've got the Raspberry Pi 5 connected to this laptop Raspberry Pi 4 to that laptop I'll press enter on both keyboards and as you can see they have now started trying to crack the password pressing s on both of these will give me information about the speed. On the 5 we're getting 2718 hashes. On the 4 we're getting 1061 hashes per second. So the 5 is at least two and a half times faster than the 4. On the 5 we're told that it's going to take 11 hours to crack but on the Raspberry Pi 4 it's one day two hours. Raspberry Pi 5 just in the simple demonstration is cracking passwords at least two and a half times faster than a Raspberry Pi 4 definitely a huge upgrade on the 5 versus the 4.",

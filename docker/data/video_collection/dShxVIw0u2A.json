    "transcript": "- This is a banana to eat and there's another banana in this box for you to use. From London, apparently. It's a beautiful wooden box with a little thing. You can open it up. Okay. It's pretty thick. I don't wanna sound weird but you guys get out your dirty mind. This is a practical piece of thing you can have in the house. This one's a limited edition. This one produces two of 50 pieces. Beautiful here. Don't touch it like that. This product is a wall lamp that must be used as a wall lamp only. What are you thinking? What else would you use with this lamp? This is not a sex toy. It's pretty obvious it's a lamp. Please do not try to put it inside your body. They actually say that. (laughing) You're not allowed to put this inside your body, other people and animals, obviously. Yes, it does. Don't put, why would you? It could hurt and even kill someone. What? This product is insane and very dangerous. If you're watching this, make sure you read the guideline. Okay? We don't want anyone get hurt. Let's take a look at this beautiful lamp. It's a lamp. Before I start touching this lamp, I need to make it verified by dbrand. Thanks dbrand for sponsoring this video. Dbrand has a lot of stickers. You know, as you can see, the phone, iPad, MacBook any stickers you want. You can customize this look or even these colorful beautiful skins. Or even you can just pay $8 to verify anything, a penis lamp. So make sure you head over ShortLius.com to buy a lot of beautiful stickers and verify everything. Okay, so, you're telling me this is 10 inch long. Is it long enough? I don't know. For a lamp, I think it's long enough. Let me touch it. I really, why am I excited? Okay, calm down. Okay, let's be professional. This is a lamp. Oh, first I notice it's thick and it's 10 inches long. How thick is it? Two and a half inches. I can't even control it in one hand. Don't put it in my mouth. Like, I can't even control it with one hand. The material they use is very smooth, like silky. If you put it next to your bed before bed, if you touch it, you feel more soothing, right? You want good soft material. And this is the limited addition. So they have a little diamond ring. Oh, look at the diamond ring thing on the penis ring. Beautiful. It's a lamp. Lamp. Sorry. Lamp, it's not a penis. Apparently this product is inspired by medieval torch and a part of human body which symbolizes new birth. It's very meaningful. It's created by the artist in London, anonymous artist. He sells a lot of different things on his website. Lamps, some art that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. He also has different kind of like style of lamp, like with like spiky things and just very simple, one colorful one. And this one's a limited edition. And it's cool. I mean, it's a cool piece at home. Like if someone comes to your house, I would definitely bring them to my room and show them the penis. The lamp penis. There's a special way you turn it on and off. I'm gonna show you. So very simple lamp, easy to use. On the walls like that. How to turn it on? You do this, do you see that? You pull it back. Okay, this is a little long. So on, off, on, on, off, on. Penis! Did I break it? No way. Penis! I didn't pull it very hard. Oh! Okay, so like you can see, so it is basically a piece of this cloth and it's has something attached to it, triggering the switch. So it's literally just a little string metal string attaching to the the skin. No, the cloth. If you're getting too excited at nighttime before bed, just make sure you pull slowly. Oh, be gentle. So that's it. Like is it bright? It's pretty bright. Is it beautiful? Yeah, actually you can see. It's like actually, it's bright. It's pretty bright. I think it is like good for lamp, like a bedroom lamp. So on the website it doesn't say what these diamonds are. Are they real? Are they fake? They're just kind of a ring. A lamp that's pretty on the wall. They come with a little piece here and then you just slide the penis, the lamp into the wall. Slide in slowly. Oh, come on. Is this 3D printed? It's 3D printed. Its so janky. It doesn't stay. Okay, I need help. I can't slide it in. Help me slide it in. Do you want me to hold it for you? And you can push harder? Oh, should you go from the other side? Oh no, it doesn't stay. Unfortunately. This lamp, they don't fit. They don't fit the hole. They don't fit the thing. They cannot go onto the wall. So, I guess you can 3M tape it, if you bought this. Tape it on the wall. It looks like this. And then before bed, you're just like, oh, good morning. This is so bad. Linus is gonna come? Linus, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Just come. Yeah, walk backwards. Okay. Sit down and then give- - Oh my god. What are you- - Put your right hand here. I wanna give you something to hold on. Okay, you can look at it. This is a beautiful- - It's a dick. - It's a lightsaber. - No, it's not a lightsaber. - It's a shorter version of a lightsaber. - It's not circumcised. - It's supposed to turn on. - Well, I'm turned on. - Okay, come on. Work. - Yeah, it's that little like bit of skin there. Sometimes it, you know. - Stop. What are you talking about? - Okay, can you stop doing that to it? What is wrong with you? - Jerk it on. - How much would you pay for it? - I mean nothing. Obviously this is- - Even if it's free? - What would I do with it? - Don't put it inside. - I could see this being like novelty. 69.99 or whatever. Like 70 bucks. - Please tell me I did not pay for it. Did I pay for this? Did I pay for this? So it's 12.50? And we broke it already. - Okay, I did not break. It just didn't work. Look at the playback. So on, off. On, on. You screw-- wait, this is the cheapest light. (laughing) It's not even smart. We need a small light bulb. You're paying a premium right? - What the hell? - Linus stop. You're breaking the foreskin. - No, it's dead already. This is seriously just some panty hose over a 3D printed tube. With a basic light socket from Home Depot and a wire attached to it so that it clicks when you pull the foreskin back for a thousand dollars? This is nice cord. It's a better cord than you'd get at a dollar store. This bracelet is probably from the dollar store though. No it's not. Have you ever jerked off a penis before? Because that's not how it works. - Okay, Linus, I'm not jerking it off. I'm trying to turn it on. - Okay, well that's not how that works either. Try your mouth. - Stop. This can get demonetized. - Dennis, this was demonetized the second you un boxed this light. Okay, let's try to see it from their perspective. This is a small batch, artisanal product. It's very edgy, so you probably can't expect to sell a lot. You know, you gotta make up that in higher price for the few people who do want it. I guess. - Can I add something to this? - They got the accurate penis skin seam on the bottom here. Everyone has a seam along the bottom of their penis, right? - Did you say that this was $2,100? - 25. Oh my god. - So on Ali Express, I went ahead and searched cock lamp. - This is 10 times cheaper. - A real cock. A real cock with that light in the butt hole. I actually, I would rather have that. - That's so much better. - I'd rather have that for sure. - Truthfully, not living in a bachelor pad. I just don't have anywhere to put it. I think it's hilarious. - If it's like 10 bucks, I will buy it and put it in my room and every time I have a guest over, I'll show them the penis. - Yeah. - Well unfortunately, this penis lamp doesn't turn on, or anyone on. - Well, I'm turned on. - If you're looking for a cool lamp to buy and you have spare money laying around and you support art, that's the most important thing. You support art. And this thing can be the thing you want to get. Where's the diamonds? Did he steal the diamonds? He's stole the diamonds. Thanks for watching. I'm going to get a diamond ring back. Oh yeah. I was like actually trying to steal- Oh!",

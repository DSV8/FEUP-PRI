    "transcript": "- Today we're checking out a brand new coffee maker, this makes coffee in an all new way. It's called Spinn. (upbeat music) This is something that has been in development for many years. It started out as a Kickstarter and now over five years later, it is finally shipping to customers. And what's exciting about this is they have perfected an all new way of making coffee. Let's check it out and I'll show you guys why this is so unique. This has an accompanying app. So in the app, not only can I decide what type of coffee I wanna make, but it also has a marketplace. Right now this coffee marketplace has over 1500 different bags of coffee from over 450 local roasters. This allows you to set up subscription. There's also a little quiz that will ask you what type of coffee you like. And then those beans will be automatically shipped to you if you choose to have a subscription. And also, even if you don't have this machine, you guys can still have access to the marketplace to order really great coffee. I have a few of these here that I've ordered already. There's another thing that makes the app really cool. This has coffee bean recognition. So when you take a picture of the front of the coffee, it will be able to find this in the marketplace. And it will also be able to link it up to your app so that the coffee machine knows the type of coffee that you're about to make. And it will use different algorithms to grind the beans a different way, use different temperatures of water, all of those things are determined in advance by the roasters, so the type of coffee that this will make is exactly what they had in mind. Now it's time to make some coffee. First, I'm gonna make an espresso and we're gonna use these beans because I already opened these ones. Oh, smells some good. Honestly, there's nothing better than just smelling fresh coffee beans. Another thing that's important when you're making good coffee is having good filtered water. So a built in filter. Let's fill it out. (water running) That's it. Now it's giving me the option to choose my coffee and we already have our Blueprint Seasonal House Coffee already in here, so I'm gonna click select. This little reservoir is great because you can just keep the beans in here. They're ready to go. And it doesn't grind it until you're ready to make an espresso or a coffee. Right now it's time for espresso. I already know it's gonna be good because I've already made one before. But we're gonna make one here for you guys. Are you ready? I'm ready. Espresso. Go. Why this is called Spinn is because the beans are actually spinning inside of this machine. Instead of being pressed down. (machine rumbles) Smells so good. (gasps) My entire house now just smells like a coffee shop. So it goes through this whole process, it makes your espresso and it also cleans the machine at the same time. So it's forcing those grinds into this little area right down here. It makes it super easy to clean. We don't need to talk about cleaning right now. We're talking about espresso. (sniffs coffee) (upbeat music) I mean, it looks perfect, but how does it taste? (upbeat music) It's so smooth. I've tried a lot of coffee from so many different types of machines like this and what makes this so good is the fact that these beans are being ground right here and they're so fresh. And this is so smooth. (sips coffee) I'm gonna be so hyped up, (giggles) so good. What would you like? - [Tyler] Let's do a coffee. - I'll make a coffee. Tyler has ordered a coffee, here at the barista bar of my kitchen. That guy here, there you go. There's also an option here to customize the drink so you can adjust the coffee strength, the water level, and also the speed. So this is great because if you do want a cup of coffee, that's a little bit stronger, you have that option. We're just gonna stick to the basics. Let's click make drink, it's for your Tyler. (upbeat music) (machine rumbles) Tyler's coffee's ready. There you go. There you go. There you go. It's really hot, you might wanna wait a second. (laughs) - [Tyler] Ooh. - I saw a smile. - [Tyler] Wow. - Isn't it good? - [Tyler] Yeah. - It's so smooth. Like, it's just, I can't even get over the fact that it's just, it's so fresh. - [Tyler] Oh. - Mm. - [Tyler] Oh man. - Now let's make a latte for my sister Jenna. So this is one of their milk frothers. This doesn't come with the coffee machine, but this is an added extra. This will allow you to make more cappuccino. Or if you just want some more milk, (giggles) you can also warm up some milk with that. So whatever you're into. (fridge door opens) Milk, hey Jenna what kind of milk you want? - I like all milk except almond milk doesn't like me. - Okay, hold that. - There you go. - Awesome. - That's pretty good. - Cool. - That's a lot of milk. - That is a lot of milk. I put this on. (beeps) I'm just- - This is beautiful. - Let's go. The milk is being frothed. - This is like the future. - I'm aware. Now we're gonna make you an espresso while the milk is frothing. - I do it. - Just pour some beans in there. - Does it matter how many I put in. (pours beans) - I mean, you can put them all in there because this top will keep them fresh. But this will be just the type of coffee you'll be drinking for a while. - Okay. That makes sense. - It's good though. - Smells so good. - I know. (upbeat music) - It's really cute. (machine beeps) - Oh, and your espresso is done. That looks good. - That was so good. - Okay so you're going to dump it into here. - Okay? (dramatic music) Oh, oh. - You've made a mess. - I'll work on my pouring skills. Oh look at that, it's gone, nothing happened. - Our milk is frothed. - There you go. - Are you ready? - Are you ready? - I don't know. - Let's see your barista skills. - Hmm. - Oh. - Mm. Look at that. - Now let's add a little foamy foam to the top. - Oh my gosh. - Yeah, I know. - This is incredible. - I'm aware. - Okay, that's enough. - Oh, you don't want more foam? - Oh, how I'm I gonna get to the goods. - Wait, I need to get you a little cinnamon. When do they learn how to make some designs? Look how beautiful that is. - Okay, can I have it. - Yeah but we gotta get the shot first. - Oh. (upbeat music) (Justine gasps) - Okay, here we go. So good, I put a lot of foam. I'm sorry. You're gonna get that all over you. - Mm, Oh, Mm. - Can I try it? - Oh, Mm. - Could you- (upbeat music) Maybe I can have a little sip on the other side. - Mm, yeah. Okay, it's really, really good. Oh, that's incredible actually. - This is actually really good. - It's very good. - This is my first latte I made. - Well, do you want it then? Okay take it? (Justine giggles) - This is so awesome. What I love about this so much is it's also very easy to clean. - Mm. - Check this out. This is where all of the excess grounds go. - Whoa. - I know. - Where do they hide them? - And it squeezes out all the excess water. So you don't have to worry about these being like all gross. - It's- - All dried. - So dry. - Dump it out, rinse it out and you're done. Well this is the first look at the Spinn coffee maker. I'm such a huge fan of this and I cannot wait to make more coffee. One of the things to note is if you do order it now, they do have a backlog of pre-orders that they have to ship out first. So if you do order it now, you wouldn't get one until later on this year. But either way, this is so exciting and a huge step forward for making coffee at home. Thank you guys so much for watching. Let me know what you guys think of this and let me know in the comments below what your favorite type of coffee is. I will see you in the next video. Bye. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin'? If you're a fellow content creator, you're probably well aware of just how much space all your media takes up. You need a hard drive with plenty of capacity, but it also needs to be reliable and fast enough to edit off of directly. This time, we're gonna look at a drive that promises all these things. Stick around and we'll check out the G-Technology G-RAID USB. [ Music - Intro ] Right away, you can tell that this isn't an ordinary consumer-focused hard drive. The G-RAID's enclosure is made out of aluminum, and it has a really solid, heavy build. To help keep heat down, it uses an external power supply. And to deal with what heat does come from the internal drives, there's a temperature-controlled fan on the back. Even at full speed, it never gets very loud or distracting. The front panel flips down for access to the pair of hard drives inside, which are on sleds for easy removal. There's a blue LED next to each drive to show activity or status, and the G logo at the front also serves as the main power and alert light, though it is ridiculously bright. This model features a USB 3 interface, though there are versions that also offer Thunderbolt connectivity. It has a built-in RAID controller, which you configure through an application on the host computer. The drive ships configured for RAID 0, where both drives act like one and half the data is written to each. This is great for capacity and performance, but not so much for reliability. It's easy to switch the drive to RAID 1, where both drives store the same data. You'll get the best reliability this way. If one drive fails, you can keep working, though you'll also only get the capacity and speed of a single drive. The last mode the G-RAID supports is JBOD, or Just a Bunch of Disks. This actually isn't a form of RAID; it just means you get to use each drive individually. A lot of manufacturers of these external multi-drive arrays do proprietary things, like lock you down to specific models of drive. This may not matter at first, but if a drive fails later on, you may not be able to find one that the controller will work with. The G-RAID doesn't do anything like that. It worked with any drive that I installed, including one from another manufacturer. Furthermore, when configured for RAID 1 or JBOD, you're not locked down to this enclosure to access your data. As a test, I copied some files to a RAID 1 volume, then shut down the unit and connected one of the drives on its own using a USB Bridge Board. It spun up, appeared on my computer, and I was able to still access the data without a problem. Finally, the controller will automatically spin the drives down when not in use to save on power and reduce heat. Speaking of those drives, what came in my G-Raid was a pair of HGST Ultrastar 7K series. HGST actually owns G-Technology, so this makes sense. These are 7200 RPM enterprise-class drives, primarily targeted for server use and built for reliability. With this in mind, I was surprised at how relatively quiet these drives are. They're not really noticeable when they're powered up, and even when they're cranking away, they're not distracting. G-Technology certainly didn't skimp on the drives here. These are top of the line. So what about performance? I tested the G-RAID on all of its modes using the BlackMagic Disk Speed Test utility. Set to JBOD, each came in at about a 160 megabytes per second for both read and write. I then changed the drive to RAID 1 and repeated the test. It came back at about the same speeds, which is a relief because sometimes you give up a little performance this way. Finally, I tested one last time with the array set to RAID 0, and not surprisingly, the numbers were about double: 320 megabytes per second. Considering the G-RAID uses mechanical drives, these numbers look pretty solid to me, and you won't have any problem editing directly off of it, even with RAID 1 with a 4K workflow. In fact, I edited this video off of the G-RAID with no complaints. Everything here look good so far, but what about price? Well, this definitely isn't the cheapest drive array out there. Price is gonna vary based on capacity, but I paid about $500 US for the eight terabyte version, which is a pair of four terabyte drives. Other manufacturers offer systems with similar capacity for about 30% less. But the thing to keep in mind is they often use consumer-grade drives and do some proprietary tricks. The price premium here really is for those server-grade drives. HGST has an excellent track record when it comes to drive failure rates, and the G-RAID system itself comes with a three year warranty. I suppose you could just sum it up like this: If you need basic storage for your personal media, your music collection or family photos, well, there are more cost-effective solutions out there. But if you do creative work, like video editing, photography, or audio engineering, and that work demands solid performance and the best reliability, then I think you'll find the G-Technology G-RAID a very compelling option. If you like the video, I'd appreciate a thumbs-up and be sure to subscribe. That helps me out quite a bit.

    "transcript": "- Guess what, guys? It's here, the Silk White OnePlus 6 phone. I am so excited about this, you guys know that when I did my original unboxing, I told you that this was my most favorite color ever. I was gonna try to explain to you what it looks like if you haven't seen it already, but I'm just gonna open it. (mellow EDM music) Wow. So, it's crazy because it said it had, like, crushed pearls in it. Their press photos do not do it justice at all and I'm not even sure if you can see in this light, let me try to zoom in a little bit. It's got this, like, iridescent shine to it. It has sort of these rose gold accents, which I think in the photos, they looked a little bit more pink or more rose gold, but in person, it is a little bit more subtle, so it is more of, like, a lighter pink color. I do feel very speechless because this is so good looking. Like, it looks amazing. And for me to say this about a phone that's not an iPhone, it takes a lot. (laughs) So, this definitely has exceeded my expectations because I thought that it was gonna be more of, like, that sandstone finish, whereas this, it is very, very much like an actual pearl. It is smooth and it is beautiful. And now, I guess we'll open up the rest of the box, even though you already know what's in here if you've watched my previous unboxing. Charging brick, my most favorite USB cable ever. Oh, it's a nice clear case. Very thoughtful. I feel like I'm definitely gonna get dirt inside of here. Okay, I'm taking the case off. Just take another little gander at how beautiful this thing is. Instructions, SIM card ejector, always crucial. I've honestly been really loving my OnePlus phone, I've been using it as a second device since I got it. Okay, so now we're gonna be opening up these. These are the bullet, oh, I wanted to say Bullet Time headphones. They're the OnePlus Bullets Wireless. I've really never used any other wireless headphones except for AirPods before. Oh, wow, wow, whoa, wow. Oh, look at that. Look at your different colored heads. So, there's all kinds of different-sized ear pieces here, and this looks like just a little carrying case. Oh, hello. Oh, and a little, teeny cable. No way, this is great. I haven't even got to the headphones yet and I'm excited about all of the accessories. This is gonna come in way more handy than just charging these headphones. I feel like I've gone, oh, there we go. (laughs) Do these come out of there? Oops. Nope. That does not come out. Little tab. Oh, there we go, that was easy. Am I cool now? Well, that's a nice fit. Put the smaller little guys on for my teeny, tiny, little ears. Oh yeah, that's good. That's nice. Jam that right in there. And so, what makes these special is, they're magnetic. (phone dinging) Okay. (laughs) So, what makes these super special is, they're magnetic, so when they're connected together, they are not on or using power. When they're disconnected, then they're ready to use. Here's where you charge it with that little USB cable, and it looks like it's already turned on, so let's get this thing paired up. \"Your earphones will automatically turn on \"and connect to the last device \"they were paired with when you separate them.\" Yes, yes, yes, yes, I want to. Yes, okay, great. It's happening, everything is happening. This is very, very, very exciting. It's pairing, it's pairing, it's pairing, yes. Pair. Okay, we're gonna listen to some music. We're gonna listen to some Tool. If you guys are new here, they're one of my favorite bands, and the only way you can listen to them is, oh wow, this sounds so good. Okay, these sound really good, I can't actually let you hear what it sounds like, but it sounds good. And I'm listening to a low-quality rip of a Tool album on YouTube. Wowie, okay, let me listen to something on Spotify 'cause it'll be a little bit better quality. And you might be wondering, \"Justine, why are you not using \"your new OnePlus phone yet?\" Because I don't have it set up yet and everything is already set up on this one. Fear Factory? What mix is this 'cause it's really good? Machine Head, Our Lady Peace, System of a Down, this is, like, my high school. This is really uninteresting for you guys because you can't hear what I'm hearing, but I guess I could just say it sounds good. (laughs) Alright, well that's that. Let's try it out if I take these off. Whoa, wow. So, they aren't quite noise-canceling, but I'm already slightly hard-of-hearing, so when I have these types of headphones in, I really can't hear much at all. That's why I do like AirPods or headphones that don't entirely cover up all of your ear because I then can't hear anything. These are pretty awesome, I'm definitely excited to try these out a little bit more. Let's put them in their little case. Get in your home. I'm having a lovely time. (mellow EDM music) Thank you guys for watching, I hope you guys enjoyed this. I did want to show you this phone because I was so excited about it during the launch. I'll see you guys in the next video, and man, just take one more look at it. Just, can you just, can you just appreciate the beauty? I feel like I should exit to the James Blunt song. You're beautiful (laughs) There's other boxes of stuff that I've unboxed. I am a living fire hazard. (upbeat music)",

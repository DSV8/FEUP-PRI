    "transcript": "Do you know what these cables are? These are all Ethernet cables UTP Thinnet or 10Base2 Thicknet or 10Base5 these are all variations of Ethernet over the years. In previous videos I've shown you how to get a Windows 311 computer working with 10Base5. In this video I want to show you how to use a Windows 311 computer across a 10Base2 Network. So I'll connect these 2 together using a T-connector one of the cables connects to the PC one of the cables connects to a Cisco router. The Cisco router is connected to Starlink, I'll google.com-t so that it's a continuous ping and as you can see there we are able to Ping google.com if I disconnect that the Ping start to time out connect that again pings start to succeed I've been able to connect a Windows 311 computer via 10Base2 to a Cisco router which in turn connects to a Starlink router which connects me to the internet via satellite.",

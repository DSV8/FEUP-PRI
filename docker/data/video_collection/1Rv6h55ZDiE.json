    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. So I want to do a quick video on the Pixel 2 XL. This isn't a review I feel like there's a lot of really good reviews out there particularly Mrques's that's an excellent video if you haven't seen it But I wanted to touch on something that I feel is The issue surrounding this phone, which is its screen, so let's talk about a couple of the good things It's an excellent phone if you're interested in stock Android phones like this is It's everything you would imagine the Pixel 2 XL to be and maybe a little bit more because the software is so good. The one Thing that sticks out in particular for me is how good the software is on the camera. It's a single lens and the camera in general is really good But I want to focus on the big thing that is for me, the screen. now This phone if it didn't have the controversy surrounding its screen I think a lot of publications and reviewers would consider this to be the perfect Android phone because there's so much that this thing does right, but because of the screen There is I guess doubt in the consumers mind as to whether or not they should purchase it as to whether or not this is actually a good phone because the screen is such an important part of your phone experience you use your screen every time you use your Phone and a lot of people would consider it to be the most important part of a phone So there's three issues that are surrounding this screen the first is the issue of Burnin on the screen some people are noticing that just residual artifacts on their screen from the UI and this is actually a very common Issue with OLED screens, it doesn't matter what panel you're using if it's an OLED panel There is a risk of burnin this has existed since the beginning of OLED panels on phones as for my particular phone I don't have any burning yet, but it's only been used for a couple of weeks. I feel like over time It's gonna pop up and when it does I'm just gonna live with it because almost every single phone that I've used that had an OLED display has developed some kind of Artefacts over time that's just the nature of the panel's now the good thing is that Google has addressed this if kind of like Squash people's fear of this by giving two year warranties on these phones, which is crazy like I don't think there's been any other phone It could be wrong, but I don't think there is any other phone that comes with a stock warranty of two years on Hardware That's amazing so if you have issues down the line I feel like Google is going to care of it the other issue that they addressed is the washed out colors and I would agree the Pixel to excel launched with a very flat color profile and even as someone who prefers more realistic colors and just not overly saturated Stuff I still found this one a little bit dull So it's nice that Google is addressing it now the last thing want to talk about is the whole Blue shift when you tilt it, and this is obviously a real issue I think a lot of people are getting this right out of the box and Here's the thing I think it's another thing that's been kind of over sensationalized because of how good everything else on this film is people just want to find something to pick up out on this phone and the color shift is It's there, but so many phones have some kind of color shift now I think there is some variation depending on the unit that you have like there are some defective units out there Maybe that exhibit in a more Pronounced color shift when you tilt it my unit is pretty decent and when it compared to any of the flagships here So this is like a samsung s8 the v30 like they all have some degree of color shift And I wouldn't say that the pixel to excel at least not my unit is Significantly worse than the other phones not that it doesn't exist because it is present But it's not terrible or anything at least not to me Now the reason why all this matter is this total discussion about the screen being imperfect is because the price of the phone is $850, it's not cheap and at this price point I guess the consumer expects some degree of perfection, not that perfect phones exist, but they want this screen to be as good as possible and therein lies the problem With Pixel phones with Pixel hardware in general you're paying for the amazing ecosystem that the software provides. You're not paying for a top end Hardware if you're looking for the top line Hardware There's a ton of other options out there to choose from but you're not going to get that with Pixel phones So if you're purchasing this phone, make sure you're purchasing for the right reason because if you're not, if you're trying to get like amazing hardware You're in for a bad time, but if you're going for a softer ride, this is a great phone. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time.",

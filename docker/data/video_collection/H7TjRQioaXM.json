    "transcript": "in this video I'm going to show you how to install Parrot OS on a Raspberry Pi. I've got various Raspberry Pi here collected them over the years but in this example I'll show you how to install it on a Raspberry Pi 4 model B. Now rather than just showing you the installation of Parrot OS on a Raspberry Pi I'm also going to show you how to get multiple Wi-Fi adapters connected to the Raspberry Pi and use these adapters to attack a Wi-Fi network now disclaimers always this video is for educational purposes only never use bad passwords like I'm going to demonstrate in this video on your Wi-Fi networks only attack Wi-Fi networks that you own or have permission to attack this is my own Wi-Fi network I've given myself permission to attack myself so there you go I'm allowed to attack my own network because I own it and I've given myself permission to attack my own network. I'm going to show you how to use these external Wi-Fi adapters with the Raspberry Pi now in my tests with Kali Linux the built-in Wi-Fi adapter is automatically enabled depending on which version of Kali that you install when using a Raspberry Pi 4. what's great about a Raspberry Pi 4 is the built-in adapter supports monitoring and ejection mode but you have to install the correct drivers and that can be quite a bit of work. Personally I would use Kali and perhaps an older release of Kali with a Raspberry Pi if you want to use the built-in adapter or if you want to use Parrot you're going to have to install the drivers foreign to keep this video shorter it's already very long I'm going to show you how to use external Wi-Fi adapters rather than the built-in Wi-Fi adapter these have longer range and also allow you to implement other types of attacks with a Raspberry Pi than if you use a built-in adapter only. But I'll show you 2 of the most common ones that I get questions about Alpha is my preferred Wi-Fi adapter this one is very simple to use but only supports 2.4 gigahertz TP-Link a lot of people seem to use these adapters I personally don't like them but they're obviously cheaper for some people to buy and more available in certain parts of the world so I'll show you how to use this adapter this is a version 2 version 3 adapter so I'll show you how to install the drivers for these and attack a Wi-Fi network and capture the password. [Music] The first thing you need to download is the Raspberry Pi installation software you could use other software if you prefer but on the Parrot website as an example they show us that we can download the Raspberry Pi imager or etcher so I've gone to raspberrypi.com/software/ and I'm going to download the software for Windows you could download the software for macOS or Ubuntu but I'm going to download it for Windows and I'm going to open up that software I'm going to say yes to run the software and I'm going to install it it's a very simple installation I'm then going to run the Raspberry Pi imager software. Now the first thing we need to do is choose an operating system that's going to be Parrot OS second thing we need to do is choose storage okay so to download Parrot OS go to the Parrot OS website so parrotsec.org click download and we're going to download the Raspberry Pi software there are various Raspberry Pi images the one that I'm going to download is the security image and I'm going to click download and I'm going to select arm 64. Now that's quite a large file you can see the size 2.5 gig now rather than waiting for what it says here 2.6 gig to download I'm going to Simply use the software that I've already downloaded in preparation for this video so you can see there it says the actual size per Windows is 2.682 gig in size so that's the software that we're going to install now on the Parrot OS website they tell us that we need a Micro SD card of at least 8 gig in size core could be installed on 4 gig I've got a much bigger SD card here but you basically need a Micro SD card that you can install the operating system on so I'll insert that into my computer so that's been inserted now so what I can do using the Raspberry Pi imager software is select the OS I'm going to scroll down here and select custom and I'm going to select Parrot security Raspberry Pi image so that's the image that we're going to use and I'm going to choose the storage which is my micro SD card and then I'm gonna choose right. We're told that the card will be erased do we want to do this yes we do and the software will now be written to the card this is the perfect time to get a coffee or do something else while you wait for this to write while I'm waiting for that to write I want to tell you that we've created a PDF file which you can download using the link in the description that shows you all the steps to do this so if you want a reference guide I've added that below the video that basically takes you through all the steps to install the software now with the power of editing let's get this to complete very quickly and there you go installation has completed I can now remove my SD card. Okay so on my Raspberry Pi I'll take out the current SD card this is actually installed with Kali Linux and I'll put in the new SD card that's running Parrot OS before I power this up I'll connect micro HDMI I'll also connect a keyboard and mouse I'll just move these pies out of the way I'll connect a keyboard connect the mouse so those are connected now now I need power before I power it up I'm going to run OBS so that we can capture the output from the Raspberry Pi so I'll connect the power now and as you can see there it's busy powering up and on my screen we can see that it's busy booting so there you go Parrot OS is booting typical Linux boot process and we presented with a login screen on the power OS website we're told that the username is pi the password is parrot I'll log in now so I have to jump to this mountain keyboard so parrot press enter and there you go parrot is now installed on my Raspberry Pi and as you can see there we've successfully logged in to Parrot OS running on a Raspberry Pi let's do some tests so first thing I'll do is open up a terminal and type sudo Wi-Fi to see if we can run Wi-Fi on the Raspberry Pi I need to put in my password we're told there that the interface doesn't support monitor mode now this is where I prefer Kali Linux because by default it automatically works you don't have to do anything else but yeah we probably need to install drivers to get this to work so what I'll do is connect an Ethernet cable to the Raspberry Pi and let's see if we can get the drivers updated and get this working so first thing IP address we have an IP address I should be able to Ping google.com we'll have to use sudo here so sudo ping google.com so that works what I'll do is clear the screen and then type sudo apt update to update our references okay so software has been updated I'll also type sudo apt upgrade to upgrade the software so yes to install additional software [Music] this is fine okay I'll remove any unneeded software so pseudo apt Auto remove so yes okay I'll clear the screen now once again pseudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade okay so everything looks good now let's try and do pseudo Wi-Fi to see if it works this time still not working we're going to have to install the correct drivers now I can use external Wi-Fi adapters with the Raspberry Pi here are two of them Alpha network adapter here's a TP-Link network adapter I'll install the relevant drivers so that we can get these working with a Raspberry Pi and a TAC a Wi-Fi network behind me so let's start with the alpha this is one of my recommended Wi-Fi adapters very easy to use with Kali doesn't work by default in this installation of Parrot but it's very easy to install the drivers the disadvantage of this network adapter is that it only supports 2.4 gigahertz okay so I've got it connected to the Raspberry Pi I'll log in password is parrot what I'll do now is open up a terminal lsusb shows us that we have the Qualcomm Atheros or Atheros depending how you want to pronounce that Communications AR9271 802.11n network adapter however if I type iwconfig we don't see that in the output we see the built-in Wi-Fi adapter ethernet loopback but we don't see that adapter ifconfig again we only see wlan0 we don't see that network adapter so what I'll do now is connect ethernet to the Raspberry Pi so that we can update the drivers first thing I'll do is type sudo ping google.com to make sure we have ipconnectivity put in my password which is parrot as you can see there we have connectivity to Google so sudo apt update to update our references okay so references have been updated I'll clear the screen and now we can type sudo apt install firmware atheros or atheros and press enter. So hopefully that will install the drivers that we need now to recognize this network adapter and to be able to use that network adapter I'll clear the screen so iwconfig now doesn't show that so what I'll do is type sudo shutdown reboot now to reboot the Raspberry Pi [Applause] okay so login open up a terminal again iwconfig as you can see now we have wlan0 in the output make that slightly bigger you can see the interface is in manage mode and on the Wi-Fi adapter the LED has now come on so that's been recognized so I'll clear the screen and now I can type sudo wifite let's launch Wi-Fi to attack our Wi-Fi network so again I'm attacking this wi-fi network behind me Wi-Fi has started I'm going to press 2 because I want to use WLAN 1 monitor mode has been enabled on that network adapter and we can see various Wi-Fi networks. Okay so I'll stop that the one we want to attack is this TP-Link 69C0 and that has a number of six so I'm going to select six and press enter what it's going to try and do now are various attacks against the Wi-Fi network so you could let it try and do a pmk ID attack but I'm going to stop that and then I'm going to say C continue to the next attack which is a WPA handshake attack this is running WPA2 I've had comments where people complain about me using WPA but it's actually WPA2. I have connected to that network from my phone and notice it's captured the handshake and it's already cracked the network password the password for that network is spiderman. As always in demonstrations like this I'm using a simple password so that it goes quickly rather than taking hours and hours and hours may that be a warning to you don't use basic passwords like that Superman spiderman basic passwords like that including your telephone number should never be used use complex passwords on your Wi-Fi network so don't use Simple passwords like that because they're too easy to crack so if I type ls9 you can see there's a cracked Json file if I cut that you can see once again details of the Wi-Fi network including the password of the Wi-Fi network again don't use bad passwords. Okay so we've successfully attacked this wi-fi network using the alpha network adapter let's use a different network adapter so I'll unplug that and what I'll do now is plug in this TP-Link Wi-Fi adapter so I'll just use an extender here and I'll plug this in we now have a TP-Link Wi-Fi adapter connected to the Raspberry Pi so ls again shows us the crack to Json file so what I'll do is remove that so remove cracked.json I should have used sudo there so let's do that again sudo ls file is gone okay so I'll clear the screen iwconfig shows us that that adapter is not connected so what I'll do and I know the right driver is sudo apt install realtek and 8188 eus-dkms so press enter. Let's install those drivers okay so drivers have been installed iwconfig again doesn't show that so sudo shutdown restart now okay I'll log back in open up a terminal iwconfig as you can see now we've got WLAN1 currently managed mode I'll use Wi-Fi again to do the attack so sudo Wi-Fi put in my password Wi-Fi is starting we could either use the TP-Link Wi-Fi adapter it's again using this driver rtl8188 eus or we can use the built-in adapter so I'm going to choose one in this case so it's actually wlan0 rather than WLAN1 for this example and I'll start it scanning so a whole bunch of Wi-Fi networks have been picked up I'll stop that in this case the one we want to attack is number two the TP-Link network so I'll say 2 and press enter it can do a pmkid attack again but I'm going to Simply continue to capturing the handshake it actually used the previously captured handshake so let's do that again. So I'll type sudo remove cracked and I need to go into the HS directory and I'll remove that as well so sudo rm handshake let's get rid of that handshake so that's gone Json file is not there so let's try that again. So let's go through the whole process sudo wifite again it's already in monitor mode so it's scanning for networks okay what I'll do is do kill to kill any conflicting processes so stop that again okay we want to use WLAN1 in this example okay so that's better it's picked up the network already I'll press Ctrl C in this example it's going to be Network 5 the TP-Link Network so you could let it run a PM kid attack again but what I'll do is stop that and get it to continue to capturing a handshake and then I'll get my phone to connect to that Wi-Fi network I'll just jump to that Network now hopefully it'll capture the handshake from the phone to the Wi-Fi network. Okay so they capture the handshake it saved it and then it's running an attack against it and as you can see there it's already captured their handshake and cracked it again don't use bad passwords on your Wi-Fi networks. Okay so in this video I showed you an example where I used 2 external network adapters to capture Wi-Fi traffic and track the Wi-Fi passwords as always this is for educational purposes only, only attack networks that you either own or have permission to attack I once again own this little Wi-Fi network and I'm simply showing you why it's a bad idea to use passwords such as spiderman or other easy to use passwords use good passwords in your Wi-Fi network okay I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please like it please consider subscribing to my YouTube channel and clicking on the Bell to get notifications I'm David Bombal and I want to wish you all the very best [Music]",

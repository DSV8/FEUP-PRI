    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin'? This is one a lot of you have asked for, and I'm happy to oblige. Let's take a look at what's involved in installing a bivert module in a Game Boy Pocket. Does it make as big of an impact as it does with the original Game Boy? [ Music - Intro ] The whole idea behind installing the bivert module is to increase the contrast of the Game Boy's screen. In a previous video, I showed you how to install a bivert module from Hand-Held Legend in a DMG. As I'm filming this, there's no custom solution for the Game Boy Pocket, but that doesn't mean it's not possible to do. It's just a bit more involved. As with the DMG, you'll need to install a backlight. I've covered that in a previous video, which I'll link to down in the description. Of course, we need to get the Pocket taken apart. One of the first things we need to do is cut two of the traces leading to the LCD ribbon cable connector. Normally, I'd recommend desoldering the pins and lifting them. But in this case, we need 'em to stay soldered to their pads for reasons we'll get to a little later. These are the two traces to cut. Use a sharp utility or craft knife, and be really careful not to cut the traces nearby. They're pretty close together. After that, remove the logic board from the Pocket because we'll need access to both sides of it. Before you get too far into things, go ahead and rotate the polarization film on your backlight 90 degrees. This will keep the screen looking normal after the mod is done. I like Hand-Held Legend's bivert module because it's pretty easy to solder to, but the Pocket is a lot more cramped inside than the DMG is. This makes finding room for the module a bit tougher, so the best place I've found is to put it on top of the speaker. I used a piece of 3M VHB double sided tape to stick it down. This tape is really nice to use because it's strong and tough, non-conductive, but still removable. You can find it at auto parts stores and of course, online. The bulk of the work in this mod is running the wires between the right places on the logic board and the bivert module. I've seen some people use solder points on the front of the board, but I prefer to use the pads on the backside, since I think they're easier to solder to. This is why we can't lift the pins on the LCD ribbon connector. The pads they solder to are connected to two of the points on the back of the board. Here are all of the points you'll need to use, and where they connect to on the module. Go ahead and pause the video now if you need to. It's really as simple as two wires coming from the CPU and going to the module, two more wires from the module back to the LCD connector, and then power and ground. The bivert module basically intercepts the signal from the CPU, flips it, and then sends it on to the screen. You'll definitely want some thin wire for this. I used 28 gauge. There is some conveniently-placed holes on the logic board, very close to where we'll be soldering to, and you'll definitely want to take advantage of 'em. Only strip off enough of the wire's insulation as you need to. These solder pads are pretty close together, and there's a risk of shorting things out if the wiring touches pads it shouldn't. Solder the wire to the board, run it through a hole, and then around the other side and to the appropriate place on the bivert module. Be sure to press the wires flat against the board on the backside, and don't let 'em cross over each other. Otherwise, it'll be hard to close the case in the end. These solder points are a bit small, and this part of the mod is pretty fiddly. But just be patient and install the wires one at a time. You want to leave the wires a bit long. After you get 'em all soldered, drop the logic board back in the front housing so the wires can be routed properly. They need to get tucked in between the board and the housing like this. I used a spudger to help get 'em into place. We need to run the wires this way so the case will close properly, since there's not much free space inside. If you do it right, you'll end up with an organized bundle of wires like this, and you can still remove the board later for cleaning the case without having to desolder any of 'em. And, that's it! Just like with the DMG, the bivert module makes the soldering much easier than if it was just a bare chip. All that's left is to hook the backlight panel's wires back up, reconnect the ribbon cable, and put all the screws back in. The results of the mod are pretty interesting. The first thing I notice is that turning the polarizer changes the pixels from black to blue. Of course, the bivert module definitely improves the contrast of the screen. But to me, it doesn't make so much dark pixels look darker, as it does make the shades of gray more distinct. Things just look clearer after the mod. It doesn't really have quite the wow factor that is does on the DMG, and I think that's simply because the Pocket's screen is better than the DMG's to begin with. So, with all that said, is the mod worth it? I think so. While installation can be a little tedious, it's not really tricky or anything; you just need to be mindful of making clean solder joints. It's a good next step to perform after installing a backlight module. And the results, I think, well... speak for themselves. I owe a big shout-out and thank you to Hand-Held Legend for sending me the parts necessary to do this mod. I have links to the bivert module and wiring I used down in the description, if you're interested.

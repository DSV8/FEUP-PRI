    "transcript": "Your guys johnathan your iPad pro is in the house I'm excited Hopefully you are too we got the big boy, but not the thick boy because it's smaller It's also thinner but faster and better in pretty much every single way Also got the new Apple pencil in here which now charges 100% less dumb either way though, I'm not gonna lie This is probably the most excited I've ever been to run a geek bench score. I need to reconsider things for now though Apple (**Apple Pencil Falls Down**...RIP) Apple pencil off to the side. We are excited for the iPad pro guys say Apple knocked it out of the park with the wallpapers this year like that is just beautiful flipping **Twist it ... Pull it...** Box on the floor. Oh boy wow, it's so light like That's not sexy oh Okay, oh So we got the silver not the Space Gray I'm not hating that but it looks really nice so far and like this feels like futuristic like something out of what Conda So smooth. We got like vibranium just bleeding out of this guy Give me the Apple stickers. We got a SIM card tool for the cellular version Quick Start Guide. Where are the stickers pairs? We got big stickers for a big iPad those are some big-ass Apple stickers geez That is it confirm last but not least Apple is doing everything we complain about with new iPhones this year not including a USB C charger or fast charger in the box because We got both of those here USBC cable because we have USB C on this iPad pro while we're doing that though we are going to It was more satisfying than the iPad pro like that was not sexy at all, it was super like loud and just like This though that's like that classic Plastic, I'm excited for this Apple pencil no longer Do you have to stick it in and make it sit there all? Uncomfortable and awkwardly this just connects magnetically to the the iPad. It charges wirelessly You know I didn't really use the first-generation Apple pencil all that much but this feels solid and It's going to give that a was it to the side or the top to the side That clicks on real nice an apple was pretty confident Like they were shaking the thing around saying like don't worry about it It is going to stay on there very well. So we'll give it a little Shake test that's not bad It's not falling up well-done Apple Wow So there we go swipe up to get started because we do not have a home button on this iPad pro man Look at that and being well that Apple pencil is just chilling up there the whole time just out of my way Wirelessly charging so we have this little Apple pencil icon up here. So it automatically recognizes that we're going to tap connect We got this beautiful beautiful wallpaper I will save one thing. That's very apparent that is lacking on any other Apple product this year or ever is 120 Hertz pro motion display. So if you're moving it's just like flying off the screen and I gotta save this wallpaper is Beautiful so future Jonathan hopping in here I just want to take a second to appreciate what Apple did with these bezels or rather the lack thereof So comparing against the previous twelve point nine inch iPad pro what they did now is kind of mind blowing Through though like the previous iPad pros of twelve point nine inch version almost felt like silly big to the point where it looked Comical this so is the biggest iPad pro, but it doesn't feel like that at all. It's actually really really nice We are getting closer Here we go. Can we get that drumroll start and play that epic music whatever. It's gonna get the build up The results are about to come. Are you ready? Is your face ready? Is your body ready? My body's ready or is it I don't know anymore. I shouldn't be this excited for a Geekbench score like ever ever. Oh My it is not a lie 5065 on a single core score eighteen thousand and ninety nine on the multi-core score This is on an iPad like we talked about last week. People were tweeting me that hey this is Faster than my desktop PC. And yes, I realize again for the second time PC boys the LTTE masterrace It is a completely different platform different architecture I realize that but the fact that there is this much power inside of an iPad which is this thinness lights That's crazy. Now one thing to keep in mind. This is the maxed out one terabyte version So with this you get six gigabytes around as opposed to four on the lower capacity model So keep that in mind when you're picking one up, but yeah This thing is a monster a core CPU full high-powered cores paired with or high-efficiency course Then you of course have that insane seven core GPU. So Apple is claiming Xbox one s-class graphics inside this think about that Xbox 1s, which is just like So much bigger and thicker and beefier and runs off power. This thing is off of battery Apple is just like playing games right now with this iPad pro naturally from there I want to test out face ID because that is also new with this iPad pro not having a home button So one interesting aspect with face ID and what's different than the iPhone for example? It's going to work on any orientation with this iPad pro So it's actually a little bit different but let's go ahead and set that up So for the initial setup, we're going to rotate to portrait Get started So this in your face and the frame we read slowly. I used to like do it way unnecessarily complicated now I realize it's just simply moving your head first face ID scan complete move your head slowly Second completes, but that rotate swipe up and there you go works like butter so it's kind of interesting Normally, you would think that you're looking here because that's where the camera should be on an iPhone But again because it works in any orientation that camera is actually over here But it's working just as flawlessly next from that. I want to test out those speakers Those are supposed to be really good on this iPad pro. I'm gonna get a little hyped. We got some power in this thing So it's only fitting that We play a little rage Got some pretty deep bass on this like So if speakers are impressive I'm sure at this point you can barely hear me but the stereo spread here is just like Music to my ears, it's just really good So that's been the better part of about 72 hours with the new iPad pro consider this my day one review This is absolutely a completely different beast And with that I want to treat it as such and dive Way way deeper everything from a comparison to the smaller iPad pro 2 external storage to headphones both wireless and USB See the smart keyboard and definitely Finding someone who can draw just a little better than I can and putting the Apple pencil through its paces So with that if there's anything you want to see covered in the full length, in-depth feature-length iPad pro review Let me know with a comment down below and quick up either still about a week left on the iPhone 10 are give with iJustine so details that are down below and also Hint there's probably gonna be an iPad pro or MacBook Air giveaway this week with her So definitely stay tuned subscribe inter notifications on both channel so you don't miss out on those videos This is Jonathan.

    "transcript": "- Here's a quick rundown of the most common Cherry MX Mechanical Keyboard Switch types. There's three different kinds. Mainly Red switches are linear meaning they don't have a tactile bump but they don't require much force. So they're the switch of choice for FPS games so that key presses can register quickly. Brown switches on the other hand require just a bit more force and give you a little bump. So while they're not quite as fast they can confirm that you've actuated the correct key making them good for both gamers and typists. Typey types. Finally, Blue switches are quite heavy and very audibly clicky when you actuate them, a satisfying choice if you do lots of typing, but maybe don't use them in a quiet office, unless you're a D word. There are a bunch of other more exotic Cherry Switches too if you're just a massive keyboard nerd like me. So check 'em out.",

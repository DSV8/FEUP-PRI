    "transcript": "A year and a half ago, we made a video wherein a $1,000 Intel Hackintosh was bested bywhat was thenthe first Apple Silicon M1 Mac mini and I subsequently declared the future of Hack Macs all but dead. Thats certainly still true as well discuss later, but the videos title ended in a question mark and Betteridges law of headlines states that any title ending in a question mark can be answered with no. So, this is the real last hackintoshright? I call it Winters Last Whisper: a computer running macOS Ventura and an impressive one at that. It has 10Gbit Ethernet, DisplayPort passthrough via Thunderbolt enabling use of an Apple Studio Display or ProDisplay XDR, really, it does everything youd expect a real Mac to dobut betterbecause it outperforms the $4,000 M1 Ultra Mac Studio. Oh, and it does so at half the cost. [5-8 sec cool intro] Apples done releasing Intel-based Macs, but they're not done supporting them. I mean, they still currently sell an Intel machinethe Mac Pro. Time will only tell how many future versions of macOS will support x86, but Apple has set the precedent of maintaining their computers for 6-7 years. That does not mean, however, that hackintoshes will have that same long-term support. Starting with 2017 Macs, Apples [T2](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/dwslx9/comment/f7lp8fa/) coprocessor acted as a controller for disks, SMC, audio, and more. As of yet, there's been no way to bypass or emulate it and so it's possible that as soon as later this year, Hackintoshes will be stuck forever on the last supported version of macOS. But that day has not yet come and current-generation processors are supported in Ventura so we elected to use an Intel i7-13700K cooled by a Noctua DH-15 which I feel hits a great price-to-performance ratio and certainly packs a punch with 8 performance and 8 efficiency cores. What's not current gen is our GPU. In Winter's Last Whisper, we're using an AMD 6800XT. Apple added graphics support for Navi 2x in late 2021 upon the release of updated workstation cards for the Mac Pro. Which answers the question: why no current-gen card? There's still no Radeon Pro variant of the 7000-seriesand thats only variety Apple usesbut even when AMD *does* roll those cards out, there's no guarantee Apple will sell or support them. Alas, it's no matter because this card is still an excellent value and superb performerparticularly considering Apple Silicon's achilles heel has always been GPU performance. As for our other components, arguably, we went overkill: the motherboard is a Gigabyte Z690 Aero Dan ATX-sized board that's blinged out with on-board Thunderbolt, 2.5Gbit AND 10Gbit LAN, DisplayPort passthrough, a high-impedance headphone amp and more. There's 64GB of DDR5-5600 memory in addition to an 1TB Samsung 980 Pro NVMe SSD that slots into the board. All those guts fit fabulously in Fractal's handsome Torrent ATX case and an attic-mounted Corsair 1,000W 80+ Gold power supply gives the build it's first signs of life. The looks befit the price. A price that isn't cheap, but not outlandishly expensive either. We could have gone a lot more thrifty on several components, but I really wanted to match the Mac Studio spec for spec as cheaper hackintoshes often skimp on I/O, disk performance, power supply quality, and more that Apple truly does an excellent job with but seldom receives credit for. Turning a pile of PC parts into a functioning Hackintosh has become more nuanced than it used to be. A few years ago, you could download a couple of tools to auto-compile a thumb drive and using the Clover bootloader be up and running with a new hackintosh in minutes. OpenCore, the new norm and what I used for this build is *not that.* Creating a hackintosh in 2023 has a steeper learning curve and is more involved than it used to be, but it's worth it because OpenCore has a number of huge advantages: it's built with modern UEFI standards permitting better hardware compatibility (like support for AMD processors) and offering resilience against future macOS updates it's rare you can't just update your machine like any other Mac, there's way fewer crashes and hackintosh \"oddities due to strict adherence to Apple's bootloader structure and OpenCore supports FileVault and Secure Boot ensuring a safe macOS experience on a non-Mac. And while it's a little tricker to build an OpenCore installer, the post-install experience is much better and the incredible documentation doesn't just tell you how to make a hackintosh, but teaches you how and why things work arming you with knowledge you'll want should future troubleshooting become necessary. I do hope I havent scared you off because it really isnt THAT hard. You install macOS onto a USB drive, add the base OpenCore files which is as easy as dragging and dropping, and then you follow the guide to determine which drivers and kexts are needed for your given hardware. Also easy. Then, our ACPI configuration. our what? In short, ACPI is a standard that helps your computers hardware and software communicate with each other to manage power and system configurations. ACPI is the conductor of an orchestra and macOS, a system strictly designed for its hardware, freaks out when the conductor deviates from the sheet music macOS is looking. Its not a jazz musician. So, we have to use what are called description table patches to help align our musician and conductor using modified sheet music they can both understand. Using your target machine, you run a Python script called SSDTTime which dumps your ACPI information from your PCs firmware into a file that you can then automatically patch to ensure theres no conflicts between your hardware and what macOS expects. Pretty easy. So when whats the hard part? Where most people get fouled up is with the config.plist file. This is an XML document you modify that basically handles the whole boot process by making sure all those files we added are properly injected in addition to a few other things like spoofing the model of Mac were using and its corresponding serial number. Where people get stuck is through lethargy. Its really tempting to find someone who has the same or close to the same hardware as you, copy their config.plist file, and boom! Youre done. Dont do this because there are SO MANY variables at play and with a little patience, you can build a config.plist file all by yourself thats guaranteed to run on your hardware. Its not hard and the documentation walks you through the whole process. Dont cut corners. Once your config.plist is built, you can boot right into the macOS installer and the OS is none the wiser. Youre on a Mac! But were not done. Once youve finished installing the OS, there are a few steps afterwards we need to follow: for one, we need to move OpenCore to your machine so you can boot it without the USB and speaking of USB, we need to address that. macOS is limited to 15 USB ports and my board has more than that with the internal headers on the board and the IO. Additionally, macOS sucks at guessing which port is what speed and youll run into issues if you dont define that. Yet again, theres another great tool that mostly automates this for you and once youre finished with that, well, youre likely to be running a golden Hackintosh! Our build has functioning Bluetooth, WiFi, 2.5Gbit, and 10Gbit LAN. Consequentially, we can use AirDrop, Handoff, and other macOS niceties. iMessage, the App Store, and Safari all work great. Ive got functioning Thunderbolt 3 for high throughput devices and I can even pass DisplayPort over Thunderbolt using my motherboards internal header connected to my GPU. System Integrity Protection and FileVault are both enabled, audio works perfectly, its nearly a perfect Mac. Nearly. There are three weird bits about this computer: #1 I had to disable 3 USB ports at the back of the machine to come in under my 15-port limit, #2 sidecar doesnt work because theres no support for 13th gen iGPU drivers, and #3 Intels big-little core design isnt respected by macOS and the operating system believes the performance and efficiency cores to all be the same so that balance of power efficiency and performance youd get in Windows by scheduling tasks optimally is lost. Theoretically, it could even impact our systems total performance in macOS; theoretically. Practically. haha. practically this machine is insane. How insane? Well why dont we let the numbers speak for themselves? Starting with everyones favorite heavily Mac-biased benchmark, Geekbench 6, Winters Last Whisper hangs really closely to the multi-core performance of the M1 Ultra butmuch to my surpriseobliterates its single-core performance with nearly 15% faster results. In the GPU department, Geekbenchs Metal Compute test also gives the hackintosh the upper-hand by more than 30%. Moving to media tests because YouTuber, we see that in another synthetic load, Cinebench, our Hack Mac silences the M1 Studio yet again. That trend continues as we move into actual video editing applications like DaVinci Resolve and Final Cut Pro. Hilariously, we had a number of effects errors causing Final Cut to crash on Apple Siliconbugs that havent been fixed in almost a yearthe Intel hackintosh never crashed running Final Cut even once. Furthermore, we did notice general performance to be improved on the hackintosh over our M1 Max Mac Studio when scrubbing through RAW footage in all NLEs. This behavior didnt exhibit itself of course with H.265 nor ProRes footage due to the M1s native media engines, but that extra computing oomph does come in handy for formats like RED RAW. On the other hand, when running PugetBench for Adobe Premiere Pro, the hackintosh finished behind both Apple Silicon machines. Why? Well, Apple Silicons video engines are designed to encode and decode a myriad of file formats insanely quickly and clever memory swap helps write stuff to disk with incredible speed. What it lacks in raw computeneeded for, say, applying effectsis more than made up for elsewhere. Moving on from video, benchmarks in both creative and development environments give our Ventura-veneered PC the dub time and time again. But where we notice the greatest performance disparity is in a category that should be no surprise to anyone thats been paying attention to Apple Silicon: GPU performance. Running Unigine Heaven, our PC does spin its fans up a tiny bit (even with our modified fan curve), though the sound it creates a much more pleasing whooshing sound when compared to the Mac Studios shrill screams. At nearly double the performance and half the cost, things are starting to look a bit embarrassing. Moving to real-world gaming performance playing Tomb Raider on both machines, it gets worseor better, I guess, dependent on which side you find yourself. Boot that same hackintosh into Windows, load up the same title, and the machine pulls away yet again. And that really is the benefit to a hackintoshits an equally performant Windows computer with a huge catalog of games if thats your thing. Another thing that can be done super well in macOS Hacktura, Windows 11 virtualization. No need to rely on a crappy ARM variant of Windowsthis is full-hog x86 Windows if you dont want to dual-boot in between systems. I love Apple Silicon and think Apples currently making the best computers it has ever made. But I also think that theres been this weird idolization of Apple Silicon chipsthis perception that Apple is ahead in every department. Make no mistake, Apples chip design is leading the consumer industry in a lot of areas as I talked about in my recent video concerning software-defined hardwaredefinitely go check that out if you havent seen itbut Apples chips are not market leaders in raw performance and they never have been. Frankly, save for the M1 Ultra, Apple has yet to make a chip that even gets hot enough to not work in a thin-and-light laptop. Running at full tiltwith absolutely everything maxed outincluding power delivered over every single port on the M1 Ultra Mac Studioa wattage youll never even get close to in the real world, the machine pulls 215W from the wall. Compare that to our hackintosh, the CPU can draw up to 350W just by itself. When surfing the web, our hackintosh pulls more than 7X as much power from the wall as our M1 Max Mac Studio and under load, say when gaming, its more than 5.5X. In fairness, our M1 Max vastly underperforms the Hackintosh when gaming but even adjusting for watts per frame, Apple Silicon still finds itself 2.2X more efficient. But, in a home environment, what does that really matter? Because even as a heavy computer user, youre likely only to find a cost savings of $50-100 in energy annually. Itd take you nearly 30 years to pay forin energythe $2,000 premium the Mac Studio would cost you over our Hackintosh today. So then why would you ever buy a real Mac? First, smaller power draw means a smaller thermal footprint which results in a smaller computersignificantly smaller. The Mac Studio is insanely powerful for how tiny it is. Second, you dont want the hassle of building and maintaining a Hack Mac. The trope it just works isnt a trope; a real Mac just works all the time. Third, you identify a moral issue when willfully violating the macOS EULA you agreed tothat you wouldnt install the operating system on unauthorized hardware. But last, and perhaps most importantly, Apple Silicon is a clear path forward. Applications will only continue to be more and more optimized for the co-processors and specialized hardware blocks that have been designed to handle specific workloads better than general-purpose compute cores found on our Hackintosh. And when Apple does finally get around to releasing a chip that isnt designed to be hyper-efficient, or thermally constrained, no, a chip designed to scream scream it will! But until then, weve got this and this is pretty great. Let me know in the comments down below if youve recently built a hackintoshor if you plan to in the near future. Please subscribe, leave this video a like, but most importantly, stay snazzy.",

    "transcript": "today I'm going to show you how I built this all Corsair gaming setup that's clean enough for you to sterilize medical equipment with a video that was sponsored in its entirety by Corsair [Music] [Applause] [Music] so Corsair has gone ham for their sponsored video although to be fair it's not that hard the platform desks just are ham although uh you need more than just a desk for a gaming setup so there's a whole bunch of stuff over there as well but let's lick some Corsair ham first and then we'll get into the rest of it O Okay so this is like pegboard stuff giggity and I think these are um heavy to start with but they're like wings that go on the side of the desk to extend them oh oh ooh look at that that's a lovely that's a lovely desktop oh it's so heavy these are the little hangy things that you you mount stuff with and there's also a tool kit side extension tool kit cool lots of cable management and stuff the next box was filled with the desk arms and legs motorized legs that look like they come off an Olympic cyclist and in this bit I'm assuming is the desktop oh never mind it's just even more accessories there's a bunch of mounts and even more pegboards giggity and I think here is like a frame that hangs the pegboards very exciting the final box with the desktop in it must have been one of the heaviest things I've ever interacted with and getting said desktop out of the box was no mean feet oh where am I going with it oh no I eventually decided to just flatten the box and pull the desk off it which still required Herculean effort oh terrible things are happening oh this oh I'm getting sweat all on it oh no now aside from the Starship enter desktop over here we still have all of that that's going to be attached to it this is wild but I think the first thing that makes sense is to attach the legs to the desk so that we can get that upright and then start messing with the other stuff it goes like like that now what's really cool about how they lay out the tools is that they actually tell you what step all of it's involved in so here you can see that these screws are involved in step one which I'm really hoping is leg attaching step one use use M8 bolts to attach feet and legs oh I'm a genius but while trying to attach the left leg I immediately ran into a bit of a problem oh um that's not good the left and right screw holes didn't align correctly which meant I couldn't screw the leg down I then immediately reached out to Corsair whose product manager had never seen this problem before I then went online and couldn't find a single person who's complained about this issue so um I guess I'm just wildly unlucky when it comes to abnormal defects in press samples but either way this seems to be an issue that was resolved in standard production and when it comes to the one I had corer sent out a replacement but I was too excited to see the end result so I may have just edited the whole slightly on mine so with the problem resolved and our legs attached the next step is to screw down our [Music] feet in fact the next several steps involved scre bring a bunch of different exciting Cable Management stuff to the desk's undercarriage but then I got to the most terrifying step of all okay well now comes the super fun part where I have to try and flip the desk over without blowing out my rectum so um yeah let's hope that goes well okay okay that's a good start I need to remember to lift primarily with my lower back in a twisting jerking motion oh it's so un unbelievably heavy and with the desk finally upright I was really excited ooh cable routing box okay so now that we have this Majestic Beauty standing upright I guess I need to add all of the top stuff [Music] now this is a big part of what pretty much sold me on this desk setup is that you get power strips for both on the desk like this one and there's a six Port one that you can mount under the desk so you can plug all of your long-term stuff into this and then if you need to plug like I don't know soldering stations or whatever in you have easy access to more strips on the desk I love this oh there we go okay and just like that this state that we're looking at now is the base desk so this is the kind of entry point uh which is already ridiculous this is really cool I like this a lot uh but I did also get like a pegboard attachment that's going to go on the top and a little bit of extension for the desk as well I didn't realize that it was the size of a small continent so I feel like it's big enough in this form but you can always use a little bit more desk space you know so with that let's drop some more stuff on it screwing on the final accessories felt like assembling a MAO tank this thing is thick but there's a lot more to a hashtag sponsored by Corsair gaming setup than just a desk so now that we have our Mega desk in place it's time for us to assemble the rest of the setup PC peripherals a whole bunch of good stuff now in terms of the system we're building an ITX system using of course hashtag sponsored by Corsair parts and the main reason I'm using ITX is because I want as much of our near infinite desk space available as possible CPU wise I'm using the 7600 X we've seen a lot on the channel lately but it's just a really good gaming CPU I have lying around [Music] storage wise I'm going to use one of corsair's mp700 pro drives because this is a pcie Gen 5 drive with absurd read and write speeds and luckily our motherboard has a PCI Gen 5 m.2 slot so we are going to make use of a lot of that extra speed ooh that's a fun warning to get I like that they don't include a cooler out of the box so that it doesn't get in the way of the cooler that all motherboards come with these days it's a nice [Music] touch in terms of ram Corsair once again went ham with 64 gigs of 6,000 MHz ddr5 it's a lovely understated Vengeance [Music] kit so now that we have all of our yummy Corsair memory in place it's time to get some yummy Corsair Cooling in place and for this Corsair B have gone a little little bit Overkill teeny teeny little bit because to cool our 7600 X we're using this IQ h150i RGB well because our case can support it and because IQ Link cable reduction stuff will help with cable management which is often an issue in ITX systems and to save us busy Gamers a whole bunch of time the fans come pre-installed and pre- managed although I don't know if cable managed is really the correct word cuz the fans just kind of mate onto each other and then work so that's cool and what's also cool is a lot of packaging for this stuff like the the IQ link Hub is paper like that now because I know that all of this Hardware works I'm not going to preest it so I guess it's time to whip out our hashtag sponsored by Corsair case and I'm going to use this black mesh 2000d this is [Music] [Applause] [Music] nuts now another advantage of a slightly bigger ITX case is that you can fit a slightly bigger power supply in like this sf1000 L which is still a tiny power supply and is insane overkill for what we're using it for but isn't technology amazing this little thing is a th000 w power supply the rest of the build primarily involved a whole bunch of cable management which with ITX cases is always a little bit tricky but once that was done I also dropped in a butt ton of fans aside from the three fans already on the radiator ooh these tubes are so nice and flexible and like look at the complete lack of cables we have to deal with Corsair also sent over some of their RX 120 fans which is a more affordable entry into the IQ ecosystem and the coolest thing about these fans aside from how easy IQ link makes it to integrate with the aiio but they also have a new fan screw design which takes like one rotation to fully Mount which if you've ever mounted like any other fan you'll know is like magic and then finally I did run into a bit of an issue getting the graphics card into the case with the radiator already mounted apparently its girth needs to be accommodated after the radiator so I did have to remove the aiio to put put the graphics card in and then Mount the radiator again just standard ITX things and with the system complete I hooked up this Corsair Zenon OLED gaming monitor to the desk's Vasa arm before checking out some more [Music] peripherals now when it comes to the peripherals I'm really excited because Corsair recently launched something called custom lab which lets you personalize your peripherals you just go onto the custom lab site choose a peripheral and then you can mix and match a bunch of designs on various bits of that peripheral just to make it look a bit more unique you know and if you really put your mind to it you can design some real out there stuff I can't remember what designs I went with ooh yeah I remember now with some Sakura on it look at that oh so creative with my m75 here I went with a black and white shoulder buttons oh it's real out there now this uh K65 plus I'm super excited about because it's a tkl keyboard but with a volume wheel and it's wireless and look at that for the keyboard I decided to match the mouse pad with some Sakura key caps oo classy instead of just like a smooth potentiometer it's a stepped attenuator I like that it's like all clicky and with the peripheral set up I just just had some finishing touches to add to the setup like this 4kx external capture card Corsair sent over for later capture duties and then before I get into some cable management which is one of my favorite things in the world to do I do want to see if this system worked first oh yes there we go I feel like for this distance you kind of need a 32in monitor this it it feels a little small in the middle of the vastness of this desk Corsair also sent over some Nano leaf for lighting around the setup I ended up having it kind of grow out of the side of the desk so that I could hide its power cable hey things are linting up there we go o they make quite a lot of light and then finally I just had to do some pegging before unveiling the setup [Music] at the end of the day I think the hashtag sponsored by Corsair setup turned out super well gaming on it's great with the miles of clutter-free desk space there's just something so clean looking about all Wireless peripherals now I've been cable managing in various stages cuz it's not something I'm very good at but I'm slowly refining it and it's it's getting better and the desk does offer a lot of tools for that the monitor is obviously spec spectacular cuz it's a 27in OLED gaming display so super Snappy gaming and in terms of the systems performance not only were we getting Immaculate temperatures cuz of that massive radiator but with our 7700 XT running cyberpunk at 1440p high settings we were getting over 80 frames per second and generally the frame pacing was ruler flat giving us a gaming experience that feels smooth as a baby's bottom and with that thank you very much corser for sponsoring this video it's wild what a variety of products they make thank you for watching and until the next video bye-bye

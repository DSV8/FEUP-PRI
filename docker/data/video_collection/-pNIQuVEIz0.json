In this video we take a closer look at this card, its specifications and potential performance.     CORRECTION:  Our chart showed the GTX 1070 to have the GP106 core.  This was a typing error.  As mention in the video, it actually uses the same GP104 core from the 1070 Ti / 1080.

    "transcript": "so guys I know what the ton of this video says but I want to sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk about the RTX 2080 and the RTX 2080 ti launch don't worry I will talk about the RTXs 2070 a little bit later around the video but I want to dial back a few days or I just want down back and talk about this particular launch that took place a few days ago now that day was certainly interesting for us here at Hardware Canucks and to be honest with you we really appreciate your feedback both positive and negative in fact smart folks say that people learn from criticisms rather than compliments and everyone here the team takes them to heart so about the RT X 2080 and the RTX 2080 ti video we still stand by our results and conclusions 100% but but before you start going crazy all over the comments we realized that there's still more room for information and additional perspectives now there's been a lot of questions from our audience about how well the custom GTX 1080 ti cards from board partners stack up to the RTX 2080 it actually got me and the rest of the team wondering if moving outside the founders edition spec would change the results well we're gonna find out but not with something like the gtx 1080 ti Strix OC or ZOTAC amp Edition GPU since both of those cost even more than the RTX 2080 founders Edition on new egg and Amazon right now they also represent the absolute highest pre overclocked spec of a previous generation design and using those would just serve to stack the deck both positively and negatively so what we did is order a more affordable custom and prio o'clock EVGA GTX 1080 ti that will be compared against the RT X 2080 it will be interesting to see how the two cards stack up when both have downdraft coolers anyways that's the end of this public message you spoke we listened and as usual we really appreciate your feedback so now on to the RTX 2070 and to be honest I think it's gonna have a tough time competing against last gen card so let's dive into that right after this the new master keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a comfortable magnetic rest rest beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter and perky lighting control with a variety of Cherry MX switches and the bottom type-c connection cooler master doing it right check it out below okay so back when Nvidia first announced the RTX 2080 ti and the RTX 2080 there was another little surprise the RTX 2070 this is actually the first time that there were three different GPUs at 20 different price points that were announced and it showed in video was ready to replace their entire high-end GP lineup not only that but they were replacing them with products that are much much more expensive that's a pretty big problem since it automatically sets expectations based on what looks like inflated prices rather than the merits of the GPUs themselves let's quickly go through the RTX 2070 specifications since they will set the stage for the rest of this video this is what Nvidia is calling their tu 106 core and right away people will make an association with the GP 106 core that was used in the GTX 1060 back then the GTX 1070 and 1070 ti I used a cut-down GP 104 core from the GTX 1080 but this time around Nvidia decided to build a brand new design for the RTX 2070 in this case it means that the RTX 2070 will get a fully enabled tu 106 core with 2,300 for cuda cores 140 for textual units 64 ro PS and a 256-bit wide memory bus in many ways this looks like a gtx 2080 core that simply been cut in half but with memory controllers l3 cache and ROP s remaining intact for the bigger GPU I can't say this for certain but it looks like the main reason Nvidia designed a new chip for the RTX 2070 was power efficiency instead of needing to use the power-hungry 215 watt tu-104 as a baseline the standard RTX 2070 will consume about 175 watts okay so before again to the specs of the baseline RTX 2070 GPU I do want to mention that you should take pricing on these GPS with a huge bucket of salt because with the RTX 2080 and the RT X 28 ETI the pricing on those GPUs just make me feel frustrated and currently with the pricing I mean you really can't pick up those GPS at the starting price that Nvidia is claiming which is definitely frustrating and disappointing so you know while the RTX 2070 is supposed to start at $500 I'm gonna call BS on that because I don't think you'll be able to pick a GPU at that price during launch in October and honestly I would hope I hope to be proven wrong but with the current state of RTX pricing eight it really makes me feel angry and like I said my original review you are paying for a bunch of promises that are supposed to happen sometime in the near future but there is no guarantee to that so here are the specs that I've been talking about and on paper at least it looks like nvidia is keeping a good separation between the RTX 2070 ti the 2080 and the 2080 TI with between $200 and $300 gap between them you can also see that despite having less course the RTX 2070 keeps the 256 bit 8 gigabyte memory interface which may be a key point for 4k gameplay whether or not it will have enough physical processing course to backup that interface is another matter though now if we end the GTX 1080 and the gtx 1070 series you can see where this RTX 2070 may get into a bit of trouble while the gtx 1080 launched around $550 most custom and pre overclocked board partner versions currently go for 480 to 510 dollars meanwhile it has more cores more texture units and faster clock speeds than the identically priced RTX 2070 and again I'm saying identically price because I'm certain it'll almost be impossible to find a $500 RTX 2070 on launch day what will probably be even more interesting to see is how this new card lines up against the north gtx 1070 TI for its current price of between 420 and 460 that card is an absolute beast in benchmarks so here's a bigger potential problem the RTX 2070 founders edition costs another hundred dollars or 20% on top of the finer dollars in videos asking us to pay let me say that again my friends the RTX 2070 founders Edition is $600 now maybe this card will surprises with its performance but I think we can actually see what the challenge of adding RTX features looks like in cards that are supposed to be more affordable those features at die space and doesn't increase production cost for the whole lineup I also have to wonder at what point does adding RT and tensor functionality to lower end course like the T 106 become a matter of diminishing which at some point in time I'm sure there just won't be enough of those specialized course on a chip to properly process ai and ray-tracing I'd also like to mention that we've entered an acht I'm in the GPU market because people really don't care about the dye size or the transistor counts what they did see is the current or the new line up costing significantly higher than previous generations specifically the founders Edition GPUs and what's really interesting is I guess the bigger problem to this whole launch is that even though the 20 or the 2000 series offer impressive performance at 4k it just doesn't promise or it doesn't deliver the RTX features that they do claim to be so like I said my original view you are paying for something that just is not reality and if NVIDIA fails to promise or if they fail to deliver RTX is true potential then then there's gonna be hell to pay so the RTX 2070 founders edition is a much shorter card than the RTX 2080 series but it still has the downdraft style cooler in this case everything looks shrunken down to a smaller scale there's still plenty of high-end finishing and a glowing GeForce logo just like those other cards I think this one looks pretty good and that doesn't mean it's worth the hundred dollar premium one major difference is the location of the power connector on this example even though the card is shorter which could make it an eventual solution for small form-factor systems and medium made the weird decision to put it around the back that just adds to its length and limits compatibility so I think it's a very odd move from Nvidia there's another missing element on this backplate and I'll give you five seconds to figure out what it is all right so time's up and if you know the answer well here it is there's no env link connector to pass an SLI signal between two graphics cards that's because the Tia 106 core doesn't support multi card configurations now you may be able to use DX twelves explicit multi-gpu technology in some instances but that's just a workaround and it doesn't cut to the heart of this problem this could be another big miss for NVIDIA in my opinion with every generation it seems like the ability to multiply cards gets constrained just a bit more with Pascal it was a gtx 1060 but now it's the 2070 what's next now I'm sure the number of people actually using s lie on gtx 1070 cards wasn't huge but the option was still there and not having it on a $600 GPU just feels wrong treat your ears with the incredibly comfortable HD 5/8 X Jubilee headphones from mass drop and some Heiser delivering sound expected from $500 headphones but only for a hundred fifty bucks making it one of the best price to performance scans available check out and join the drop-down below so there you guys have it everything that you need to know before the RTX 2070 benchmarks are revealed sometime in October and now do yourself a favor and don't fall into this hole pre-order phenomenon thinking with this particular card because if I were you I would wait for reviews and better yet if you don't need a cutting-edge card for 4k then I would wait until 2019 to see if those RTX promises are actually kept because for a card like this there's bound to be some performance sacrifices somewhere I'm also pretty concerned about what we've seen from the RTX 2070 so far since out of all the RTX series cards its founders Edition pricing seems the most out of whack the 2080 was expensive while the 2080 Tiye is hideously expensive but this card looks like it's forcing up the cost of the popular mainstream market come review time and video may have a tough time convincing us that 80 106 base GPU is worth $600 but you never know miracles do happen but hopefully this quick preview will prevent you from making any rash decisions on pre-ordering before that time comes a me bar with hurricane X thank you so much for watching stay tuned for the full performance run down between the custom gtx 1080 ti that we ordered from EVGA and of course we put it up against the RTX 2080 founders Edition and of course we will do a lot of our TX content specifically comparing you know custom bored partner cars with the gtx 1080 ti with the RTX 2080 and we will give you guys the full analysis when it comes to temperatures and all that kind of stuff so there's a lot of content hitting or coming your way so again stay tuned for that I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

    "transcript": "- Am I being stunned? Whoa, there's so many police, what's happening? Oh my gosh. I'ma die. I'ma die. I'ma die. Wake up, samurai. It's time to kick ass and unbox video games. And I'm all out of-- Look. A video game. This is Cyberpunk 2077. You've probably never heard of it. It's a tiny game made by an independent Polish studio, but some people seem to be pretty excited about it. We got our hands on it a couple days after launch, as the perfect cap to 2020, things being hard to get at launch, it seems to be appropriate. And so today we're going to unbox it, we're going to play it a little bit, I'm going to give you my first impressions on everything inside this box. So this collector's edition is 249 American. It's big. And bigger is always better. Just like that one slider I chose when I was creating my character. You know what slider I'm talking about. (chuckles) We got a description of the game, Cyberpunk, it's punk in cyber times, which is 2077. And then a description of all the things on the box, but I'm not going to show you that, because I want it to be a surprise, samurai. (chuckles) I'm having fun. We're having fun here. Wow, what a box. Boxes in boxes and boxes in boxes. So inside, we got this big styrofoam and then this kind of pullout thing. This is kind of a cool experience. Whoa. Oh, it feels kind of like I'm pulling out a secret item from a cryo-container or something. That's pretty neat for a box. Whoever designed this box, y'all did a real good job. Cyberpunk 2077. I'm guessing like this. Oh, Ooh. Okay, that's a lot of stuff to show. Well, this is pretty cool. It looks like it's the signature of everyone that worked on this game at CD Projekt RED. If you don't know, CD Projekt RED is actually a pretty cool company. They're a Polish studio that founded Good Old Games. And they've kind of had a meteoric rise from Witcher 1 to Witcher 3, which is a huge game. And now Cyberpunk, which is one of the biggest games of the year, maybe of the last a couple of years. Yeah, if you guys haven't tried Good Old Games, it's actually my kind of preferred place to buy games, when I can. There's the steel box version of the game on the inside. I'm going to unbox this, but a little bit later, 'cause there's actually a lot of stuff in here, which is pretty cool. I saw on Twitter, someone unboxed this and I was like, Huh, that's pretty neat. But let's go to the more collector-y stuff. This is gorgeous. I really love the style of this game. I think that's one thing they nailed, is the aesthetic. Games have been trying to replicate Cyberpunk look for so long, but I think this is the first game where the technical side and the ambition kind of actually were able to follow it up. This art book is a real book. Like when I unboxed the last game, Last of Us, which happened to win game of the year this week, because, I think, of my unboxing. I'm just going to call it, The David Bless Me. Anyways, this is an awesome art book. This is really high quality. Like it's thick, you can see on the camera, but it feels like when you would buy at, I guess it's called Indigo now, for 40 bucks. And you would put on your living room table, look at it twice, and then let it get into the pile of other books that you never look at. Man, the art is so good in this game. Nice little touch. It's a little police evidence bag. And Night City Police Department. Oh, is this the comic book? What does it say on here? Detective Bureau, Haywood Station. It's collected by Detective River Ward. That's cool. That's nice little touches. And I think that's something that CD Projekt RED does really well, is they take the time to add the little touches. In the side quests, in the box, having a little bit of a story on the package of the promotional pack and that's pretty cool. Meat Grinder, Night City, the city of broken dreams. Oh, that's cool. It's a visitor's guide to Night City, scratched out with nomads. So it's like a visitor's guide, that's been scratched as if it was a nomad, which is one of the life paths you can take in the game, which is kind of the outsider, living in the desert, outside of the city. That's kind of a neat touch. Yeah, neat touch. I'm not going to read this. You're not here to watch me read. Oh, okay. Here's the steel box. Wow, this is art is so sick. Oh, man, I love the style that they've gone for in this game. So this is just the outside of the steel box and it's kind of got a graffiti look on top of a wall. And there's actually a difference in texture, which is nice. I don't know if it was intentional or if it was just the paint or whatever they use, the finish on here, but it looks good. What are these? Oh, it's just stickers. That's nice, stickers. I'm not a huge sticker guy, but I know some people are, so it's kind of cool to have just a whole lot of stuff. (chuckles) Corporate Wars, The Musical, I would pay to see that. That's great. That's the kind of stuff I like. This one. That feels empty. Ooh, patches. I like patches more, that's kind of cool. So this is, I think it's the band of Johnny Silverhand, who's the character that Keanu Reeves plays in the game. I won't go too far into it. I don't want to get into-- And if you haven't watched any of the trailers, you might not know that Keanu Reeves is in the game so, oops. No, you know, everybody knows Keanu Reeves is in the game. It's kind of a big deal. But the patches are Samurai, which is his band. A Night City patch, that's pretty cool. I like those colors, the pink and blue, I think that looks good with kind of the yellow accent. Ooh, this feels like there's something in here. Pins! Again, I prefer pins to stickers. So this might go on a backpack or something. The Night City Heat. I'm guessing that's a sports team. I don't know, I haven't gotten there yet. I haven't done a side mission with that. Militech is the military corporation in the game, you'll come across it. I'm guessing everything is tied to the game. I just haven't made it that far yet to be able to tell you. Wow, that's hefty. That's heavy. It's not like a hot wheel. It's like solid metal all the way through. And that's one of the Supercars in the game. All right, let's go back to the big box. So it's a styrofoam box. I'm pretty excited to find out what's in here. But before we do that, let's talk about our sponsor, MANSCAPED. MANSCAPED hooked us up with their new performance package kit, which comes with a ton of stuff, just like this box. Like their new Lawnmower Waterproof Trimmer with advanced SkinSafe technology, which helps reduce nicks and cuts. Their Crop Preserver Ball Deodorant, The Weed Wacker nose and ear hair trimmer, and their new Sheers 2.0 Luxury Nail Kit, all that stuff to customize yourself in real life. Head to manscaped.com/CIRCUIT and get 20% off plus free international shipping today. Plus you'll get their Shed Travel Bag and a pair of their anti chafing boxer briefs, available for a limited time. I'm wearing them right now. It's not true actually, but I do wear them and they're very comfortable. (singing) Oh my gosh! It's a happy meal toy. No, it's a really nice statue. This is really cool. I'm surprised I have to put it together, I mean, this is huge. And just like The Last of Us 2 statue that I unboxed, it's real detailed. And this is cool. I really like that this is a dynamic scene. This guy's got a little cover for his gun on his back, even though it's still bent a little bit. That's V, but I mean, part of the appeal of the early part of this game, is you can customize your character to be anything you want. So this is a promotional V. Probably not exactly what your V looks like. My V looks nothing like this. And there's also a female V or a non-binary V that you can be. This is like the world's most basic puzzle and I'm still having trouble with it. That's really cool. This looks pretty incredible. I like how dynamic it feels. It's really capturing really intense motion, even though it's a statue. Just for comparison, because I really like this one, and I think the details are excellent. And I'd say, some of the textures are a little bit better on the Last of Us one. The blood paint that's hand painted on the chest or the head, but it's kind of a boring scene. What's up, Linus. - [Linus] Just wanna look at this. - Come look at it. Tell me what you think. - [Linus] Yeah, they did a great job with that. - Yeah it looks really good. - [Linus] Really feels like he's in motion. - Yep. This is a great statue. If you like statues, I would have no shame in putting this up. It looks great. I bet like if you lit it right, too, it'd be insane. Get some cyberpunk colors in the back. There it is. Over 200 awards, even before it comes out. That's my favorite thing on video games, is when they're like, Winner of E3 most anticipated title, or even lesser meaningful titles. When you peel back the sleeve, there is the box. And then this kind of art-- The world companion, that's kinda cool. This reminds me of like an old school manual and this is the kind of stuff I feel like CD Projekt RED does really well. It's like they understand what people want. They want a manual where they can open it up, and there's a little bit of world-building. I think that's a really cool idea. That being said, we have trailers and stuff, and most of us have kind of watched a lot of this stuff, but this is neat. Telling you about your life path and kind of understanding what fixers are. That's a cool idea. I think that's, again, a neat little touch that goes to just make this feel like a sweet product. So we've got postcards with some more art. Like I said, I think there's art's really excellent. It's the kind of stuff that, if I had a high quality print, I wouldn't feel bad at all about putting it up. All right. And then that brings us to the actual case. So, it includes a code. I'm not going to scratch it off here. So yeah, even if you have the physical copy, you're going to have to tie it to a GOG account. That's fair, that's just pretty normal. I don't think you can have games that don't install to a launcher anymore. Oh, this is the soundtrack. I'm really enjoying the soundtrack. I mean, the story stuff is really good, the kind of more cinematic stuff, but there's also, just like GTA, a radio station, so you can choose your genre. And right now I'm really feeling the John station, I can't remember, something blues, and it totally changes the vibe when you're driving through the city, when you have smooth jazz playing, it's sick. More stickers, eh? That's pretty cool. Include a map of the game. It's fairly detailed, you can see all the streets. Like they said in their pre-release stuff, this isn't the biggest open world they've ever done, but it's certainly the densest. If you drive through a street, you'll see there's roads over going, there's walkways over going, and there's apartments everywhere. And I mean, I haven't gone everywhere, but it feels like you can go anywhere, do anything. And it's really fun just to head in a direction and do stuff. And there'll be markers constantly popping up on the map, but there's also just, you'll be driving, you hear gunshots, and you could pop out, join the fight. You can do anything. You can-- It feels so dynamic, and I think if they succeeded at doing one thing, it's bringing Night City to life. Anyways, we've talked about the game enough. Why don't we boot it up? Playing in 1440 P because, ha, a 1080 Ti trying to get 4K, 60 out of this game, ah, that's not gonna happen. What we kind of decided was the best setting, was the ray trace medium. So it's everything on high or ultra, except some of the ray trace options. It still looks really good. I'm going to turn on DLSS to quality, 'cause DLSS is great, it really helps performance, and it still looks really, really good. So if you don't know, Cyberpunk's open-world RPG. It's got a lot of a flavor of like the Deus Ex series, kind of a little bit of GTA and kind of certainly its own identity. And so, like GTA, you're going to be running around doing crimes in an open world city. You can steal cars, go anywhere. But more like Deus Ex, everything's more dense. You can kind of interact with everything. It feels kinda like one of the hub cities in Deus Ex, but stretched out to a full world. And, man, it's incredible. We can get off here. Let's go just, I dunno. I dunno where I am right now. Let's get out of this car, can I? Oh, frame rate. Oh, 25. So that kind of brings me into one of my first complaints of this game. I actually think that it's mechanically a pretty solid game, but when you play games in first person, just like VR, I think you kind of need it to be a smoother experience. Playing first person shooters, at 30 FPS, is kind of a bad time. And when I play competitive shooters, I turn all the settings down to absolute minimum, so I can get my 200 frames a second, so I'm used to things being really smooth. And 60 frames, it's totally acceptable, but I find, in gunfights, when it drops, it just makes it feel less snappy, less good. Yo, I'ma fight you. Do I have a gun? Oh, there's a lot of police. Oh no, I'm not gonna fight 'em. Oh my God, what's up with the scanner? (chuckles) Why, what am I doing? Oh, here we go. Am I being stunned? Whoa, there's so many police, what's happening. Oh my gosh. I'ma die. I'ma die. I'ma die. This is the best part of good open-world games is just you don't even need to dig a mission, you can just mess around. I remember hanging out with friends playing GTA, like probably Vice City or San Andres, and you would just take turns watching each other, just going around and you just randomly-- Yo, that dude just spawned outta nowhere, that's not fair. Police can't keep spawning. That's not fair. Whoa! Okay, that's not a glitch. That's actually used as an elite-- Whoa, I have four stars. I've never had four stars. This is awesome. So as you can tell, I enjoy this game. I think it's pretty fun. There's obviously lots of issues. On the technical side, the console versions are kinda sad. If you have a base PS4 or a base Xbox One, it's kind of meme worthy. It all goes to make this game, even though it's been delayed multiple times, feel a little bit rushed. It feels like it could have used a little bit more time or a little bit more focus. And I wonder if they considered launching just on PC first, 'cause on PC, it's incredible. It's not cheap, and when you're playing HDR, and you go into a dimly lit area and the reflections are bouncing off the floor, through the smoke, and the reflections look different on the different surfaces, it's really feels next gen in a way, like no game currently does. It's definitely the Crysis of 2020. This is a great showcase of ray tracing. Obviously, we've had it for two generations of video hardware now, but this is the first game where I feel like my 1080 Ti really doesn't cut it anymore. I feel like I need a 3080, a 3090. If you have the system to run this game, if you have a high end PC, you should be playing this game. You're probably already playing this game. This is one of the biggest hits of the year. If you're on console, it seems like it's a mixed bag. If you have one of the next, or the mid gen refreshes, it seems like it's acceptable. It's kinda dipping below 30. It's currently pretty good. But if you have a next gen console, it's cool that it runs well, but it's a shame they didn't release it with a next gen version. And so I would say, just wait. Wait for it to be fixed. Wait for it to be smoother. You don't really want to play this game and not have the wow moments. I think that that adds a lot to the experiences. The feeling of being in a real city. And when you take away the technical side and you really struggle at like sub 720 P resolutions, and it just looks like a blurry mess, it's missing one of its pillar elements. And I think that's how I would describe this game, is it has a bunch of pillars, and some of them are better than others, stronger than others, but overall, the pillar is going to work together to lift this game into something really cool and really special. Good job CD Projekt RED, I'm super into it. I hope that you can continue to work on the game, get all the bugs fixed. I mean, there's a lot of issues. Yesterday, I was driving through the city and every couple of frames, my character would T pose above the car and then kind of go back in the car. There's tons of issues, but they'll work it out. But overall, I would say this collector's edition is worth collecting. I thank you for collecting this video in your collection. By liking it and subscribing to Short Circuit, like a samurai, samurai.",

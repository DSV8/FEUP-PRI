    "transcript": "This here is another viewer's broken gaming pc and apparently this one does not power on at all so this build is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of presentation not that that really matters in the grand scheme of things with the system not powering on at all it's just one massive paperweight so who cares about how it looks but there are some components in here that look to be a bit older or at least a bit dirtier we're missing one of the fans for the 240mm radiator up top i just noticed that that's um that's a big no-no and there are a couple other fans that are very very dirty but then we've got you know like this EVGA RTX 3060 ti4 the one three here this looks to be pretty clean and obviously these are very difficult to get a hold of especially for a decent price in this current market so it's possible that as this viewer was changing things out looks like maybe he upgraded the graphics card he might have miswired something this could come down to user error and if that's the case should be an easy fix but it could be something much worse if you're not getting power at all not only could it be a potential miswiring or failure to wire something up but it could also be something much more expensive like a power supply could be a short on the motherboard could be a number of things we're going to find out what exactly it is in this video stay with me mercury by stream elements is a dynamic tool for youtube that'll help you better engage your audience so you've got tools like dynamic video descriptions where you can add polls recent subs and member alerts but the real kicker is that they update in real time so that's an extra layer of interaction between your audience and an otherwise static and rather boring video description you've also got tools like shout out studio which allows users to create gorgeous shout out videos for fans of the channel in only a few minutes they've also integrated patreon for those who use it and if you're into tipping there's even a tool for that mercury also includes super useful charts and metrics for content creators to better gauge video interest with a much cleaner and easier to use layout than vanilla youtube analytics if you ask me you can track subscriber growth and member growth as well as direct engagement with the comment section and like button it's something i think every serious youtuber big or small should consider as a means to more readily interact with fans but don't just take my word for it check out mercury by stream elements for free that's right it doesn't cost a dime via our sponsor link in the video description below so for those who are new to the fixer flop playlist the goal here is simple we attempt to fix owner systems in and around the Orlando Florida area but the caveat is we do it for free we don't charge them a dime so long as they're okay with this taking on their systems for a few days at the most usually it doesn't take longer than a day or two and also so long as they're okay with us filming the process we can monetize these videos so that's where i make my money i don't need to roll over any of that cost to the owners and at the same time they're also being gracious enough to allow me to film with their systems for a few days so i think it's a worthy exchange so we're gonna need to move one of these fans definitely back up to the top radiator here because it doesn't make sense to have just one when you have all the space for another cooling performance will be drastically affected by that ask me how i know we've ran those tests just because we're kind of crazy there are a few cable management concerns i want to take care of but all that needs to come after we figure out what's wrong with the system so with all that out of the way let's begin the troubleshooting process by attempting to power the system on now this shouldn't work according to the owner but we need to try this anyway we need to make sure that what the owner is describing as a symptom is what we can actually replicate here in the studio because if we get something else showing up maybe the system powers on but we're getting a picture out that's a different issue than what was described so it's possible something else might have happened in the transportation process in between the viewer dropping it off me bringing it to the office or what have you so we need to narrow that down first so with everything plugged in flip the switch at the rear the power supply let's push the power button uh everything turns on i don't know why the last two episodes i feel like people told me that their systems refused to power on at all but this is definitely on and it looks like it should be posting but i have a pretty good feeling that's not going to happen that's why it's here now i've checked all vital connections 8 pin eps 24 pin the 2a pin supplemental pcie power all of that looks good we'll check on the power supply side here in a second but i do want to do one quick thing and only because this has come up in previous episodes you gotta clear the cmos it takes two seconds you should do it just to rule out the possibility of it being something very simple and in this case it very well could come down to clearing the seamless because it looks like everything's functioning just not getting a picture out so in order to do that we've got the system let's see system is on well at least the power at the rear is now we're gonna flip the switch off and we're just gonna hold these two pins together we're going to jump them with a screwdriver and there we go should be good now let's try powering on this time seeing if we get a picture a few moments later that's so weird everything looks like it's working still no picture out these fans take a while to kick in i think they're being controlled by a commander pro or something at the back but no picture out is no picture out that's no good this builds otherwise a paperweight so we need to figure out what is causing that now notice this motherboard doesn't have a doctor debug screen or really any led that i can find that indicates the status of the system or individual components so i connected a speaker here to the speaker port at the bottom of the board and i'm still not getting anything so i don't think this motherboard knows that something's wrong and that's just going to complicate the process a bit more so at this point since we're not getting any other indication from the motherboard or elsewhere that anything is wrong and we're also not getting picture out i'm going to start narrowing my focus in first on the graphics card we're going to try a different card first and then we'll try a different slot and see if we can narrow it down between either this being a card issue which would be pretty awful uh or a motherboard issue in the sense that maybe we're not getting a proper maybe if there's some software conflict between the card that's connected and the pci generation that's running or something like that i've seen that before so we need to narrow that down what we're going to do is swap this 3060 ti with a good old gt710 out goes one and in goes another here we go and now we're going to give it another go with the gt710 installed let's connect the hdmi cable here at the rear if this works then that i'm afraid is very bad news for his 3060 ti we'll do a bit more digging so power on uh well keep forgetting that i haven't connected the power cable already what do we have here kind of hoping this doesn't work for the sake of the viewer because um you never want to hear the most expensive component in your build is the thing that's preventing your build from actually functioning uh but i don't think this is fixing it which means this this is a huh it's kind of weird i wonder if he's got an incompatible bios but it's a b550 motherboard so we need to see what kind of cpu's got in here because i'm not actually sure this is a ryzen five 3600 okay so there's really no reason why this cpu shouldn't be working natively with the b550 board that's in here um as far as i know there's no bios that would eliminate zen 2 support uh so i mean i guess while we have the cpu out we should just go ahead and swap it with one that we know works just to just to rule it out but i don't think the cpu itself is bad so i've got moon ryzen 5 3600 here i know this one works i've just tested it and we're going to swap this one in wow no way no it's a dead cpu i really didn't see that coming this happened so rarely maybe uh maybe we're missing a few pins or something let's take a closer look i'm not seeing anything obvious here with the pins at the back of the cpu i'm not sure if the camera is going to get a side shot yeah it's going to be kind of all over the place but every pin is where it should be no bent pins no missing pins it's very rare that a cpu is the first thing to die usually it's a motherboard of the power supply because this just kind of sits in there so unless it's overvolted or something crazy um yeah it won't be the first thing to go by the way the only reason this screen is showing with the new cpu that i put in there is because i disconnected all the SATA drives i really unplugged everything except for the 24 pin the eight pin and i think there's a couple SATA connections still at the back of the system but uh otherwise yeah that's why i can't find a drive because i disconnected them and with his graphics card back in the rig that's the 360 ti remember we're still getting a picture so that tells me that the graphics card is not at fault for what we were seeing earlier i i'm obviously i think it's the cpu because the only thing we changed was the chip apart from uh disconnecting a few things that are really not pertinent to a post so what we're going to do next is attempt to get a post with his old cpu in a platform that i know works so we're going to try another b550 motherboard if i have one i might have a b450 board but it should have an updated bios so this setup here is pretty primitive but i know everything works this b450 board does have an updated bios we'll confirm that we'll run with a 3600 x here in a second i've got a single stick of DDR4 that i know works and we've got that GT710 that we just used in his rig i've got a little cooler attached and uh just a 450 watt power supply the one actually the one that i always use as well in the fixture fault playlist it's good to be consistent it won't be consistent because there are really no surprises there shouldn't be any surprises if you're using the same components over and over with which to troubleshoot so let's power this thing on and see if we get a post flip the switch at the rear and let's see power pins here we go power it on we got the one fan so that does tell us that it's on we actually have rgbs as well on the right side of the board so it's turned on but uh are we gonna get a post that's that's the big question if we do get a post then it's possible he might have just like i don't know improperly seated the cpu very rare very hard to do with am4 but um i'm sure it's happened a few times i don't feel like we're gonna get a post though i i think his his cpu is is bricked and it could have been from a number of things uh okay okay so cpu is not dead all right that caught me off guard uh so let's go ahead and swap it back in yeah like i was just saying i guess it could come down to mounting pressure uh maybe the way that the aio block was installed maybe there was just too much pressure on one side of the cpu maybe there's more pressure on the bottom side so some of the top pins weren't making contact right with the socket itself that could be one of the reasons why we weren't getting a post before and why the motherboard was kind of tripping out not really knowing what to do so all right let's we don't even need to test the 3600x i have here let's go ahead and swap his 3600 back into his rig literally the only thing i am changing in this process is the cpu i am not touching anything else i want to be sure that we can get this working with his original chip so we'll remove mine we'll reinsert his it's kind of weird doing this sideways and then we'll get some fresh thermal paste for him so let's give it a shot jump the pins and across our fingers i have no reason to doubt that this will work now especially since we just confirmed that it worked in another blur another board another platform so i'm hoping i'm gonna be so confused if we don't get one come on give me a post give me a post two thousand years later there's no way i i don't understand this at all identical cpus identical they're both 3600s one of them posts with this board and one of them doesn't but both of them post on a different board this is so weird i've never seen this before i don't i don't know what else to say so i tried a few things off camera just in a desperate attempt to understand why the heck we're getting a post with one 3600 but not another yet both 3600s have been confirmed working in yet another b450 board so i have no idea what's going on here i tried multiple bios's i used the q flash plus function at the back of this board this is the b550 elite gigabyte auris board and none of those biases i tried worked so uh yeah that's not the solution eureka i figured it out and this took some tinkering off camera i wish i had filmed it all live because my reactions i'm sure would have been priceless so my 3600 is in his rig and it works just fine right we get we post and we get to the the windows loading screen and that's great so this system for all intents and purposes is fixed but we still need to take care of cable management because it's it's pretty bad and we will give it a light cleaning as well because some of these components are rather dusty now as for his cpu i was still struggling to understand why we were getting a post with my 3600 but not with his and i realized that there was one other variable i was forgetting so if you notice in his rig he has two ddr4 modules spaced out appropriately to run in dual channel slots a2 and b2 your two channels are a and b ryzen supports dual channels at least these desktop skus do and that's recommended for ryzen but in my yeah my test rig i only had a single ddr4 module installed and i did this just to keep things simple but this means that the cpu is only operating off of a single channel of memory that is not again optimal for this platform but i didn't really think about the fact that that is a pretty substantial difference between this test rig and his now you're thinking okay well greg what does it really matter i mean you know like at the end of the day it's just ddr4 well what matters is the fact that the channels are controlled by the cpu so in this config here with a single dimm in slot a2 you can see that his 3600 post no problems at all we're in the bios now and i'm assuming that if we had an operating system installed on a drive and that was connected to the board we could boot into the operating system without a hitch the only downside is that we're not running dual channel which obviously benefits especially Ryzen in this case but i'm going to keep the camera running and all i'm going to do is turn the system off i'm going to drain the power just to be on the safe side okay and then we're going to swap this module from slot a2 to slot b2 now i'm not adding an extra dim we're just sticking with a single module here i'm just changing where it is connected to the cp or how it's connected to the cpu so instead of the a channel we're connected to the cpu via the b channel we're going to turn the system back on nothing nothing's coming up in fact the cpu in this case the cpu fan is not spinning this is a slightly different behavior than what we are experiencing in his rig but we get nothing he has his 3600 here has a dead memory channel that's why it wasn't posting in his rig but it was posting here because i only had a single stick and it just happened to be installed into the channel that was still functioning so regardless of the type of ddr4 module used whether it be a fast kit with tight timings or a slow kit with pretty loose timings it's going to come down to where the memory is installed i could put one module here in slot a2 and then i could put another module in slot a1 this is kind of cringy sorry i'm trying to do this with one hand so i can put another module here squeeze it in there there we go right so now we still have well in this case it'd be 32 gigs of ddr4 16 a piece and the system would post i'll show you that right now and there we go so that's 32 gigs now so we're actually detecting both dimms the system is posting but we can't again utilize channel b so the moment we put any module in either of the b channels so the two rightmost slots the system is toast it will not turn on or we'll turn on but it won't post because i believe the channel that that b channel in the 3600 here is dead so with that fiasco out of the way i'm still kind of caught off guard by the fact that a random memory channel died in a ryzen 5 3600 i've only seen that one other time personally that wasn't an intel cpu that is um that's very unfortunate but at the end of the day you could have still used the cpu if you had just moved one of these modules over uh out of the b channel then your system would have been fully functional again apart from maybe a small fps drop i think that in day to day tasks you wouldn't have noticed much of a performance hit at all ryzen though is more sensitive to those kinds of things all we need to do now is clean up the cable management because it's pretty um it's pretty bad we need to fix the aio positioning as well i think we're going to move the radiator to the front because i realized later that he couldn't add a second fan because it's being impeded by his memory kit so we're gonna move this to the front swapping things around and then we'll clean it up uh just a bit we're not gonna deep clean it but we'll clean it up um you know to make it look better than it does now and then we'll be good to go here we go foreign and well here we are a much cleaner system and perhaps more importantly a fully functioning system again we replaced his 3600 with one that doesn't have a dead memory channel and everything is a back to working order so that's uh that's good news uh we actually took care of a lot in this video we figured out more specifically what was wrong with his cpu very rare that this stuff happens but it does happen and you should be aware of the signs and symptoms how to test for it if you happen to run into a similar scenario and that's ultimately the goal of this playlist not only to help viewers in around the orlando florida area but also to educate those who might be in similar boats as this viewer the boat is looking so much cleaner now it was not deep clean but you can see i was you know i gave it a pretty thorough scrub outside we relocated his radiator to the front and the pump is still sufficiently below the barb so i'm not worried about air making its way into the pump over time i hear a little bit of gargle but i think that this cooler from corsair has been filled appropriately so i don't expect there'll be long-term functional issues with this aio i always get people complaining about that they see they see one video and then they take it totally out of context or they misinterpret what the creator says and we have a video that straightens a lot of that out in the video description if you want to check it out now it's time to email the owner and tell them the good news if you guys have friends or family members or maybe yourself maybe you have a system that is not working anymore and it appears like it's a hardware issue especially send me an email it's greg salazarstudios.org it's also in the video description uh send some photos of your rig the specs of your rig and tell me uh in a detailed fashion what is going on and i will see if i can fix it you have to be local though don't try to ship me your system or any of that stuff need to be local i don't deal with shipping i don't want to touch it because i've been burned more than once and i don't want to get caught up in a logistical fiasco with fedex or ups or whoever you happen to send it with maybe i send it back to you and it's destroyed but you didn't want insurance but you're still accusing me of brett you know it's just like it's it's it's a mess so i hope you enjoyed this fixture flop episode we only have a few more of the season then we're gonna start stockpiling for season two but uh look hopefully you learned something from this one and if you didn't maybe you were at least entertained and if so mission accomplished if you wanna leave a comment down below i would appreciate that if you are not subscribed get

    "transcript": "well hello good people and we just got back from the UPS tour and we have something very exciting that it showed up it actually might be my dream monitor I'm really excited for this I'm super excited Mike what do we got so this is the XG438 we originally covered this at CES it's actually pouring rain right now so that's not a good thing precinct to HDR 43 inch 120 hz 4k not curved so let's get this thing inside before it pours rain on us and see what's up so we have the monitor set up Michael how're you liking it so far there was a couple of challenges it looks beautiful right now we're just of course updating a couple things on Steam Eva has an issue about where I have my pieces yeah guys Chicka seven he has his printer on the right side and he's facing his back panel the PC on the left side guys come on like this is insane anyways let's check this monitor out the first a quick message from our sponsor with long battery life and NVIDIA MX 150 GPU and Intel Core i7 processor in a compact design the Razer Blade stealth 13 is a great companion for users on the go if you want more gaming power hook it up to the core X EGP you would support for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs the Razer Blade stealth + the core X the ultimate power couple alright guys so I know that Mike mentioned aspects really quickly in the beginning this video but let's actually go over what we're dealing with because this ROG xg438q is one of the craziest monitors we've ever seen so far so it features a 43 inch flat but not curved 120 Hz 10 bit 4k panel which is almost the same size as a small TV and that does cause some space limitations now asus has also equipped this monitor with AMD's freesync 2 HDR and basis HDR 600 now even though that this monitor covers 90% of the dcpip to a color spectrum which is the minimum for HDR 600 they decided to go with a VA panel instead of IPs and for all that specs you're looking at around $1,100 us which makes this one of the most expensive freesync monitors around so other than the size the first thing that jumped out was the back it's all about the rog look but entirely made up of plastic but the stand is well designed with three legs instead of four so it can be pushed super far back to your desk and trust me guys that's exactly what you want to do just note that it doesn't support any height adjustment or pivoting and only a small amount of angle changes moving on to the connectors they're actually hidden behind a removable panel that also acts as a cable routing channel so pulling it back shows one DisplayPort 1.2 through hdmi 2.0 connectors and two USB 3.0 ports as well as a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack oh and there's also this little attachable projector that displays the ROG logo on your desk it can be controlled and turned off in the menu so no worries if you don't like that look asus has also included a remote but no batteries guys yep $8,000 monitor with the remote and they couldn't include batteries so with that out of the way I'm gonna invite Mike over here to share his experience after using this monitor for more than a week so it's it's been an amazing experience and at the same time I have found some very serious limitations and those limitations have absolutely nothing to do with how powerful your GPU is but rather its ability to accept input signals so in order for me to show you that we're gonna have to step over to the monitor so let's get to it this is the best possible image quality settings that you could probably have on this monitor the reason for that is both the HDMI and the display port connectors have a limited bandwidth so you can't really drive 4k 120 Hz at 10-bit color you have to make some sacrifices somewhere so right now we're at 60 Hertz 10 bit color and full RGB but in order to actually bring it to 120 Hertz you have to go down to 8 bit the amount of difference between 120 Hertz 10 bit and 8 bit isn't actually that much so if you're gaming this is totally acceptable on the other hand if you want 120 Hertz but a 10 bit there's where the problem comes in you would actually have to do is select the 4 to 2 chromatic subsampling what that ends up doing it causes even bigger problems all of the text now has this odd halo around it in in am over a purple so I know some of you guys are gonna be asking why on the freesync to HDR monitor who are you using the Nvidia control panel now that was just because my personal system has the NVIDIA GPU in it right now we also use the AMD control panel and the settings are exactly the same so 10 bit and 4 to 2 everything else you can set that there to now about free sync to HDR personally I think it's more of a marketing point than something that's going to be worth while right now there's very few games that support sher they're supposed to be more that are coming out but personally I don't see much of a difference in most games in Mass Effect absolutely this this monitor looks amazing now there's another big burning question that a lot of people have had is the flat-screen monitor or the curved monitor better and I'm gonna say after using both neither is better some people like the flat aspect of it some people like occur that aspect of something like the predator x34 yeah either way there is no wrong answer I personally like the flat monitor better speaking of panels this is a VA panel and not an IPS displays and I know that might throw some people off especially for a thousand bucks but to be honest guys it was perfectly fine I mean just all you need to make sure is that you're at a proper distance and sitting since you're sitting right in front of the display it's really not a big deal and if you think about this like 4k at 120 Hz if you had IPS on top of that it's gonna cost you at least 2 grand or a little more than $1,000 for sure and you know the g-sync ultimate panels are definitely proof of that I also want to quickly talk about backlit bleed I was barely able to notice anything with my naked eye I had to crank up the ISO on my camera to actually properly see that so it's really not a huge thing to consider or worry about but one issue we both noticed is with the dynamic dimming feature which is basically a Souza's version of a local dimming this is supposed to help improve contrast ratios but with it enabled there's a vertical halo around your cursor during darker scenes honestly it was never really apparent in games but Mike first noticed it when watching a movie like a lot of large format displays this RG monitor also includes a picture and picture and picture by picture setting for productivity this is definitely a plus and I really have to appreciate that Asus allows you to modify these second pictures the location lastly if you do want a base amount this monitor that is an option so with all that being said let's move on to some firsthand gaming impressions why don't we I think we should let's go so I really like this monitor but there's a couple of limitations so let's get to the limitations first right now I'm just way too close I need to be another half arm length distance away what that causes right now I'm constantly especially for me I I love strategy games and it's what I predominantly play I'm constantly looking into the upper right-hand corner to see my minimap and bottom left-hand corner to see my special skills in in battlefleet gothic 2 for example one other thing that you're probably gonna see is something I've had an issue with too is the fact that a lot of the UI doesn't scale well in these strategy games to 4k other than that the sharpness is their viewing angles are exactly what I would want but one of the other issues that I've seen now is because I'm so close to the monitor I'm actually getting some headaches and some of you guys on Twitter mention that I might burn my retinas out and you know what it might actually be happening so what I want to know is what Eber thinks about all this so I'm in the hot seat sitting in front of the 43 inch monitor and guys the one thing and I wanna just mention is just how sharp the image looks especially on 43 inches 4k looks absolutely gorgeous I'm playing over once right now BOTS match to be honest because I don't want to get distracted while having this conversation with you guys the next thing I want to talk about is color reproduction and it's good certainly not IPS level great but honestly for FPS gaming it's perfectly fine as you're just you know shooting enemy it's perfectly just fine view angles are also definitely respectable it's like I said for an average gamer you're not going to notice a huge impact from contrast shift and whatnot it's just perfect and lastly I want to talk about the refresh rate 120 Hertz first of all you need to capable hardware to drive 4k at 120 Hz but when you have that sorted it's absolutely gorgeous just the response time is fast it's it's amazing so I guess this ultimately comes down to two questions one is this your dream monitor not right now the reason for that is I didn't properly prepare my space for it so I couldn't fully enjoy it I'm just too close to it and you really need to be aware of the spatial constraints before actually purchasing something like this Flynn desk the other thing is my perfect monitor from a size perspective is probably a 30 to 32 inch high refresh rate 4k monitor I used to have a samsung 3:05 t it was an allege Neri monitor and I'm looking for something like that and I'll be really honest with everybody I don't like curved monitors it's just a personal preference if you like cruise monitors that's it's great but I guess I will ask you the same question is this a dream monitor for you not really because I personally have a 32 inch 4k display and 43 inch it's a little bit too big for me I would love to see a 4k display with that refresh rate with g-sync IPS that would be amazing but I still thought if it's g-sync you're gonna be paying 2,000 bucks for yeah it's gonna be expensive speaking of expensive is this our G monitor worth $1,100 I think it will be once AMD releases higher-end GPUs right now it's a bleeding shame that you can't properly get that hundred and twenty Hertz over 120 frames per second consistently from what AMD has on the market at 4k exactly but in the grand scheme of things also I think that the $1,100 is certainly worth it if you're looking for a large format non curved 4k high refresh rate gaming one yeah and provided you actually have the space sorted out let us know what you guys think about the ROG XG438q I can't believe I actually remember I know yeah that's amazing so would you actually consider picking this up considering the price and of course it's trade-offs given that it has a be a panel Lupton your thoughts",

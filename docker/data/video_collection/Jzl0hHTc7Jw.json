    "transcript": "- Seven years ago, we set out to perfect the form factor most people turn to when they want to get things done, the laptop. Like when you wanna get right into your creative flow, it's effortless to open, and Windows Hello recognizes you for a quick login. And you can work the way you want, whether it's using the responsive touchscreen or the large glass track pad. And you get a typing experience that's accurate, comfortable, and quiet, with each key optimized for an exact balance of travel and responsiveness. In the size or color that suits you, including our newest edition, sage. Now built on the latest Intel Evo platform, it's up to 50% more powerful than the previous generation. And with Thunderbolt 4, you can transfer data faster than ever and set up the perfect workspace with two 4K monitors. And all this performance is optimized for power efficiency so you get all-day battery life, up to 18 hours, and Fast Charge gets you back to 9 hours of battery life in just 30 minutes. And all this comes together on our stunning new, 3x2 Pixelsense display Dolby Vision IQ ensures the best possible picture in any lighting with richer details and sharper contrast. The speakers are perfectly tuned, and with Dolby Atmos 3D Spatial Processing, you'll feel immersed in your audio. With Windows 11 and the HD camera, you get true-to-life video that automatically adjusts exposure for any lighting environment. And the front-facing studio microphones capture your voice perfectly. - Since it's release last year, you've told us that you love Windows 11 more than any other version. And now I have the privilege of showing you even more. Windows 11 now includes system-wide live captions from any form of audio content. So you can see it instantly transcribed on the screen. Voice Access, which allows you to control your PC using only your voice, and natural voices for narrator, creating more pleasant sounding audio to assist in navigating, reading, browsing the web, and interacting with apps. To help you look and sound your best, we're introducing Windows Studio Camera and Audio Effects enabled by advanced AI on new NPU devices. Microsoft Presenter Plus, features quick and natural interaction with Teams. So you can easily advance your slides and mute or unmute with the push of a button. And the audio doc simplifies your physical desk setup by having one combined accessory for docking to monitors, a premium speaker and a clear microphone array. Today I am excited to announce that we're making it easier than ever for customers to access their iPhone photos and the entertainment they love from Apple on their Xbox and Windows devices. We start by bringing iCloud photo integration into the Windows 11 Photos app. The Apple TV app is already on Xbox and starting today, Apple Music will be available as well. We're thrilled to announce that Apple Music and the Apple TV app will launch on Windows next year. - It gets even better with Surface Pro 9. Every single part of Surface Pro 9 is meticulously crafted with highest grade aluminum to achieve beautiful anodized colors. With our iconic kickstand, built right into the device. With precisely tuned back lit keys and precision track pad you can work from anywhere. The system is engineered with the latest and most powerful 12th gen processor built on the Intel Evo platform. With Thunderbolt connectors, you can set up two 4K monitors for a powerful desktop setup. This 13 inch pixel sense display is stunning. And when I detach the keyboard and bring this beautiful display closer, Windows 11 adapts with larger icon spacing in the task bar. Pen itself has a micro actuator inside, so you get subtle friction as you write, and the display is fused with optical bonding so the ink flows out from the very tip of your pen. Good notes, one of the most loved note taking apps in the world today is coming soon on Windows. The front facing camera is centered so you're not looking off to the side. The field of view is widened and designed at the perfect angle, so you and others are always in view. We designed the microphones and speakers to face directly towards you by carefully creating openings through the display. And today we're introducing Surface Pro 9 with 5G. Built on the new Microsoft SQ3 processor, powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon, and up to 19 hours of battery life. - The new Surface Pro 9 with 5G has the most powerful NPU ever built for Windows. All that computational power drives Surface Pro 9 and Windows Studio Effects. We're gonna switch to the Pro 9 camera. The image produced by this new camera is absolutely beautiful, and the new portrait blur emulates the wide aperture optical effect of a professional DSLR camera. With auto framing built right in, the burden of trying to stay in the shot is now no more. As the camera zooms in we simultaneously de-pixel the image using our innovative super resolution algorithm right in the auto frame. - With the latest generation of our pioneering eye contact feature, we can stay engaged, maintaining natural eye to eye contact. - They wouldn't let me bring my leaf blower in here, so I brought my hair dryer instead. And with voice focus turned on, you can't hear it. - But what's mind boggling is the Surface Pro 9 with 5G, all these effects run concurrently and continuously in real time on each video frame while consuming just a few watts of power. It's built right into Windows and with just a click of a button, you can use it on any of your favorite video or audio apps or even on the web. All this magic happens while leaving your CPU and GPU unburdened, so your application tasks can run smoother and faster. - So I want to talk to you about one more product. The New Surface Studio 2 plus, we've redesigned it with the Intel i7 quad core processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060, it is five times more powerful than the original Surface Studio. It's got three thunderbolt ports. One of the things that everyone had asked for. 13 and a half million pixels. So they light up for you, they just light up for you. 4K resolution, there's over a billion colors. The color depth is DCI-P3, for those of you who are fans, new Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, the sound is gorgeous, but ultimately just look at this, how simple it is. You'll see it expand, but then when I start launching apps watch how it comes to life. So I'll open my Twitter page, just gonna grab it. Use the windowing mechanism here. Four 14 inch displays, four apps at once and only, only here with this screen with Windows on the New Surface Studio. I wanna introduce you to a new product called, Microsoft Designer is a very cool product, it's a new graphic design app in Microsoft 365. It's, it is powered by Best in Class AI, including DALLE 2. It automatically helps you get a variety of unique images and designs that are generated just for you. I'm uploading an image, the original Surface prototype. Now designer has suggested potential layouts I can choose from and I'm gonna use DALLE. You can do this yourself. You can see that DALLEs working now, searching, generating an image based on the exact description that I typed. You can customize, get exactly what you want with words, including color, font or size options. Now, Designer does the heavy lifting for you here, creates a custom image based on your idea. Now I can post directly from Designer to my LinkedIn or Instagram account, which is super cool. I love the hashtag recommendations too. We don't believe technology of this type at any single point should be limited to a single app. That's why we're also bringing these Microsoft creator tools, including DALLE 2 integration into Bing and Edge with the new Bing Image Creator. Now, you can use your words not just to search, but to create. This is coming soon. The next wave of computing is here right now and we've created it for you. (uplifting music)",

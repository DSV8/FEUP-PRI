    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we are checking out one of the brand new cameras by DJI, this is the Osmo Pocket and this thing is so tiny and so awesome. I cannot wait to unbox it. Spoiler alert: I actually already opened it up to look at it 'cause I couldn't wait to film the video. I tried to package it up very nicely to make it look like I didn't open it. Just keep that in mind. You may be familiar with DJI, they have the Osmo Mobiles, which you can put your phones in. They're also famous for their steady camera line, which are the Ronins, and the new Ronin-S which I also reviewed previously on my channel and I love the Ronin. I just shot a really fun video with it. And while I absolutely love the Ronin, and the shots that you can get with it, it's heavy, it's big. It's not something that is compact like this. So I am super excited to check this out. This is also 4K, you can shoot it 60 frames a second. It connects directly to your phone. This camera looks very similar to what is on one of the Mavic drones. It's one of the things that I think is so important about film-making or just taking photos or anything in general, is if there is something that is small and compact that you can always have with you, that's what's most important. I can't lug around my Ronin at all times, but this is something that I actually could keep in my pocket. Great name, guys, great name. Alright, let's open this up. I'm gonna use one of my new knives that I got. The brand is James. They're based out of Portland, I believe. Comes with this cute little cloth, even comes in this nice little wooden box. (snap) Alright, James, are you ready for your first cut? Also something that's cool is in the box, it says right here, this is so cool, It says \"first cut.\" This'll be my first cut. Osmo Mobile. Wow. Like I sliced through the box, actually. So I did just take a peak in here, so I didn't completely ruin it. This is the little case, and here is the camera, itself. It's crazy because it's really small but it has a significant weight to it. Like it's not heavy, but it just feels substantial. So it doesn't feel like you're not holding anything. It's probably because of the battery. So with a one hour charge, you can reach a 90% battery level. You can shoot for two hours on 4K and 140 minutes if you're shooting in 1080p. This also has some intelligent features which we're very used to with DJI products, like active track, face track, panorama, time lapse, motion lapse, HDR photos. This also has an LCD. There's a micro SD card slot. You've got some buttons to record and select. There's a little adaptor that you can put here, depending upon what type of phone you have. So if you have a USB C, Micro USB or a Lightning, that is inside of here. So I should probably open this up. (piece falling) So that was probably the thing that I needed. It was. So this slides in just like so. They even thought of everything. If you're gonna keep your adaptor on, that's nice. So another thing that's interesting is this now uses an all new app. It's called DJI Mimo. So let's turn this on. (dramatic inhale) No SD card. Hi. Oh my gosh this is so small. Basically the drone camera but on a gimbal. This is also touch screen. A lot of things that I can do on here. So I'm gonna plug this into my phone. This is crazy. It just It just turned on. It just worked. Now that we've unboxed, let's take it out and test it out. Oh this is gonna be so fun. I should probably get an SD card. Today we are off on adventure. We're in Big Bear and right now you may see behind me, we have a Ford Raptor for the week. Alright, we're taking this thing into the desert. But first, gotta get some coffee. (upbeat music) Time to test out the Osmo Pocket. This thing's so cool. First thing I'm gonna test out is a pano. Which is kind of cool because usually when you're doing a pano, you have to move the camera around, but you don't. You just hit the pano button, the gimbal adjusts itself and it moves and gets you a perfect pano shot. Also want to test out shooting 60 frames a second, so let's see what that looks like. (electronic music) So this will shoot 4K, 30 frames and 60 frames a second, but I love shooting in 60 frames because it does look really smooth, and then you can slow that down 50% and then you can get some nice slow-mo footage. And it'll still be in 4K. I'm into it. Are you into it, Ed? - I'm very into it. - What's really great is the audio is actually pretty good, too. And as you can see, we got that Raptor in the background. This thing is so much fun to drive. (upbeat music) So I'm now testing out the 30 frames a second. I'm gonna climb up this little rock here and then I want to try out the time lapse and see what that looks like. Kay, I'm gonna flip the camera, ready? Flip. (walking) (wind) Hey, Jen. Kay, so I'm trying out the tracking right now, it's kind of cool because it'll basically, if I move, it tracks my face. Yes, so here we are. - [Ed] It's got you. It's got, yeah. - Still got me. - Yeah. Perfectly centered. - Look at this. I may have confused it on that one. - [Ed] I think you maybe hit the gimbal limit. - I might have. - [Jenna] Whatev just do a new pose. - No, it still has me. - Oh wow, yeah. - It's still got me. God, this is incredible. (Ed laughs) I mean this is honestly game changing. - It's actually really cool. - Now I'm gonna give you guys an example of the story modes. This is cool because it'll automatically make you like this short little clip of a movie. It'll show you certain time lengths, so like 2.5 seconds, 3.9 and then you fill in those little blanks with some shot, and it'll automatically cut those clips into a little movie. So, let's try it out. (upbeat music) Our little movie turned out so good. I'm saving it. I'm surprised. - Yeah it looks good. - That's so cool. (fast electronic music) So far, I'm extremely impressed with this thing. And I honestly don't want to ever leave home without it. Like the audio was good, the video quality's incredible, the fact that you can track yourself. If you get one of those little lav mics that record SD cards, I know Jonathan always uses those, I'm gonna have to ask him what those are, 'cause they're really cool. You could basically be doing like a whole entire shoot with this setup. You also need another phone so that you can film the other phone but that's a Justine problem. (upbeat music) Did the time lapse. Probably should have done a smaller movement, longer time lapse, because this is all we got. It's super short. I mean it looks cool. There are so many possibilities for this, it's like, I'm extremely excited about it. (upbeat rock music) I am here now, officially, pretty much in the middle of nowhere. We don't have any reception, we've also got the super 73 bikes. I mean this is so much fun, like I'm so overwhelmed. (soothing music) Stuck Mixed emotions Do you know I'm not immune to try (drone) Well, flying a drone off of a Ford Raptor. Goals. (guitar music) Smile Smile Smile Smile Smile Smile Smile Smile What is this the Johnson Valley Desert? - Johnson Valley Motor Recreation Open Area. - It's beautiful but I'm getting a hyper lapse right now with the Mavic Pro 2 and then I'm gonna put up Zoom, and get some cool Zoom shots of the Raptor. This has been so fun. - This is insane. - It's unbelievable. (digital music) There was another pano option that I didn't even see until right now. So it'll take nine different photos, so there's three on the top, three in the middle and three on the bottom. (upbeat music) I just can't stop talking about how cool it is. Let's carry on. Look at my setup. I'm into it. Put an Amazon link for this tripod in the description below. (upbeat music) We are off on another hike. Man, I am so in love with this little Osmo. Like, this thing is, I keep saying that it's game-changing but it really is, because you can do anything with just a phone and this. I mean you can do anything with a phone but this just gives you this whole added bonus. Like I'm moving around and it's following me. Like, it's still tracking me. (leaves crunching) Are you dizzy? I'm dizzy. (upbeat music)",

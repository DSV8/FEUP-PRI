Samsung claims the S7 can survive 1-hour submerged, I decided to test that claim. Is this the best Android phone available? Is this the longest Galaxy S7 submersion on YouTube?

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video, and today I'm doing an experiment Well, we are doing an experiment together, collectively. This is the new S7 Edge. The objective here today is to dunk it, give it a little bath, let it go for a swim. As you know, this new model along with the standard S7 now features a water resistant build. I believe the official line is somewhere in the neighborhood of an hour submerged. Well, an hour is just not all that entertaining and, who knows? maybe... your whole house gets flooded, you get hit by that tsunami and your phone ends up underwater a little longer. Let's find out exactly how robust this water resistance is. Let's dunk this baby for many, many hours. I'm gonna dunk it over night. I'm gonna pop it in this little jar right here when I get back into the studio tomorrow, we'll see what happened. This is Science. I wanna know the truth when does it die? or does it die at all? Okie Dokie. What do we have here? We've obviously gone to the extreme here and we recorded the entire event so we can find out what exactly went down, I'm gonna pull this out it looks to me... Oooooooow.... huh! (in excitement) Wow... that baby is working right now. Look at this, working perfectly. So this has been in water from 7pm last night until 12 noon. I didn't expect it to survive that long and it looks like it's done quite a bit better than that. You can drop it in your toilet ...and leave it there overnight. Later guys!",

    "transcript": "- Did I switch to the creaky chair? What's up, guys? Lew here with another video and today I'm checking out probably the coolest iPhone camera cases that I've ever seen. These are legitimately professional looking. They have a dedicated shutter button and a huge array of lens add-ons and various grips. This might be the most advanced way you could shoot photos with that smartphone, in this case, the iPhone6 or 6S. It is from a company called bitplay. It's called the Snap!Pro Professional Camera Case. Plus, I've got a bunch of lenses over here to try out. There's the case itself as well as an extended grip. Similar set up here. In this case, though, you're adding a leather strap as well as a wooden grip. Look at that thing! And you guys know, my relationship with wood. You can see how you can install your phone. Physical shutter button. Two types of grips so it's easy to hold it in portrait mode or landscape. Tripod compatible, so there is a tripod mount. Up to six lenses you can add to this. And, of course, with the thumb rest, a firmer grip, which the ladies tell me is very important. So, this is a quick and easy way to kind of upgrade your social photography, let's say. Stuff that you intend on sharing immediately and, of course, it's very easy to do on an iPhone and less easy to do on a dedicated camera. Look at that guy! Jack, look at that guy! Now, you put that baby in there and you feel like you're the real deal for a minute. Instant real deal. A single lens but two functionalities. So, it does wide angle or macro. And it feels pretty solid, actually. So, this is the front and back cap here. If you take the standard black grip, you're going to get a tripod mount included on there. See that, Jack? The fancy wooden one does not have that. So, you've got to make a call there. A standard strap and then the hot-shot leather strap for the boss players, you know who you are. It looks like it's just simply two screws on the backside here. Oooh, so natural. Organic. I even kind of like their little mini screwdriver here. I can think of other uses for it on other devices. We're in business, now! The wide-angle, as I said it's versatile because you can actually flick the front, spin it, and turn it into a macro lens as well. Now, the thumb part, slides in here. Cool, alright. So, that's optional. Okay, so, we're going to go down and then snap it in. Oh, now, the thumb grip goes in. Oh, yes, wow, I really underestimated the importance of a thumb grip! Tiny bit concerned that it might slide out. Let's see here. Oh, there...yeah! Well, let's open a camera app here. Oh yeah, we are totally wide-angling it right now. Whoa, very wide. Oh, how about this little speaker from the last video. You can see how much bigger the field of view is here. Pull that part off, now it becomes a macro lens. Whoa! We're talking like tiny little fibers on that speaker. Wow, look, we're right inside that micro USB there. It's kind of important to mention that you're other buttons are still available to you. You've still got access to your hold switch, volume up, volume down. Oh, wow, the mechanism they have here is actually lifting up on that when I press here because the iPhone maps the shutter to the volume down. Tell me if you see it move. That's how they navigated the fact that the volume down is the way you have a physical shutter button on the iPhone. They sent a bunch of other lens adapters as well. Look at that. They're all in the frame. (laughter) Perfect. Listen, I like wide angles. We're talking, this is a wide angle. You see me, wide-angle. It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a wide-angle lens. Polarizer is going to cut down on reflections if you're shooting out in bright light against reflective surfaces. Full-frame fish eye. Substantially more distorted, fish eye-type situation. Fish eye plus macro. Ultra-wide plus macro and then a telephoto. This is zoom. What do we have here? Three-times zoom. Let's try this one out. Decent chunk of glass there. The zoom lens and if I go ahead and unscrew it, being very careful, that's without the zoom. Wide angle, see, that's your standard iPhone field of view. You can imagine, being at an event, taking these cool photos, videos using these adapters that other people with iPhones can't and sharing it immediately. So, now, you're a reporter now. You're April O'Neil. If you don't know who that is, get your Google out. Ninja Turtles. FTW. Don't ever grow up, Jack. - (Voiceover) Hello, you've reached Lesley. Can I get your ten digit telephone number, please? - Uh, I, you know what? I got the wrong number. - (Voiceover) Ok. - I apologize, sorry.",

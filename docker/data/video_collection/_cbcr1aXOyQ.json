    "transcript": "everything just works everything just works oh man how great would it be to have RTX and DXR features on gtx cards well it looks like with a simple driver update it is now we're gonna turn it on together and video RTX real time ray tracing and so let's test the gtx performance with ray tracing and DXR features I have some GTX cards some RTX cards my open bench is ready to go let's begin all right so what does it mean for existing GTX users now that you can enable ray tracing and experience those visuals and a nice hit on performance - just like the rest of the rtx owners but I feel like this approach has multi-layered consequence so it's better for developers now that they can use gtx hardware instead of rtx hardware and experiment with ray tracing implementation and the optimization for gamers you can now just experience the visuals so see what it's like to have ray tracing in-game you know be a five Metro Exodus and shadow of the Tomb Raider and potentially will this nudge you to get rtx hardware probably not but we'll see and so I hope this will open up a stream of games that have some form of arty implementation either shadows reflections ambient occlusion or global illumination or any other technique and so a ray tracing for the gtx cards starts at gtx 1060 6gb version goes all the way up to the turing cards 1660 ti and so on my table today i have a gtx 1060 GTX 1080 Titan XP rtx 2060 and the rtx 2080 Ti to see how that entire stack of cards performs so first of all as Jensen said it just works outside of updating your Nvidia drivers and making sure you're on the latest Windows OS the 1809 you don't have to tinker with anything in-game you know all the RT and DXR are features should be visible to you with your gtx hardware now as I've said in my previous analysis of bf5 and metro Exodus rate racing has a massive potential to improve your overall immersion of the gameplay as long as the environment fits the whole ray-tracing you know delivery so as long as the environment is a major part of your observation and game you know ray-tracing from my standpoint is improved now bf5 is not that with its fast paced shooter mechanic in which you don't really have time to stop and admire the reflections on wet surfaces or other reflective surfaces but with this update you can with gtx graphics see those reflections in action but only from like a demo perspective as the FPS hit is actually quite significant so what you're watching now is running on the gtx 1080 FTW by EVGA and 8700k 4.9 gigahertz and the game is running at 1080p resolution with medium quality settings and since only the reflections are ray-traced the visual difference in like 95% of the gameplay is not noticeable but at least we hit over 60 FPS with DXR enabled I won't recommend it since it doesn't really benefit the overall gameplay experience but Metro Exodus is another story so with this game I feel they've done a fantastic job with global illumination to improve the overall game world and since this is a story driven game I would recommend replaying it with rt enabled if you can now the performance hit is massive however you can see over a hundred FPS difference with my GTX 1080 at 1080p resolution with medium settings and high arty preset so again this game becomes almost like a demo of what's possible with great racing like the darkness gradient of the sewer entrance you know it's very realistic versus it being totally illuminated by conventional means when the arty is off now the reason why we're seeing such a significant hit on performance with gtx cards is because all the ray-tracing is rendered on standard raster course instead of the dedicated arty course on the rtx graphics so of course that is inevitable now in terms of sli performance with ray tracing and gtx Hardware we were told that at first it's not possible and then that some games might implement it and it's kind of game dependent so I would say SLI would rate racing would gtx hardware is kind of a write-off and so here's the performance breakdown with my five cards the interesting thing is that my Titanic speed collector's edition outperforms the RTX 2060 both and DXR on and off which is quite interesting to see but of course all that changes when we move to Metro Exodus so here we're using global illumination for our ray-traced technique and I think that is a lot more intensive so not just reflections but like all that light scattering around surfaces and interacting with objects and looks like a lot more computational intensive for the RT cores or the raster course in this example moving on to the atomic hard demo at 1080p so this one yeah it's a bit challenging if you are willing to sit through about 10 FPS on average with a GTX 1060 just to see some you know beautiful graphics running at the really low framerate be my guest and even with my 2080 ti it's still quite difficult to run and the same story continues with Port Royale benchmark this one's running at 1440p so we're stepping up the resolution but again you know I mean those average frame rates on the gtx hardware is kind of laughable but it's also very low on the rtx hardware so just shows how demanding this you know ray trace benchmark really is and so the takeaway is that ray tracing works on gtx hardware now no problems I haven't experienced any crashes or any like visual differences between rtx hardware and gtx hardware so that's a good thing it's almost like it's enticing gtx owners to consider playing around with rt features and DXR and certain games and some demos to see what they're missing out on but like we literally have only three games with you know these ray-traced techniques apply to them so it's it's not worth it just yet but it does give you a look glimpse or like which direction we're heading in and I'm hoping that we'll see more like good implementation of ray tracing in future titles not just reflections but like global illumination and shadows so that it like builds this visual beauty into the game world that makes sense and is not just there for a tech demo get a good sense of grip with Corsairs iron claw RGB Gaming Mouse featuring a lightweight design ultra durable Emraan switches paired with Pixar's 33 91 optical sensor and some RGB lining for some extra Flair the iron claw ensures gaming at its best check it out down below so make sure to update your drivers play around with it and let me know what you think of it in the comments below I'm a Dmitry thanks so much for watching if you haven't checked out my analysis of previous rtx implementations make sure to do so and yeah I'll see you next video",

    "transcript": "A few days ago, the United States Federal Reserve dumped nearly 1.5 trillion dollars into short-term markets, which spawned many questions online like Why arent we giving this money to the sick? and Why arent we paying off student loan debt instead? I get it. Over one trillion dollars is a fuck ton of money but it isnt like the Fed has a huge gold reserve and theyre selectively choosing WHO to give it to. What we just witnessed is known as Quantitative Easing and its a dirty trick used by central banks to stimulate the economy though that isnt always what happens. I wanna break this down as far as I can to help even the most financially illiterate grasp whats going on in 2020. Stay with me. --- Lets start with a very basic definition of quantitative easing: An unconventional influx of money from central banks into local markets via asset purchases. Usually things like bonds and, more recently in Japans case especially, ETFs. Central banks are government institutions set up to manage the supply of money in a given market. The central bank of the U.S. is the Federal Reserve, and the central bank of Canada is, well, the Bank of Canada. They control prevailing interest rates, money supplies, and a long list of commercial bank requirements. Now when you hear of the Fed lowering interest rates, theyre trying to simulate growth by making money cheaper to borrow. We all prefer lower interest rates because it means were paying less overall on top of principal to the lending institution usually a bank or credit union. For example, a $20,000 5-year auto loan with a 5% interest rate comes out to roughly $377 per month and $22,645 in total payback, which means youre giving $2645 to the lender over 5 years to borrow the 20 grand. Its not bad. But if the same loan had a 10% interest rate, youd be paying $425 per month and $25,496 overall so nearly 5500 dollars to borrow the same amount of money. Interest rates, along with other factors, provide context clues regarding economic health. Believe it or not, some countries have prevailing NEGATIVE interest rates. Japan, Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland are a few examples. This mean that, instead of banks paying YOU to hold and borrow your balances, YOU pay the BANKS to hold your money. Its usually a very small amount, but it indicates that the country as a whole is generally risk averse and would be willing to pay a federally insured bank to safeguard funds rather than invest. Anyway back to our discussion. If a central bank determines that traditional means of stimulation are not cutting it, they may resort to more extreme methods. Quantitative easing is one of them. Consider what just happened: the Fed pumped 1.5 trillion dollars into short-term markets, which means they bought assets from commercial banks and other companies in an effort to stimulate growth. But where does the money come from? And how does this sort of injection actually grow anything? First, the central bank doesnt spend 1.5 trillion of its saved up dollar bills. That isnt how things work nowadays. The U.S. dollar is a fiat currency, meaning it isnt technically backed by anything. Theres no standard that determines how much of it we should print, whereas, prior to 1971, the U.S. dollar was exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold roughly $35 per ounce with a few fluctuations around market crashes and war. And its because we use a fiat currency that were able to implement something as brash as QE. So when its announced, the Federal Reserve essentially prints money. Now, its not as simple as it probably sounds, but at the end of the day, the Fed moves a few boxes around and ends up with 1.5 trillion dollars more than it had a few minutes prior. And by doing so, they essentially devalue their own currency something known as inflation. It trickles down to the consumer at some point, resulting in a higher CPI and thus higher degree of inflation. Now lets tackle the growth phase and Im putting that in quotes because it doesnt always work out the way its planned on paper. You see, when the Fed creates money and uses it to buy government bonds and corporate assets, it suddenly places more money in the hands of commercial banks. And since banks make money by, well, loaning it, the excess capital is supposed to persuade them to lower interest rates and offer unique financing terms to stimulate investment. BUT and this is a big but this entire process ASSUMES that bank will use the capital wisely and we all know from the 08 financial crisis what happens when corporations are simply given money. Whether it be through a bailout or asset purchase, we put a considerable degree of faith into these businesses to utilize the funds in such a way that the economy as a whole would benefit. Japan tried this several times throughout the 2000s and ended up with an insane level of debt given its size and GDP. After injecting trillions of Yen into commercial banks and seeing little to no real uptick in market conditions, the country was backed into a corner and succumbed to negative interest rates a point of no return, in a way. And thats what so many economists are afraid of here in the U.S. Negative interest rates policies are largely unproven in the long term elsewhere in Europe, and such uncertainty for a country our size could spell irreversible damage to a country already buried in debt. When it comes to economics, I try to look at things from a micro perspective. What would the individual do? It tends to weed out useless politics and bias and force individuals to think for THEMSELVES. Consider the following: Times are tough. Youre barely earning enough at work to cover the mortgage. And because of this, you cant go out on weekends and enjoy a movie or fancy dinner. Lets assume this is the case for MOST middle class workers. Local businesses suffer as a result, and the economic outlook of your city isnt favorable. Now the government steps in and offers to simply give you money. Call it a stimulus. No strings attached. Its literally a check for $500. What would you do with it? In fact, the U.S. government did something very similar to this in 2008 for the 07 tax season. When market conditions were grim and an impending recession loomed what would eventually become the financial and housing crisis congress stepped in and issued tax rebates for individuals and families who met certain criteria. Most middle and low income legal residents received between $300 and $1200 USD in rebates through direct deposits or physical checks. The intent was for this surplus of funds to stimulate a dying economy. More money in accounts SHOULD make people spend more, right? Yet several studies point out that only around 1/3 of the tax rebate was actually spent meaning consumers largely chose to SAVE the funds instead which is actually pretty smart. If youre barely making enough to pay your mortgage each month, having a nice cushion of funds in your accounts is a GOOD thing. There are several conflicting studies regarding this approach by the Bush administration, but I want you to put all of that aside for a second and ask yourself what youd do in this scenario would you SAVE or would you SPEND? Now pull this idea into the realm of business. Say you own a commercial bank and make money by giving out loans. However, interest rates are terribly low at the moment and your income has been steadily declining for years despite an influx of loan applications. If a central bank suddenly bought millions of dollars worth of assets from you in order to increase your liquidity, what would you do with the excess capital? Would you loan it out? Keep in mind interest rates are the lowest theyve been in years. From the consumer side, this is a good thing, but if the economy is apprehensive, people generally behave in a risk averse fashion. Maybe loans arent such a great idea right now. This mentality, of course, impacts banks directly. And if theyre picking up on this, you might be reluctant to loan this new capital out. Maybe youll just store it for a while. Ya never know what could happen, right? The markets could crash tomorrow. This is the setting of the world stage at the moment, and its being compounded by various health crises and tanking oil prices thanks to Saudi and Russian disagreements. What were left with is a very unique combination of factors weve never seen before and its why no one really knows whatll happen next. Thats all for this one.

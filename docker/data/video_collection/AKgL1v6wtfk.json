    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is. Today we're gonna build a laptop. - We are? - No. - Oh. - So one of our more popular videos on the channel is, we built a little laptop. - [Austin] It was great. It was more of so a Surface kind of like little tablet, kind of thing. But it was neat because you could put the battery in, you could actually like plug some components in, clearly a little bit more meant for kids and people who have never had any experience building a computer. But Matt, are we about to bust out the new framework? - No, because we don't have that kind of budget on This Is. Instead I got us what I think might be one of the coolest things for kids. - Oh! It's a Raspberry Pi laptop. - So this is the advanced kit. - What makes it advanced? - We'll find out. - Can I open this up? I mean I know there's a lot of information on the back, but why don't we just explore it? As a team. - Yeah, let's go into this. - Okay, so this ver-, you- - I did not repackage it at all. - This looks like it's completely brand new and never touched. There's a Super Nintendo controller in here? Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Not one but dos. - Wait. Okay. So this is clearly meant for kids. You teach little Timmy how to build his computer, and then he can build a world in Minecraft. This checks out. - It's offensive that you say that this is specifically for kids when it comes with these very adult Minecraft building blocks. So do you want gold or what do you want? I think we need glue for this, but- - No, you just fold it Matt. You just fold it. - It definitely wants you to glue tabs. - Why would you glue tabs when you can just fold it. - Minecraft blocks. - I got a block of gold. So we've got the crow pot. Oh wow. That's, that's a chungis if I've ever seen one. - Is that is, is that a bowl of Campbell's soup? Because that is chunky. - So there's a lot here. So we've actually got a USB mouse with the dongle inside, a ton of little gadgets. So it looks like a little controller, EQ volume and some extra little boards. Also hands on Python programming guide for beginners. Okay, so we have a little micro SD card, a 32 gig micro SD card that says game on it. There's also a micro SD to USB reader. So if you actually need to go and burn your SD cards, you've got all kinds of GPIO, resisters. - [Matt] Transistors. - Oh, it's an A Pi 4 too? - [Matt] Yes. - Wow. Okay. So this means that we've got dual micro HDMI. You've got yourself audio, you've got USB-C in for power, you've got USB 3.0 and ethernet? Shove it, Apple. Where's your ethernet, and your six inch thick crow pie laptop? We've also got the system OS, which is I'm gonna guess already in here. - [Matt] Yeah. - 128 gig micro SD? Damn, this is, this is legit. The Raspberry Pi takes a USB-C power adaptor, but this is a barrel plug. So does the laptop actually have a battery? - No. - It's so thick. Why do they not put a battery in? - I mean, why do there not a battery in me? It'd be cool if like there's a battery that was in here, that could go in the tray and go in the back there. One of the things I'm like, 'oh you know it'd be cool' is I was, I want to like put the the Raspberry Pi in there, and kind of surprise you. Nope, doesn't fit. - Yeah. - So then I'm like, you know what it comes with, uh- Nope. Doesn't fit. Well it comes with a mouse. Nope. Doesn't fit. - Why don't we try to actually build this thing and get it up and running? So we've got ourselves a webcam. We've got ourselves a probably like 11 inch screen or so. There's a headphone jack on the side. We've got USB. - Ha, take that Apple. - Why's it got micro USB? - I am actually not sure what that port is for. - The problem is is that the actual Raspberry Pi has tons of ports on it. So what's the point of that? Volume, Oh you know what, the Pi comes in here, and then the ports surface on this side, right? - [Matt] Yes. - Wait, if the pie lives in here you're gonna have to route all your cables and HDMI and everything out and inside the laptop. - Well maybe we should pop up it open and find out. - Well, I mean there's obviously a dimple here so I'm just assuming that it does this. - Go ahead. You were wrong. - Oh whoa. Oh, oh. - This is why I thought the thing was really cool. - Yeah. Yeah. - So it has the full project board already integrated. Everything is already wired up. You have a little breadboard on the side here. You got your GPIOs, all of your like learning things that you'd want to do. Here's your RFID reader. - Yeah. - All these little projects that you'd want to do are just integrated into the board. - You got a joystick in here. Why do you need joystick? That's wild. - But like learning how to program all these things. A big challenge for someone who's brand new at this, keep in mind this is for kids, is first the level of learning how to code, but then also like, it can be daunting just to try and hook up the system. - [Austin] Of course. Yeah. - It just takes one barrier, like one like barrier of entry out, which I think is really, really nice. - This is a almost ridiculous amount of bits and pieces. So I'm guessing then that you just pop that out. So that is the backside. So basically you line up the GPIO here. Then there's a fan that's directly over the actual cooler. And you got yourself a little dotter board for the USB. You know the micro HDMI, and USB-C and what not. So basically you just drop this into place really, right. So we've got ourselves USB-C which I will line up here. - Which I believe, yeah, it's just power. - Yeah. And then I've got the micro HDMI. I think that's good. I'm just gonna just put the- - If that's really it, I'm actually like annoyed. - Let's plug this thing in and actually see if it fires up. I probably should put my keyboard back on on that same cell. Okay. So how does that actually connect? It's a Bluetooth. This is Bluetooth. Oh. - [Matt] I will say it is the worst track pad I have ever used. - So the only thing I have to say about this which is probably not great right off the bat, this is not a super intuitive design, right? The fact that the keyboard, which looks like it's all part of the actual system, has its own on off switch and whatnot. There's definitely some things that if this is- a kid's trying to play with this as a laptop this is not the way normal laptops work in a lot of ways. Which is obviously you're trying to learn, right? But there's certainly some things where I'm like, if I was giving this to a kid as their first laptop, then I give them a real laptop later, they're gonna be like, what? They're not gonna understand a lot stuff. Oh, it just is booting up immediately. Oh there we go. - Ready? Ready? Yeah. And ah, flounk. So it's got an OS skin on it. The game version that it comes with, the game SD is just RetroPie. - Oh neat. - So if you wanted to have like an emulator system, it comes with that. - All right, I'm gonna open up the chromium web browser. Who cares about all this extra stuff? I'm gonna watch, who this is video. - I don't know why you would do that, but like- - Ah, that speaker is not good. Also. Holy balls. This thing is slow. This the Raspberry probably, 4 and it's this slow? - Yeah. - This is not, this is not how slow a Raspberry Pi 4 should be. - There is a lot of bloat. - Yeah. - On this thing. There's no real speaker. It's the little board piezo speakers. There's also like nine different coding apps on here. - Write your code here. - Hello. - Hello World. It's oh it, it just turned off. - So here's the thing. I have a feeling you're not gonna do any of these because you actually have to like, program it. Yeah. - As in write lines of code? - Yes. That's the whole point of this thing. - I would not use the skin. I would just reinstall. - Yes. - Something. Cause like if you're gonna use this as like something to learn, you wanna actually use all like the, the games, and all the things to you know, learn how to code and whatnot. Then I guess- - The skin on here bogs this down terrible. - Immensely. - Yeah. Why do you have XBOX cloud gaming loaded up on this map? - Cause I tried it. - And it was a terrible experience. Right? - It was in fact a terrible experience. - Cool. We're not gonna try that anymore on camera. - I love how generic these SNES controllers are. - This is, I would say bordering on unusable because I can't type on- - After about 30 minutes of this thing, I want to throw it through the window. - Yeah, this is bad. Ah, Matt. I'm getting a little worried here. So this is like a cool idea, but the execution seems like it is half baked. Now you could buy this and use it just for the hardware, and of course flash whatever OS or really whatever clean version of Raspberry you wanted on here. - I personally like this better than just a regular, like everything like a breadboard out you-, you route everything that way. I think it's just neater. Like cleaner. So like if you wanna learn how to do some programming for these type of things, I think it's great. One of the things I was interested for it is, if this is a good little mobile retro gaming system. Obviously you have RetroPie that you can put on here, but it comes with like a controller. Like this is a good portable little emulator. - Do we need to switch over to the SD card, or are you just gonna tell me that it sucks and we can move on? - It's up to you. - Be straight with us. How bad is it? - [Matt] It's loud. While I was using this, I just definitely unplugged it. - If you want to use this just for the hardware, I might be able to get around it. I don't think it makes sense to- - But! - What, what, what's the but? - How much do you think this costs? - Raspberry Pi 4? 50 bucks. - They are a little marked up right now cause they're harder to get, but they're, they're coming down. - This whole board honestly, probably at least another $50 screen, all the bits. You got the advanced kit. I'm gonna say it's probably $300. - A lot more. I paid about $550 for this. - This is outrageous. I mean I, no, I have nothing good to say about this. - There was a couple like cheaper versions. - But they're gonna come with less stuff, which is almost the only reason why you would even consider this. Surely we're done now. - Look, we built a laptop is definitely uh, click bait. I know that as soon as we do this video, people are gonna- they did it with our last video. They're gonna do it here. Why not the framework? Do you like- - Actually I think frameworks a better idea. - Well the framework is a better idea. But like, is it, are these comparable? Like that's, that's like, I wanna like, I wanna like- - Are they pretty much better? No. Pretty much better. - Yeah. For you, the adult man. - Who is this better for? - A 10 year old. - I would disagree. - Man. A five year old. - I would disagree. Matt, you cannot with any kind of straight face defend this thing. - I can't defend this thing. I can't do it. Let us know how this is a piece of garbage in the comments. Like, subscribe, follow and check us out in the next one. - Yeah, where Matt will click bait us both once again. - I click baited you all!",

    "description": "Uploading your first 360 degree video can be a bit intimidating.  But its actually rather simple!  I used THIS LG 360 camera:   Here is how to edit and upload your 360 video to YouTube!  1) First convert the image from the 2 large circles so you can edit it on your computer.  You can do this by transferring the files to your phone before putting them on your computer. OR you can use LG's desktop app here:   2) Edit your videos like you normally would in any video editing software.  3) Render/Export your finished video.   4) Then use the 360 metadata injector tool from YouTube.  This tool lets YouTube know that the video is 360 and will play it like a 360 degree video:  EDIT: THEY HAVE UPDATED THE APP, THERE IS NO 'spherical' CHECKBOX ANYMORE. JUST 'OPEN' THE PROGRAM AND 'INJECT THE METADATA'. IT'LL STILL WORK THE SAME WAY JUST WITHOUT THE SPHERICAL CHECKBOX.

    "transcript": "Editing your first 360 video can be a bit confusing. This video will walk you though the entire process, from shooting, editing, and uploading to YouTube all with the LG 360. Intro The normal footage coming straight from the SD card cannot be edited into a 360 video. It appears as just 2 large circles. But, it is very easy to convert into a flat image that can be edited. There are two ways to convert the image. The first is just with your cell phone. The camera connects with WiFi. So find the clip you want to edit, WiFi that clip to over to your device, and it will be converted on the device itself. The transferred clips that you pull from your phone onto your computer, will not appear as 2 large circles, it'll be a flat image that you can edit. The second way is with a free desktop app from LG's website. I will link it in the video description, below this video. Download that. You can see here what the raw footage looks like directly from the SD card. Its just 2 huge circles that don't look 360ish at all. Drag and drop that footage into the LG 360 desktop app, and it will convert into the editable files for you. The app will drop the finished files into the same folder. With the word 'result' in the file name. Then you can view the 360 degree footage in the LG 360 desktop app, if you open the file in a normal video player, you can see that it fills the entire screen with footage that you can edit with any editing software. I personally use adobe premier. So Ill it pull it up in that. This is a 360 video I made previously. Of me hiking the Yosemite Half Dome. Super sketchy hike, I suggest you watch that video after you are finished with this one. You can see that the LG 360 shoots in 5.1 surround sound. So when you are done cutting and splicing up your footage and are ready to export the final clip, make sure to switch your audio to the 5.1 surround instead of stereo. Also, make sure that you find the correct bitrate of the file so that adobe doesn't compress the footage for you. YouTube does enough of that on its own. Because the original files as you can see here in the details are just shy of 22 megabits a second. So that will maintain the quality and the integrity of the video file as I render. Before YouTube compression comes in and smashes it all up. Now, YouTube has no way of knowing that the footage is 360 degree video unless we tell it. So we have to download the free 360 video metadata app from YouTube. Ill also link this program in the video description as well. Its a very simple app. Just open up the finished file that you just exported from your video editor. And check the spherical box. You don't need to worry about any of the other options. Then hit 'save as', and the program will add the word 'injected' into the file name. You can save it wherever you want. But I like leaving it next to the original file. Just drag and drop that file into the YouTube uploader. And Boom. You are ready to rock. In order to view these 360 degree videos. You need to be watching from the Google Chrome web browser, OR from the YouTube app on your phone, iPhone or Android. Anywhere else will just display a flat video which isn't as fun to watch. Please subscribe if you learned something new today! And hit that thumbs up if you are in a good mood. Check out the Yosemite 360 degree video I made, and another video of me flying teeny drones with Suli Breaks, Cian Twomey, and Gary Turk. Thanks a ton for watching! Hope to see you around.",

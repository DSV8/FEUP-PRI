Ever walk into a small computer shop and think who is buying all these old products? Well we did, and that weighed on us. Sleepless nights turned into exhausting days of wondering just what is in that small computer shop? It became such a problem that we found ourselves with no other option than to walk in, close the door behind us, and tell the owner well take everything youve got. Thats what we did. We were forced to, if you really think about it. Just what are we going to get? Will there be RTX 4090s, or old Voodoos? 13th gen i9s or Socket 1 486s? Thunderbolt 4 cables or serial port connectors?  Discuss on the forum:   Purchases made through some store links may provide some compensation to Linus Media Group.

    "transcript": "Do you ever walk into those mom-and-pop computer repair shops that have been around since the 90s and notice that half the inventory on the shelf seems to be from the grand opening day? What is this? Why do they have so many of these? Where is all the modern hardware? This USB switch looks old enough to be my dad. How's it $30? Sir, you couldn't possibly need some of this stuff. So I'll tell you what, I am going to buy every last item in your storefront. But I warn you, I'm a pretty tough negotiator. Do you like games of chance? I do. So do I. But this guy looks cool as a cucumber. Am I going to end up paying full sticker price for 12-year-old ink cartridges? Or is he going to cut me a deal? Will I be walking out of here with Core i9s or Core 2 Poos and Athlon 60 Poors? All I know for sure is that if you go to Black Lab New News Computers tomorrow, you will find it to be quite empty. Thanks to our corporate credit card and the Ridge, who sponsored this video and asked me to tell you about their $75,000 giveaway where you can win either $75,000 cash or a Hennessy Ford Bronco Raptor. No purchase necessary. You can find out how to enter down below, but I can give you a little hint. If you want to get a ton of bonus entries, you want to check out these Ridge X Hennessy collab products. We're also going to have those linked down below. Obviously, I was poking some fun at you in the intro, but it doesn't change the fact that you have a wireless N access point from Air Link, whoever the hell that is. So that's quite old inventory, but I'd never sell it to somebody for $80. And Air Link is a big company. Didn't they go to business a few years back? So did NCIX. This one, for example, you clearly tried to get rid of at some point. $570. That was probably what it was worth in about 2002. If I can remember, someone actually ordered that and I got stuck with the inventory. If I had to guess, I'd say this is probably a similar story. But some people play retro games now and they want the old computers and they need the parts. What socket is this even for? I don't recognize it either. Not everything's going to be like that, though. I'd imagine this was just... That was a stock item, yeah, that I got stuck with. These were rarely popular at one time because everybody wanted their media onto a hard drive that they could access through their house. And they were great for piracy, this one in particular. And they were great... Really? He's making my dream come true, actually. Oh, clearing out the dead stock? It's all dead stock. Even the dead laptops in the back are dead stock. I said buy everything in the storefront. What can you do for me on this one? Windows 7 era. A lot of people in construction use those. Still, to this day, it can still run Windows 10, no problem. Yes, it's an i5. It's 8 gigs of RAM and it's got a 256 SSD. Basically what you're saying is I'm not getting a great deal on this. No, you are. You still are. It's a massive $400. $400? Oh. Which is pretty good for an indestructible laptop. Indestructible, you say. So I have four of those. I only saw one in the front. $400 Panasonic Toughbook. Three of them. I'm not taking all of them! I thought we were friends. Storefront! Surely you're not going to charge me $150 for these ancient Sennheiser wireless headphones. You're correct. You really want them? I don't want them. Look at the foam on these things. How's half price? 80 bucks. Done. How much for this entire wall? Smart cover for the iPad Mini 4 car charger with QC 3.0. I mean, we've got a few of those. That's actually pretty good stuff. There's also some absolute junk. What is metal cable? It's metal. Universal clip lens. Does anyone have a computer that is on? That's not how you hold it. That works really good. Two of those. Give me a price. $500. Kindle Fire Stamps. Universal car holder. Your cat can't chew it. That was worth a lot of money. Did I say $500 for the whole wall? I meant to say $1,000. Really? A three and a half inch card reader? People still want them. Hey look, you saved me the trouble of waiting around for these batteries to bulge. I get three of them. $980. Even with Ridge's help, I'm really not sure about this right now. Now it's time to have some fun. Let's have plus minus 5%, plus minus 10%, and then each of us gets to write one sticker. And so we each get a side that we decide. Where does the front of the store start, Keith? Okay, so it doesn't include that wireless headset then. You're going to save a lot. There's a 66% chance it'll be something within reason. And Keith gets to decide what our outliers are going to be. He could say plus 100%, but there's a chance I'll get it for free. My wife's going to kill me. Plus 100%, we got a gambling man! It's just the bin. I'm rethinking about it. You know, my truck just broke down, right? Well, let's find out if I've paid two grand for a bunch of old cables. Please be lucky. 10% discount. Not too bad. Great, so that one's $882. The next thing I'd like to talk about is this shelf, because you did say it's reduced to clear up to 70% off. Correct. How much for the shelf? Well, there's a brand new printer, color laser printer. We've got a Core i7, Windows 7 era machine, Windows 7 Xeon machine with a Blu-ray disc. That looks like another brand new in-box printer. It's a brand new in-box color laser printer. That's $700. Is this shelf, because it's these? Are you going to take all these? Oh, good. UPS is with dead batteries in them. That's right. But you can get the batteries. I might as well throw in the amp, too, for the guitar. I mean, I have to buy everything, so it doesn't really make a difference how you bundle items. It's just what's going to be in the bundle when we play our games of chance. Oh, good, an iPad Mini 4 keyboard cover. $3,700 with 20% off. We've got marbles. We've got baseball. We're not going to kiss after, are we? We've got a hippo that says, I'm broken. Let's do a putting challenge. I win. I get to roll the die. You win. I pay the price. No more questions asked. Deal. From the Please Keep Social. So the rate above there. That's fair. Now, I am not a golfing man. Oh, no. Okay, she's going somewhere else. It's a really light ball. This is really important to me, so, you know. Oh, geez. Minus 5%. I'm liking this die right now. I'm okay with that. $2,812 All right, I just spent three grand, boys. Let's clear out this shelf. As much as I was memeing in the intro, Keith does have some... Oh, it's an empty box. Oh, it's an empty box. Oh, thank goodness. Uh-oh. Not everything up here is an empty box. Oh, no. What is this Logitech speaker with glue all over the back of it? I use it for the store, but if I was to sell it, it'd be like $299. I'll let you roll for it. Give me a bin. I think this is one of them, eh? Yeah. I don't know what I'm going to do with all this stuff. Oh, no. I found a subwoofer. Oh, no. Honestly, I love that system. I can see you really love those speakers, and this is tearing you up. So I'll tell you what. I want to throw you a bone. If you make this shot, I'll pay you double for it. Keith, Keith, Keith. It's an impossible shot. It's a broken hippo. No! $600 for the speakers. Keith getting a sound system upgrade. I want this amp now. Also, I get this sign. No, not my sign. Oh, no. I get an iMICE. We just do the best. Oh, you get two iMICE. Oh, come on. Please tell me this Elite X2 is not very new. And broken. It must be broken. It doesn't power. It's broken. Because you don't have it plugged into an adapter, and there's no battery. You admitted nobody cares about these. It was $189. 10 years ago. I'm going to give it to you for $49.99. People still might use it. Dashcam from iZeeker. Shenzhen Hengyufa Trading Co-limited. Come on. Everything is from there. Come on. It's 20 bucks. $79.99. What? Come on. I'm seeing $50 on Amazon. Come on. For the new version. What is this? A bottle opener? EVGA mount holder. A retention bracket. Yeah, because they even still make GPUs. This is not worth $90. I'll give you $10 off. $80 baby monitor. HDMI 1.4 splitter. So who would use that? A pub? Restaurants? I don't even want RGB extension cables. They light up. You know how many people like those? This is part of your security system. Yeah, but that... Okay, so here we go. Here we go. So a lady came in here and said, do you want an old Ghetto Blaster? I said, no. Do you see all the junk I have in here? She said, but it still works. And it works perfectly. I said, sure, I'll take it. So then I looked it up on eBay. They're $600. You're welcome. They're averaging around $400. Do they work? Because if this works... Oh, parts only. Oh, s***. Oh, we're drinking now. The middle is minus 25 percent. You get to pick what's in two of the outside ones and then I will match it in the other ones. Plus 10, minus 10. Plus 10 for two of yours. I need my truck fixed. I don't want to be stupid about it. See, that was too easy. I should get a... You get to pick the next game. So what's my total for that? $1,507.50. Okay, I'll tell you what. You get to pick the next wall or shelf. Why don't we do this plus the mining stuff? What's my price for the Fire MV2400? This thing is like 100 years old. So I'll give it to you for $50. Okay. More RGB stupid cable extensions. $50 for an RGB LED strip though. Really? From AirGoo? Please tell me this isn't in here. Yeah, of course it is. That's in here? No. Oh. This is about as old as that multi-view card. I'm not paying $69 for this thing though. X17 gaming mouse. That's a great mouse. And it's current. $90 for the X17K that's cooler. Neither of us even knows what socket it's for. $5. This is not a $16 phone holder. It's a dog. Come on. It's a horse. A dual bay hard drive dock. Is this even USB 3, sir? Oh, I'm getting li-. Sorry. A little lightheaded. I am paying a lot of money for old tech that I don't need right now. I feel so much better today. Thank you. I don't even know what these are. So I had a customer who wanted to do Ethereum mining. I see that. A month before it all got kind of shut down. That's when they bought all this stuff. So they're basically new cards. Give me a price. Let me just do some adding in my head. Sorry. One sec. $3,500. And we're talking Canadian dollars. So that's about three grand US, guys. And there's a mouse down there. Oh, good. And I got the boxes for it. Fine. Pick your game. Oh, and a keyboard. How about we play darts? Here's how it's going to work. For every ring away from the dot I am, Keith gets an extra 5%. And for every ring away from the dot he is, I get a 5% discount. And we take the difference. Best of two. Best of two and one practice. But you get it in practice. They don't stick. I can make it stick. Oh, I like my chances. I think we should do to a maximum of 25%. If he is outside, then I get credit. So if he was way outside, then I would get a 10% discount. Oh, crap. I'm in. No, dang it. You know what? I think I can do better. Oh, it doesn't stick. I got another shot. Yeah, you only get one more. I pay the price we negotiated, plus 5%, which on four grand is? $4,320. Yeah, thanks, Josh. I actually was able to do the math on my own, but thank you for saying it out loud for me. How much for the four printers? $600. Okay, we got these cases. Corsair 220T. $129.99. You heard them $129.99 for two cases? No, each. Each. Oh, there's another printer. I didn't even see that. This invoice is from 2021. Oh, this is a repair. Shoot. Put that away. I almost sold a repair. I don't even know what I'm looking at. It's a beautiful chrome Acer. What makes it chrome? It's a Chromebook. It's Google Chrome. Oh ew. Yeah, I agree with you. I don't like them at all. Okay, that should be a good price then. It is. It's $450. So then I guess this is going to be a grand. That's USB 2, sir, before you give me a price for that. Yeah, so you can have the whole lot for $300. $300? That is a Pentium. $250 for the whole lot. I'm taking the desk pads too. They're $40. They are not. They are not. I get them. You told me the whole lot. I will replace both of them with brand new ones from lttstore.com. Can we arrange that, Colin? There's four. Four desk pads. What's my damage on this lot? $1,560 for this? I'm picking the game this time. Like you did the Hippo game? That worked out well for you. Whatever Keith catches is the discount we apply. There's plus 10 on the top. Okay. And other than that, I have no idea what else is in here. Is it going to go in my mouth? I hope not. Oh, you caught the first one. Minus five. Oh, okay. I got a 5% discount. 1482. I'm not feeling that great about that game we just played. So I'm going to go after something that I actually want. That Buzz Lightyear. My son was two. Oh, I'm not going to take it if it's your son's. And no, no, I've been offered $180 for him, but he's now 21. 21 what? Years old. Oh, oh, oh. So my wife wanted to throw it away and I said, I'm not going to throw away Buzz Lightyear. I love my son. He's grown. You can have him for $500. $500. $300. I'll activate my radar motion sensor. Done. $20 for this Mac Mini. This is worthless. It has firewire. Okay, sure. Now those, I'll let you offer those. There's no way a G4Q is worth more than $150. $200. With the speakers. These are crusty, man. They're included. Okay. So Starbucks Express, they don't sell those anymore. So? This eBay listing is saying 40 Canadian plus 60 shipping. I'll give it to you for $40. So you're saving on shipping Linus if you pay 80 for that thing. Thank you. Okay, $80 is fair. Lenovo ThinkCentre Core i5-7 series. Oh, those are super cool. Yeah. Stop it. I have about a dozen of them at home. 300 final offer. You've only got eight gigs of RAM. Done. You haven't seen what's in the glass cabinet back there. What's back where? Back there. Yeah, let's get this customer TV out of here. Thank goodness. Okay, that's not so bad. I thought it was full. A Nintendo DS XL. What's the price for this? These guys know. No, no, no. They're 150 bucks. Offer on the TV. Yeah. Oh, that can't be worth more than 70 bucks. Okay, yours for a hundred. A hundred? It's a display. It's my display. That doesn't mean I want it. A Vantec NAS. It takes parallel ATA hard drives. Five dollars. Really? Yeah. I could use one of those. I'll sell it to you for 10 bucks after I buy it for five. Five dollars. Take it. Cheers. An easy swap to removable hard drive rack. How long has this display case been completely sealed up against the front wall? Uh, maybe 10 years. This is also USB 2. 20 bucks. It takes two drives. Done. A brother label maker. 50 bucks. Come on, this is so old. Sure. It's yellowing, okay? Oh, you forgot about the otter case. 45 dollars. This is for the iPhone 7. Right? It's rare. Two dollars. Fine. I'm nothing if not fair and honorable. I would like to play a game. If I win, I take all this for free. Okay. If you win, I pay full sticker. Deal. The Nintendo DS wasn't part of this lot, so what we negotiated is 112 dollars. If it's full sticker, this one piece alone is 130. I want to see a best three out of five rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. That's one for me. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Yeah, I get it for free. Is that a five? Dang it. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. It's yours. The three? Uh, yes. Where did we end up on with the TV and the Mac and everything? 1,360 dollars. Okay, we haven't played for that yet. Do you want to roll the die? Dice. Dice. Oh my god. Okay, give it to me. He's rolling the die! Lucky Buzz Lightyear. Here we go. Come on. No! How much for this bin now? $2,720. But hopefully, at least, you're feeling somewhat charitable right now as we go into the cable walls. Correct. DVI cable. Other more different DVI cable. USB 2.0 A to Mini 4 pin. It's like a half a dozen of them. 20 dollars? This is just a power cord. Correct. Five bucks, 30 dollar power cable. Oh, for Y cable, I see. USB MIDI cable. So, this is yellow. It is yellow. I knocked it down to $19.99 from $40. You know, some stuff is really weird, but some people need it. They haven't needed it. Yeah, they clearly haven't needed it. Some people still ask for serial to serial, which is fine. Yeah, I don't think prices are going to matter for these. USB 3B cables. Oh my goodness. You have so many of these. I acknowledge some of this stuff is worth something. This S video cable, for example, is very long and someone somewhere needs that. I will make you an offer for everything that was on this cable wall that I think is very reasonable to allow you to restore this wall stocked with modern things. $1,500. And I'll say two. I got a counter offer. We flip a coin. If you win, we'll make it one. Okay. All right, if I win, We make it 25. So it's only a small penalty for you. Huge penalty for me. Okay, I'm calling tails. Damn it! What did I just buy? $2,500 worth of cables. Firewire cables in here. What even is this? This is a smart card reader. Get those cables in there. And I want the cable management products too. I have a feeling a lot of this isn't going to make it into the final video. So make sure you get subscribed at lmg.gg slash floatplane where we're going to have a ton of behind the scenes. I don't think this is worth more than like a hundred bucks. It doesn't even have front USB 3. This is first gen i7, maybe second gen. This is probably not even worth a hundred dollars. Well, if you're, you know, a dishonest person, that sticker is worth a hundred dollars. But you're not. How's that corner you painted yourself into? I'll give it to you a hundred dollars because I'm a very honest person. Okay, good. Oh crap. This one has USB 3. This is like one generation newer though, man. So let's do $200. $200? This drone- So that's brand new. I think they're $89 on Amazon. No way. Yes way. When are you going to get a $10 drone? It's got a camera on it. This is dead. $39.99 for you. Bad and dead. Bad and dead. This has PCI X in it. 50 bucks. Fine. It's not worth 50 bucks, but I feel like that's the best I'm going to do with you. Ah, I want this PS2 for the same price. Okay. All right. You overpaid. What's that? Nothing. All these monitors for $200 total. Done. He didn't see the one in the box over here. Oh, I didn't either. We might have also missed this monitor over here. $690. This is the first good deal I've negotiated today, I think. You want to gamble on it? And I'm still going to gamble on it. I'm going to draw five lines on this cable. I'm going to pull the cable through your hands. Okay. For every line that passes through your hands, you get 5% on top of the negotiated price. But if it reaches the end, I get 20% off. Okay. And you'll be blindfolded. I don't think either of us is going to be able to tell from what I'm doing right now, exactly where these lines are going to land and go. How many lines will he get? I guess we will find out yet. Let's see if he gets some lines. Oh no, come on! How do I do? I pay 25% extra, Josh. I'm going to watch your channel way more often. You've got to help me out on this cable wall. Ancient RGB strip, actually worthless. Literally expired 10 years ago. USB to PS2 adapter. How come you just show the bad stuff? What about the good stuff? A one to three RGB LED splitter cable. You know how many people need this stuff? Oh, there's a 256 gig micro SD here. That's at least actually worth something. USB audio jack thing. Cable management do-dads. Oh, wait. Oh HDMI 1.4, 100%. 100% of what? DDR3 laptop memory for $70. I'd probably charge somebody $19 for that. Very generous. Big fan. More DDR3. Electronic anti-lost alarm. You'll never have to watch that show again. $90 laptop cooler. At best, does Vantec even exist anymore? He doesn't know. You don't want two trains, do you? Ah, I mean, it's in the front of the stores. 20 years old. Some of these CD wallets. CD bag, good quality. 4x speed DVD RWs. Even with the train. There's no way this is worth more than a G. But a G sounds good, so I'll accept your offer. Crap. Crappy iMac and old gaming PC. I think the old gaming PC's got 32 gigs of RAM. $750 for the lot. How about $1,000? That's easy. You get $500 for that. And easy, you get $500 for that. And then you get $100 for a monitor. And then you get a gaming keyboard. And mouse. Camera not included. Okay, $1,000. But we roll the dice again. Agreed. Okay, I want to roll it this time. We ready? All right, 5% discount. I think it's time for some lightning rounds here. With neither of us knowing what's in this gun, I truly don't. You give me your best price on these, I fire a disc at it. And that's our final price. Deal. What's this Core i5 Dell worth? $699. Last sold eBay listing price. Core i5 7th gen. $599. Plus $10. 8th gen Core i5 Elitebook. $699. Plus 10%. What are these? MacBook. $625. This is ancient. Minus 1%. Perfect. I blame Tanner. $900. It's a 2019. MacBook Pro. Maybe this one I at least got a deal on. Plus 20%. Intel Core 5. Windows 11 Pro 256 SSD. $650. Plus 5%. This gun sucks. Go, go, go, go, go. Okay, well, at least I got a deal on this thing. This is worth $49.95. What? I paid over 200 bucks for those. But anyways. Hey, this is my cable already. I paid good money for these cables. Got a metal one here. Let's go. Before we start, I think we can both agree. Most of this stuff is really old. Windows 98, my friends. I agree. People still want KVMs. I don't know why. TP-Link camera. Someone breaking into your garage? I know what a security camera is for. $129. Giving me tech tips. $129 security camera. This is literally a no-name projector. Correct. $50. TP-Link mesh thing. $300. Kitchen gadget. You can cut your pizza. Spoon. Even has some picnic stuff with it. 'Kay, you claimed not to be a hoarder. What are you really looking at? Is this just a cable? Yeah. I thought I already bought all the cables. AC, Wi-Fi. 150% better coverage. Yeah, yeah, yeah. $70. Everything here, no negotiation. But I want the rest of the shelf for 250 bucks. This is so old, it's named after an ancient civilization. Done. We got this home plug adapter. Other more different ancient home plug adapter. Oh, good. One of those handy-dandy things that was replaced by a piece of cardboard to hold your phone for VR. Oh, the AirLink 101. Makes another appearance. Oh, good. GPS Pianet navigation. Who uses GPS anymore? You got Google. Hold on a second. There's some stuff here. Hold on. USB to DVI display adapter. Wireless G camera, though. Is this a creative X-Fi? To be clear, I'm just excited because I had one. I'm not excited because it's worth anything. Yeah, this is the cheap entry-level one. I think I won that in Vegas 10 years ago. The Ultra Media Dashboard. Now with S/PDIF in the front of your case. The V-Gear LAN disk. Oh, there's another keyboard and mouse back here. The MVP 20 watt. Now with variable voltage. Oh, that's a vape. What is HD video processing? People need this stuff all the time. So convert your, if they have an old console into... Got it. Okay. Okay. Okay. These are actually useful. Oh, good. Wireless N was 129. Now 99. How'd that work out for you? And genius. They did really well in the wireless access point space, didn't they? This box is disintegrating, sir. What you said when I first picked that up is people still buy these. But do they buy this one? Oh, wait. What is this? I didn't even see all this crap. The SecuMaster. Empty box. Oh, thank goodness. New rule. If I can't reach it, I don't have to buy it. Now we're getting into some really random garbage. Why do you have this many proprietary Ville laptop docks? I have them because the company wanted me to recycle them. So you're saying my price is going to be really good then? Yeah. This has a parallel port on it though. Yeah. Pretty awesome. What's the story here? If you really want to watch analog, your LCD is the TV box now. $15. Oh, that would have offered two. The Witness Pro DVR, come on. A PCI security system card. $10. Oh, come on. All right, ethernet switch. Yeah, I think it's a gigabit. I'll give it to you for $19.99. All right. It's PoE too, so that's actually a good deal. Got them. Oh, what the heck are these? See how popular Air Link was? No, I don't see how popular Air Link was because it's all still in your store. These are not... Don't even look at that. This is power line 200 megabit. You know how fast that is? 200 megabit. $50. Come on! I'm just... I'm taking a huge loss. Does that look like the face of a man who's taking a huge loss? Let's do a bundle deal, okay? All right. An Air Link printer server. USB 2 dock. This camera. A drive sled and a Wireless N mini router. $75. Including these? Oh, yeah. You should pay me to take those. $100. Fine. Uh-oh. $150. No way. $30 bucks are best offer. Oh, is this eBay again? You can't compare everything with eBay. You did it earlier. He started it. $40. Done. Is there more stuff in here? Oh, no. No. Another stupid camera. Two keyboard mice. Verbatim keyboard. Oh, what? There's a thing down here. Oh, no. You might need this. That's for an Xbox. Meet me on offer. And this is classic. That's a laptop stand. I have people who work for me who are younger than this. Look at the antennas. $100 bucks. Done. Don't even act like you're stressed out by this. Come on. Oh, I'm going to take you out for a drink one day, for sure. Let's do a deal. Winner takes all. That case. That case. You pick your price. I pick my price. Whoever throws a marble closest to the big one, that's it. No negotiation from the other side. Wow. There is some stuff that's worth money here. There's another drone. There's a tablet. $10,000. What? You can't be serious. You said name your price. Okay. Well, if you're going to be like that, then $1. Deal. Okay. There's a wireless keyboard in there. Oh, come on. I'll even let you throw the stone. This is the big one. So we both got to get closer to it. This is serious business. Feel like I have a lot more riding than you do. Fine. I'm going to have to agree with you. I want these in there too. The server? Yeah. That's junk. The I love strippers TV? Yeah. Surround system. And Acer all-in-one computer. Oh, come on. That's an ancient Core i3 from the Windows 7 era. I say it should all be in. Okay. I'm going to agree with you. Oh, that's too far. Where is it going? It's in the parking lot. Should I roll it again? I think we should stay in the store. Okay. So, David, you'll have to sit in the door. My mouth is like cotton right now. $10,000. I should have said 100. Here we go. Yeah! All right. I like that roll. I've never kissed any balls before, but this is the first time. Hit the marble. Oh, I'll tell you what. If you can beat me, I'll pay two grand for it all. You want one do over? Yes, please. Oh, shoot. Oh, shoot. Hold on. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, he did it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I wouldn't have gave anybody a second chance. Every time. Is there anything good? I got replacement glass for an iPad. I got a Saj keyboard. You got a nice Huawei. Yeah, okay. Hey, at least I got this tablet. I got this bulb. Great. The Aura bulb. I hope that Ridge helped me out a lot today. I really didn't look closely at what was in here, but they sure did help make this video possible. So you're going to want to go check them out at the link down below. If you pick up the collab products with Hennessy, you can get a ton of entries into their giveaway. And as part of the whole thing today, we're going to be hooking you up with one of their carbon fiber wallets, as well as their key case, which is just a super cool compact way to hold your keys so you can nice and easily put it on a key chain. Love it. Never get caught on your pockets or anything like that. That's yours. We have one case left. In light of what just happened, $200 for the case, please. $250. $250. $300. $300, Keith. Come on. Adobe's in there. Keep going. What do you mean Adobe's in there? Adobe Premiere. It's all subscription now. You can't even use that. Look, you got a Lenovo water bottle. Oh, $350, this case. It's yours. Let's see what I got. Does that include everything that's on the case? I certainly hope so. I think I want another $100 for this. The Katana mini guitar amp. It's only another $100. Fine. Fine. He said fine. Oh, good. A wall mount adapter. Hey, Office 365. Apple power brick. How's that Apple power book? Oh, power book. Let's just get this over with. The Omega Pro. Portable power supply and jump starter. What is this, Canadian Tire? It's electronic. What's this? Office Professional 2007. Yes. NCIX used to sell these for, yup, probably about 15 bucks. Oh, good. Lots of power adapters. Ooh, hold on a second. What kind of PlayStation 3 is this? It's not a backwards compatible one. Oh, really? Wait. There might be something good in here. Vista. Is Vista still upgradable? Office basic 2003. You know, I see Microsoft certificates of authenticity. I go like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 2003. Windows XP still sealed. Oh, wait. No, it's not sealed, but it is OG. Hey, Windows 10 home. Sealed. Oh, nice. Sealed Windows 10 home. All right. I got something. Windows Vista Ultimate. Oh, good. The upgrade. Want to do your taxes 13 years ago? I don't even want Norton 360 version 4, but I'm taking it anyway. Express upgrade Windows Vista. All right. You want to buy a few more things? I mean, you're in the mood. No. There's some new stock, you know? No, no. Storefront. This is behind the counter. But what I do want to do is see some of the things that apparently are kind of cool that I won. Oh, I see. I got all the expired ink cartridges. People come in here all the time asking for ink cartridges, but there's too many printers out there. I really appreciate Linus getting rid of all my old cartridges. At least I got this $40 iPad mini folio. Sorry, what is this? Apple 4K display. It's Thunderbolt 2. Okay. I mean, what is this thing worth? It can't be that much. That's like $300. Fine. And then you got an all-in-one computer. Beautiful. 100 bucks. Done. Brand new Acer monitor. 100 bucks. 150. 100. Okay, fine. A display monitor. I don't want that. But it's got to leave the front of my store. 50 bucks. Done. Over here. Oh, come on. We have this beautiful case. 400 for both. Deal. 350 for both. Done. You'd be great at an auction. I've had enough auctioning for the time being. I'm just glad the items in here were a lot larger than some of the Ridges products. Okay, they got the wallets. They've got the key holders. They've got rings. Okay, imagine if this is full of rings. It's time for the grand reveal. You guys saw all the stuff we held out of here, but we haven't kept a running total of the pricing. That's because I wanted us to play a little guessing game. If you can guess the total amount that I'm about to pay within 5%, I will throw in another 10% on the top. You can't lose. Let's get those truck repairs. $28,500. The grand total was $28,275.24. Oh my god! I don't think we need to do the math on that one. Want to play Marvels? $31,102 for some stuff that was pretty decent and an awful lot of dead stock. Pleasure doing business with you, man. And you as well. If you want the truth, I'm getting a little teary-eyed, honestly. It's okay. No, I mean, my truck just broke down and summer's always slow. Merchant copy, man. I just want to know if you're getting a little teary-eyed. It was our pleasure. I have a ton of respect for the frontline people who run these kinds of shops. I know it's an extremely challenging business. Yeah. I'm sure there have been times. 20 years? Yeah. Time is passing, so. All right, well, like I said, pleasure doing business with you. And you as well.",

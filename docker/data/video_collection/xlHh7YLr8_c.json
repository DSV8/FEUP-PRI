    "transcript": "- Today, we're going to be going head to head against AI to decide who is the real champ of PC building, Jay, myself, or I think we actually used Copilot, that was actually what gave us the best PC. And, of course, this video is sponsored by our good friends over at Micro Center who are, of course, celebrating their brand new store launch here in Miami, Florida. My producer, Alex, prepped a full list of parts that Micro Center are actually building for us. We're going to be building a, quote, \"midrange\" gaming PC from the brand new Miami Micro Center. I think we should aim for $1,500. I mean, I would say that's like bordering on high-end. - That's like entry-level, high-end, high-end. Okay, it's high-mid-end. - Yeah. - But it's entry-level high-end. - We've agreed that we're not gonna go super cheap. We're not gonna go- - Oh no. - You know, throw giant GPU- - [Jay] You have to use a case, Austin. No cardboard boxes. - Let's go inside the store, let's scout it out, and then we'll see exactly what we're going up against. - I think it's important to note, like, we don't know what AI chose yet. - I'm a little scared of what we're gonna be going up against. I'm not gonna lie. So this is the brand new Miami Micro Center, and I gotta say it's a different layout than some of the other Micro Centers. Do you wanna do- - 305. - 305, what? - That's the area code. You know, Pitbull. - The main thing I think to consider here is that while we're gonna go for 3DMark, I guess, divided by the price. - That's weird, because you could theoretically get a score that's, you know, 5,000 points below, but it could be like 3 cents more, or 3 cents better performance per dollar, right? So that's why I just aim for 1,500. - I'm almost of the opinion that if you go over, you're just disqualified. I feel like we should not even, like, let that be an option. - Okay. - So the prompt we gave is, \"Build a midrange gaming PC using parts from Micro Center.\" Look at the size of this. - Not bad for a store that just opened. There are 40 AMD CPU SKUs versus 13 Intel SKUs. - Oh. - They still have 12th gen though, so that is of value there. - So we're taking advantage of the same-day build service. So Micro Center will, of course, be able to not only provide you parts if you wanna go build it yourself. But if you're not willing, or you're a little bit afraid, or you just don't have the time, they can build it for you in the store. You can just take home a fully-built system. We're going to have, what, 10 minutes to pick parts? - I think we might need more than 10 minutes. - Five minutes? - I said more, not less, sir. - [Austin] I could probably do three. So you're right, there's a lot of options. So we've got everything from a 12600KF. - Are you gonna actually risk an Intel CPU? - Well, as long as it works for one run of 3DMark Time Spy Extreme, that's fine with me. - And, for the record, we're giving them away, so you don't wanna give away a time bomb. - [Austin] The good thing is Micro Center have plenty of options to choose from, and one of the things that AI is not smart enough to do, but we are, is take advantage of the open-box deals. - Have you seen the simulator wall here? - There's a simulator wall? - It goes from here all the way to that end cap where he's walking right now. That's all simulator stuff. - Oh my god! There's a whole aisle of hard drives? - They have over 150 different hard drives. That's why when you were like, \"I can do it in 10 minutes,\" I'm like, \"No you can't.\" - Yeah, I could do it, but I won't do a good job with it. I think I've seen what I've needed to see. Let's do this thing. So we've been talking about this idea for a little bit, but I think this is the first time I've really realized that there's a possibility that we could lose against the AI. 'Cause obviously I wanna beat you, but I definitely don't wanna lose to AI. - I'll tell you what, AI for me is the true competition here. 'Cause I look at it this way, let's say we end up with the same parts, that's still a valid result. So if they end up being very similar builds, then I think it's pretty valid to say, \"Hey, that's one of the best combinations of parts you can do for the price point.\" And if you're not sure, you can use the Micro Center PC Build Configurator on the website. For those that are wondering, it will even know the difference between like, \"Hey, your GPU is too long for this case.\" 'Cause, in the configurator, it knows how much GPU clearance, CPU height clearance.\" Buy a flight to Miami now. - The scoring will be simple. We're taking all three systems and running 3DMark Time Spy Extreme to see which one is the best for the budget, while also keeping in mind that these need to be reasonable systems. No cardboard box, at least this time. So I have a little bit of a plan. Micro Center have just announced they're brand new Ryzen 5 7600X3D CPU. Now this is an exclusive CPU only sold at Micro Center. And not that I'm cheating, I would never cheat, but they maybe pulled one aside for me and I don't think there's any more in the store. I think that that's gonna be a lot, hopefully, of CPU performance. Now we're shooting this video on August 31st, so it has just come out. I've not had the chance to actually try it yet. I'm hopeful that if I have a powerful and, importantly, affordable CPU, that is gonna do a lot of heavy lifting for me. So yeah, that's my plan. Shh, don't tell Jay. Hello, what's going on over here. I was perusing the lovely supply over here of stuff. Okay, all right, that's fine. So I think my plan, especially, because I don't want Jay to know what I'm doing, is I'm going to make a mental list of all of my components. So I'm gonna use the handy Micro Center website to figure out, oh, look at these grand opening exclusive deals! So one of the things, if you've never shopped at Micro Center, their bundles are almost always the best deal, because you'll get yourself a CPU, a motherboard, and RAM for typically a pretty big discount over buying them by themselves. I think I should still do the 3D, but that's actually like a pretty good deal. Wait, it's not on the site yet, of course! So slightly nervous right now that I'm gonna have everything that I need. To win this, I really need the absolute best performance while staying underneath my budget. Which, in this case, is really gonna mean getting the absolute best GPU I can fit in my budget, and then maybe not cutting a lot of corners, but cutting some corners. But it depends on if I've got my secret CPU here. They're checking in the back right now to see if they've got the 7600X3D for me. (Austin laughing evilly) It's in the spirit of the rules, right? By the time you watch this video, you will be able to do this. And I'll tell you that Jay definitely was offered the same CPU. Let's go see what Jay's up to. I'm feeling a little bit confident now, so I'ma go and harass him a little bit. (laughs evilly) Do-be-dee-doop-be-doop-be-do Oh! Oh, oh, no. What's wrong? How's the system going? Is it good? Are you done yet? - Pretty close. - So right now I have $450 spent. So- - Is that it? - I spent a lot of money on my power supply actually, Jay, and my 20-terabyte hard drive. Now that I really have to whisper because Jay's listening. I'm going to another part of the store. I'm not playing anymore. Right now I have CPU, motherboard, and RAM for $450, which means I have over $1,000 for my GPU, for my case, power supply, and cooling. So I'm assembling everything for the build. I'm gonna just put this face down just so Jay maybe can't see it. (laughs) If I can fit a 4080 in the system, I think I win. Can I squeeze the budget though? $700 for this. That's a good deal, I think I'm gonna get this, shh. What's like the smallest CPU cooler I can get away with? I'ma take anything that's vaguely cheap 'cause a 7600X3D is not that bad. - It's not that crazy. - Okay. I can also look it up on the website. Oh, it's $45? Hell, yeah, mm! So I'm at $1,200 spent. I have $300 left. I actually can maybe push more than the 7900. Oh yeah, SSD is not gonna be a problem at all. $80 for one terabyte? That's not bad. So I've got myself a TN470, which is a one-terabyte SSD. So I'm not gonna ultra cheap it out. Oh, hello. Open box Open box What's up So this is a G.Skill, which is normally $90. But it's only $72, 'cause it's open box. So that was $80. (suspenseful music) Dollars of money- - Oh, you put back our DVD burner. - Are you here to win or are you here to talk? - I already won. - So I actually have $150 for a case, which is a lot of money for one of these builds. So with my case chosen, theoretically, I am $3 under budget. With a grand total of $1,497 spent, I'm ready to go head to head with Jay and AI. How confident do you feel right now? - Very, okay, let's start with the simple stuff, like drive. - Cool. So I chose the Inland TN470, one-terabyte SSD. It's PCI Gen 4. One-terabyte SSD cost me $80. - I got a one terabyte Gen 4 Crucial P3 Plus for $69. - Where was that? - It's a additional bundle deal if you buy a drive with a bundle deal. - Oh, you did a bundle. - I may or may not have. - How interesting. I feel good about this one. So I am rocking a open-box G.Skill. So this is a MB750G, and, importantly, I saved what? It was originally $90 and I paid 72 for it. - I actually went with the Super Flower 850-watt Gold fully-modular power supply. The reason why I did this, is, one, it's not the cheapest, it's 99 bucks. But if you think about the fact that I already have a cheaper drive than you, like, it starts to add up, right? And because of the fact that I'm thinking about future proof as well, I didn't wanna be stuck with something like, not to point out your 750- - 750 is more than an enough, Jay. I would actually say it's above average. - [Jay] I also read the reviews of that G.Skill power supply. - You're reading reviews? So for CPU cooler, I went with the be quiet! Pure Rock 2. - I didn't see this on the shelf when I was here yesterday or today. - [Austin] I don't know, I walked around the corner and it was sitting right there. - My cooler though is a little overkill. (Austin laughing) I went with the Razer, it's $109, it's actually not- - Oh, that's actually not bad. Fractal North. - Montech 903 Max. Is this you trying to undo all the cardboard shenanigans you've ever done? - No, no, no, no. Can I actually tell you? - It still has wood. - Oh, well what's your final total? - 1479. - I think I've got this. Don't tell Jay, oh. I've got myself 32 gigs of G.Skill Flare X5. Oh wait, is that exactly the same? Oh, you've got Ripjaws. - Does that mean that you went with an AMD build? - What? Whatever could give that away, what? GPU? - Okay. I think this one's pretty obvious. - I think we've already seen each other's. There was no way we were gonna let that- - Not get this $700 7900 XT pass us by. - Just a little inside baseball. I was trying to see if I could squeeze a little bit more budget, but like there's no way to do some things. - I tried really hard to see if I could fit a 4080 Super in there. - Same. - But there's no way. - So that leaves us with only one component left, right? - So the CPU and motherboard. - Oh, two components. - We'll just show 'em together. Z790 motherboard bundle. - Interesting. Interesting. - With the 12900K. - Woo! So I, as you so astutely noticed, I'm going with an AMD build. So this is the Asus- - Very tempting. - B650. - Tempting. - With a very special CPU. (drums rolling) Would you take a look at that? - Oh, oh, we're good, nope, we're good. (Austin laughing) We're good. - [Austin] I, because I'm such a huge fan of our lovely sponsors, Micro Center, and they're exclusive new CPU, this is the first time I'm using this build. - Is that CPU actually out yet? - No, it's not, it is unreleased. - There's the rule bending I told you Austin was gonna do. - No, no, no, here's the thing. You got the same email that I got. Like, \"Hey, do you wanna check out this brand new CPU?\" - I did, but this is a consumer perspective where the consumer can come build this system. - And by the time this video goes live, there will be plentiful stock of this I'm sure. - I got this, 'cause I know how the 7800X3D performs in that same test, and I know how that's gonna perform compared to it with two less cores. I said, at the start of this, that this was Jay versus AI. This is Jay versus Austin now for the sport of it. (Austin laughs) This CPU I chose specifically because I knew that this is a combined score test. - Yeah. - If this was only gaming, then an X3D CPU like that would make a lot of sense. The challenge is about how balanced AI could build the system. - Yes, exactly! - So let's see how it did. - You're just trying to make me feel better because I think we have almost the exact same system, except you have a faster CPU. The real test isn't between Jay and I though. It's about how our systems stack up against what AI built. And, oh boy, this is a system all right. So white power supply is definitely, immediately, the first thing I notice on the all-black system. - Yeah, with the white cables. I'm noticing that RTX card, it's a 4060 Ti, 'cause it's not, as you can see, it's not PCI 5. - What the? So AI built a system with a 4060 Ti? - At $1,500. - What the? - [Jay] Well, here's the thing. So we have a Corsair power supply, an RM power supply, which is expensive. A Corsair 240 AIO H100. - Oh! - [Jay] It's obviously an Intel board. So it's an Intel CPU. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait. How did AI pick these parts? - [Jay] I think it prioritized highest rating. - The prompt was, \"The best midrange system.\" It probably used best as like midrange is my budget, the highest rating. - [Jay] That's a no brainer, like, we've destroyed this in the benchmark. Okay, CPU, I'm curious about that. - Yeah, what is it using? - The 12600K. - What? Dude, that board is almost as... The board is basically as much as the CPU. (laughs) Okay. - Oh, and the 990 EVO? - 990 EVO. (Austin and Jay laughing) - Can we put that in my build? - No. - The H100 RGB Elite? I saw this on the site, this is like 130 bucks. - The case is a Lancool. - It's a Lancool II, yeah. - That's a fine choice. - It's a good case. - If you watch a lot of JayzTwoCents content, you would know that the number one best seller is usually not the best move. - It didn't even consider using a bundle. Like, it didn't understand bundles, it just did individual price points. - Of course, it didn't. AI actually chose a 3060 Ti and that wasn't available, so they- - Replaced with 3070. That wasn't available. So they went with a 4060 Ti. - It does have a pretty good understanding of compatibility. But the problem here is that what you're getting is something which just feels like a really just amateurish kind of list of components. Now, thankfully, the wonderful people at Micro Center are happy to help guide you a little bit better if you come into the store, and probably will not recommend you to build a system like this. - Enough talking about the AI, we know we've won, let's see who won here, which I'm feeling pretty damn confident right now. More confident than I've ever been in any competition I've been in, and that includes \"Scrapyard Wars.\" - Let's build our PCs, shall we? (Austin and Jay laughing) So while I'm putting this together, I have some initial thoughts. I'm very curious to see how the 7600X3D is actually going to perform, because it feels like it's one of those things that in real gaming should be pretty powerful, But what I'm a little bit concerned about is that Jay is probably gonna have an edge in the benchmark, and that's all that matters here is just how it compares in the benchmark. A little concerned maybe, but, you know, a little stress makes you build the PC faster. How are you coming? - All that's left is power supply, and then do the wiring. - Ooh, that actually looks pretty good. So my system is coming together. I'll say it's a little bit, I'll say basic in here. But I do think the fact that I've got the North, it's really gonna help to add for the aesthetic. This has been a challenge for a couple of different reasons. First of all, obviously, I've gotta go up against Jay who doesn't know anything about PCs, but I'm trying to go easy on 'em, you know and kind of- - [Jay] I use AI for all my videos. I don't know what I'm doing. - But the other thing is I'm here solo, so I'm not gonna lie, it's been kind of funny to like go back and forth between shooting, and then realizing like I forgot to install something in the system 'cause I was like messing with the camera. - [Jay] Says Mr. my producer set up for me. - I know, but I'm here by myself! Behold, my friends. (grunts) - Okay, there you go. - [Austin] The system is vertical, thanks, Jay. How many damn fans do you have? Wait, one, two- - Seven. - [Austin] Really? Do you need seven fans? - Yes, 'cause I'm gonna overclock it. - [Austin] I think my much cleaner-looking aesthetic with the North and the air cooling- - [Jay] I do kind of like how the orange on the TUF board sort of ties into the way the front of the wood looks. - Okay, so the build is essentially done. The entire board seems like it matches pretty well. And, thankfully, I actually have an LED switch here so I can turn it on and off if I don't want the RGB. Because besides the LEDs on the graphics card, I don't actually think I have any RGB at all in here, so this is gonna be very stealthy, very sophisticated. I mean, you've got so much more back there. - It reminds me of the old Corsair AIOs where there's like three wires coming off every fan. - Yep, meanwhile, while mine's not exactly clean, there's just so much less going on in the back of my system. I'm not worried in the slightest. Why would I be? - [Jay] Don't worry, I'm a very sore winner. - You're a sore winner and a sore loser? (laughs) Do we have signal? This would be a bad time to find out that I need a BIOS update for my unreleased CPU. It's alive! All righty, and there we go, everything looks good. So with our PCs ready, let's see which one comes out on top. Three completed systems. - They all POSTed. - They all POSTed surprisingly smooth. You didn't have issues like last time when it came to like the BIOS. - Yeah, that was a BIOS update problem. - My system came up instantly. - Okay, so we have to make a correction when it comes to the pricing, 'cause we did get a printout of the prices. So it came in at $1,377.92. I think if they had saved some money still in some of this stuff, they could've definitely stepped up to the same GPU we are. So what we're gonna do right now is we're just gonna take the Time Spy Extreme combined score, the total score, and divide it by price and see who got the most score per dollar. Okay, so let's run the AI test first. - Yeah, that'll be our benchmark. The benchmark of the benchmark. So we're going to be running the exact same Time Spy Extreme test on all three systems. - Ooh, 30s on the FPS at the start. I'm gonna guess that this is gonna be sub 10,000. It's gonna have to be in like a 7,000 range. - And I wanna give it a little bit of credit. I mean, the fact that it was smart enough to make sure that all the components were correct, it did pick everything that was at Micro Center. - Everything is compatible, everything fit. - And like none of the components in this AI system are, on their own, terrible. But when you put 'em together, it's just like a lot of strange choices. - Yeah, almost 60 milliseconds per frame. So it's like 10 FPS, somewhere around there, under 10. - It's slow. - It's not good. - [Austin] 6,079! - [Jay] Okay, graphics was a 6116, and then CPU is a 5881. - Next up, let's try my system. At least, I'll beat the AI. - I can't remember the specs of the 12600, but I wanna say, as long as you start higher than 30s, which you're going to 'cause of the GPU test. - Yeah, of course. - You're gonna be at like 75 probably. 80. - 80, yes! - That's what I was saying, like, it has to be pretty good. So already Austin has beat the AI. Can Austin beat the machine? Yes, he did, by just showing up. So we're looking for you to have anywhere faster than 59 milliseconds per frame. I feel some warmth coming off this thing though. Holy cow, feel in there. Come on, uh-oh! - Uh-oh! - Oh no! - Oh no. - [Jay and Austin] 68-70! - So what we're talking about here is a CPU bench here. Because, in a game, I have no doubt this is going to be a very potent CPU. - Oh, it'd be great. - But we don't care about how it games, we care about how it benchmarks, right? And this is stressing the CPU to its max. I think what I'm losing out here is just the fact that I don't have as many cores. - So you are 30% slower at rendering the frame than the 12600. - Hey, 10,000! - Yeah. You're 66% higher than the AI system. - [Austin] But, importantly, my CPU score is a little bit lower. - It's a 4404 versus a 5881. - Yeah. - I'm gonna pull in like 13,000. - [Austin] No, it's not gonna be that high. - Yes, it is. - Really? - Yes, it is. - [Austin] Uh-oh, you errored. Uh-oh, a pensive JayzTwoCents. - That's weird. - [Austin] As he realizes that there are problems afoot. - I wonder what the error is. - [Austin] But your GPU is exactly the same as my GPU, which just ran. (laughs) - I'm gonna do a restart, 'cause I don't think I restarted after all the drivers updated. - Technically, I am in the lead now. No. - You watch reality TV when like things go wrong and you're just like- - We have no secret producers who are like unplugging things in the background. This is real, legit YouTubing. (Jay chuckles) - Little did I know he was gonna give me- - Excuse me, excuse me, I- - Some Temu version of OS of Windows here. - How dare you? I'm gonna take my drive back right now. (laughs) - 85, I'm five higher than you already. Look, I take every victory I can get, okay? I'm gonna call right now my CPU test. That one was 59, you were like what, 80? 32 milliseconds. I'm honestly anticipating 13,000 plus. 32. (laughs) - Okay, all right. All right, congratulations. - I'm using my AI, it's JayI. - JayI? - Jartificial intelligence. (Austin laughing) 13,000 plus, 13,282. - 12,720! - Ah, okay, whatever. - Okay, well still. - Maybe the 13,000 was with the 13th or 14th gen, but whatever, it still won. - And so it is clear that today, and today only, JayzTwoCents is the PC master. Congratulations. - I'll take it. - I am slightly sad, although I will say that your bundle deal was absolutely, like, that was- - I'm kind of surprised you didn't go with it, but you had already made your mind up on what CPU. - I literally had already had this planned with Micro Center. Like, \"Oh, you got that CPU, put one aside for me at the store.\" So if you would like to check out any of the components that we used for these builds, they will, of course, be all linked in the description. Thank you, again, to Micro Center for sponsoring this video. Check out the brand new Miami store. It is now open, and I can say that it's a very nice layout. - And one thing they're also chock-full of, deals. - Deals, deals, deals, including lots of deals that I don't know that I'll have to VO and put in right now. It is incredibly cool to see a brand new Micro Center in Miami, and there are a ton of deals to go along with that. One of the big ones is if you are a new customer, you can get yourself $25 off of all processors specifically in-store. On top of that, there are also tons of deals that are available at all of your friendly local Micro Centers. So definitely make sure you go check out the links in the description. And yet, again, thank you very much to Micro Center for sponsoring this video. All right, I think we should go give these PCs away. - Let's do it! - Goodbye, my friends. And next time, I'll see you at Micro Center. - Loser. (Austin snickers) (gentle mellow music)",

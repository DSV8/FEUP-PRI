    "transcript": "look ugh mr tape man still has their job although i will say the straightness and the general quality of the tape job has definitely gone downhill so i'm thinking maybe they've received a 10-year position but anyway about six months ago at this point i spent a thousand four hundred dollars on a gaming pc from aliexpress and aside from it being a little bit rough around the edges it was an awesome system although it's been six months and considering that the global pc market's been on a heavy drug binge for like a year now i thought what does a thousand four hundred dollars buy you on aliexpress at the moment is it going to be better is it going to be worse is it going to have flesh-eating bacteria in the box i don't know but we're going to find out today but before we get into that it's time for today's video sponsor that helped me pay for this box tape today's video is sponsored by the elgato wave 3 usb microphone which i'm actually using to record this audio this is what it sounds like when i provocatively whisper into the microphone the microphone uses a premium condenser capsule that picks up audio in a cardioid polar pattern the elgato wave 3 also has a physical volume gain knob right on the front of the microphone making it really easy to adjust your levels on the fly the elgato wave 3 also has a capacitive mute button right on the top of the microphone so that you can shout at your neighbors mid-stream without getting banned on twitch so considering the wave 3's noob friendly plug and play functionality mixed with its excellent audio quality this is an amazing option for anybody who wants to step up their audio game thank you very much elgato wave 3 for sponsoring today's video [Music] now before we de-robe the system and play around with its insides i just want to walk you through the experience that i had with the seller ibsen because it was actually really pleasant when i ordered the system on aliexpress i cheaped out and got the aliexpress shipping and after maybe a day i got a message from the seller saying that they don't trust the aliexpress shipping so they'll give me a free upgrade to the dhl shipping which was i was very excited about that and it meant that the system took two weeks to arrive from placing the order which for aliexpress is real impressive so let's open it up and have a look at what we got now aside from the uncharacteristically amateur box tape job the box has actually suffered quite a beating in its journey with dhl and then another weird thing aside from that is that it has lithium battery warnings on it which would make sense if this was a laptop but but it's not a laptop so yeah i'm curious to see what batteries are in here oh this is a very flimsy box and in there uh we have what looks like a significantly less interesting pc than last time [Music] someone fell out i really like the inclusion of these two little packets of air that'll really make all the difference i don't know if you can see any of this on camera but looking through there there are some worrying things going on the graphics card's actually not installed i'm kind of hoping it's in this box uh because it's it doesn't seem to be in the case but we'll check that out in a second let's first just have a closer look at the system [Music] after unboxing this system i was greeted by this it seems like dhl still hosts its illegal underground pre-built fights however i don't think it's entirely dhl's fault if the seller had used higher quality foam and double boxed the system maybe it would have survived dhl's mild curb stomping but with that let's have a closer look at this interesting looking case the case is definitely less pink than last time but it's still quite interesting i've never seen this case before on the front you've got this kind of like metal metal-ish plate on the front with a bit of ventilation that i don't think does much and then we've got this this plate with the power button on it and some more ventilation behind that and on the top not much going on in terms of ventilation but it's another one of those metal plates the front i o is on the side here which i actually think is a really good spot for front i o especially if you have your system on the desk next to you on the side we've got very restricted ventilation and a dent in terms of rear i o it looks distinctly 2012 gaming system uh we we don't have a graphics card i don't see it lying on the inside of the case i think it's definitely in that other box uh which which we'll talk about in a bit and then finally we have the power supply which is by corsair oh it's a nice glass panel whoa okay there's there's a lot going on in here let's start with the positives we have dual channel ram isn't that nice look oh two sticks i think this is 16 gigs and then right next to that we have an aio it is designed by cooler master and as you can see it's got these cute rigid thin little tubes under there we have a ryzen 5 3600 which is a six core 12 thread cpu and we should get pretty decent temperatures with this aio now when it comes to the motherboard i don't actually recognize this it is an asus b450m which i don't think i've seen for sale locally and it does seem to be quite a basic motherboard you can see that that is not much of a power delivery we have over there under that we have a decent wd 500 gig nvme drive which has this kind of seal that protects the the screw underneath again i've not really seen that before and if you have a closer look at the pcie slot you can see we have some thermal paste splatter i think that thermal paste [__] is a fairly standard feature on aliexpress species because this is the third one out of three that i've seen with it on these front three fans are doing some experimental choking with that solid front panel and these two fans in the top are also definitely not doing anything in fact the only bit of the case that even remotely resembles actual functioning ventilation doesn't have fans on it it's like the only bit of the case that doesn't have fans on it it's a bit of a brave move now up until this point again the eagle-eyed of you would have noticed that there is no graphics card so let's go check out that box and hope that the graphics card's in there now supposedly we we should have an rtx 3060 in here so so let's see what version of the card we got oh that actually looks like a really awesome version of the card oh look at that we've got a tough gaming version of the rtx 3060 and that is quite a good looking card we've got a huge heatsink on here with a very open-air design and on the back we've got some tire tread effect for some reason but i guess you know what they say nothing says premium gaming hardware like roadkill [Music] whoa damn when you take the back panel off you can really see how structural the damage is that it suffered in shipping that sucks this system really got its ass handed to it i think i'm gonna message the seller and see what they have to say about it the rear cable management is pretty good everything's routed relatively neatly around the case and then we have this huge uh fan hub that controls all of the useless fans around the case and then in terms of power supply we have this corosair vs 550 unit it's a 550 watt power supply it's very basic but it it should be okay and it should get the job done so with that let's put the graphics card in here fire it up and see what kind of vd we have on here [Music] okay um every time i see this case i just feel bad for it damn uh but yeah it's the moment of truth let's see if it's still work okay i don't know why that's happening it's it's seizuring quite hard is oh yes we do have a signal out now the ram is running at 26 66 megahertz as opposed to 3 000 megahertz and as you can see no settings were changed in the bios i don't know why they thought that ecstasy induced rave was the best default setting for the lighting wow there really is nothing on here this is a completely virgin windows install that's amazing i don't think i've ever seen that on an on a pre-built system okay i've installed aura creator i've also installed armory crate and looked on both of them it seems like that rgb isn't plugged into the rgb header on the motherboard so we don't have like software control of it i don't know i'm gonna have to figure out how to get it to not be running in a seizure mode so let me just open up the back and have a closer look at what's going on over there okay so we've got rgb problems that we have to deal with which as you all know is my favorite thing in the world to do but anyway we have this fan hub rgb thing which has a bunch of warranty void if removed stickers which is quite funny because for some reason according to them unplugging a fan voids your warranty which is a bit weird but anyway this i think also controls the rgb now there is this controller which i think may change the rgb settings okay well let me actually test that okay so we have the death flashing happening here let's see yes that does change it that is actually really irritating because it means the only way to change it from the just seizure inducing rgb vomit spectrum death whatever is by opening your back panel and and using this little controller now i do think that you can plug this into the rgb header on your motherboard for software control i think that's what this cable is but it's not been plugged in uh it ends up here i think this is the header a few moments later so after an unacceptable amount of struggling i've freed this little rgb header which i assume is the thing that gives this controller a software rgb support i don't know that for a fact because the label is in what i think is mandarin and and i can't read mandarin so i'm just going to plug it into an rgb header on the motherboard and hopefully nothing explodes well nothing's immediately exploded so that's that's good now let's see if we do actually have software control of the rgb because i just want to gauge how infuriated i should be about the fact that it wasn't plugged in uh search for devices it's not compatible with aura sync so that's why it's not plugged in that kind of explains that which really makes that out of the box rgb configuration an interesting stylistic choice but anyway let's see what kind of gaming experience we get with this system [Music] at this point we're about 50 minutes into the session of battlefield v almost at an hour and the temperatures have been stable for ages they're really good this is like the best pre-built gaming temps i've ever had that huge cooler on the rtx 3060 is clearly overkill considering that we've we've barely touched 56 degrees celsius through this entire session which is crazy even the cpu is doing fine at 62c it does feel like there's a bit of a cpu bottleneck here with battlefield 5 at 1080p we're running at high settings and this is with the ram running at 2666 megahertz as opposed to 3 000 megahertz but this has been a very good gaming experience now the frame rate's been jumping between about 110 and like 140 frames per second which feels really good but let's have a look at a wider variety of games and then we'll compare it to its 6 month older brother [Music] that gaming performance is pretty good um i was expecting better for a system with an rtx 3060 in it but at 1080p for more demanding games at higher settings we were still getting a solid high refresh rate gaming experience which yeah that's that's what more could you want right but how does it compare to the previous system that we bought six months ago on paper it seems like it should be clear cut that system has an rtx 2060 in it whereas this system has a 3060 in it however aside from just the graphics card pretty much everything else in that six month old system was better we got a 10700f in there which gives you two more cores we've got a better motherboard a better power supply a better ai oh a more interesting case and it's pink which should account for some performance differential so let's let's do some comparative benchmarks to see how far we've come in six months [Music] now these results had me a bit confused because despite having a faster graphics card the results were pretty much the same and it's not like the ryzen 5 3600 is a bad cpu it shouldn't be holding back the system that much but to test this i re-ran the battlefield 5 benchmarks at 1440p and lo and behold the rtx 3060 based system did pull ahead of the older system now what i thought then was maybe the reason that the ryzen 3600 was struggling was because i was running the two systems in the out of the box configuration the way they shipped from the the ibsen seller uh so the ram was running at 2666 megahertz on the ryzen 5 system so i set the ram to its max 3000 megahertz speed and well it didn't make that big of a difference so yes the gaming performance is pretty similar at 1080p and at 1440p you'll get more performance out of the newer system and then the last thing i want to talk about before we finish off this video is i actually reached out to the aliexpress seller ibsen and i was like hey guys uh did you accidentally check the alleyway beating option while filling out the dhl shipping form because the case came came quite brutalized so they asked me to send photos of the damage and if the pc was still working so i sent them photos of the damage and told them that yes the pc was still working so they then very politely apologized and said that no what we'll negotiate reparations for this problem uh how about we send you 20 bucks what am i going to do with 20 am i just going to like rub it on the bit of damage on the case and hope that it fixes it i was kind of hoping that at least replaced the case because you know it's partially their fault if they packaged the system better it wouldn't have arrived as damaged even though dhl decided to play hacky sack with the package or whatever in their defense at least they shipped the system without the graphics card actually mounted otherwise that thick boy would have ripped that system apart so at the end of the day after six months on aliexpress we were getting very similar gaming performance in fact weirdly similar gaming performance but at least we didn't go backwards right and as is always the case with aliexpress you get really interesting hardware configurations for the money but then there are like huge asterisks behind it you're either going to get a bunch of shipping damage or your ram is not going to work or you're going to have very difficult to deal with rgb seizure happening which means if you're considering buying an aliexpress system which depending on where you live in the world may be one of your best bets but if you're going to go into one of these systems i wouldn't recommend doing it unless you have at least some ability to diagnose problems with a system if you go into one of these aliexpress pcs as a complete noob with no idea how to fix stuff that may be a bit of a route to tears oh and on a final final note i just looked on a local canadian kind of pc shop chain called canada computers and they actually have pretty much the identical core specifications to the system so a ryzen 5 3600 an rtx 3060 16 gigs of ram and like a 500 gig nvme ssd for quite a lot less than what this system cost even after taxing you don't have to worry about shipping because you can just go pick it up at the local shop so subscribe to the channel and comment down below letting me know if you want to see that video comparing like a canadian pre-built to an aliexpress pre-built i think that could be pretty interesting and that brings me to the end of the video so thank you very much for watching and until the next time bye [Music]",

    "transcript": "Wish Marketing Boardroom \"Now, we need to work together to come up with some strategies on how to sell this box of Graphics Cards I found by the river.\" \"Okay sure. We sell it as 'Gaming GPU'. We're just clear about what the graphicscard is and then if people want one they'll buy it?\" You really think you're gonna sell a graphics card on wish.com like that?? You got toconvince me that graphics card is going to cure my marriage-ruining erectile dysfunction!!\" \"Um okay, '4K Gaming GPU?' \"Yeah, that would be great if this was 1752. No one cares about 4K gaming anymore. [Dramatic Music] \"Dear God! That's magnificent.\" [Intro Music] Ah, it's always comforting to see Wish's used diaper bag plastic plastic bags oh wow that went all the way over there but it's fine I'm sure all this plastic protected it. This looks less like a package you'd ship a graphics card in and more like one you'd ship an alien head bong in. Oh yes! Very good. Oh wow. that is a smell oh it's nice of them to add a quick start guide that includes Sage advice like please make sure the computer is powered off and cut off power supply off computer case wao we also get a single six pin to dual eight pin piec C power connector that seems perfectly safe to use and then here's our Graphics Squad that smells like a fire in a fertilizer Factory ooh apparently this graphics card is by dicka saver which is easily the best aib name now aside from the dicka this is a reasonable feeling cooler for what this graphics card is I mean that's some sturdy plastic for a wish graphics card trout and then on the top of the graphics card aside from a couple of copper heat pipes there's only one pcie 8 Pin power connector so why did they give us an adapter for dual 8pins do do we need two of these and then when looking at the I/O it's immediately clear that this isn't just a fake GTS 450 pretending to be a different graphics card that itself isn't fast enough for 8K gaming I think this is the graphics card it claims to be which is an RX 580 it's an 8 gig version of the RX 580 which checks out for an 8K gaming graphics card you don't really need more than a gig per K but it is the castrated 248 SP version of the RX 580 this graphics card is basically an RX 570 but again that is a well-known 8K capable graphics card after the testing I took the cooler off so we could have a quick look at the dicka UN sheathed this is a pretty standard wish graphics card cooler undercarriage they really like just taking a piece of aluminium and cutting some Groove Groves in it for extra uh surface area but because this is a real graphics card and not a fake one we get a couple niceties like some heat pipes and a couple of thermal pads making contact with the uh the video memory and the power delivery oh and there is our legendary Polaris GPU I can recognize that bad boy with my eyes closed uh in terms of the PCB it's a budget graphics card PCB we've got reasonable power delivery uh there's are 8 gigs of video memory that makes this 8K gaming graphics card remember and other than that not a whole lot to talk about except for our 8 Pin power connector this PCB really puts the Savor in dickup with that let's drop it in a system and work our way up to the resolution wish intended which was way more challenging than I was expecting after an initial potential red flag when first firing up the system everything went smoothly I didn't even need to use virus drivers from the seller's Google Drive so now that we've established our wish Graphics got Works we're going to test it in stages starting with a use case it should be able to handle now I'm starting off with CS2 at 1080p low settings this is going to be the easiest test we have this video and well it's not super promising we're getting over 120 frames per second but this is a game designed to run on your granny's pacemaker so um not not super promising for what's to come having said that aside from a couple of pretty big stutters in a vacuum it's running fine and the temperatures are good too now moving over to cyber B running at 1080p medium settings we're jumping around 40ish frames per second not very promising considering that we're supposed to be able to game with this at 16 times the resolution of what's Happening Here but I'm sure the graphics card just refuses to associate with this peasant resolution and it will start to really come into its own as we climb up the resolution mountain or not which is a lot more likely o wow this cutdown RX 580 is just about Clinging On when it comes to Modern more demanding games this is 1080p low settings and again we're hovering around 40 frames per second at least we still have a lot of video memory left to utilize so we've got that going for us which is nice so generally at 1080p this slightly cut down RX 580 runs Esports titles pretty well this is dota running at the second highest preset and it's very playable but when it comes to more demanding modern games it starts to struggle now for us to jump to much higher resolutions we need a display that's a little bit more serious than this 1080p NZXT one I've been using I think I've got just the [Music] monitor I'm going to be using this 48 in 4k LG OLED thing now you're probably thinking D it 4K is a much smaller resolution than 8K and you'd be right but this is the highest resolution display I have lying around but don't worry we'll figure out a way to get that graphics card to render some 8K but before we do that we still have some steps to climb so we've moved over to 1440p here we are with CS2 and well we haven't lost that much frame rate to be honest so even at 1440p CS2 is very playable it's not a great result but usable however moving over to cyberpunk the cracks were already starting to show ooh a game that struggled at 1080p is really not having a good time at 1440p not sure who would have seen that coming but this is with low settings and even at 1440p our 8 gigs of video memory is already almost fully used yeah I think as is expected this 700-year-old mid-range graphics card doesn't do great at 1440p with newer games despite this being low settings but it's just kind of out of its depth here having said that with Esports titles its performance is ad mble still providing a very usable result at 1440p but things are getting scary fast now the performance may have been drop kicked in the crotch but I'm kind of surprised at how well this is going it is just CS2 at low settings but it's hovering around 60-ish frames per second and it's it's really very playable this is not going as poorly as I was expecting but bear in mind 8K is four times the resolution of 4K now hear me out I don't think this is going as poorly as I was expecting yes the performance is a disaster and no one should game this way and we're not at the advertised gaming resolution yet but it's 4K and it's kind of okay but that naive optimism quickly evaporated when I started trying to get the advertised 8K running on the rx580 because I didn't have a native 8K display to use I had to use upscale SC in to get an 8K rendered image to happen something that should be possible using amd's virtual super resolution scaling technology that's designed to let you run the game at a higher resolution than your monitor supports but with the 4K display attached every time I switched GPU scaling on in amd's drivers it would just break the video output I even spent hours trying different versions of amd's drivers but nothing worked I even went looking for an 8K display to buy but the only options in stock cost the GDP of a small country at this point everything seemed hopeless surrounded by despair I knew if I posted this video sans's 8K result the wrath of Gary's will surely assault but then after a full day of struggling I stumbled onto a video by Mike the tech about how to set up 8K virtual displays on your system Oh My Lou I think it finally works thank you so much Mike I let let's please have this be the way we get to test 8K gaming on this graphics card and once I set up the virtual display I had to use OBS to see it this is getting really stupid but this is it now on I was going to say virtual display but I still ran into a problem with CS2 it wouldn't let me select the virtual display as an output option so I decided to try cyber Punk instead oh oh oh cyber Punk is stupid enough to let me do it yes and with a little bit of fine tuning we were ready for some 8K gaming oh that that is all I wanted from this video was to have cyberp punk run at 1 frame per second at 8K on this game on this graphics card and it would have been way easier to do if I didn't sell my Aki um but we finally got there with the most ridiculous workaround ever well actually no this isn't the lowest frame rate I've ever gotten in this game I think we've gotten it down to like 2,000 milliseconds but this this feels pretty wild I'm not going to lie the added latency of previewing the virtual monitor through OBS just adds another level so I'm going to move my mouse now and it's it's not happened it's oh it's starting there we go there we go it's it's happened it's finally happened but after struggling for way too long to get into the settings I realized that we were running at high with Fidelity FX on which meant we weren't technically running at 8K so I dropped the settings to low and turned Fidelity FX off it's still just one frame per second but but it's running way better although if anything it's it's more unwieldy now because of how the input like this there's basically no connection between the input that I give and what happens on screen the menus in The Last of Us was basically unnavigable you had to smack the input continuously for several seconds and just hope that the game registered it but once I finally found my way into a session it was about on par with cyberpunk I.E completely unplayable but then I found a game that kind of was playable hey I finally found an old game that will let us pretend to run in 8k kind of I guess and despite this game being almost as old as I am I think I think it's very close to my age uh at 8K we're only getting 19 frames per second which I guess means this is an 8K gaming graphics card because 8K gaming is happening on it and despite the fact that we've just got 47 milliseconds between each frame the input lag is still terrible like you can see there's there's quite a delay between inputs and stuff happening on the display but I think that's almost entirely because we're playing the game through the preview window in OBS but yeah so with that I guess if you lived 25 years ago and somehow also had this graphics card and an 8K monitor then yeah wish's advertising is perfectly accurate good job well done which brings me to the end of another video thank you for watching if you enjoyed it subscribe to the channel and maybe if you have time watch another video a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next one bye-bye [Music]",

    "transcript": "- We're used to using just one HDMI cable for both high resolution video and super clear surround sound these days. But did you know it wasn't too long ago that you'd need a whole mess of cables to do the exact same thing? Younger folks might not remember these things called RCA cables, which dominated the market in the pre-HDMI days. The nice thing about them is that the connectors were perfectly round so you couldn't put them in the wrong way. But that was about their only advantage. Each cable could carry only one signal, which isn't surprising when you consider that the RCA connector was invented in the 1930s, and was originally meant for record players. This meant you'd need at least two cables just to watch standard def video with mono audio. And if you were watching Hi-def content with 7.1 surround, you would need a total of 11 of these cables. One for each of the three component video signals, and then another cable for every audio channel. No wonder we stopped using them.",

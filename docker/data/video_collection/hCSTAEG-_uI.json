    "description": "Today NVIDIA is launching their RTX 2060 Super and RTX 2070 Super, two cards that are supposed to compete against AMD's upcoming Navi.  Basically the RTX 2060 Super vs RX 5700 should see the GeForce card win and that's the same with the RTX 2070 Super vs RX 5700 XT.  But we can't really test performance with all those cards yet since the Radeon lineup hasn't been launched yet.  Until then, lets check out some benchmarks and see if they're the best graphics cards NVIDIA has released so far in 2019!     0:00: Intro 1:17: Dmitry does a Family Guy impression 1:43: Availability discussion :( 2:22: Pricing & free games  2:46: NVIDIA's new lineup vs RX 5700  4:00: All The Specs Info 4:48: A closer look at the FE cards 6:13: Test system specs 6:47: BENCHMARKS!

    "transcript": "well hello good people Eber here with Hardware Canucks and after AMD announced their Navi GPU architecture and the new RX 5700 XT and the 5700 that is used in Nvidia team green had the perfect opportunity to respond in some way and that's exactly what they're doing now instead of cutting prices of their current RX lineup they're actually replacing almost the entire line up with some new GPUs so this is the RTX super performance review so even before Navi hits the store shelves it'll have to compete with what Nvidia is calling their Super Series and yeah it's a terrible name I really want to know your thoughts about this super branding in the comments but nonetheless these new GPUs have more cores faster clock speeds and in some cases revised memory layout now in Vita is also pricing these GPUs aggressively so that could be the worst possible news for the RX 5700 XT and the 5700 now you won't be able to run out and pick up one of these GPUs right away and I'll get to that shortly first a quick word from our sponsor also I'll be leaving timestamps in the description down below just so you can easily navigate through the video well no they where'd you come from it don't matter it's a path where I'm going well I don't really need a new Mouse right now sure we'll see everybody loves a 4-way hidden d-pad and a cool OLED display plus I'm quite sensitive at 24,000 dpi Plus RGB you got a try what was I thinking saying no to you the MM 830 by Cooler Master the mouse you didn't see coming check it out below alright so let's start with the bad news first Nvidia is taking a page out of AMD's Radeon playbook by paper launching the RTX 2070 super and the RTX 2060 super reviews go alive today and you can place an order for a founders edition but actual availability at retailers and reviews for custom cards will be on July the 9th the RTX 2080 super will follow later in July now if you think about it this is a great business move by Nvidia although I'm not really a fan of it but at the same time it'll also allow us the opportunity to use these super series GPUs in our RX 5700 reviews so at this point the Radeon team should be worried but there's also some more good news this time the founders Edition won't cost one penny more than nVIDIA's reference prices now sure those cards won't come pre overclocked but you can do that yourselves anyways also every rtx Super Series cards will come with two free RTX enabled games so in this case you get control and Wolfenstein Youngblood together they're worth about $90 so it's a pretty good deal so what are these super cards other than a really weird name well let's actually take a look at invidious lineup and what its gonna look like right now the RTX 2080 TI will stick to $1,000 and remain at the top of Nvidia's stack but the rtx 2080 and the 2070 are being discontinued they're being replaced by the identically priced $700 RTX 2080 super and the $500 RTX 2070 super now the rtx 2060 super is a bit of a different approach since it costs $400 but it isn't replacing the rtx 2060 since that card will stick to around 350 dollars this might seem odd but when you pop in these new cards into this you can understand what Nvidia did by discontinuing the rtx 2070 they're saving it from getting beaten by the RX 5700 XT while also introducing a higher performing card at the same price now the 5700 XT slots right between the rtx 27 super and the rtx 2060 super I can see the same thing for about the RX 5700 AMD's $380 card was supposed to beat the Arctic's 2060 but now it has to compete against the RTX 2060 super and that's just $20 more now the 2070 super uses the t 104 core instead of the tu 106 and it has 256 more cuda cores than the RTX 2070 it also operates at much higher core clocks and that should bring its performance right near the RTX 2080 but power consumptions has increased by about 40 watts also some of the rumors were obviously wrong and memory frequencies have stuck to being the same even then the RTX 2070 super should basically give you RTX 2080 performance for 2070 prices the 2060 super still uses CT 106 core but it's now being unlocked to offer almost as many cores as the older rtx 2070 probably the most important change from the rtx 2060 is that nvidia equip this card with 8 gigabytes of gddr3 and a 256 bit interface without that I don't think it would have competed very well against the rx 5700 power hasn't even gone up by all that much either so that's nice so what about the cards themselves well the ones we have are the basic founders editions which don't look all that much different from the original 2070 and the 2060 the heatsink and shroud bill quality is just so much better than the rx 5700 series but the only thing I don't like is the mirror like area and video added when the card is installed into a case it can reflect everything from LED strips to areas where you've tucked away or cables I mean at this point I might as well classify these super cards as a beauty product it really is because it has a mirror on it guys it really does now other than that you have the same eight plus six pin power connector layout on the 2070 super and we are mounted eight pin on the 2060 super I mean you guys have seen these cars before and in my opinion for the looks I'd rather go for a founders edition instead of a custom card from your partner but in this case I just don't like the mirror finish but let me know what you guys think in the comments all right so if you've skip to the performance segment I do want to mention something very important before getting into the benchmarks an actual review isn't really possible without having looked at the way how the RX 5700 XT and the 5700 perform compared to these super cards so definitely stay tuned for a lot more content around when the rx 5000 series cards finally came out let's do a quick rundown of our test system it features a core I 999 hundred x or o'clock to four point nine gigahertz on all cores and Asus X299 Strix eman the board 64 gigabytes of g.skill tried and Z clocked at thirty six hundred megahertz NAC Sonic focus gold 850 watt power supply it's running Windows 10 professional with all the latest updates installed now with that out of the way let's start with some benchmarks this one's gonna be a little bit different I'm actually gonna start with some of the games that people actually play these days including overwatch Rainbow six siege and yes fortnight and pop G and as you can see from these results the rtx 2060 super can't actually beat the RTX 2070 but it comes really close in some cases it also stays out in front of the arctic's 2060 by between 10 and 17 percent now Nvidia claims that they 2070 super is pretty much an RTX 2080 for less money and these first four games show that's almost a case but not quite there's a huge 15 to 20 percent improvement against the RTX 2070 and that'll be very important when it comes to competing against the RX 5700 XT alright so let's move on to some more typical benchmark games with Assassin's Creed Odyssey and as we run through all of these results you'll likely see the similarities to the last benchmarks that means the RTX 2070 super pretty much lines up just below or equal to the RTX 2080 and the RTX 2060 super almost matches an RTX 2070 there really aren't any exceptions to this either with the performance scaling almost linear between the super and non super RTX cards but will that really be enough for what's coming from AMD I can't say that yet since were a little less than a week away from that launch if AMD's published benchmarks are any indication things that are gonna be pretty interesting power consumption is pretty much in line with what we expected relative to performance the RTX 2060 super doesn't really require all that much more juice than the 2060 but the RTX 2070 super almost needs our tix 2080 power input levels so that's something to keep in mind so this one's gonna be a bit hard to conclude since without the rx 5700 series in the charts there's no way of actually knowing how good these cards are having said that we can quickly go over how they compare against Nvidia is current offerings you see right now will the RTX 2070 super is accomplished here is bigger news because you're paying the exact same price as the RTX 2070 but you're getting in return an average of 15 to 20 percent better frame rates now sure a lot of people might say that five million dollars is still expensive and I completely agree with you it isn't cheap but you got to remember that the price still remain the same now with the rtx 2060 super I'm not really a fan of what NVIDIA did with this thing I mean I appreciate that the performance levels almost matched the r-tx 2070 but do keep in mind that they were paying an extra $50 over the rtx 2060 but in return you're only getting roughly 10 to 17 percent better performance now it's obvious that Nvidia had to introduce this card because it's the only way that it can outperform the rx 3700 and nothing more so for now I think I'm gonna leave it here since a lot of these performance results don't mean much until we know how they line up against the rx 5000 series it's great to see how aim these moves pushes Nvidia to do something but we're just gonna have to wait and see how this is gonna help play out so definitely stick around for a lot more content in the pipeline my meatball with hydra connects thank you so much for watching let me know what you guys think about the new supercars from Nvidia in the comments down below I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

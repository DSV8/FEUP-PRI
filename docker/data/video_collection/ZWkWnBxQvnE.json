    "description": "The Fnatic Gear React gaming headset ended up being one huge surprise for us, especially since it comes from an eSports company.

    "transcript": "good people cheap gaming headsets are finally getting good but what is it like using an eSports targeted gaming product in your everyday life it's okay actually I'm really hoping the fnatic react headset is starring in trend where you don't have to be embarrassed by the sound quality and the mics not trash either and despite the branding all over the place they look pretty good my first impression when I saw this was like this is a HyperX knockoff and fnatic are not afraid to be reusing existing frames to save on tooling instead invest that money into sound tuning for the drivers and I can appreciate that and that's reducing their margins further even to hit that $69 price point honestly it is kind of refreshing to see a gaming brand focus on the bare bone essentials when it comes to gaming headset and they are cheaper than the alpha or the cloud 2 yet target the same audience your eyes haven't seen anything like it yet the new Razer Blade Pro 17 packs a beautiful and fast 4k 120 Hertz panel with gorgeous vibrancy and color accuracy with incredible clarity awesome for creative work that will never disappoint with a fantastic future-proof IO as well it's also a touchscreen so your fingertips gets impaction the bezels are tiny the chassis is sleek the fiery keyboard is perfect that tracked by this massive the hardware is epic with RDX man the blade pro 17 is a complete package experience a smooth 4k gaming link below alright so first let's go over the basics the frame feels very familiar with the semi robust build quality the ear cups don't swivel so it's not a comfortable fit around your neck especially given the tight clamping force out of the box size extensions are a bit on the short side I have to wear them fully extended they are pretty flexible but unfortunately do make a bit of noise right at the joints especially on my left side yeah the pop of color inside each ear cup is a nice touch and the memory foam on these is awesome to create a perfect seal around your ear that's it's OK with glasses too but all three of us found the clamping force a bit too tight so I've intentionally been trying to stretch the frame over the past few weeks to loosen them up a bit compared to my Logitech G pro X headset I find the ear padding on the react so much better but the slightly looser frame on the pro-x is a better fit for me however I'm pretty surprised at the comfort and fit of the Kraken X by Razer these are $49 pair and I find them a bit more comfortable because again the clamping force is not as tight as the react but the react sounds so much better the cable is non-removable it's a pretty short one meter for pole connection with inline controls plus an extension is included and I do like that the cables are not braided this minimizes a cable noise and the mic of course is detachable but there's nothing to cover that input I love the rigidity of the mic arm it's pretty serious it's not going anywhere with a standard foam filter included and for 69 bucks I really love the audio coming out of this thing I've gotten a few compliments in cs:go in competitive matches and to be honest I prefer this over the G Pro X headset which is so much more expensive the problem because it's a closed design I just hate not hearing myself there's no way to add voice feedback into the headset so that's my only complaint the funny thing is the G Pro X headset plugged into the same source sounds so much worse and while this thing has the blue voice functionality it still is a pretty poor microphone and it sounds very similar to the $49 Kraken X this is the razer kraken x a $49 headset it sounds very similar to what just heard with the pro x and my current benchmark for my quality for under $100 on the gaming headset is the image 75 won by Cooler Master they really found a fantastic microphone capsule and so did fnatic it's definitely in my top 5 with regards to microphone quality and you could find everything linked in description below thank you very much with regards to sound performance we have great passive noise isolation things too awesome ear padding and whatever bass these push out it is all trapped inside the ear cup but the drivers are specifically tuned to flatten the low end that is on purpose to emphasize other frequencies that actually matter for competitive play a writer Dimitra stop hacking so they are intentionally bright as in lots of detail and clarity in mid and high ranges it's exactly the signature I prefer in multiplayer so hearing someone reload around the corner is crispy AF but I also found to be slightly too sharp outside of competitor gameplay not that my ears were ringing after red that too but I prefer a slightly smoother delivery with my HD v 8x the react is also a closed design so environmental and soundstage expansion is of course limited but that is not necessarily a negative when it comes to wanting to hear only the sound cues that matter to know where your enemies are coming from now just for reference the $49 crack index and the $69 react the sound difference is just insane these things sound money there's no control in the bass Department they are very harsh on the high end if you crack the volume while they react sure they're tuned to be slightly flatter on the bass Department but it still feels much tighter than the crack and X and so much extra clarity and detail out of the react headset the important fact to recognize what the react headset is its competitive sound advantage for multiplayer with an awesome microphone and a killer price points it's not trying to add surround sound RGB other features software USB dongles its bare-bones nature is what makes it so appealing and almost so perfect for the six nine dollar pair this is definitely one of the best in its price class I do wish that they minimized on the branding it's a bit too much and also loosen up the clamping force because out of the box it is way too tight really love what fnatic is doing here in terms of that whole bare-bones direction you're giving us products without any bling just performance make sure to check out links in description below for all the types of headset recommendations at different price points tube I want to be tree thanks for watching check out this other relevant content I'll talk to you guys in the next video

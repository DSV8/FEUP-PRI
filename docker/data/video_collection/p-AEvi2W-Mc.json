    "transcript": "well guys after months of false rumors and missed launch dates it's almost time for AMD's Ryzen 3rd generation Threadripper now AMD has allowed us to share some information and we're calling them for peace so we have the new processors the prices performance and the overall platform but that's not all AMD is finally ready to launch their Ryzen 9 3950x we first saw this debut at Computex but it was delayed due to production limitations on their SEM nanometer manufacturing process honestly there's a lot to cover in this video and I also want to be very honest some news might be a little bit disappointing for you guys but without any further ado let's get into it right after a quick message from our sponsor the be quiet pure bass 500 is a perfectly sized handsome mid tower with the usual silent properties on the front panel and foam on the interior with to quality fans included plus a modular top section to expand the cooling potential give you Hardware a new home with a pure bass 500 ok so let's start with what you've all been waiting for 3rd gen Ryzen ThreadRipper and all of the information I won't keep you waiting any longer but before that I do want to mention something I said when third about to and 3rd gen Ryzen was announced AMD is in a league of their own with this platform nowhere closer to what Intel can accomplish in fact it'll even get worse once 3rd gen Ryzen Threadripper gets announced on November the 25th when it officially launches because these new CPUs will be adding PCI 4.0 and faster speeds but there is one major downside these are some expensive CPUs the 3970X will go for a cool 2 grand and the 3960X for $1,400 that makes them 200 and 100 dollars more expensive than the 2990WX and 2970WX let's see what that means from a spec perspective so we are seeing a price increase for the same number of course but taking a look at these facts it's just crazy I mean it's amazing to see what AMD has been able to accomplish with this platform first of all the combined cash has been increased by huge amount to 144 and 145 bytes from 80 megabytes and that's super important because more data can be stored close to the processing course and that should dramatically increase performance by a huge margin all of that has been backed up by higher base frequencies lose clocks do get a bit of love too now that does mean TDP has increased to 280 watts but expect a big performance increase - another big improvement is the move to PCI Express 4.0 and a general increase in the number of available lanes some of those need to be shared with other devices but I'll get to that in a bit later oh and by the way AMD isn't planning on discontinuing second generation rising threat upper processors anytime soon alright so here comes the bad news while first generation second gen and third gen Ryzen processors and their motherboards were cross-compatible I can't say the same thing with their generation Ryzen threadripper they'll actually be using a new str x4 socket and they'll require a new generation of motherboards based on the TRX 40 platform that means absolutely no compatibility with first or second generation threadripper CPU's or motherboards now before everyone starts yelling at the screen there's a good reason why AMD decided to go with a fresh platform first and foremost this will give them the ability to expand to even more powerful CPUs with expanded core counts also 3rd generation Threadrippers communication to the chipset is handled by eight PCI 4.0 channels that's more than four times what kern first gen or second gen motherboards can offer I mean this Zenith motherboard can't even handle that unfortunately we're hearing that the new TRX 4 motherboards are going to hit new pricing levels because of how complicated they are to manufacture to the in st. memory bandwidth that they pack there is one small bit of good news though since the heatsink mounting isn't the same between tr4 and TRX for existing tr4 coolers will be compatible but only if they support the 250 watt wxc reviews a lot of you were asking Dimitri's threadripper build why he didn't wait for threadripper 3 well now you know now about that platform this thing is a beast guys there's 40 PCI 4.0 lanes dedicated to add in cards and 8 - the chipset link add to that 2 sets of configurable ports that can each be set to deliver either for more pci lanes for Gen 4 and Mimi lanes or for SATA outputs then there's also a hub for for USB 3.2 gen 2 connections the TRX 40 chipset comes into this with another 8 gen 2 ports USB 3.0 connections SATA 6 gigabits per second and another a general pci 4.0 lanes that can be used for other devices finally there are two more flexible hubs that can either accommodate PCIe capacity or SATA 6 all right so let's get into the performance numbers that AMD gave us now just remember that threadRipper isn't really geared for gaming or light workloads it's really meant for high-level parallel computing process or rendering tasks as for instance if you want to render simultaneous 8k footage this is something that you might be looking into I know AMD is showing performance gains against the previous gen Intel 99 8 exe but the new 10 9 8 exe won't be all that much different here you can clearly see why Intel being stuck at 40 nanometer is a pretty big problem even their highest end desktop processors are stuck at 18 cores they're holding on for everything they're worth right now and I really don't think that'll be enough now with thread upper out of the way let's talk about the Ryzen 9 3950X this has been the CPU that everyone has been drooling over since Computex now like I mentioned earlier AMD did delay this processor but it's finally available starting November the 25th a quick update about the specs it's got 16 cores and 32 threads and a huge 72 megabytes of cache while operating at pretty high clock speeds of 3.5 gigahertz base and 4.7 gigahertz boost it'll cost $750 provided retailers don't gouge on pricing and I think that might be the first problem because from what we've been hearing there's gonna be very limited quantities of the 3950X until AMD yields there's some Nana made a manufacturing process I wouldn't be surprised to see this thing you know skyrocket in terms of pricing when it officially launches but what it does offer for the price is pretty impressive so the 3900X is priced at $500 it comes with 12 cores 24 threads and 70 megabytes of cash the 3950X has eight more threads a lower base clock and a hundred megahertz higher max boot speed but it costs 50 percent more so the 3950X has more cores and can run faster than the 3900X but they both are rated at a TDP of 105 watts I feel like AMD might be low balling here because with a 3900X and II does include this which is the wave prism cooler but would be 3950X they actually are recommending this a 280 millimeter AIO we've seen this before and the second a product says optimized for water cooling it's gonna be running hot I hope I'm wrong but we'll see so from a pricing perspective AMD's still offering more course and lower prices than Intel even after they responded with cascade Lake X and here's the thing guys AMD is putting the hurt on Intel since their regular Rison series can now go head-to-head with the X $2.99 high-end desktop platform so basically the 3950X will be priced between the I 9 10 940 X and the I 9 10 920 X and it looks really really competitive essentially with its 16 cores and 32 threads $750 for the Ryzen 9 3950x takes over from the threadripper 2950x and the 2990X there are also a few things that I wanted to mention first of all if you plan on using the 3950X on your system you want to make sure that your motherboard is running the latest agiza 1.0 0.0 0.4 otherwise you're gonna have some compatibility issues also md is implementing a new eco mode it allows you to put the 3000 series cpus into lower power state which gets the most multi core benefits without producing a ton of heat that's really big news for small form-factor builders so according to AMD the 3950 x will perform equal to or better than the 9900k in gaming while also beating the 19 and 20 X by pretty significant margin but something else to note is that this is at 1080p and I'm hoping most folks buying one will at least upgrade to a 1440p screen first I really think this new CPU will be a huge deal for creators and AMD seems to feel the same way it looks like every situation gets a speed-up which is great to see so I'd be able to leave things here because I'm really genuinely excited about what aimed he is offering currently because they really value customers who want performance but also not breaking the bank and the most important thing to consider here is the fact that we were expecting Intel to respond in one way or another but that's not gonna happen anytime soon because they are pushing 40 nanometers to the extent and that is I don't know where it's gonna turn out but I can't wait to get these processors in the studio in fact if you are interested in running some extensive tests or particular tests let us know in the comments down below i'm eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe and hit that notification bell so that you don't miss out on a new video I'm signing off and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

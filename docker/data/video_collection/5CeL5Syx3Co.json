For some Noob-Friendly, Dawid-approved T-shirts, and more, shop   Watch Zach's Tech Turf video about $350 gaming PC (Different video than I mention in this video, but more relevant in my opinion :D):   Here is the Toasty Bros video where they fit an AMD RX 580 into this budget:   Check out my Twitch stream here: //  *Amazon Affiliate links, which help out the channel a lot if you use them. :D* APU: AMD Ryzen 3 3200G:  Mobo: Asrock B450 Pro-4 (Different than in video):  RAM: Patriot Viper 16gb 3000Mhz (Different heat spreader):  PSU: EVGA BR 500:  SSD: Kingston 240GB SSD:  Case: Thermaltake H18:   At the time of filming, this component list costs $378 to buy from Amazon. This gives you enough of a budget to buy a Windows 10 key and still be under the $390 the Amazon \"Gaming\" pre-built cost me.  -Follow me on whichever Social media you don't hate-\r Twitch:  Discord:  Instagram: \r Twitter: \r YouTube:",

    "transcript": "today we're gonna have a full-blown death match between the cheapest gaming branded Amazon crap built and a little concoction of my own [Music] so the challenge for today's video is to build a better $390 system than that Amazon crap build although I think challenge may be a bit of a strong word because considering the specs of that crap built this is probably going to be one of the easier things I've ever done I just want to clarify for this video that there isn't actually going to be a build guide section to this video that build guide will be released on Wednesday I've already filmed it I think that's gonna be really awesome but I didn't want to put like a ten to twelve minutes section of how to build a computer in this video because all of you may not be interested in that and that way we can do more in-depth tests about how well the two systems scale with potential upgrades and things like that and then finally before we get into the specs list I also want to say that because we have a 390 dollar budget for the system there are a bunch of ways that you can go about specking up this PC you could go the maximize performance short term route but sacrifice on things like motherboard quality power supply quality and maybe even RAM amount or you could go the knife battle people on Craigslist for a secondhand Dell Optiplex rod you just drop a graphics card in there and then you'll get great gaming performance in fact I think that's the route that gets you the best gaming performance although you do sacrifice future upgrade ability and then there's the more boring way to go about it which is using an AMD APU but spending more money to get a better power supply a better motherboard and maybe even 16 gigs of ram now the problem with this route is that you do sacrifice short-term performance but getting a nice base system I think is really important at this budget so that you can kind of scale nicely over time with upgrades so with that let's get into the boring system specs that I got for this video now I did buy all of these components at a local shop because you know hashtag support local businesses I can't believe I just did the hashtag whoo my finger is there but what this means is that I had a more limited selection when it comes to especially motherboards so the parts list that I have linked in description below is actually slightly different to the components that I'm using but it'll have the exact same performance because it's the same Ram the same APU and so on and so forth now when it comes to the CPU slash graphics card I'm using the AMD Rison 330 200 G again many of you have probably fallen asleep just by hearing me mention that name but it's a really good little APU and it's going to perform significantly better than what the little crap built was packing motherboard wise I actually ended up getting an Asus B 450 tough gaming Pro now this is a much more expensive motherboard than you should buy at this budget but again this was the only option I really had from my from my local shop and it's not gonna affect gaming performance ram wise I could actually squeeze 16 gigs of DDR for 3,000 megahertz in here now going with 16 gig / 8 gig is very important when you're using an APU because the graphics card section of the APU uses some of your RAM and if you only have eight gigs of ram yeah there's not much to go around and the extra speed helps a lot as well in regards to storage I'm using a 240 gig SSD which is gonna really help speed up the day-to-day usability of the system I really love SSDs power supply wise this is another thing that you should never ever cheap out on in my opinion and that's something where the crap will cheaped out hard but we're using an EVGA BR 500 which is a really nice budget option it's a 500 watt 80 plus bronze rated power supply and what I really like about this power supply is that it doesn't have ketchup and mustard cables and it will easily be able to handle a nice GPU upgrade and then finally the case that I got for this build is is a bit controversial because it may or may not end up in the final product but it's a deep cool matrix city which yeah well we'll get into that that one a bit later on a bit I'm a bit salty about that case and with that very predictable parts out of the way let's do a quick 80s themed build montage have a chat about how the build went and then we can get into the Deathmatch arena of death [Music] and just like that we finished our competitor to the Amazon crap build and I think it looks really good although the eagle-eyed of you probably would have noticed that this case isn't the exact same one that we started off with in the video but that little deep cool case really sucks so I decided to go with this thermal take h17 which is the same cost as the coolermaster case that I've linked in the description of this video so it's not a fancier case it's still a very budget oriented case I really like this Thermaltake h17 although the front airflow on it is really terrible it's fine if you have only the APU in there but the moment that you upgrade and put a dedicated graphics card in there it just can't handle the heat so if you want a case that looks like this I would recommend going for the h18 version which has a perforated front and it should have way better thermals now we need to size up the two competitors and see how they compare on paper before having a look at the benchmarks now interestingly enough there are actually two categories in which our brand new system actually is worse than the crap built now the first one is in the amount of storage because I went for a 240 gig boot SSD in this system we actually have a lot less storage space than the three terabyte hard drive in the crap build the next category where the crap built wins is that it actually has a DVD drive which which our system doesn't in fact this case doesn't even have a space for a DVD drive although in pretty much every other category this little system that we built is significantly better than the crap built when it comes to power supplies the crap built had a terrible 450 watt power supply of PC death in it whereas here we have a 500 watt 80 plus bronze rated power supply with some nice-looking cables we have twice the amount of RAM which for an APU based system is really important and then when it comes to the APU we have a massive upgrade as well we still don't have a dedicated graphics card because of the route we went for this build you know favoring future upgrade ability but the 3,200 G is significantly more powerful than that 9600 in in the little crap field and then motherboard wise we actually upgraded a lot as well as I mentioned in the beginning of the video I did accidentally buy a more expensive motherboard but if you go with a motherboard that I listed in the description below that is still a huge upgrade and then of course there's the fact that we have an SSD as opposed to a normal hard drive so you know our operating system response is gonna be a lot faster and games are hopefully gonna load faster as well and finally we're at the moment of truth how much better does this system compare to the little crap built [Music] and as you can tell it was a little bit like reenacting this song this PC absolutely obliterates the little crap built in some cases it was between three and four times as fast I mean I knew it was gonna be faster right but because we were going the sacrificing short-term performance route I didn't realize it was going to be this much faster than the little crap build the difference between the two with this system it's a little bit like trying to game on like a PC at your local library whereas this is like a decent gaming experience it's just so much better and then because of the SSD and the faster CPU not only does this PC vomit in the crap builds face when it comes to gaming performance but just general desktop usability is also significantly faster things like installing all of those damn game launchers that you need these days like you play and rockstars crap all of that stuff takes so long to do on this little PC whereas it's nice and snappy on on our beast but now let's see how differently these two systems scale with a graphics card upgrade so what I'm gonna do is drop an AMD rx 570 into both of these systems and see how differently they perform with the same graphics card in them [Music] as you can see it performs way better than this system with a graphics card in fact in some use cases this system with the rx 570 is actually slower than this system without the rx 570 in it which I find pretty hilarious and then again aside from just the straight out gaming performance because we have a good power supply in here we could just drop that graphics card straight in but the power supply that comes with this system is so terrible that a I just flat-out refused to ever use it in a PC again because I didn't want to burn my house to the ground and B it didn't actually have supplemental power for a graphics card so even if you wanted to you couldn't upgrade a graphics card with that power supply in it without having to also upgrade the power supply we can see that it wasn't really a deathmatch it was more like pitting a full-grown polar bear against a KFC battery chicken it just really wasn't ever gonna work out for the little KFC battery chicken was it with that subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss the the build guide where I walk you through how to build this nifty little PC by yourself that video will be coming out on Wednesday I also have a couple of videos linked in the description below where other tech youtubers did videos on different approaches that you can take to the roughly 390 dollar budget PC one of them is by toasty bros and the other one is by Zach's tech tough so if you're interested in various options in this price point go and check out those videos check out my twitch stream which will be happening later today I'll have that linked in the description below as well I have a bunch of social media down there as well and yeah until the next video bye bye [Music]",

We call it The Iron Throne and it'll serve us well even after the upcoming storage server is built!

    "transcript": "it's been a lovely two years of worryfree backup and storage but all terabytes must eventually enter the red territory my system health screams for attention my spare is as these have run out and USB sticks are just too small and this whole 100 percent filled capacity will end once and for all welcome home the new iron wolf Pro that 12 terabyte monster from Seagate is how we like to roll in total we have 8 terabytes for 96 terabytes of capacity I can't even comprehend how much that is but I'm excited to setup the safety net for backup so let's do it right into this the new Toshiba access 700 external SSD comes in this beautiful and minimalistic design its ultra portable form factor is perfect for creative professionals on the go and with blazing-fast USB 3 gen 2 transfer speeds and toshiba's excellent three-year warranty reliability shouldn't be a concern check out the X's 700 from Toshiba down below all right so yes we got me another NAS and the reason why we went for something from Synology and not build our own server or do something with 45 drives which by the way we are working with and we are developing our own server in Montreal so stay tuned for all those updates but here locally I just wanted to have something that is going to be future proof that will store or be able to store a ton of footage that is going to last for years and just not have to worry about those red lines peeking out and filling out our terabytes of capacity for backup and archiving because I don't delete any of my stuff everything that I record right now is going to be uploaded to that eventual you know a server so just having as much capacity as available to me is awesome and so we've been working with Synology and Seagate to kind of make this happen so with Synology we got DS1718 so the NAS is pretty awesome it's got a base it's pretty advanced in terms of functionality we have two fans in the back there are four Ethernet ports two of which are ten gigabit per second speeds which are awesome once I get my switch once I get the motherboard that has a 10 gigabit ethernet speeds that's going to be utilized very well right now with my ITX system it isn't but the whole idea of gathering components not all at once but you are slowly gathering things and obviously connecting that to a future system will not be an issue we also have two USB 3 ports at the back for external storage and SATA ports at the back too for connecting everything that there's going to be visible on my network just some options that I appreciate now the reason why we decided to go with DS1817 is because of its size so we have eight bays which is awesome but look at how tiny it is it's about the size of an ATX motherboard and height-wise is just the height of one of the drives so that's awesome I can stash this under my bookcase you know out of sight out of mind I don't need a server rack I don't need additional case somewhere so the convenience factor is a bonus to me and while yes it is an expensive piece just enclosure itself is about hundred dollars and then the drives themselves are about $500 apiece you know the whole combination becomes a bit expensive but the convenience factor of just having the enclosure and being able to plug in the drives and have everything set up automatically it's kind of a bonus to me and I'm already familiar with the DSM interface from Synology so using and setting everything up is just simple the NAS also comes with two ethernet cables a set of lock keys for those front bays and instead of screws for a two and a half inch drives and a power cable now those twelve turbine capacity drives are awesome because I was able to fill 12 terabytes in about a year and this is with conservative archiving so deleting some things that I know I might not be able to use and now I don't have to worry these drives have a five-year warranty and 300 terabytes of user workload data rate per year I will not be able to come even close to that usage statistic now it was extremely satisfying populating all those eight drives into it actually I really appreciate the toolless procedure with those brackets on the side and yeah it was time to power the sucker on plug this thing into my router it's still going into a basic router so I'm not receiving the full benefits of the speed I am limited to one gigabit per second transfer rights because of that router but still knowing that I have a lot more capacity and bandwidth above what I'm currently using is awesome for the eventual time when I upgrade my router and the motherboard to support the ten gigabit per second speed now the entire setup procedure is super simple but the most important thing is naming your server I think the name of come up with is super fitting the Iron Throne is now alive and after entering the nas all eight drives were detected that's excellent news and for my storage volume I decide to go with raid 6 which gives me two disk redundancy which means if two discs fail I can still recover the entire volume but for for high-end hard drives like the eye room of pros you know I'm not expecting anything to go wrong but I still have that peace of mind because I will be migrating my entire volume you know there is no additional backup aside from this one so hopefully everything goes smoothly and so far with my DS 16 play no issue is there now I will say the noise levels of the NAS with a drives populated inside is audible it's not something that I was expecting or prepared for because my DS16 play is super quiet can never hear it but it's something to keep in mind if you are like putting it on a shelf and you can hear the stuff so I will be putting it at the bottom where it's not visible and not audible so just something to keep in mind and so the Iron Throne lives 65 terabytes of usable storage remember we are using 2 disks for redundancy so that storage is not being counted for the total capacity but sixty five terabytes is awesome I can finally offload all the archived footage and video projects from my USB sticks into the NAS but I'm so excited because so much weight has been lifted off my shoulders this additional 65 terabyte buffer means that for next like two three years minimum we won't have to worry about even filling half that capacity and so now I just you know it's awesome I love it and so big thanks to you Synology and Seagate for making this whole thing happen you know storage stuff usually is not that exciting but when you're dealing on something of that scale four terabytes that's pretty damn exciting alright guys hope you enjoyed this one make sure to check out this other relevant content make sure to subscribe to our new boot sequence Channel and that yeah I'll see you in the next video that will be fully backed up nothing deleted these are the days yeah",

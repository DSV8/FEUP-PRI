    "transcript": "hello my friends good people you know we're always told that's not about your camera it's all about your creativity and what you can do with it and while I agree today my friends today is all about the gear so recently went through a platform shift no longer the Panasonic gh5 oh I love this thing we're now capturing things with a Sony and it has been a really interesting experience it's almost like going from a Mac to PC you have to learn all the new settings you have to kind of miss out on the features that you're so familiar with but still the a7iii is my camera of choice for now I want the advantages of me getting this whole new system has been really challenging myself to utilize this camera to its full potential taking advantage of that autofocus which has you know never been in my production schedule at all but now like doing things like this makes it so much easier of course I cannot see myself but I trust that it's in focus right on my face but also this whole new eco system gives me a challenge of trying to do something different and also you know given me that creative law additional Drive so while I know what the gh5 is capable of it gives me that extra low push when it comes to new gear to try something different and it also brings me joy all right your people so in today's video let's talk about the gear the what the why and the how and just for reference all the gear and the links to purchase will be listed in the description below so if you're looking to upgrade your arsenal be my guest and also make sure to check out the playlist about our behind the scenes series where we talk about lighting tripods and the rest of things that were not covered in this little segment about this Sony upgrade all right so put the past six months I've been using a Sony a7iii I've taken two Computex we're gonna be taking it to CES and my experience with it has been extremely satisfactory because it removes the element of like tried to think technically in terms of what I need to do so autofocus is a big thing with a change v we had the flip out screen so that's a big thing but I have to be sitting very close in order to focus on myself so with the Sony I'm allowed to or able to use 55 millimeter the 85 millimeter lens is something telephoto and still be tack sharp and focus because of that face tracking and that has allowed me to do things like this hello I'm looking for some fans well now I know autofocus isn't everything and I never use autofocus when doing b-roll of product stuff I always manually focus make sure that I'm exactly where I need to be but for on-camera segments like this with native Sony glass it has been absolutely incredible set and forget and just talk and waiting your camera system comes new lenses of course that is an important part of the equation for the whole ecosystem and this is something that I've always told myself to purchase good quality lenses that I can afford because most likely that will outlast the body or I will most likely upgrade the body later but we'll keep the lenses and I'm afraid to admit it but I've never bought this many Prime's in such a short amount of time for any other camera system not for my canons and also my Panasonic's not my Fugees but because the sony is a full-frame sensor utilizing the 18 to 35 doesn't give me the full advantage so I have to go with full frame glass that covers the entire sensor and the 28 f/2 was my very first lens for the sony 873 and well in Taipei I found an amazing deal on the 85mm at 1.8 what an incredible portraiture lens this is my second lens in this Sony system it's awesome for people beautiful compression nice bokeh but it's actually not that bad for tech products you know I haven't been able to achieve shots like that with any of my other systems and it's nice to have full frame once again and my last prime here is the Zeiss 55 Miller at 1.8 to complete my entire range 28 on the wide-angle the 55 member for that medium and 85 for the telephone portrait stuff but the Zeiss 55 Miller is considered to be one of the most detailed lenses in the world in that 50 millimeter focal range and I absolutely love it the shots I can get with this for technology products it's absolutely incredible to capture that really fine detail it has that really analytical character you know the bokeh is very smooth I actually prefer busier bokeh but the detail out of this thing is absolutely gorgeous and so my most used lens is the 28 millimeter f/2 because a beautiful bokeh separation I can get real close has all that face tracking and my latest lens is the 16 to 35 f4 f4 is not really an issue on a full frame sensor I can get still get that nice subject isolation and beautiful bokeh plus I can revert to my primes if I really need that I have like 3d effect with really insane bokeh but 16 millimeters on the full-frame sensor is absolutely insane a really unique wide angle perspective I love this for vlogs in the 28 millimeter for one I'm doing things that they're more stationary Plus this thing has in body or in lens stabilization plus the in-body stabilization so it gives me a little bit smoother footage versus if I wish to use this it's a little bit shaky and so those are my lenses I know it's a little overkill I've never had this many Prime's in my entire video production career but I use a 28 millimeter the most the 16 to 35 for doing block stuff the 55 millimeter is a beautiful compression nice reach there and I can get a little bit closer to the subject and 85 if I really need that beautiful background compression and nice subject isolation as long as I'm further away from the camera because the macro capabilities on the 85 Miller are not that great now my favorite thing about the Sony camera would be the form factor it's super compact it's much lighter and smaller most of my gh5 which was already pretty compact no issues traveling but now with these prime lenses which are super light by the way I can basically travel with the same weight with those three primes as I would with a gh5 and the 18 to 35 now the four key image on the sony is absolutely incredible skee sensor I think the down scales up to 4k so it is more detailed than the gh5 the colorscience everybody complains about sony color science but they've pretty much fixed it here I use PP 6 and just bring up the saturation a little bit add little blue into my shadows so it's not super warm and that's exactly the look I'm going for it's been what I've been doing with the the gh5 shooting in natural profile and just bumping up the saturation a little bit in contrast so in terms of the color science while the Canon delivers that beautiful out-of-the-box image that you can upload immediately without any color grading I don't mind doing a little bit of work and no no no complaints at all about the color science from the Sony camera the slow motion feature is awesome 120 FPS at 1080p resolution well it's not as good as on the gh5 in terms of the actual 1080p image quality the gh5 is much better with that plus we have 4k 60 so you can get those really nice smooth cinematic 4k 60 shots you know slow them down to 30 P or 24 P I'm okay with the Sony because I usually shoot at 120 frames on the gh5 as well and I don't see that as a compromise what is a compromise though is the frame rate so if you're shooting at 4k at 24 fps you're utilizing the entire sensor but if you're shooting at 4k at 30fps to get that slightly smoother motion then the sensor crops in a little bit and I hate that and so how about we talk about things I don't like starting with the screen at the back I don't care if it's articulating you know it'd be nice if there was a flip-out screen it's okay for now plus autofocus works no problem what I don't like is the actual pixel quality of that display I think the screen of the gh5 has ruined me because it is so sharp I know exactly where my focus point is with the Sony I need to enable focus peaking in order to see where my focus is because the pixel detail I guess in video mode is so bad you have to rely on other tools in order to know what's in focus and that's a big compromise furthermore to company this whole screen issue since you cannot see yourself many people choose the HDMI display you can route that into the camera so you know what's happening especially when doing things on camera when you do that face tracking is disabled which is completely stupid since it kind of defeats the whole purpose so if let's say if you're moving your hand around or there's a slightly closer object the camera most likely will focus on that area instead of tracking your face and the same thing happens when using the app on the smartphone to control the camera you cannot even tap the focus which is ridiculous you can do that with so many other apps and face tracking is disabled when Wi-Fi is on come on I guess there is no perfect camera we just have to go around these compromises and actually be aware of this compromises so hopefully if you're thinking of the Sony a7iii these are my main kind of gripes with the camera and for the first three months you know what I'd say when I had the display plugged in if I move my hand closer to the camera would focus on that instead of my face and I was wondering why when face tracking was disabled all along all right enough about me let's see what Ebers get I think I need a change guys I picked up the Sony a7 iii Dmitri sold me on it to be honest actually there were a lot of good reviews on this camera online and it was just a matter of time but hear me out for a second I've been using this e100 for the past four years and when you look at the system it looks amazing I mean it's a beast of a camera I absolutely love shooting with this system because it had a lot of great features first and foremost built-in ND filters cannot live without them also built an XLR input so I can directly plug in my shotgun microphone into the camera it has a great preamp so I don't have to worry about recording audio externally and syncing and post it just helps a lot when it comes to the workflow standpoint but then I started traveling a lot this year and I had to actually end up travelling with two different cameras so I picked up the Canon a TD this one is something that I picked up earlier this year and a fantastic camera for the price it the dual pixel auto focusing system in this camera is just it probably way better than the Sony a7iii and overall you know for Stills and for video it's it's again all around an amazing camera but if I were to compare the images of the ADT and the c100 the scene when it actually does a lot better because in a dynamic range is better on this camera compared to the ADT so it was like switching back and forth and it just it wasn't feasible because I had to show a lot of vlogs with this camera and when it comes to b-roll I just switch things up to the c100 and again didn't really make that not much of a sense and talked about traveling with these gear it's just not practical because I had to cram everything into this small backpack that I carry and it just I didn't really enjoy my experience especially traveling with traveling with both these systems and for events and stuff so I thought really hard I gave did a lot of research online and I ended up actually pulling the trigger I was so close to putting in trigger on the Blackmagic pocket Cinema 4k because when you look at the samples online it is ridiculously so good I choose raw video and the color science is just oh my god you know I was looking at the gh5 it and it seemed like a pretty good option but then micro four-thirds was something that was holding me back still a great sensor and considering the specs on the a7iii for the price it just was a no-brainer in fact Dmitry was shooting with this camera for a really long time and so you know just looking at his videos it just made me want to switch to something a little bit different because I was looking for a system that sort of replaces you know the c100 and the ATD so that's why I had to you know go for something like this now I have to take a few compromises one I don't get built-in Indies and I don't get built-in xlrs but I had to invest in a few other things so I ended up picking up this variable ND filter that actually does a really good job you know for my Sigma lens and also had a step-up ring for my 28 mil that I have right now I also ended up picking up this Sigma MC 11 MC 11 adapter it's a sony e-mount - a canon EF lens adapter and it basically adapts my Sigma lens without a problem on the sony camera so that's awesome now in terms of audio i ended up picking the zoom h5 which actually does a really good job with my shotgun microphone the audio quality is fantastic I'm not really compromising on the quality sign but the only thing is I have to sing the audio in post which is an extra step but I'm willing to take that sacrifice what I'm really impressed with the a7iiiis the image quality the 4k image is just out of the world's way better than the c1 who did much more sharper because if you think about it it's a six case sensor that down scales to 4k and you know you wouldn't be wrong or you wouldn't go wrong with this camera at all because you know if you're looking for a system that can shoot a great video you know a7iii is a great choice but no camera is perfect but I'm just willing to give this a try and I'm looking forward to spending you know the rest maybe two or three years shooting with this camera so now I don't have to carry two cameras at the same time when I'm traveling I can just rely on the ACM and three because it's compact its portable it also shoots great video so I can just toss this in my backpack hit the road and it'll ease my life a lot better well that's been pretty much my experience with the a7iii I'm really enjoying it so far back to Dmitry Thank You Eber I think it was about time to retire the c100 and welcome to the Sony camp and with this whole upgrade I realized that my expectations for a full frame look were not as they were before I used to shoot on the 5d that was a beautiful image but now I've gotten so accustomed to the gh5 the micro four-thirds like sensor size I tend to stop down my lenses to achieve like a similar look instead of having that super super shadow that's a field because you know I guess our tastes change as we move from one camera system to another and it's almost like I'm trying to imitate the gh5 aesthetic on the Sony camera while also implementing those full-frame beautiful depth of field look on the Sony and just as well alright so that is my gear I think I'm becoming a lot more efficient doing trade shows CES Computex I mean whenever we do anything travel wise because the camera is so light lenses are super compact we have autofocus fantastic low-light performance excellent 4k image nice slow motion until known as good as the gh5 but we compromise there a little bit and yeah I'm pretty happy with the Sony a7iii if you have any questions about the system let me know in the comments below I'll make sure to chime in as much feedback and you know opinion about the whole system as possible I'm with Dmitry thanks for watching make sure to check out

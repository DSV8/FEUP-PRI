    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Overclocking computer components has gone from exclusively the domain of enthusiasts to something anyone can do with a couple of mouse clicks. And this has been especially true for RAM. Thanks to Intel's Extreme Memory Profiles, better known as XMP! But XMP hasn't seen a significant update since 2007. So the powers that be decided it was time to finally give us one with a new XMP 3.0 due out with the release of DDR5 memory. To understand why XMP 3.0 is a big deal, it'll help to give you a quick primer on what XMP is to begin with. So you know how when you buy RAM it has a speed and a set of timings listed on it. Well, if you've ever plugged a new stick of memory into your motherboard, you might've seen that it defaults to a much lower speed. This is because each generation of DDR Ram has a default speed that's set by an industry body called J DEC or JEDEC or JEDEC. I'm on three hours of sleep, Andy. To ensure stability and compatibility. This is the speed your Ram will run at unless you change your settings. XMP was devised partially as a way to allow users to quickly set the Ram to the advertised speed instead. Ram, that supports XMP has a very small amount of internal storage that contains XMP profiles from the factory, with one of them matching the advertised speeds and timings. To set it, you simply need to find the XMP setting in your bios, often on the front page, and the system will automatically apply those settings for you. Although it's \"overclocking\" in the sense that XMP makes the Ram run faster than the base JEDEC specification, you shouldn't have stability issues since the modules themselves are designed to run at the speed printed on the label. Although XMP is an Intel technology, it's also been implemented on AMD motherboards as AMP, DOCP, or EOCP. So if you have a CPU from team red, look for one of these settings in your bios instead, and you should see an option to enable the correct speeds. But how exactly does XMP 3.0, improve upon this? We'll tell you right after we thank Secretlab for sponsoring this video. Secretlab chairs are engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play. Their new TITAN Evo 2022 chair has four-way lumbar support, ultra comfortable lines of different seat materials and more. All chairs come with up to a five-year extended warranty and a 49 day return policy. Head to link in the description and check out Secretlab today. So XMP 3.0 is supported by Intel's 12th gen Alder Lake CPUs, which also support the aforementioned DDR5. XMP 3.0 will improve on the existing XMP scheme in a few ways. First, it'll raise the number of profiles you'll get from the factory from 2 to 3. So it'll be easier to tweak your modules to determine which profile gives you the best blend of stability and performance for any given application. Blended up. Get me some froth. Not only that, but the additional onboard storage dedicated to XMP will allow for two more XMP profiles that you can customize. So if you're more of an enthusiast overclocker who wants to do additional tweaking to get the most performance possible out of your Ram kit, XMP 3.0 will make it easier to save profiles you've tested on your own, and you'll even be able to rename them to avoid confusion. Wow technology. But aside from making the overclocking experience more convenient, XMP 3.0's new features could also result in real performance benefits. Alder Lake CPUs have something called dynamic memory boost, where the system can detect if the application you're currently using, could benefit from boosted Ram speeds and adjust them accordingly. And if you're running an AMD CPU, vendors could offer XMP profiles tuned more specifically for Ryzen, as the CPU's are notorious for being more sensitive to Ram speeds than their counterparts from Intel. Of course, XMP 3.0 is only going to be available for Intel platforms to start, but we'd expect it to appear on AMD platforms once Zen four is released sometime in 2022. Just don't go too crazy tweaking your overclock, as there's nothing extreme about frying your motherboard. Guys, thanks for watching this video. That was very extreme of you. Now give me the extreme likes up, the extreme dislike, if you extremely hate this video.

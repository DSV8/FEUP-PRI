    "transcript": "- Yeah, but you're gonna show us something about like, is it Wi-Fi 6, or? (pop music) Wanna shake the ground Wanna break away, let loose I'm tired of waiting Gotta make that move All the neon signs Now they shout to me and you To write our story Wanna shape the new Do you wanna, do you wanna Come along with me Come along with me Do you wanna - Hey everyone, David Bombal coming to you from San Jose. I'm at the DevNet offices. Very happy to introduce you to Adrian. Adrian, you better introduce yourself properly and tell us you know, DevNet, what do you do here? - Perfect, thank you so much David. First of all, I'd like to thank you for everything you do for the Cisco community and for all your followers, and that's really appreciated over here, so great thanks on that. So my name is Adrian Iliesiu, I'm with DevNet, I'm an engineer on the team, and I'm gonna just show you guys around on what things we do here, a couple of demos, and then I'll have some of my colleagues show you also what we're doing. Hopefully you find this inspiring. - Yeah, I mean you're going to show us something about like is it Wi-Fi 6? - It is, so first time ever, right? This is ground breaking, nobody has seen this before. So, Wi-Fi 6, right here in the DevNet offices, I have here a demo for you. So I have two Samsung phones, one is Wi-Fi 6 enabled, here on the left hand side, and one is old school 802.11ac. Right, so you can see here we have a 4k video, you see the statistics, there's no drops on the Wi-Fi 6 of course, and then there's gonna be quite a number of drops and poor quality on the AC one. - [David] So what I'm looking at here is the new wireless, is that right? - It is yes, so Wi-Fi 6, which basically brings wire to the wireless, right? So we have transfer speeds, in this case we see here 92 megabits per second. - [David] So that means the drops that you've got there, you've got drop frames one out of 11,000 or something? And then, this is the old, which wireless have we got here? - [Adrian] This is 802.11ac so this would be the AX, right, the new one, the Wi-Fi 6, and then the AC Wave 2 here with 28 megabits per second, 73 drops, so it's actually not doing that bad in our test, in some cases it was doing much worse, so. - [David] But, I mean, there you've got like one out of 12,000, that's amazing. - [Adrian] Yeah. - [David] And what's the speed here? My eyes aren't that good. What speed are we getting here? - [Adrian] So it's like 103 megabits per second. - [David] Wow. And that's compared to here. - That's 30 over there. So, three, four times we've seen, easily you get five times more transfer speed with Wi-Fi 6. And then, once you start getting these Wi-Fi 6 chips into laptops, tablets, then you'll really see the advantages, 'cause like I said, this is brand new. Only, I think, Samsung S10 has the Wi-Fi 6 chip in it, but as companies start putting out laptops, and phones and tablets with Wi-Fi 6 chips, you'll be able to take advantage of the new technology. - So, these phones that you've got on the desk here, what are these? Samsung S10s? - So, these are Samsungs, one is an S10, and one is like an S7, and then the access point that's actually doing everything, it's that one right there. So that's the Cisco Catalyst access point. Brand new, Wi-Fi 6 enabled. There's gonna be a lot of goodies for developers on this type of access point coming up this year. So, you're gonna be able to run applications on it. You'll be able to get statistics from your clients, like streaming telemetry type of statistics from it. So, there's gonna be quite some nice goodies coming up on the wireless side. So, let me just show you also over here, the clients, how they're connected to the AP. I have the two clients here, the two phones, Catalyst 9800 CL Wireless Controller, so its the virtual controller, and I see my whole client here connected on the AC and then 11ax for the other one. (electronic music) That's pretty much what I had to show you on the Wi-Fi 6 wireless side. Brand new controllers, brand new access points, Wi-Fi 6 enabled. A bunch of developer-related features coming up with this devices. - Do you want to tell us more about the developer features that are coming, or? - Yes, so like I was saying, you'll be able to run applications on your access point, right? So, you have that option. There's gonna be also statistics that will be streamed from the access point in regards to the clients that are connected. So, this is also a first. We've never had this, actual wireless statistics from the clients. Why have they connected to the specific access point? Why are they roaming, right, when they're switching between access points, the single strand? So, there's a lot of statistics and information that we've never had before. They will be able to get access to, and then start improving location services, I mean, really, the sky's the limit, with all this new information, you can pretty much things that we haven't thought about yet. - [David] So what APIs does the, are the APIs on the access point or on the controller? - So, the APIs will be on the controller, and will be also integrated with the DNA center. So you'll get access to them, also through the DNA center REST APIs. So, that's how you'll get access to the clients, the wireless clients. - So you said more from, do you think it's, I mean, you said developers will come up with all kinds of cool applications. Do you see it more from monitoring, or you can configure the access point through a script, like a Python script or something? - I mean, of course, yeah, monitoring is the easiest one, right. Everybody's doing it. Automation, all of that. But then, I'm also seeing, personally, I would like to see people improving location services with this, right, 'cause you get statistics and information from the clients that we've never had, like I said. So, I'd like to see some improvement on location-based services coming out of this. And then, really, I mean, like I said, \"sky's the limit\". We'd like to see the community, what they come up with, because I'm sure there's things that we have no idea, but somebody's out there thinking about it, and we'd like to see that. - And what APIs does it support? Is it like NETCONF or REST API? - So, it's REST APIs at the beginning. I'm not sure about NETCONF, it's probably coming up. But first released are gonna be REST APIs. - When is this available? - So, this is gonna be announced at the end of April. So, you're getting, like I said, a sneak-peek preview over here. First time ever. We're what, two weeks away for this from the actual announcement? And then, they'll be able to also be ordered at that time, I think. So, you'll be able to place your order at the end of April 2019. - In your tests, like you showed us on the phone, the big advantage of Wi-Fi 6 is speed. Or is that right, what do you think? - So, there's several advantages with Wi-Fi 6, right. The speed is, of course, one that's really visible to everybody, but then there's the power saving on the battery of the devices. That's another big advantage, right, so these chips are more power-efficient, right. So we have the power, then there's also, we see a lot of utilization, especially with Wi-Fi 6 in IoT environments. There's a lot of new technologies that are involved with Wi-Fi 6 that allow low-powered IoT devices to be connected for a long time. There's new features, with a sleeping timer, specifically for IoT devices. So yeah. Power. Speed, of course. Latency. So, improved latency. Pretty much like 5G, right, on the carrier side. - And are you really excited to see what people do with this new technology? It sounds like-- - Of course, of course yes. And, like I said, specifically on location-based services, 'cause, I mean, it's been, people have been struggling to get this wireless-based location accurately, right. So, it works. It works, but it can always be improved. - So Adrian, what kind of applications do you think people will come up with? Have you got any examples that you've seen or you guys have worked on? - David, so yeah, with Wi-Fi 6 we're seeing a lot of, because of the more bandwidth, right, so the 802.11ax brings more bandwidth, lower latency. It brings OFDMA technologies for better bandwidth utilization. And there's also, on the application side, we've seen adoption of course on high-definition videos, like we've seen in our demo than on the AR, VR apps, right. So, we're seeing, hopefully, an uptake on that, and developers will be able to take advantage of the improved latency and bandwidth, higher bandwidth to actually deploy AR and VR apps on the end devices. So, we're expecting that to grow quite a bit. Another advantage of Wi-Fi 6 would be the higher density. So, in high-density environments, like stadiums, schools, these new access points are able to accommodate much higher density of clients. - It's like all these new technologies, isn't it? We can think of ideas, but it's the developer community that really comes up with their own, cool, interesting, you know, use cases. - Definitely. So, we give you the technology, we give you the APIs, and then what you decide to build on top of them, then that's really up to you. And we try to inspire you with projects like this, right, and we'll see other demos today. So, getting the community inspired and really would like to see them, what they're gonna come up with next. - Brilliant, Adrian, thanks so much for sharing. That's brilliant, thanks. - Thank you so much. Do you wanna, do you wanna Come along with me - So why is Wi-Fi 6 better than previous versions of Wi-Fi? Come along with me Do you wanna",

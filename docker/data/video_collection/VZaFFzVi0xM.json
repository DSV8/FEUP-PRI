    "transcript": "- [Madison] Wait. Oh no! Okay, wait. - Did you find the hole? - [Madison] Yep, I found the hole. - As you guys know, I recently did my Intel home upgrade. And I got a lot of massagers and a lot of you guys complained that why do I get some useless stuff? So I got this. Predator Gaming Chair with OSIM. It's a massager chair for gaming. A lot of you guys probably not familiar with this brand, but I'm growing up in Taiwan and almost everyone know what OSIM is. They make a lot of high-end massage chair. Almost every family will have a massage chair. Why not? So let's open it up. So why do we need a massage chair for gaming? Well, it's science, okay? IPSOS report that 88% of gamers indicated that an ache-free and relaxed body would enhance gaming performance. I was one of them. So now you think massage chair is too much? It's too extra? No. I think it's essential. Oh, wow. This is huge! Look at that. It's huge! Here's the wheel. That's okay. Ooh. Oh my god, it's so heavy, because they have all the massage balls in here. When you get a massage, it's like this, right? So they have the balls, so it can feel like a real hand. Apparently. (grunts) This is so heavy. Oh, look at the texture. Okay, this part is bouncy. Fell the balls? Look at the balls. Gaming. (Dennis groans) So this was the blue one. Apparently they have black, blue, and orange. Okay, where's the instruction thing? Ah. Where's the instructionS? Wait, there's no instructions. Oh, here. Okay, it's gonna take me a while. - [Jono] Do you want some help building? - Yes, I need help. I need a lot of help. Who is my helper? - Hi. - Oh my god, no! Why do I get this? - [Madison] Oh, we're building the chair. Okay. - [Dennis] Do you know how to build chairs? - [Madison] Oh, yeah. I'm proficient. - [Dennis] I don't know how to read. Can you read this? - You don't know how to read? \"Make sure you do not operate the product in environments with high temperature or high humid.\" Step one. No, this is not- - [Dennis] No, that's not... - [Madison] Is this how to build it? - Yes- - This is how to build... No, this is just the part- - [Dennis] Yes, this is how you build it. - [Madison] No, this is just the parts. - [Dennis] Yes, how to put the wheels on. - [Madison] \"Place the backrest assembly on the rear side of the seat\"- - [Dennis] Okay, don't just read it to me! I need- - [Madison] You said you couldn't read! - [Dennis] I need you to screw- (Madison sputters) - [Madison] Yeah, we have to put them on this so we can screw them into the side panel things. You're supposed to slide. It says slide. - [Dennis] Oh, slide? On top? - From top down. - Oh, there, there, there. I got it. - Yeah. And then there. Wait. Yeah. No. Yeah. Maybe. Where's the hole? - [Dennis] We'll be back in five minutes. - [Madison] I can't find the hole! - [Dennis] It's pretty tight. (Madison snickers) It's so dusty here. - [Madison] \"Do not operate the product in a dusty environment.\" - [Dennis] It's okay. Go in there. I can't... - Does it not wanna go in? - I can't find a hole, either. What the? Is this... - [Madison] Sorry. (laughs) (Madison laughing) - [Dennis] Why is it so hard? - [Madison] Just get the thing and use that. - [Dennis] Oh my god. Oh my god. Why do you have one of my shoes here? You are actually very helpful. - [Madison] That's the nicest thing Dennis has ever said to me. - [Dennis] Am I looking in the wrong place? - [Madison] Side cover. Okay, so this is supposed to go over this. But... Oh, okay, it's supposed to latch in. You have to actually- - I think you put in in there. - [Madison] No, no, no, you don't put anything in there. You just push, you just have to bang it. - [Dennis] What? That doesn't make sense. - You just have to hit it! Put it there. - [Dennis] You got so close to me! - [Madison] It's not going it. Your side sucks. - [Dennis] (grunts) Are you sure? Oh, there. - Ah! - [Dennis] Don't like assembling stuff. - [Madison] You want this to be easy, so much. Think about it, you would have to do this two times instead of once if I wasn't here. - [Dennis] Yes, she's better than me. - [Madison] I don't think your thing is screwed in enough, Dennis. - [Dennis] Yeah it is. Look, I cannot screw more. (Madison laughs) - [Madison] Wait. Oh, no. Okay, wait. - Did you find the hole? - [Madison] Yep, I found the hole. - I'm coming in. - Insertion is complete. - [Dennis] For the pillow, you just put it in here and you can adjust the height. Also make massagers, foot massager. They also make the strap massager. - [Jono] How come you know so much about massagers? - [Dennis] It's just my lifestyle. I like massaging. My stuff at home. So here's a cable, a connector. And go into this hole. Yeah. And then here's the power. The placement is fine. I wish it's wireless, but it's not gonna happen. You're not gonna be moving your chair a lot when you are doing work or gaming. It's fine. Just stop moving around! Why are you moving around so much? It's like, why are you moving around? You can't just, oh, like, I'm getting a massage while I still want to do this. Then unplug it! Okay, it's finally assembled. But before we sit on this, let's talk about something more important: Manscaped. Manscaped's Performance Package kit is all you need. It has all the stuff for you to stay groomed from head to toe. It features their new Lawn Mower 3.0 waterproof trimmer with a SkinSafe technology, as well as their Weed Whacker ear and nose trimmer for those tricky areas. For a limited time you get a kit plus two free gifts, the Shed travel bag and the Manscaped anti-chafing boxer-briefs. Go to manscaped.com/circuit to get your 20% off and free shipping. Okay, let's take a look at this chair. Look at it. Oh! Look at the cable, it's dragging. Oh, look at that embedded control panel. If you want to show of to your friends... Look at this. It massage you. So the panel's very straightforward. You have spot. You can go up and down. And it has grip. It has rolling, tapping, and from your shoulder position to all the way down to your lumbar. Ooh. Okay, this is really low. This is right by my ass. Ah! It's actually really deep. You can also go wider. Ooh! (Dennis hisses) You see the V-Hand? Right here. So for the chair itself, feels pretty comfortable. It's really firm. And I like the back part and the pillow. So this chair has built-in speaker. You can connect to it. I think some people can make good use of this. It would be really cool. Let's try it. Oof! All the way back. And let's play some music. Mmm. (lively orchestral music) Oh, nice. It is nice. The sound quality is not the best, but it's a built-in speaker, so why do you even complain? Oh-ho-ho, whoa! That's a bit too hard! If you, say, you're gaming on your phone, you connect to it and it can be more intense. So you can play your games like this. - [Colton] What are you doing? - You don't do massage chair. Get out! (savage death metal) See? It's actually pretty cool for a built-in speaker. That's how you use it. Oh yeah. - I don't like this at all. - Try it. Sit back. And you can adjust it here. - [Colton] Dah! Ah! What the... (Dennis laughs) Like, it's actually hitting my butt! I'm out. Weird. (Madison laughs) - Gaming. Ah. Nice. So this chair is 1,599, and right now it's on sale for around $1,000. I mean, for a regular gaming chair it's around $500, with a massage gaming chair it's $1,000, and this chair is $1,500. That sounds fair. But no massage feature. Oh! Wow. Actually feels pretty nice. For people who don't like being massaged, I guess this is pretty nice. But for me, for people who game and if you work for a long time on a chair, this can be a good choice. This is basic. Very good basic. So the problem for massage chairs is that you have to lay back, right? But when you are gaming or working on the computer, you actually sit straight and you don't feel anything here. I don't think this chair is built for people to get a massage while you're gaming. It's built for after you game. Why don't we try gaming and massaging at the same time? Oh my god. Ooh! Actually, it's not too bad. Position itself is fine, but I just find it a little distracting. When it's tapping your back it's kind of shaking your hand as well. Look at it. Yeah. No, this is not built for you to use it while gaming. This is built for after your game, you can relax. Like this. (leatherette creaks) Oh, my god. It's smooshing my pillow. It's smooshing my pillow! You know, actually, a regular massage chair is huge. It would probably take up the whole bedroom or something. For gaming, if you just want a massage feature and you also need a gaming chair, you might as well get this. The Autonomous chair I got at home, after two months you can feel the materials getting worn out really fast and then I can feel the bottom of the plastic. But this one, all the material is tested by Bokin. So the quality, I think, is really nice. Look here. You can see different texture here. I don't think you'll get too hot. And the weight load for this chair is 110 kilograms. I know this chair is not really for when you're gaming on the PC and getting a massage, but if you have console games you want to play, I think it's doable 'cause you don't really need your hands like this, right? So you can still easily get a massage and play your console games. Just make sure you turn it down. Don't get it too hard 'cause it's gonna shake you a lot. So if you're like me and you just have way too many stuff like foot massager, shoulder massager, neck massager, whatever massagers, you can get this chair all in one. So for $1,000, this can be good for some people other massagers, they're not cheap. Might just get one, 'cause it's minalmeh... Minimumest... Minimalistic. Okay, so if you want me to be the chair reviewer, better than Colton, make sure you comment below and give me a like. More likes than Colton's.",

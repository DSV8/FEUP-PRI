    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   SoundSoul Water Speakers -   I'm fairly convinced that these are the weirdest speakers I've ever featured on Unbox Therapy. Why do they have water in them? Why is that compelling? ... I have no idea, but there's something about these that seems special.

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lou here back with another video and today, I am gonna blow your minds. I've got speakers here with dancing water fountains inside. Why? I gotta be honest with you - I have no idea. I stared at it for a while, I said \"There is no way this thing sound any good!\" ...but dancing water in the studio was just too compelling to pass up so these are the SoundSoul, 6 Watt, musical speakers. From the fabulous water dance speakers. This is a monumental occasion, Jack. I hope you appericiate it for what it is. They work of USB, they're USB powered. You see here you could hook up a smartphone, laptop or otherwise. Obviously there is a big... Ughhh... ...ambient compenent here. Maybe you are trying to show a lady friend just how... ...established you are, like some, Michael Douglas type character. She comes over, you've got a pool table, It's a white pool table... Maybe you're drinking some champagne, cham-pan-neah! Let's look at the speakers. Oh! Easy Ben! Hol-y, there is water, all I see is a little bit of water inside. Now that I didn't know, was I'm gonna have to... - it's now much water though. Is it actually water? Whole thing looks weird right now, okay? There's one, there's two. Ahhh... what a fun day this is. Oh, look, it's mini USB - remember the other day I was... \"What uses mini US... mini USB?\" See some other cables here... Uhh mini-jack. That is the one I think I wanna use. Okay... I think I need USB power, give me a second... Oh! Those things are juicing right away! You thought you knew the world of tech, you thought it was all about the latest smartphone. Let me tell you something. Things are happening, beneath the surface, in the sewers of Gotham. The sewers are Ninja Turtles, what does it have to do with Gotham, they were always eating pizza those turtles. Should we play some music? Ooh, Oooooohhhh! Just dancing with my... water here... completely normal. What a weird combination! Who said \"That's what I need!\" Go back to the drawing board, these figures are not good enough, I need more WATER (Music Playing) I'm gonna hit the lights. Ooh, so emotional right now... No idea what I am doing right now! Get'n naked! With the lights! Nothing says romance like water in your speakers! Am I yelling?! (Laughing) I don't know, these are weird, but I like weird. Are they the best sounding? No, hell no, they are not! Are they the best looking? No, hell no, they are not. But will they get people talking, are people gonna say \"What is up with those things?\" - hell yes.",

    "transcript": "You really need to learn Linux and a concept that you need to understand is relative path names versus absolute path names. As an examplehere if I type ls you can see there's a directory called desktop, I can navigate to that directory by typing cd Desktop and notice I've moved to that subdirectory. However, if I type cd root Iam now in the root directory and I can't use the command cd Desktop because that directorydoesn't exist here that's the absolute path for that directory so I need to type /home/kali/Desktop in this example desktop and notice I can move to the desktop directory I am now in that directory ls shows me that there are no directories here if I move back a directory I'm now in my home directory and that directory is available to me by simply typing cd Desktop This is the absolute path name this is a relative path.",

    "transcript": "There are literally hundreds of thousands of games for dozens of consoles, but if you wanna play any of them, you will not only need the console they were made for, you'll need a controller, a TV that can display it, and the game itself. And since retro game prices have soared so high that GPU prices are jealous, emulation just makes sense. No clutter, no wear and tear on your valuable cartridges and discs, and no worries about controller or video signal compatibility, right? Well, the fine folks selling machines like this on AliExpress have heard the call to action loud and clear, and they've put out more consoles than anybody knows what to do. Hyperbase FC, this is a football club. It's a joke for my European friends. The point is, are these things any good? Can they play ROMs in any way that's close to how they performed on original hardware, or are they just repurposed Android TV boxes? Is this a repurposed segue to our sponsor? War Thunder, War Thunder is a free-to-play online vehicle combat sim extravaganza. With over 2,000 highly detailed vehicles, you can battle enemy forces in style. Click the link below to get a free bonus pack. I can't wait to get to the game station five, but I have to because we're starting with the Mi Pad 80. This is the whole thing? 89 inches, 89 inches of what? Oh, no way! This is one of those things. The whole console is the controller. That is quite possibly the worst joystick I have ever felt ever. It's like an even bigger version of that awful slide-around one from the DS family. It grinds. Wow, a single AAA battery. And with only a little bit of gross residue inside the enclosure. Wait, wait, is this a flashlight? Um, I'll take unnecessary feature creep for a hundred. Then we take our AV cable. This is just mono audio and composite video. And immediately we're up just like that. Whoa, that latency though. Wow. Oh, oh, okay, this is the game for sure. This is truly awful scaling. Like look at Mario's sprite as he's moving around. Terrible. And then if I want to play a different game, reset. Oh, wow, that's it. Oh, you're right. It's Sonic the Hedgehog shape, which makes no sense at all at the price of this thing. I'm having a pretty hard time justifying it. They go for anywhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 bucks. One other knock against it is it has to be powered by battery. But I also got to say, as a nine-year-old visiting grandma's house in the summer, if she'd had one of these instead of nothing, I would have been pretty into it. Just like I'm into this next unboxing, the game station five. Does this actually include two controllers? Oh, it totally does. That looks very cheap. We get only AV out, at least we get power in this time. No micro SD, no HDMI, which is really curious because it has spots in the mold for it. Reset and power buttons in the front. And then two USB 2s for a joystick one and joystick two. No clip mod. Wow, that's about as simple as it gets. We've got some kind of SOC on some kind of adapter board. We've got some schmoo on here, presumably because they don't want you to know what chip this is. Yep, there is no micro SD and no HDMI to be enabled. I have to assume that this is a generic chassis and there are a variety of different boards that might end up inside it. Hey, look, it includes a little stand. That and the 200 Total Games are already making me feel pretty good about this one. What the hell is this manual? Oh, it's Russian. Right, but for what? This has a wireless controller. This has some kind of gun. It has game cartridges and we're wiring into a VHF box for some reason. What the hell are they talking about? Dibs player one. Oh, there's no shoulder buttons. But there are labels molded into it. In case you forget which side is left and which side is right to prevent this. This is a very similar looking interface, but based on that we can at least play Super Mario 3, maybe it's a little more powerful. What the hell is fruit gift? Okay, I have to know. Are we competing? I have the same information that you do. Combat, if combat isn't multiplayer, I don't know what will be. Wait, what? You have to hit these guys while they're down? Isn't that like against the Geneva Convention? Okay, milking nuts. What is happening right now? Oh, what the? Oh, I'm dead. So here's something fun. This button goes to the side. That's the extent of my buttons. Thanks for playing. Time to move on to the arcade box. Comes in a little carrying case. Controllers that actually weigh something, even if they still feel pretty knockoff. Wireless though. This is feeling like some more primo bootleg right here. Oh, though. We did a video recently about these Android TV boxes, which is presumably what this is and they can be just chock full of malware. Got a little 64 gigabyte micro SD card. Do not remove, warranty void. You're not getting a warranty from arcade box. You need two separate dongles for the two separate controllers, brilliant. Let's see how it goes. This thing better impress me much, as my fellow Canadian would put it. Yeah, it's Android TV. Okay, can confirm. It's running Emulek, which is a Linux distro that's specifically for emulation. Whoa, okay. 45 PlayStation games. I doubt it. Oh, these are reversed. Tano tells me though, that you can fix that in software, which actually makes perfect sense. Joysticks usable. I mean, wow, yeah. Emulation speed seems fine. I'm a little surprised. I mean, for the price, I shouldn't be surprised, but for how light this thing is, I am a little surprised. One cool thing about this one, is that absolutely, whoops. Nothing would prevent you from just pulling out that micro SD card, because realistically, what you care about your warranty on this thing, and putting different games on it. However, I would caution you against plugging this into your network. The device is very rooted, including root file explorer, shell emulator, et cetera, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because it gives you full control over the system. It just means that they also had full control over the system at some point. The instructions are well-written though. So as long as you're happy with the game library, and you don't mind the fairly cheap, crummy controllers. Again, for Grandma's house, I could see it being pretty usable. Tanner insists that I try a couple of other games that he loaded onto a USB drive. That's kind of impressive actually. Just throw games on a USB and it picks it up. Yeah, I find it's quite nice. Unfortunately, you do still have to follow the folder structure. What are you expecting to go wrong here? So we're gonna see some of the textures messing up. We're gonna see things kind of fading in and out. Yeah, I see some textures messing up, but in terms of my expectations for a machine like this. It's pretty playable, isn't it? It's pretty playable, yeah. I think they loaded it up with all of the games that can reasonably run on this. Right, that would explain why Crazy Taxi is the only Dreamcast game on this thing. Also, Dreamcast games are really big, and that's only a 64 gig microSD. Hey, it's time to do the Hyperbase FC. Retro gaining console. These controllers look promising. Buttons are a little stiff, but joysticks feel not bad, and they've got all the buttons where I would expect them to be. I don't think that the style of the controllers could be any further from the box itself if they tried. Oh, that's pretty cool. Look, there's a SATA interface. So you could just plonk a two and a half inch hard drive or SSD in there and have basically all the frigging storage you could want. It gets better. Wait, wait, there's a cartridge. Hold on. There's a drive in the cartridge. There's a hard drive in the cart. Wait, so hold on. Does it have any? It currently has zero games. Oh, it's just adorable and shaped like an S cartridge. Oh, I like it. Yee-hee! There's not much we know about the hardware right out of the box. It's a quad core A53 processor. We know it was set up with a Dell PowerEdge R740XD. Oh, these are just like ROM hacks. Yeah, I think that's one of the biggest selling features of one of these machines is ROM hacks. Hey, this is cool. Hey, what's up? Wait, where'd you go? Behind you. Oh, balls. Oh, balls. I think I'm gonna stall. I think I stalled. And I fly off into the sunset. I'm guessing this one is 200 bucks. I'm seeing it on AliExpress right now for 61.27 USD. $61. To be clear, these are not amazing controllers by any stretch of the imagination. I wouldn't pilot a submarine with them. But for 65 bucks, also including the console with all the pirating done for me. Well, certainly a better value than that stupid overpriced one we looked at last time. I think this is the winner so far. Actually, I take back what I said about the quality of these controllers. They feel pretty good in the hand, but look at the size of this dead zone. It's just like the original console. No! It's straight or friggin' turn. What is Beats of Rage? What is a Thomas Wave? I think Beats of Rage is an open source version of Streets of Rage. Yeah, but it's a console. Oh! Well, we're gonna have to play Badass Babes. Good loading screen. What is this? Press attack to break free. Okay, yep, this is gonna need to go. Unplug, replug. How about the Super Console X-King? Did they rip off Intel's skull branding? Yeah, Beelink's done a couple different things that has that skull branding on it. Yeah, this one actually looks like kinda premium. It doesn't include a controller though. This one also uses microSD for storage, though I guess technically nothing would prevent you from plugging in a USB external drive, whether it's a hard drive or a USB thumb drive. Some key stats for this one. It uses an S922X processor, which is significantly more powerful than the S905X that we saw before, and it's running Android 9. But that's only the NAND. This is still loading up Emulek. Oh, I guess, yeah, that's true. This thing's gotta be rooted as hell. Oh, I like their interface though. The art on this particular one is really nice. The art is really nice. The art is really nice. Really nice interface. But one of the things we noticed is that there are a lot of games missing from their N64 library compared to the other consoles that we've looked at. So the only conclusion we can draw there is that it probably doesn't handle them very well for some reason, which is weird because it uses an S922X processor instead of an S905, which is quite a bit more powerful. It could just be that it, this is a very incomplete game library. They've got most of the ones I would care about though. Ocarina of Time, Star Fox 64. I mean- Is that flashing up the top of the screen always there? No, that seems to be a problem. The power of the hardware is reflected in the price. This one goes for about $125 without all the Emulek stuff preloaded on it. You can see it's got Beelink branding on it, but we actually got ours from Kinhank, and they're the ones who are loading all the software onto it. So you're paying about $15 extra for them to configure it for you, load it up with a bunch of games, and then hopefully not put anything malicious on it. The NAND runs Android version 9, and the only other really interesting thing I think about the hardware here is that these USB ports are USB 3. So if you had a high-speed USB storage device, you might get slightly better performance out of it. Theoretically, if you can get a good Android install going, that will be a pretty good TV box too. Bringing us to our last, the Super Console X Pro comes in, oh my goodness, two boxes. Wow. Laser-cut acrylic enclosure with a Kinhank logo lasered into the side of it. Okay, 60 mil cooling fan. A USB hub. Does it come with four controllers? No way. A four controller button. Hey, these are those same controllers again. They are. Well, we are shorted two dongles, I think. I noticed Kinhank has come up a lot. Are these guys a power player in the pirated Android game console space? It seems like they're just buying and then reselling Android boxes, essentially. But they also carry a couple of x86 computers? That is a frigging loud fan. And it smells. Oh, oh, ew. What the heck? Why does it smell? This looks pretty good for a virtual boy game though. Oopsie daisies. This is completely unusable and it's not even super powerful. This is using an S905X, so it's not even the most powerful console we've seen today. Now my question for you is, is this really what was in the picture on the site? They have two different versions of this. I bet they do. They're the Super Console X Pro Plus. The X Pro looks almost like a Super Famicom. And from what I can tell, isn't actively cooled, which I never thought would have been a bad thing. But here we are, it smells, it's loud, it's soldered right into the DC jack. No way, it is. That is the stupidest thing I've ever seen ever. When I see something stupider, it's held together with these plastic screws. There are a couple of consoles we saw today that if you're comfortable with the piracy and profiting off of others IP aspect of these products, could recommend. The one with the slot loading cartridge in the top, that one's pretty cool. What's that one called again? Hyperbase FC, but the performance not that great. Yeah, but the price. I mean, yeah, the $150 one was definitely smoother, but it costs twice as much. And that one was 65 bucks and includes two controllers. And a 500 gig hard drive. Again, it comes back to grandma's house. Come to grandma. If you just want something for the kids to do that's cheap and cheerful, there's far worse ways to spend your money. This one on the other hand, this one is stupid. Like this stupid segue to our sponsor. War Thunder, watching vehicles blow up is one of the internet's greatest past times. War Thunder is a free to play PVP game that lets you scratch that itch. Since every one of War Thunder's more than 2000 vehicles are modeled after or inspired by real tanks, planes, and other war machines, every battle feels realistic and immersive. Adding to that immersion is the game's vehicle damage system. It's dynamic and detailed enough to show every piece that breaks off of your enemy's machines as you mercilessly destroy them.

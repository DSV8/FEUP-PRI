    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we are checking out the brand new Tone Free T-90 Earbuds from LG. Now I am really excited about these because they are actually the world's first earbuds with Dolby Atmos and Dolby Head Tracking. They have Bluetooth 5.3 active noise cancellation, up to 29 hours of battery life with the included charging case, and they're also super comfortable to wear. Thank you so much to LG for partnering with me on this video and sending me these to checkout. So let's un-box and get into it. (upbeat music) (knife opening), (box cutting) (box cutting) (cardboard sliding) (plastic crinkling) (cardboard rustling) We've got two U-S-B cables, I like that these are really thin cables. We have a U-S-B-C to a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and we've also got a U-S-B-C to a U-S-B-A. I do like that the cables are color coordinated so if you do get the white, you'll have white cables and if you get the black, you'll have the black cables. You also have some different size ear tips. So depending upon your ear size, they have some different options for you. Also, color coordinated. Look how pretty, I love this case. It's a nice feel. Small, super light. (upbeat music) All right, let's put 'em in. Let's try 'em out, shall we? Oh, look at this. So I would say right off the bat, these are super comfy. I mean, if you watch any of my videos then you guys know that sometimes my ears do not get along very well within ear headphones. but these are super comfortable and I feel like I can go for a run. I could take calls, I could play video games. I could be raging (laughing) with my gaming consoles. Look at this, the head shake test. Holy moly. Why are these staying in? I don't know. Like I'm so surprised, like I'm so surprised these are staying in my ears and I'm so excited about it, but these ear tips are a little bit different. They're actually made of like a medical gel and they just sort of conform to my ears and it's not like there's a lot of pressure or anything, it's just, they just fit. You can also actually test out how well they fit in your ears using the Tone Free App. So we are definitely gonna try that out and see what it says. Now I have these all synced to the Tone Free App with Bluetooth, and here's our little user manual. So this shows you the different touch controls. Touch once to play and stop, touch twice to end call, and also volume control. Touch three times to play the next song and the long press will turn your ambient mode and noise cancellation on and off. Test my best fit. In the ears we go, let's start. Oh, it's telling me to try a different ear gel. Okay. I'll pop on some smaller ones and see if that helps. Oh, that actually already feels better. Wow, okay, thanks for the hot tip, and then if we scroll down, we have some equalizer settings. So you can do immersive, natural, base boost, treble boost, 3D sound stage, and this is where we have the Dolby Head Tracking and Virtual Sound. We're definitely turning that one on. All right, let's listen to some music. Okay, I'm gonna listen to some One Republic but you guys are gonna be hearing some royalty free music. Oh, this is nice. Okay. (upbeat music) Oh yeah! (upbeat music) The base just hit in. All right, let's test out the noise cancellation. (music lowering) Okay, noise cancellation is on. Stay, fixin' ta walk up that door - [Cameraman] Justine? Mama stay - [Cameraman] You can't hear me. Justine, you can't hear me. You can't hear me at all. Why you like with grudges - Were you talking to me? - [Cameraman] Yeah. (laughing) (Justine laughing) - I didn't hear a single thing you said. (laughing) Alright, well I guess active noise cancellation works. Check. One thing I really like about these is the plug and wireless feature. So you can already connect these to basically any device over Bluetooth, but what if you wanna connect a device that doesn't have Bluetooth like maybe you're at the gym or on a plane. All you have to do is connect the charging case to the device with the included cable and then you can connect wirelessly to the case. Plus, sometimes devices do have Bluetooth but it doesn't always work that well. This is so perfect for those scenarios. Let's see if it worked, Oh my gosh, it's working! (upbeat music) Oh man, this is awesome because sometimes I have trouble connecting Bluetooth headphones to this and now here we go, problem solved. So let's talk about Bluetooth and sound quality. These are rocking the Qualcomm A-P-T-X, Bluetooth 5.3 as well as Snapdragon sound, supporting 24 bit 96 kilohertz HD audio. That means you're getting enhanced connectivity while using Bluetooth as well as clear high resolution quality sound in a very light and compact package. That is pretty impressive. So I have the LG Tone Free T-90 headphones now hooked up to my PC and I'm about to play some games and test this out. What I really like about these is they have built-in Dolby Head Tracking. So no matter what content you're watching on what platform, you'll be able to experience the Head Tracking feature. So I'm watching a cut scene right now on my game and so when I turn my head, like from side to side, it actually feels like I'm a part of this cut scene, like I'm in the conversation. So if I'm turning this way and this way, like you can actually hear the difference, it's pretty awesome. Okay, so another thing that is super cool about these headphones is that they have a UV nano-tech built right into the case. Basically, it uses UV light to kill 99.9% of bacteria on the ear gels while the earbuds are charging and plugged in. So when you're ready to put them in again, they're powered up, clean, and ready to go. I love that. So they're now connected to my TV and I really wanna test out the sound. So I'm gonna find myself an epic movie trailer and see what they sound like. I feel like trailers are always a good test because the sound design is always so good. Here we go. Turning up the volume. Oh yeah. (upbeat music) This sounds like I'm sitting in a massive theater with speakers all around me. This is where you can really tell the Dolby Atmos kicks in because this is like a movie trailer. I feel like I'm in the theater. It's actually all around me. I thought I had a pretty decent sound system in here but this is next level. So I wanna see what this sounds like watching a live show. Whoa, they're chanting his name. It seems...whoa! Okay, I'm gonna, I gonna stand up and act like I'm at this show now. Now most normal headphones don't really help much when you watch live concerts at home. So the LG Tone Free T-90 headphones are an incredible way to listen to live concerts from the comfort of my couch. The Head Tracking is making it actually feel like I'm here because it's keeping it, whoa! This is so cool. This is the comfiest concert I've ever been to. Testing these out on the big screen was pretty incredible but honestly, most of the time I'm traveling, I'm on the go. I'm not really watching TV that often. So I thought I would test this out in a scenario that is most familiar to my life. I'm gonna watch something on my tablet and in the headphones go, and you guys may be able to hear it that I am pretty close to a road so there is a lot of car noise. So I'm gonna turn on active noise cancellation. My movie has started and here we go. The noise cancellation definitely made a big difference, so I'm gonna turn it off. Okay. Turn it back on. Oh yeah, it's a huge difference. Sound quality is so important and just watching this right here, it actually feels like I'm inside watching on a large TV because it is so full and filling, and of course this Head Tracking, again, makes it feel like you're in a theater experience. I think these are a great option for people who don't like over the ear headphones but yet you want that Dolby Atmos sound. These are small, compact and of course very portable. Overall, the LG Tone Free T-90 Wireless Earbuds seem like a pretty great option for anyone looking for a comfortable pair of earbuds with awesome battery life and a fantastic listening experience across a variety of devices. Make sure you guys like this video and I will see you guys in the comments and in my next video. Bye.",

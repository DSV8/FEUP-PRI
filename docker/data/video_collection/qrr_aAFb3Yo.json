In this video he goes through some issues and lessons he's learned about posture, comfort and how he needs something that fits his body type rather than a chair that's received review awards.

    "transcript": "what's up everyone Eber here with Hardware Canucks and I'm here to talk about chairs more specifically why I'm ditching my gaming chair because I've been using this guy for the past two years and it was quite an uncomfortable experience but I've sort of left it out of the equation now never even thought about it until now because it's almost affecting the posture that I'm you know normally used to be sitting at and it really is concerning to me so I'm ready to get rid of this guy and look for a new one and so follow me along so this will be a two-part series video the first part would obviously be me talking about why we don't do gaming chairs and why you know you watching a gaming chair of you doesn't really give you the full picture because there is a lot more than that so let's get into specifics right after message from our sponsor then you and there Mack slick fusion is their first addressable RGB all-in-one cooler with a standard 240 ml rad an absolutely beautiful RGB ring elimination on the fence and the pump to highlight that unique flow indicator through the transparent top check out the lake fusion down below okay so let me backtrack here for a second so this is the Vertagear PL6000 gaming chair it was sent to us by Vertagear for free as a review sample so let me get into how this has held up so far first up physical aesthetics I mean I haven't noticed any wear or tear with materials it has stayed up really well for these past two years there are no rips or anything some sort the one thing that I did notice over that was sort of recurring you know these past days is that I've noticed creaking here and there it was it's just something that I've been noticing for for a while and it gets a little bit annoying especially if you're recording on cams like scripts or something like that if you just make a slight movement with your chair that obviously the microphone picks up that sound and it kind of kind of ruins the whole thing so that's one of the things I have noticed with the PL6000 I've definitely started noticing creeks here and there so that's that now in terms of comfort well that's the most discerning part about this gaming chair in fact it's the one reason why I'm willing to get rid of this as soon as I can and look for something that's a little bit better so I'm going to start with the bottom because the PVC leather option is certainly quite durable but it didn't have proper breathing space so I noticed he'd buildups very fast as very rapid so if you're seeing in something like this for really long periods of time especially during summer your bottom can get really toasty so it it gets a little weird obviously becomes a little gross too so it comes to a point where I have to physically just get out of the chair start kneeling on the carpet and do things on my computer especially when it comes to editing and something like that so it's definitely not a effective works workflow in my opinion so it's just it's one of those things where I wish had I had something that I can comfortably sit on and unfortunately on the PL000 with the PVC leather material at the bottom it's just not doing any justice next up is the backrest so it is a completely flat surface meaning there is no proper lumbar support for your back which means if you're trying to lean back you kind of have to get to a point where just there's a little gap that's filling or it's just left there out of nowhere so you really can't comfortably you know sit back and just relax and do your work it's just not the case here vertigo does include a lumbar pillow that you can put on the bottom but to be honest it's way too thick and it almost gets to a point where you have to it pushes you forward without a cup you thought you sort of getting into a comfortable position it just doesn't add up that well so that was definitely something that I did notice of course it was definitely concerning and it almost got to a point where I'm sorry he's slowly starting to slouch forward which makes it totally uncomfortable and sometimes it's just not even healthy because I can notice the back pains coming here and there and that definitely is you know quite concerning so a lack of proper lumbar support is one of the reasons why I'm also willing to ditch this gaming chair I should also mention that proper posture is very crucial you want to be able to sit back straight and edit comfortably or just work at a desk comfortably without having to worry about back pains or anything like that constant or occasional back pains that come up here and there so it is very crucial I mean back pains is again a very dangerous thing if especially if you're working at a job where you need to maneuver around in my case I have to move around for shot for composing shots and stuff like that and of course filming here at the office so if I have a back problem then definitely an effect content and you know if I don't get proper support at the back then it's just it's it's ultimately it's gonna affect my back and it would obviously end up with me not being able to produce any content so I don't want to do that that's not what I'm looking for so as I mentioned earlier the lack of proper back support or just proper lumbar support at the back is definitely a noticeable thing and over these past few years that's one of the things that I've noticed because you could comfortably lean back it's just then you know when you lean if you're working on a desk it just you're getting to a point where you have to obviously slouch but you can't comfortably rest your lumbar at the back and that kind of it just doesn't add up so that's one of the reasons why I'm looking for solutions now this next bit of the video is definitely gonna be quite an interesting conversation starter because I'm gonna be talking about chair reviews in general because personally I find them to be pointless I know we did do one back in the past or probably a couple of them probably three or four of them back in the day but there is a sole reason why we have stopped doing gaming chair reviews here in the channel at least these days because you know over the course of these years we've slowly come to understand where the industry stands in terms of providing just things in general I guess features exclusive features mostly on gaming chairs because right now we're seeing gaming chairs with RGB lighting which is completely just pointless I have no idea why we're seeing something like that in 2018 but it is it is existent it is something that we have to deal with but most importantly if a brand reaches out to a youtuber and if they ask you to so you know if they're asking you to review one of their gaming chairs and if they accept then obviously the first step would be to review that chair give an unbiased opinion about it but it almost gets to a point where someone who's watching that review would base their purchase off that opinion and I don't think that's right simply because you know you as an individual you haven't put in the effort to try out that gaming chair or non gaming chair in general but the chair by itself in general at a store to make sure that you're comfortable sitting on it because I have had friends who have tried Herman Miller embody chairs and they absolutely hate it so you know you could be someone who absolutely fell in love with a $50 chair an office chair basic chair versus someone who just won't be able to take something like that and might want to go with something a little bit better spend a little bit more money and get something of a higher quality and be a lot better with that and of course feel a lot comfortable sitting on it if you're looking to invest in a chair I'd highly recommend trying it trying it out at stores rather than buying things online based off the chair reviews it's just that's just my take now trying out different chairs at different stores might be a little bit of a challenge for people who are living in remote areas so my suggestion would be to do as much of research as you can narrow down your results spend a day or two just traveling around trying out different stores maybe if it's a 30-minute drive from your place dick take the time to do that because trust me that $30 or $50 investment or even a thousand dollar investment can play a huge role when it comes to your posture or just your health and channel because it really does the chair really does affect your your back the health the way how you sit and the way how you just work in general so if you if you just decide to cheap out on that investment if you if you're if you're looking to take compromises on that part well ultimately it is gonna affect your health and that and that isn't cool your chair purchase ultimately determines the quality of life you lead moving forward because if you invest on a chair based off someone else's opinion that you read online then you know the next thing you know it shows up at your place you assemble it you sit on it and all of a sudden you realize that it just doesn't feel right to you it doesn't feel comfortable you don't feel like you're just relaxed when you're working at a desk or if you're just sitting in it doing other productive things so that's a complete fail in my opinion and I hope a lot of you guys can relate to this I just want to point out that this isn't a takedown on gaming chairs but rather it's a process and I'll obviously have to go through not just with gaming chairs but just chairs in general to find out what's suitable for me next so this is probably why we're not gonna be doing any chair reviews here in the channel because I don't think anyone should again as I said in the beginning and the end should base their opinions or make their purchasing positions on chairs in general based off someone else's opinions so that's it for me guys I hope you took away something from this video I think the things obviously I'm gonna be ditching this gaming chair and looking for something else I'll make sure to document and vlog my journey or my path to find the next chair here for the office and yeah let me know what you guys think about chairs in general in fact are you satisfied with your chair purchase if you've invested you know fifty dollars or thirty dollars or a thousand dollars let me know the comments down below if you're satisfied with your purchasing decision even if it's a gaming chair let me know in the comments down below I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you the next one",

    "transcript": "- Hey everybody, I am Dieter. We are at Amazon's Fall Hardware Event, and I am holding in my hands the all-new Echo Buds. Now these are 129.99 dollar earbuds and they go in your ear and they sort of noise isolate, but what's special about these, at least for me, isn't necessarily the Alexa integration, it's the Boss integration. These do noise reductions. Not quite noise canceling, but it really is effective. So you put them in your ears and then you double tap, and now you hear all the noise that's happening around me but I don't hear it basically at all. Which is pretty great. But if you're worried about it, you can double tap again. And then you can get pass-through audio. And there's little voice prompts that let you know what it's doing. Now, if you want to use it for the Alexa, you can. You can, of course, just say something like Alexa, what's the weather? And Alexa is now currently telling me the weather. You can ask Alexa to play music, or any other Alexa thing. And when you pull them out of your ear, they auto-pause just like air pods or some other ear buds. Because they have a tiny little optical sensor there. Some other options you can do with this thing, you can actually customize what all are the taps are. By default, a double-tap switches between noise reduction and pass-through. A long press lets you access the digital assistant on your phone. So either Siri or the Google Assistant, depending on your phone. But you can also set them to other things, like track, volume, etc., etc., etc. Now the case here is actually pretty large relative to other wireless earbuds. It charges by micro USB. (sighs) And it doesn't charge wirelessly. These buds will last about five hours on a single charge on their own. Or twenty hours total with the case. And you can also get them fully charged in about an hour. Amazon says that these 130 dollar buds are gonna be available in time for the holiday. But you can pre-order them right now. And I gotta say, 130 bucks for noise almost canceling ear buds is really darn good. And I've listened to just a little bit of music on them, they sound pretty good. But of course, we're gonna need to go out in the world and not inside this demo room to give you a full picture of how they sound. And we hope to do that very soon. There's a lot more happening here at this Amazon event so please keep a lock on the Verge, because there's more videos coming.",

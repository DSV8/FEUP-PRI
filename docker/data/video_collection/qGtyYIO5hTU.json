    "transcript": "What's up guys Lou here with another video and today I am bringing you What? Mel B claims are tangle free earbuds 'scuse me? Everybody has been using earbuds for many many years and tangling has just become part of the business So let's just say you are still looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones Skip out on the whole tangling part of things Mel B, She used to be a Spice Girl I guess she still is, are you always a Spice Girl? Once a Spice girl, always a...She is a Spice girl Scary Spice You've got this company, she has got these earbuds My question is.. To you , Mrs. Mel B To you , Mrs. Mel B are your headphones any good..or.. Do they suck? umm probably its somewhere in between Its a weird kinda design this like this sleeve that goes across the headphones, She's happy about it, now these apparently have adjustable base as well oh my goodness If you got, like I don't know Earpods lying around Ones that keep on a Purse Purse, how many females are watching If you are a female watching this I appreciate you Because you're part of 5% of overall viewership 5% of a big number is a big number But I'm just gonna shoutout to the ladies right now Why not, purse, bag whatever you call it headphones get tangled in there... Nightmare Rat's nest Hate it Anyhow There... There's some extra eartips in here as well And here are the actual headphones Firmly pinch the tube at this point Pinching tubes... oh here we go Cunch correctly. Why are they so concerned? What happens if you don't crunch correctly I'm pinchin' this point, and I'm pinchin' at this point Okay Okay and these go And these go Left,right up in here Left, right up in here And down to there, OK that makes sense Now how do you put them away? Firmly pinch Then pinch the tube here And stretch it Oh my god... Is this gonna be magic? Okay here we go Oh!! Oh!! Success!! You'd get more used to this over time though Boom Max earbud-ness Then you're done Then you're done Grab here Grab here No more tangles Good crunch Bad crunch Its pushing it too far this way Okay I didnt do that, no bad crunch here No bend Don't bend on the Crunch Straight crunch No slingshot, Jack You see that there? But the idea of just a simple pair of earbuds In your bag That never become tangled Allright so... Earpods So here's what happens okay? Like rat's nest These are not even that bad right now Let's say I wanna use these right now AHA!! *FAIL* You get the point You get the point It happens!! Everybody has experienced it before Right? Like.. Cool we get the point Thanks Mel B What do they sound like they are headphones after all It's kind of important There's an \"N\" and a \"B\" And a little arrow Now when i spin it, I go to \"B\" I go to Bass mode They are describing \"N\" as soft pure and \"R\" as strong dynamic Oh yeah Way more bass Obviously that's the idea So i guess thats Kind of cool You can tune your sound a little bit I don't know how much better they sound than Earpods To be honest I think I feel like I need to do this right now Because And I entangled it... Finally Do a quick comparison here Gotta go back one more time These fit deeper in your ear canal Obviously with these types of tips here Now these dont sound like some of the Insano million dollar headphones that I test here obviously Considering these because tangling headphones has been Has your life been altered? By The... Tragedy that is, tangled headphones Yeah they are a little better than this People are there see just you sitting around say What's up with your headphones Man they look a little... Uhh...

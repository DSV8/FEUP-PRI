    "transcript": "We are running out of sand. That sounds insane. There are massive deserts all around the world that are just full of sand. 27.7% of the Earth's crust is just silicon, a key component of silica sand. The problem is that not all sand is created equal, and we use a lot of it. Over 50 billion tons of sand and gravel are used globally every year in paving and construction, but also in windows, screens, silicon chips, and photovoltaic cells. And this massive sand demand has been going on for a long time. A 2014 UN report estimated that sand was 85% of all material mined globally by weight. Sand is formed by the gradual erosion of rocks into smaller and smaller grains. This is a process that takes thousands of years, making sand a renewable resource only in a very technical sense. Plus, that sand has different properties depending on how it was created. Concrete typically uses water-weathered sand because the resulting grains are rough and angular, which allows them to lock together. Wind-weathered desert sand, on the other hand, tends to be too round and smooth. Therefore, Dubai, despite being built on a desert, imports hundreds of millions of dollars of sand each year to support its rapid growth. As for the screen in front of you and the silicon chips inside your device, that's a slightly different story. Glass needs to be made from near-pure silica sand, sand that is at least 95% silicon dioxide, or your window is going to look just awful. It also needs to be extremely fine, with grains between 0.075 millimeters and 1.18 millimeters, and it also has to be the right color. For more sophisticated industrial purposes, silica is extracted from rock quartz and quartz-rich sand, then purified into 98% pure metallurgical-grade silicon. Silicon for semiconductors needs to have a purity of 11 nines, that's 99% a decimal and nine more nines. The advantage of this process is that the geometry of the sand doesn't actually matter all that much, so desert sand can be used. That being said, natural sources of sand vary a lot in terms of composition, and easily accessible quartz-rich sand sources are still a limited resource. The global demand for sand is so intense that the industry has attracted attention from organized crime, and you know the situation is getting serious when a bunch of gangsters roll up and steal a beach. Sure, it sounds funny, but illicit sand mining can cause serious problems. Not only can intensive dredging of sand from rivers and the ocean floor damage local ecosystems, but irresponsible sand mining can erode supports from nearby structures, and has resulted in multiple fatal bridge collapses. There are a few ways we can manage the ongoing sand shortage, and we'll tell you about them right after we thank the sponsor of this video, DeleteMe. Your personal information is being easily shared online without your consent, and Delete.me has a strong moral intuition that that's wrong. They'll help you find hundreds of online profiles sharing your personal info, which can be used by scammers to bombard you with annoying robocalls and scam emails. DeleteMe's software and team of experts can remove this information in just minutes compared to the hours it would take to do manually. On average, DeleteMe removes over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer in their first two years. So if you wanna get your personal info removed from search results on the web, go to joindelete.me.com slash techquickie and use code techquickie for 20% off. Now, we could massively scale down our use of sand, but we'd all still like to have buildings to live in, roads to travel on, and TVs to watch. And so the spice must flow. There are other options though. We might be able to reduce the amount of sand we use by shifting to other sources of aggregate and silica like crushed rock, demolition material, and ore sand, a byproduct of the mining industry. Some have even suggested replacing sand with used pyrolyzed coffee grounds, which research has shown can even result in 30% stronger concrete in the right proportions. We also need to reuse what we've already extracted as much as we can. The bright side is that many processed forms of sand are basically infinitely recyclable. Around 80% of asphalt used in American roads is already recycled back into new asphalt. And glass can be broken down, tumbled and turned back into sand. However, many forms of processed sand, such as rubber-like silicone polymers, can only be down-cycled a limited number of times due to physical constraints, or they may be too contaminated to safely and economically recycle at scale with current technology. We also need to push for longer lasting, repairable digital devices, because even the very cheap ones are made from materials that are ultimately limited. Life's a beach, and then you die. But first, you finished this video. Nice job. Hey, thanks for watching. Like the video if you liked it, dislike it if you disliked it.

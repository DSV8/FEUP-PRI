    "transcript": "So.. LG. All I know, all I know is that this came from LG. They sent this, crate... So, ya, we figured let's roll and we can have the surprise together. What? Ultrawide heroes, it has my name on it. But these are nailed in not screwed. I'm called Unbox Therapy for a reason not crate therapy. Ooh sliver. Hahaha. This is obviously not how you uncrate something. I feel like it's some kind of buried treasure. Oh wow, thats my desk man. That's my exact desk. Hang on a second. That's a miniature version of my desk. What? Wow. Unreal. There's a magnet for the top display man! This is one of the craziest things. Look at this, look at this! The speakers with magnets. What? Hahaha. What?. This is my chair man! Here's a Macbook Pro and look the Mac Pro. Wow. They got the remote control for the TV up top. Have they been in my office? What? Hahaha. They got my shoes? In three different sizes. Me, Will and Linc. Haha. What? They got Will and Lincoln man. My sunglasses that were also on the table. Zoom audio interface. The Apogee Duet. The Justin Maller prints from right there. Look. That's insane! That's absolutely insane. This is a certificate from them. Here are the simple steps to follow: Get your snapback ready, fold yourself into 1:12 scale and enjoy your space. I don't know what to say. Thanks LG. I mean it's kind of sentimental in a way. With like the attention to detail and whatnot. Wow. Insane.",

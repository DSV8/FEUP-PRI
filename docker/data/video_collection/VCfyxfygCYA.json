Well, four years later  thanks to you  weve finally hit it. So, were shutting down.  [jk lol!] Im just taking a week off to recharge my power cells before diving into TechTober 2020  and while Im gone, I thought it only right to give back to the million of you whove propelled MrMobile to this milestone  with the biggest giveaway in the channels history.

    "transcript": "- One million subscribers. Numbers aren't everything, but when we started Mr. Mobile, that million was the only number I cared about. Four years later, we've finally reached that goal so now we're shutting down. Just kidding. I'm just taking off for a week ahead of Tech-tober to recharge my power cells and while I'm gone, I thought it only right to give back to the million of you who have propelled Mr. Mobile to this milestone with the biggest giveaway in the channel's history. My support team at Future reached out to tons of companies to help with this celebration, many of whom generously donated some giveaway gear that you can win. The full list will be on the website I'll share in a second, but we're talking everything from home tech from Lenovo to smart TVs from Hisense to cameras from Sony to mobile phones from way too many manufacturers to list. Winners will be able to choose any one of those items, assuming we can ship it to your country, on a first come, first served basis. How do you enter to win this glorious giveaway? Well you've just gotta help me help you. See, there's a lot of great YouTube channels out there, tech or otherwise, that kick out excellent content, but don't get the recognition they might deserve. I spent four years hearing from wonderful fans about how surprised they were I hadn't crossed the million mark yet, so I'd like to shorten that journey for other creators. All you have to do is subscribe to a channel you feel is underrated and leave a nice comment on one of their videos. Then upload a screenshot of that comment to the widget on my website and that's it, you've helped yourself by filling your inbox with quality content, you've helped a creator keep kicking out that content, and you've given yourself a chance to win once of these princely prizes totaling over $20,000. And if you want more chances to win, you can find them in that widget as well. For more details, full instructions, and complete terms and conditions, visit mrmobile.tech/contests linked in the description. You have ten days to enter, starting Friday, September 18th and wrapping up Monday, September 28th. That weed we'll start drawing prizes and reaching out to the winners via email. And my thanks to all the sponsors and partners that have teamed up with future to make this giveaway possible. So best of luck. Thank you so much for propelling us to this point and until the next major milestone, stay mobile, my friends.",

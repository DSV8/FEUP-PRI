    "transcript": "What's up guys? Lew here back with another video, and today I am bringing you something practical! This my friends, is the first washable keyboard, I've seen, with actual real keys. It is the keyboard that loves a wash... Now I know you're staring down at some grimey keyboard and I'm telling you to change your ways. If you're in an environment where you like to eat your Cheetos over top your keyboard, like most of the people here on YouTube, then it's time for you to step up your hygiene, and maybe take a look at the \"K3-10\" from Logitech. The key characters are laser printed, UV coated, can rinse it off, there it is in the sink. So our job, of course, here on Unbox Therapy, is to test this guy out! I've got Coca-Cola, maple syrup... I don't have real maple syrup, because I would never waste that holy material. Okay, what do we got here? Oh, wow! Aggressiveness! *thud* A really long USB cable, with a little protector on it. Look at this is, there's even a little tool here, which stores on the bottom. You see that, Jack? For getting even closer. Maximum: 50 Celsius water, okay... 30cm submersion, 5 minutes max underneath. And then, don't use a hair dryer to blow it, don't put it in the dishwasher either, that makes sense. A couple little feet on it. So, I could see these things being deployed in Hospitals, in kitchens... Uhhh, bathrooms. Why would you need a keyboard in the bathroom, Jack? Stephen King! If you're a Stephen King, you gotta be typing everywhere you go! Because that idea might strike, and you're like, \"Right! Of course!! That's the way the guy dies!\" *furious typing* See how the keys seem to be floating a little bit? Now, let's reconfigure the set here, and let's do some experimentation! Ok, so I've got the worst of the worst! We're going to start with, the stickiest stuff on the planet, Aunt Jemima! This is fake maple syrup, alright!? So for the record, get the real deal, alright? Splurge a little bit. Pull your wallet out, get the real deal! Have you had real maple syrup?! Give it a shot! Take it from a Canadian. Oohh!! That's painful... It's like pancakes. *sniffs* Smells like Waffle House. What's up next? Ketchup! Oohh, good Lord!! Look at that. Well, Mustard? I don't know. Oohh!! No-Shake Mustard! It's worse than regular! It's the No-Shake! This combination of smells is a little much right now for me. A little bit of soft Honey- Oh! And then, of course: Coca-Cola. Woah! It's not even fair. Listen, if you're eating at your desk and this happens, you're a wild animal. I got some water now... Come on water... Do your thing. You know what? It's all rinsing out kind of nicely. The next step is, of course, to test it out! Moment of truth, gave it a proper rinse in the sink. We need to plug it in! Obviously, it still has to work. Otherwise, all those shenanigans were kind of pointless. Let's see here... Yes sir!! \"Unbox Therapy\"... Feels good, works well! All the keys are in good working order. Yes! It's a washable keyboard! It has real keys on it, and it's washable... Am I the only one who's excited here? Wait, I want to do it the other way. There we go. I like that look better.",

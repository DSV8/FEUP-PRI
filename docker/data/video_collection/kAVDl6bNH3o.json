    "transcript": "- Today's Q and A is brought to you by SimpliSafe. (upbeat bass music) - Why do people run from me? - Are you gonna try Night Sight on the Pixel 3 and feel bad about making fun of it? Look man, I am not above any of that. I will admit, I trolled Google a little bit and I think most people, when we saw that comparison at the keynote with that iPhone XS against the Pixel three, it definitely looked like they were exaggerating a little bit, but based off what we've seen so far with the leaks on Night Sight, it looks like I was wrong. Firstly, I'm going to wait 'til the official version rolls out to review it and showcase it here on the channel. So definitely stay tuned because I will absolutely be doing a showcase on that. Again, based off some of these images, it looks amazing and I am 100% eating my words. Well done, Google. I was wrong. Most recent gear purchase that we should convince Marques to buy? Vinh, you are always lookin' to make Marques buy stuff. He is not going to approve. For real, though. I don't know if there's really anything recently here that we've picked up that we could convince him to buy. He's never gonna go Arri. He's all about them ques and 30 frames per second, but maybe if I flipped that and go for a piece of gear that we want eventually, is the Arri Trinity Stabilizer System, which oh my God, looks even cooler than your robots. I have watched this video so many times. Oh, my goodness, it looks amazing. The way they have this giant camera rig just up there and the dude is just swinging it around like Ronin S. just blows my mind. Clearly, Arri has color science down, but the engineering behind this is like next level. So Vinh, grab Marques's credit card, buy two, send one here, and we'll call it a day. What would you like to return, Blockbuster or Circuit City? Courtney, my guy. That is a great, but simple question to answer. Hands down, no questions asked, all day long, Hollywood Video. Who has the best hard part, and why is it mine? Look, man. I'm not even gonna try and compete with you on that level. I have done the hard part before, but I'm gonna be honest. It is way, way too much work. You gotta get that line perfectly smack down your head and then maintain it like every week, and honestly, I'm just too lazy for that. So golf clap. All the applause in the world for you for rockin' that so well. Name one YouTuber you have not worked with but you would love to? That is an amazing question, and I would have to say right now it's gotta be (soft intense music) Peter Mckinnon. One, amazing personality, but two, the creativity he brings into his videos just kinda like gets my brain going, makes me want to be better. Yeah, Peter, what's up? I head down to Toronto. Let's collab. What all can we expect at TLD Breakdown? That is a great question, my friend. I kinda break that down. I'm sorry. - You really screwed that up. - It's more of a behind-the-scenes look at the production that goes into these videos and again, I'm not claiming I'm some expert, but I have hung around some really, really talented people and picked up a trick or two. Everything from lighting to camera work to composition to editing tricks, and really it's not meant to take away from these videos. Those are here to stay. I've never been a fan of pay or join a membership to access videos early. This is something extra for those who are into filmmaking. I just want a resource where you can learn. So if you want to, link below. Cheapest tech you are using now? That is actually an awesome and really relevant question. For my most recent iPhone XR unboxing boxing video, I actually used this $110 Zoom H1 recorder to do the entire voiceover. This microphone that you're listening to right now, yeah, it sounds amazing, but it's also about a thousand dollars US. So it's pricey, and it kinda shows that you can take less expensive gear like that Zoom H1 and really take it a long way because I think it sounds fantastic. Favorite shoe of all time? You guys have seen the shoe wall, and you know. Maybe I like shoes just a little bit, but as far as what my favorite shoe of all time is, that's easy. Bam. The original Human Race in this beautiful, beautiful TLD blue. What do you use on your hair, man? I feel like I have answered this question before, but just to throw it back out there, it's nothing fancy, nothing crazy, just this $7 Suavecito matte version. That's the key, though. Don't get the regular one, get the matte. It works better, smells amazing, I recommend it, link below. Do you still expect an SE 2? Honestly, as much as I would like to see an SE 2, mainly because Apple has really gone away from any kind of smaller form factor phone, the iPhone XS now starts at 5.8 inches. We have the iPhone XR at 6.1 and then we have the massive 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max, and there's really not an option for people who prefer small phones. I know some of you out there are probably thinking, why the heck would I want an iPhone SE size phone? That's crazy, but you'd be surprised. There's a lot of people out there who don't want to give up their SE because they love that form factor and if you're one of them, let me know with a comment down below. How much can you bench? Not nearly as much as Evans. That dude is jacked. Thoughts on the v40? That is honestly probably the most underrated phone of 2018. There's so much that's good about it, but it's just like LG just keeps screwing up with some of the things they do with their marketing so I think no one really cares about LG, which is sad because yeah, again, there's a lot of really good about that phone. The Dacon thing sounds amazing. I took it around and used it for like a week and it made me really want to reconsider my life and use wired headphones, it was that good. If you guys want to check out that video, I covered it recently. (device pinging) Hey, Vector. (device pinging) Be quiet. (laughs) He really doesn't want to be quiet. List all your favorite iPhone XR colors in order. Blue, coral, red, white, black, yellow, but if we're talkin' Power Rangers, I guess blue wins by default. We got Billy, throwin' it back. But if we could pick any color, any color at all, I'm gonna go with that Tommy green. What is your favorite part about being a tech YouTuber? Honestly, it would probably be the ripple effect of creating videos to the point where someone watches this and they're inspired to make something, leaves a comment, and for me that's everything. I get a ton of questions and comments saying, why do you use this camera for video if it's overkill, it's crazy, it unnecessary, why do you spend that much time in production? It's kinda silly for a smart phone review. Really, though, it's kinda like that episode of Breaking Bad where Walt talks to Skyler and admits, like hey, I didn't do this for everybody. I did this for me. That's kinda how I approach videos. I make videos the way I do because I have fun, it makes me happy, and if someone can be inspired with that, that's just icing on the cake. Do you ball? Absolutely, basketball is one of my favorite things to watch and also play. I absolutely hate, hate, hate, hate running. Being on the treadmill or cardio so for me that is the best way to get it in. I recently got a chance to play with Mr. Jacques Cousteau. He schooled me a little bit, but yeah. Basketball for me is a great way to get some exercise in. It's a lot of fun, and I just love basketball. Next from there, it is sponsor time. - [Richard] Dear Jon, I need a reliable, modular, customizable home security system. Help a brotha out. - Rich, that is a great question and I think friends over at SimpliSafe can definitely help you out. SimpliSafe is an incredibly effective and reliable home security system. They're actually monitored by professionals 24 hours a day, seven days a week and will call you in an emergency and even call the police if you need the extra help. For us over here at the office, we've got a ton of tech, a lot of gear, so security is a big deal. What I like most about SimpliSafe is one, the modularity. You pick and choose and build out your perfect security system to fit your needs and then from there it's both easy and intuitive to set up and use, because nobody wants to bang their head, lose their mind setting up home tech and with this, you won't have to. There's also small things like reminders saying, hey, you left your door open. You might want to close that, which I have done way too many times. The pricing is great. There's no contracts, there's no hidden fees, and overall it's just a really well-rounded security system so Rich, my friend, head over to simplisafe.com/TLD and get the help you need. Which Apple commercial you like the most. If you follow me on Twitter, you've probably seen me tweet about how good Apple's cinematography is. Whether you love them or you hate them, what they do in terms of that is next level. As far as what my favorite commercial would be, I would say recently it's gotta be the HomePod commercial that was directed by Spike Jonze. What they did in terms of how it looked, it was effects, but it was actually practical, was insane. If you haven't watched the behind the scenes, check it out now, because it will blow your mind. Where do you get your music from? Music is huge for me. It's like an integral part of the editing process for me. I will actually sit there and just go through playlist and playlist and song after song and they will actually dictate and affect how I edit a video. I'm sure most of you out there know what Epidemic Sound is, which is fantastic, but recently I've gotten into Musicbed, which is like next level for me. There are just so many more actual CD-like tracks, if that makes sense, where the vocals are great, the instrumentals are great, and yeah. It's just a great all around package. A little more pricey, but again, for me it's more of a creative inspirational thing and I would definitely recommend. Your dream AirPods? Dream AirPods, huh? One, I would definitely love to see Apple offer some color versions, especially with the release of the iPhone XR. If they had matching versions of those or Space Gray or Gold, that would be incredible. Secondly, I've always wanted some sort of haptic feedback almost like Apple Watch type functionality where if you get a call or a text, maybe it will alert you through your AirPods. I think that would be awesome. Lastly, AirPods don't sound bad but they definitely have room for improvement. For me one of the biggest drawbacks with AirPods is the sound isolation. If you're at the gym or in a airplane, forget it. The noise just leaks through and punches your ears in their ear faces. (laughing) iPhone X or XR? If you've never owned an iPhone X or XR and you're looking to buy one of those, I would probably, honestly, lean towards the XR. The A12 chip inside the XR is blazing fast, plus you're getting all the current camera features like Portrait mode and adjustable aperture, which I think is awesome. The LCD panel is definitely a slight step down in terms of quality versus OLED, but I think what you're gaining as far as features, the better battery life, I think makes it a better buy for most people. If you want a more in-depth breakdown, make sure you check out my XR review which you can check out up here or down below. Thank you guys very much for watching. Hopefully, you enjoyed the video. If you did enjoy or you feel like being awesome, make sure you guys go, Jonathan was wrong about the Google Pixel 3 on that Like button and I will catch you guys later.",

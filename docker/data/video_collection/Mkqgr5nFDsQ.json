    "transcript": "In case you guys are wondering There's been construction downstairs, every so often there are noises that come along with construction they interrupt the process here. What's up guys, Lew here, back with another video And today it is another installment of the \"Does it Suck?\" show here on Unbox Therapy. If you have no idea what that is, go watch the other episodes. I don't know why I'm pointing that way. Today, we are looking at some wireless earphones which are actually completely wireless. Now you're probably thinking \"But Lew, you've shown us wireless earphones and headphones before, what do you mean completely?\" Well these fit into your ear canals, these guys here, and have no wire, not a wire going to the back, Can you hear that? See... That's the noise I'm talking about. These are actually two little units independent of one another that go into your ears. Let's actually open the box. So these are called the D900 from a company called Syllable. And this tiny, little box here houses the goods. Extra ear tips This is a micro-USB charging cable. A little bit of paperwork. Quality control passed fairly recently Well, hot product. Tiny little things here. Oh, cool. So the case itself is how you're going to charge them up. Here's your little cable right here. Plugs right in.",

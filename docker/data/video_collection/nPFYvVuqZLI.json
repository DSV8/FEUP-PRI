    "description": "Dave2D review of the Anker Nebula Capsule. An impressive mini projector the size of a Coke can! Nebula Capsule -  Mini SNES -   The Nebula Capsule mini projector has a built in 360 degrees speaker, a screen that can comfortable scale up to 100 inches and the battery lasts around 4 hours. You can control the Nebula Capsule with your smartphone but it works perfectly fine without one connected. Pair this mini projector with a mini SNES for an awesome retro gaming experience!

    "transcript": "Hey how's it going, Dave2D here, so this is a can of Coke and behind it is a can of awesomeness. This is the Nebula capsule made by Anker. it's a very small projector and I've tried a lot of mini projectors before, the Rift 6, the Pico projectors like they're just- there's always some kind of deficiency to the product to the point where I just don't enjoy using it. This is the first one I've enjoyed thoroughly. It's bright, it's got good colors and it's just a really solid product, hence the video. Now the three biggest issues I've had with mini projectors are number one, brightness, they're usually just not bright enough for me; Secondly is the color of the image so it'll just project usually a very like desaturated or a flat-looking image which I don't like watching and the third one, a big one for me is sound there there's obviously fan noise that comes from these things because there's a little lamp in there and they got to cool it off which is fine but if their speakers aren't good or if they're not loud enough that fan just drones out everything else that you're trying to listen to. This thing does not have any of those problems so this thing has your standard HDMI connection so you can connect any kind of media device through an HDMI cable right up to this thing and it also has a dongle with a USB connection so you can connect up a USB flash drive or whatever. But the thing that makes this thing like so much better than most projectors, most mini projectors is the software that's built into it. This thing has Netflix, YouTube, Plex, a whole bunch of media services available right on the device. You don't need to connect anything third-party or even a phone to this thing it just literally takes that service, streams it and then projects it onto a surface all in the size of a Coke can. Like how cool is that, right? Okay, another thing I like about this thing, is that the speakers sound way better than I thought they would. Now a lot of mini projectors have this issue with just having a mono speaker and just projecting in one direction. This, they call it 360 Sound; I wouldn't go as far as to call it that but it's just a nice sounding speaker system that you can kind of be wherever you want around this thing and it'll still sound good It's a 5 watt speaker not huge, not amazing but it's clean. There's no buzzing, there's no hissing, it's just clean audio at a good volume. The lower frequencies are missing. It's not great with bass but considering the size of this thing, I mean it's probably physically impossible to get a good bass out of this thing so I'm happy considering what this thing is. The fan noise is actually pretty average to me, I wouldn't consider it louder or quieter than most of the many (mini?) projectors that I've used but because of the bigger and better speakers, I feel like it kind of compensates for fan noise. The battery life on this thing. They claim 4 hours on the website, I'm getting actually a little bit more than that but I think it depends on what you're doing with the device so I'm able to get a little bit more than four hours with the thing at max brightness but I'm streaming video. If you have this thing connected to a USB device or some kind of, physical drive that's feeding the data to the machine I think it's a little bit less but I'm getting around four hours of streamed content So the image is bright, way brighter than any of the other mini projectors that I've tried. it's rated at 100 ANSI lumens or a 100 A-N-S-I lumens I'm not sure exactly how they describe that thing, but this is literally double the brightness of your average mini projector Often they come in at 50. The colours on this thing are also really good. So that's something that a lot of mini projectors screw up on, it's just really muted colours. This thing, nice colours. It's a little bit oversaturated but considering what you're doing with this thing, like you're not watching these like super colour-accurate images. This thing has a nice colour profile. It has vertical keystone correction so you can have it tilted, or even use it on your bed. Now there's one issue with the image and that is its resolution. So before i looked up the resolution on this thing, when I was just looking at the image on the wall i always assumed that this thing was like 720p maybe even 1080p like my eye can't really tell when it comes to projection because they're never super, super sharp This thing is actually a 480p projection and it's- on paper that's terrible like that's straight-up pathetic I think for a lot of people they're like \"Hey 480p? Screw that, not interested\". But visually, it looks totally acceptable to me. If you're looking for like a 4K super crisp image then, don't even look at these products. But if you're just looking for like a large screen with decent image quality, that's super portable This thing fits the ticket. Okay, in terms of the screen size you can get up to 100 inches, that's what they say but you got to be in a really dark room to project it like that, but I can get like a 60 to maybe 70 inch (177.8 cm) image without going to a super dark area. So what else is there? There's a remote, it's like kind of your standard remote and there's also an app that you can use on your phone to control the device, and it's surprisingly good there's no hiccups, it's not janky and there is mouse control, it's actually a pretty good app. There's some things I don't like about this thing the big one for me is frame rate so i don't mind the resolution loss because visually I just- it's not that important to me at this screen size and at this viewing distance but the reduced frame rate limits this thing for my use so if I'm watching Twitch or even playing games I'm used to just watching things at 60 fps, this thing is not. I want to say it's like 24 or maybe even 30 frames per second. It's not really listed in the instruction manual so I'm not sure what it is but it's definitely not 60 frames per second. Another thing I don't like is that you can't log into the YouTube app so maybe they'll fix that in the future, but in its current iteration because you can't log in, you don't see your subscription feed or anything like that. There's still a search history so you can kind of see the videos that you've looked up in the past but there's no custom feed in the YouTube app right now. OK, my favorite thing about this device though is seriously, this thing paired with one of these things, those like retro gaming consoles from Nintendo. This kind of combination is super fun like this is already a portable system that you can bring around, do whatever you want with it, and then you plug it up to the projector and now you can play big screen Mario Kart wherever the heck you want. It's freaking awesome. So this is a device that is gonna be different for everyone who uses it some people want something like this some people want to stream from their phone, through AirPlay, Cast on Android. Whatever it is there's just so much utility with this thing and i think for a lot of people it's a really good pick up. So this thing starts at $350, it's obviously not cheap but it's got a lot of utility and for the right person it's a really cool device. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it, see you guys next time. (subtitles by p3rs0nn)",

    "transcript": "Do you know that it's really easy to get all the Wi-Fi passwords from a Windows computer? This command netsh wlan show profile shows us all the Wi-Fi profiles stored on this computer and as you can see here is one called O.MG there's a TP-Link one and there are various other Wi-Fi networks. To see the password of a Wi-Fi network we can use the command netsh wlan show profile the name of the network now you don't always have to put this in quotations but if you have a problem then use quotation marks key=clear is going to show us the password in clear text. So if I press enter notice there is the password. If you add | findstr Key with an uppercase K that'll just show you the password and if I did that for another Wi-Fi network in this case the TP-Link Wi-Fi network notice the password is that. Hackers can use this to extract the information and copy it to a server somewhere to grab all your Wi-Fi passwords so",

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken, and something has made me a little bit curious lately especially with the announcement of Apple's new iMacs. Did Apple leak a prototype iMac in one of their 2007 ads? I'm curious to hear your thoughts, so let's take a look. From 2006 to 2009, Apple ran the \"Get a Mac\" ad campaign starring Justin Long as Mac, and John Hodgman as PC. At the end of every ad, you'd see a photo of a Mac. Some earlier ads would show either a white MacBook or white iMac with the gray Apple logo. When the new aluminum iMacs came out with a black Apple logo, those were shown at the end of the ads instead. But what caught my eye was the boxing ad. At the end of the ad, you don't see a white iMac with a gray logo or an Aluminum iMac with a black logo. You see an aluminum iMac with a gray logo. The iMac never had that particular combination of colors, so that's where I got curious. In fact, I saw this happen in two more ads, and then later, the black logo showed up. So at first I thought, no, that's not a real iMac, it was maybe just some weird Photoshop issue, right? Until I saw one in person. When I visited Hap's prototype collection, I saw an aluminum iMac which was thicker than the retail model, and on the chin there's the gray Apple logo. And it looks identical to the one in the ads. Was it a mistake? Did they accidentally leak a prototype? Not sure. I just thought this was worth sharing. So let me know what you think. I also have a video tour of the whole prototype collection on my Patreon, so go ahead and check that out, and feel free to subscribe for more tech episodes coming at you, from the Computer Clan. And if you liked this episode, you know what to do. Thanks for sticking with me. Catch the crazy, and pass it on. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here! And this is a little different video from normal. This is something called Flybrix. And this is a product that I actually purchased last year, like, late 2016, and I bought it because it would be pretty cool, and I completely forgot about it. It just sat in my office for months, at this point, and I finally found it back again, and I thought I would kinda do an unboxing slash... kinda product experience with it. Because I'm not going to review this, I'm not an expert at this type of thing. What it is is a drone-type product, technically they're called, like, remote-controlled quadcopters or remote-controlled... toys of some sort. But that's what this is-- but what makes this one special is that it's made out of Lego, and you can attach, like, different things to it, and you can make it a Lego drone. Okay, let's take a look. So... I've never built my own quadrocopter before. Or drone before. Oh my gosh, this is so many pieces. I'm just going to try to do this thing without instructions, because... I mean, we'll see. This feels very not sturdy. Like, I know it's Lego, but this feels extremely not sturdy. *Laughing out of confusio .* What am I doing here?! I think I have to look at the instructions. It looks like to control this thing, you need to get an app. So I'm going to download that on my phone, I'll be right back. Okay. How do I fly it? No! Oh, I had to arm it! [WTF] *Escaping to avoid being cut into a million pieces.* *Sad drone sounds.* *Laughing* *Okay...* *Okay...* Okay. Okay. Is this off? Is this disarmed? Okay. [Rip drone.] *Okay...* That did not go as planned. Umm... I kinda have a feeling this one was very imbalanced-- that's why it flew off. And when out of control. Okay, I'm going to rebuild this. I mean it feels... ...slightly more balanced than it was before. I don't think it's going to make that much of a difference, but I have to test. *Random Lego brick goes flying better than the drone.* I'm not sure what to think of this thing. I mean, I could probably rebuild it and try it again, I think I should. I've been trying, like, four rotors, they supply eight. And I guess eight would give it more stability? I don't know much about quadcopters and RC toys, but I feel like the more rotors would kinda give it more opportunity to balance itself out with the gyroscope. So that's what I'm going to do, I'm going to do one more attempt at a build, I'm going to follow the instructions to a T, get eight rotors on this thing, eight props on this thing, and see if it does any better. Okay, so at this point, I've spent a little bit over an hour building this thing, and I gotta be honest, it's not been the most fun hour of my life, but this is the completed version of their eight rotor device, I guess? Uh, I put on a BB8 up front, because I mean, that's what this whole thing is about, sticking Lego pieces onto this thing so that's what we have. BB8's probably my favorite Star Wars-related item. Now we're just going to reconnect it and let's see how this goes. Now, before I launch this thing, I gotta be completely honest, I don't have faith in it. I feel like the reasons why it failed originally with the four rotor version still exist in this eight rotor version. But this is as complicated this build can be, and this is built exactly the way that they've described it in the instructions. So if this doesn't work, then this doesn't work. Okay, we are connected, and I'm going to get out of the way. And let this thing fly. Okay. The other thing is I'm convinced that this is going to shatter into, like, all the pieces, and I don't want to rebuild it, so this is the last time I'm going to do this. Okay, here we go. Please work! *Oh my god.* *Oh my god.* Okay! This... ..is... This is why this product should not exist. Okay. I spent... about an hour... building this thing... ...and... ...and you know what, while I was building and I looked it up, this thing is currently going for $180. It was a little bit more than what I thought it was, that is a lot of money for a product that... ...I mean... ...maybe there's someone out that's going to enjoy this, but really, if you're interested in drones, there's like, $20 drones that are amazing. I'll link my favorite one below, and it flies, I mean, this one I broke, but the fly great, and if you ever smash them, it's 20 bucks. Not 180 bucks. Hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time.",

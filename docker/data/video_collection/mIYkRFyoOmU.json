    "transcript": "Whats up guys! Lew here back with another video, and today I have something for you that solves a problem, hopefully, it solves a problem for you, that is, the scourge of the Earth that happens to be battery life. The problem is, up until this point, the expansion or extension of battery life on your phone meant that you needed this bulky thing! Now don't get me wrong, I love battery banks, I got a whole thing for battery banks. I got 15 of them out here, but if you can get it in a case for your device, that's also compelling, it's also appealing. Apple, they came out with their own battery case for the iPhone. I made a couple videos about it, in fact in one of them I even sliced the baby open to see what it is. Go watch that video if you don't know what I'm talking about, but anyway, this company here, what're they called, \"ThinCharge\"? ThinCharge. And in here, is what I'm told, is the world's thinnest battery case for iPhone. According to the back here, it's still got 2600mAh, more than a full charge for your iPhone 6s. Am I right about this? Yes, it can double your iPhone standby time. Plus it's a case at the end of the day, so you're gonna get a little bit of protection out of it. And I need a knife and i don't have one. Alright, let's crack this baby open and see just how thin the ThinCharge is. Oh, it's a gold one! Oh yeah, that is-! You know what this case kinda reminds me of is the design of the iPhone 5. What the? Warm tips? They're tips? They're giving me tips? Why is it warm? Jack, warm tips. Is that like hot tips but not so hot? Press for 1 second to check the battery capacity, 3 seconds to start/stop charging. There's an LED on this key and it'll tell you how much battery life is left in the case. I like that, you got some feedback to tell you how charged up your case is. You don't need to remove your phone every single time, you can just charge the case and then the case charges the phone, know what I'm saying? You have all your cut outs you'd expect to have, microphone, headphone jack. How do you... Top comes off. Well that's easy. Just how slim it is. We're in. Three seconds to start charging. One, two, three. Oh, sweet! Your volume up button, you just hold that baby for 3 seconds, and it begins charging. This is what Apple charge case should've been. Go like this... Now the case is charging and pass through charging of course to the device. Essentially now, what do you have, you have like a... Close to a 5000 mAh phone! Gotta get the Apple charge case. Okay, so, this is Apple's take on the charge case. You got this hump on the back I don't know if you guys can see that... Just a very, very strange design. And the crazy part about this device here is it's only 1877 mAh of juice, versus 2600. So this guy, which again, looks and feels like a normal case, slides in and out of your pocket like a normal phone, and it's 2600 mAh. And it's thinner and shorter. I mean, these guys, they got Apple beat! Their entire, like, giant R&D department, and ThinCharge over here. Charges pretty quick, too. We're already up to 14%. There's an LED indicator light on the side. It's flashing one time so it's between 67 and 99%. It'll speed up and flash in 2 and 3 time increments, as it gets depleted, and if the green light is consistently on, then it's a 100% battery. I think a lot of people would notice, next to no difference functionally, carrying this around compared to just the iPhone bare naked. That's it, simple! Why didn't Apple do this? Military grade. Stop yelling at me.",

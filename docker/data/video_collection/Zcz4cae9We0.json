    "description": "The LG G7 Thinq is a good phone but it is now being relaunched as the more affordable LG G7 ONE, part of the Android One lineup.  That means it runs a pure, unmodified version of Android without any wrappers or bloatware.  This may be the best Android phone available right now since it's also supposed to be pretty affordable.

    "transcript": "hey guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and this is LG's g7 one now if you call I did take a look at its older sibling the g7 thank you a little over a month ago and I had some concerns about that device my major problem with that phone was a softer experience LG's skin on top of Android really wasn't my thing and I didn't have a great of an experience but the rest of device was awesome he had a great display the Quan - that was fantastic battery life was also excellent so a lot of things have changed ever since they posted that video prices have dropped on that device it could vary from carrier to carry you might end up getting a major discount on that particular device and you know it actually competes with the likes of Samsung and the rest of the flagship devices so that's pretty awesome but I think the g7 one might be one of the favorite Android smartphones or one of my favorite inner it's my phones of 2018 I don't know why it's running stock Android it's like a dream come true so let's find out who exactly might this phone be appealing towards right after message from our sponsor the new master keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a comfortable magnetic wrist rest beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter and perky lighting control with a variety of Cherry MX switches and the bottom type-c connection Coolermaster doing it right check it out below okay so let's cut to the chase and get to what exactly you're getting with the g7 one perhaps the best way to describe this phone would be a slight derivative of the g7 thank you so you get the same 6.1 inch qHD plus display with the 1000 it's a boosted mode feature it still features an IPS panels so viewing content is just as good as a thank you great experience overall they've also kept the 32-bit high fived ACK and the boom box feature that resonates the sound within the chassis to any surface that you place the device on there's also the dedicated Google Assistant button ip68 water-resistant rating a 3000 milliamp hour battery with charge 3.0 support you get the deal here so what's really different well the first thing that struck to my eye was the slight shift in design and by that I mean that they've replaced the glass back with a stating black metal like finish if that makes any sense it certainly doesn't get as greasy as a thank you and I like that even the aluminum frame has a matte black finish to it and I'm really diggin it over the thing to use a stainless steel frame they've also removed the wide-angle lens but it still maintains the same 16 megapixel F 1.6 standard lens and pictures that come out of it are mostly a hit or miss sometimes they look too wibbit other times there there are some weird color shifts going on and if you're really patient with the device you can actually end up getting some amazing shots with the phone especially in broad daylight conditions and if you expose the subjects really well the pictures coming out of the device is actually really good there's a lot less software processing on the gcn one compared to thank you that's one of the things I noticed after examining the pictures up closely so I think that's a positive because LG hasn't loaded it with things like manual controls so there's nothing like that on the jisun one so it may or may not be a deal-breaker for some of you out there support for wireless charging has also been eliminated and you're getting a slightly older snapdragon 835 CPU four gigabytes of RAM versus six on the thank you and that's pretty much it the biggest selling feature of this device is the OS that runs on it LG has partnered up with Google to give users a clean version of Android that doesn't come with any bloatware applications or skins in fact LG is guaranteeing software updates on the g7 one for the next three years and I think that's a step in the right direction because you all know they have a pretty bad history with updating their smartphones now this guy's currently walking Android 8.1 Oreo and it is expected to receive the Android 9 PI update by the end of the year which is pretty cool but interestingly enough I did check the software version running on the g7 thank you and that device is actually still rockin android 8.0 instead of 8.1 and it really questions LG software team because i feel like you know google is directly handling the software updates for the g7 one whereas with a g7 thank you it's again mostly carrier related and you kind of have to be lucky enough to receive software updates in the first place so it's kind of confusing when you compare the g7 one to the thank you just in terms of pure software perspective and after spending some time with this device I've got to admit I really wish to think Hugh was running the exact same oh s apps load up fast it's easier to get the settings it almost feels like using a pixel device and I think that's a win win in my books but there is a major problem you see this phone was announced earlier at E for this year and no one had any clue as to how much this thing would cost and on top of that they had no guarantee as to whether or not this ahead in North American markets as of filming this video the ji-sun 1 is only launching in Canada and not the US and interestingly enough I have no idea as to how much this thing costs in Canadian dollars which is super interesting so we reached out to LG and asked them about this and their response was and I quote the g7 one will be priced competitively in the mid tier smartphone sector and we encourage all consumers to check with their local carrier or retailers for pricing so yeah that's where we are right now it looks like they didn't have any plans to launch this device globally but rather work with local carriers within select countries to price this competitively to compete with mid-range smartphones so again pricing on the g7 one can vary from carrier to carrier and if you happen to find this phone at a really good affordable price point and if it really if it justifies your budget then it's probably worth checking out but I will mention this it's certainly gonna cost a lot less than the g7 thank you now I do want to take this time and talk about Google's Android 1 program because LG isn't the first device to run a blue air free version of Android in fact there are phones from Nokia Xiaomi and Motorola as part of the Android 1 family and those devices are also expected to receive software updates directly from Google you see Android 1 was initially launched for the Indian market because the majority of devices that were available back then for that particular market didn't have the required specs to run a fully loaded version of Android with a third-party skin on top of that because the specs really weren't able to catch up to the speed or it wasn't up to the task and so you know being able to offer a bloatware free version of Android for the lower tier spec and Google being able to customize and optimize the software to run seamlessly on lower tier devices was I guess their priority and that's why Android 1 was sort of formulated or I guess it was launched with that idea in mind it then started to spread across countries like Pakistan Nepal Bangladesh Myanmar Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries fast forward to today and we technically have three different versions of Android so there's a standard Android operating system that other OEM manufacturers put their skin on top of it which is exactly what we're getting with the note 9 the other thousand-dollar flagship devices and then we have the stock version of Android which is the Android one program which is more targeted towards the mid-tier devices that are optimized and they have mid-tier specs that can other price competitively and then there is Android Go which was introduced last year along with android 8.0 Oreo this essentially is a stripped-down version of Android one so Google was able to work with software developers to fine-tune apps like YouTube Gmail Chrome maps are the most frequently used applications for most consumers out there on devices that don't necessarily have the highest end specs so we're talking maybe one to two gigabytes of RAM with a pretty low-end processor so it really is it's a great idea potentially for people who don't really want to spend 400 or 500 500 plus dollars on an Android smartphone so it really gives you the best or I guess it gives you an entry little step into experiencing Android at its finest and I think Android Go is certainly a great way to get started if you especially if you really don't want to spend too much money on an Android smartphone and then you have things like Android one which is exactly what forms like the g1 represents because it certainly is a great program I really wish Samsung hopped onto this program as well because you know who knows we might expect something like the galaxy s 9 1 Edition I certainly think that the g7 one might be a fantastic option for you because again this thing runs stock Android it's fast I really love it it's my favorite Android smartphone for 2018 but availability is a concern so I'm gonna just I'm just gonna leave it at that hope you guys enjoyed this little bit let me know what you guys think about g7 one in the comments if you happen to find this at your local carrier store would you actually consider this device love to know your thoughts in the comments I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to subscribe to our new boot sequence channel for the

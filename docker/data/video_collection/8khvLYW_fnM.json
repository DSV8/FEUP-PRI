    "transcript": "New video time! Get pumped up! What's up guys, Lewis here back with another video and I am very excited for this one, In front of me I have the SE846 from Shure. These are in-ear headphones, earphones, whichever you prefer to call them, and, these are very high end. As you can tell from the title of this video and the pricing and availability (link in the description) these are for serious audiophile-type listeners, for professional musicians, etc. These are not run-of-the-mill earbuds and they have some very interesting innovations that make them special. So I'm excited. Did I already say that? Let's go ahead, open these up and take a closer look at what makes the SE846 from Shure so special. Wow! This is a very high quality box my friends. It's got like that soft-touch plastic going on, This is some serious presentation. That's how you know this product is no joke. On the front here, SE846 in this nice, glossy kind of finish here on top of the matte box. And they lift open like this, like a treasure, wow... \"An earphone with true subwoofer performance. It demands absolute precision.\" What an experience so far So, we have a little bit of paperwork over here The SE846, of course Nice glossy little manual A limited warranty, some safety precautions, some other information here This traveling case is really high quality on its own It reminds me sort of of, like, One of those Pelican cases you guys may have seen before Has these clasps on the side there for making sure that it's locked And you are gonna wanna protect these, obviously, after making that kind of investment in a pair of earphones Okay, let's lift this baby open So there we go First thing you'll notice is this cleaning cloth on the top Bring that down so you guys can have a closer look So, I suppose this is gonna be used to maintain the shimmer and shine And that factory-fresh feel [Laughs] So, you've got a cleaning cloth Then you have a case on the left and the earbuds on the right Let's look in this case first Wow, this is a pretty solid case on its own So, I assume, if you're just taking the earbuds with you, Maybe you could just probably take this smaller travel case So, lots of stuff to talk about in this first case right here On this side, I'll open up this package first I can see there's a cable installed on the earbuds, so this looks like an extra cable here You can see it's super sturdy, this cable Braided And then, there's plastic over top of the braiding so it doesn't fray And, of course, these cables are removable You wouldn't want a super expensive set of earbuds or headphones without a removable cable Because, if you have an issue with the cable, easily replaceable You've also got a quarter-inch adapter So this will fit onto the end here for high-end audio systems Or really anything that uses this quarter-inch style instead of the mini jack connector There's a shirt clip, as well, to manage your cable An airline adapter, and what do we have here? This looks like a little volume adjuster So, if you want to have an in-line volume, as opposed to reaching down to your device You have an in-line volume adjuster Also inside this case are tons of different ear adapters So you can get the right fit And this is important in in-ear headphones, earbuds, et cetera You wanna make sure to get the best fit, that will give you the best frequency response, if you get a nice seal And it will also help in the low-end frequencies the most Because if you have sound bleeding out you're not going to get the full impact of those low-end frequencies So you can see, there's a number of different styles here That's because everybody's ear canals are different So you're gonna want to test out each and every one to determine which one works best for you and gives you the best results So lots to choose from and play with there And this is where things get really really interesting This is one of the unique characteristics of this earphone This is a tool, here on this side, And this is used to swap out filters on the earphones and you're probably thinking, \"What is he talking about? What is this gibberish with filters?\" These earphones have the ability to modify the sound signature So, by installing different filters, we can see them here in my hand hopefully you guys can see that You can actually warm up the sound, if you want to, you can have a flat frequency response, if you prefer And then the last one, I believe, is a little boost in the brightness, so the higher frequencies, if that is a sound signature that you perfer So, these are really heavily customizable To suit your listening preferences depending on how you like to listen to music and the kind of music you want to listen to Try 'em all out, just like the ear tips, and then find out which is most suitable for you and then stick to that one They're very easy to install and change out So, here are the actual SE846, wow As you can tell, not your everyday earbud These are not the earbuds included for free with your portable media player, phone, et cetera These are a totally different beast, and that's what's beautiful about them There's all kinds of engineering and design that goes into each one of these Traditionally earbuds have had difficulty delivering really low-end, heavy-duty, kick-you-in-the-face type of bass But this design right here might be the best in the business at delivering those frequencies while maintaining accurate response in the other ranges So true, sub woofer, really super low frequency bass coming out of these guys You'll notice there's a little bend there, these are meant to fit over the ear So, they'll actually go over the top of your ear to help secure them You know, like a professional monitor like you would see on stage for a musician, or a singer, vocalist, et cetera You've also got a removable cable as I said before I really like the translucent design here so you can actually see the components on the inside So, what's left to do except try out these phenomenal things? I mean, I know they're amazing I've already read some reviews and have looked at some other videos And these things are kind of the undisputed champs, as they should be for the price These are obviously not going to be for everyone, but you guys need to remember that if you're a professional If you're earning money because of what you're hearing in your ear canal A musician or professional audio engineer, et cetera, et cetera Then, all of the sudden, as a tool these become that much more attainable because you're actually going to be making stuff using them For the average listener, this is going to be for high end listeners, obviously at this price point But, for those individuals that can appreciate fine-tuning their listening experience I'm going to be testing these out with a couple of different audio players and some FLAC files So, I am really excited to do that, but for now, let me go do a quick test and come back to you [Music plays] Okay I need to have a serious moment with you guys right now These are the greatest headphones I have ever listened to in my entire life Hands down, no close second This is serious business I am shocked Whatever Shure has done here is next level, you understand me? This is a completely different listening experience to anything that I've heard before The dynamics are insane, the isolation, as far as these eartips, the ones that were pre-installed They just shut off the rest of the world beyond even what active noise cancellation can do So you can really appreciate every little nuance in the music The bass is insane for an in-ear headphone Everything I expected to happen just happened, and I am blown away This is obviously a very expensive product, but goddamn, now I know why This is engineering at it's finest right here, hands down Check out the link in the description No joke from Shure [Laughs] I mean, I've got nothing left to say I'm just laughing, literally when I put on the first song I just started laughing and smiling and I couldn't stop That's what these headphones do for me And, listen I'm a tough person to get that kind of reaction out of I'm playing with new gagets and toys all the time, and these things have made very happy I can't wait to do some more listening and try out some different types of music And maybe even try out those different filters and everything I'm pumped! Alright guys, thanks for watching this video If you enjoyed it make sure to leave a thumbs up below And tweet this video at Shure let them know how much I love their amazing new product Once again SE846 from Shure, link in the description No joke, #nojoke Later guys",

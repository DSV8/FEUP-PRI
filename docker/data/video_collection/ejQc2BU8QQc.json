    "transcript": "Do you know that you can run Linux on an iPhone or Android device for free. Here are my two favorite applications on an iPhone I'm using iSH shell free application that you can download. Termux is the application that I'm using on Android I'm running Linux here so on the iPhone as an example I can type pwd you can see that my directory is /root uname -a press enter you can see that we're running Linux there uname -a on Android you can see that we're also running Linux on the iPhone cd / as an example ls -l you can see all the folders in the root directory I could go back to the home directory by typing cd and then pwd once again whoami shows I am root this is fantastic because you can learn Linux on the move now you won't necessarily have the full power of Linux here but you can install apps. Now if you want to learn more have a look at the video which I've linked below I just wanted to show you that you can run Linux on both an iPhone and an Android device for free",

    "description": "The Razer Blade Stealth 13 lineup can be confusing but the Mercury White edition is unique since it uses a 25W Intel Ice Lake processor and Iris Plus graphics instead of a GTX 1650.   But can this improve battery life and make it one of the best ultrabooks released in 2019?  Razer sure hopes so!

    "transcript": "so this is the new Razer Blade Stealth 13 and I know what you might be thinking to yourselves Eber didn't you just review this about a month ago that is true but this is a different model it's the base one that comes with the 25 watt version of Intel's amazing.i SiC CPUs which is the 1065 g7 I was actually kidding about that amazing part because yeah it's it's pretty terrible I the naming scheme is is trash now if you recall watching my full in-depth video on the blade stealth with the GTX 1615 max Q graphics card one of my biggest concerns with that notebook was that Razer was using a 15 watt version of the Khorasan processor which significantly affected its a CP performance under a full multi-core load it only reached 2 gigahertz and that also affected gaming performance so ever since then I've been actually waiting to get my hands on this notebook specifically the one that comes with the 25 hour chip to see what kind of performance improvements can we expect in fact is it can be better than the top-tier specs GTX 1650 max key model that cost 300 for our sponsor the new cases by metal gear come with three variations newest silent neo air and neo G to satisfy your build and visual preference with the good i/o excellent internal layout and our to be fans included on Neo G and air models check the description to see which neo is best for you alright so first step I do want to quickly go over these spec differences between this base model and the top-tier spec GTX 1650 max Q variant so the cpus are the exact same except for their TDP memory still remains the same and 16 gigabytes running at 37 33 megahertz unfortunately storage is cut in half and razer does not have the option to upgrade within their site although it is user upgradeable this mercury white model does not come with a discreet graphics card and the price fifteen hundred US dollars which isn't cheap but if you compare to the competition from Dell HP or even a sir it's actually pretty good now from a physical standpoint there isn't anything new with this mercury white model it still maintains the same footprint as D GTX Berrien I'm actually really digging this silver finish it isn't pure white like the XPS 13 - and one that we checked out recently it Matt and interestingly enough it doesn't show fingerprints as bad as the black model the key caps however are white and I'm still debating whether or not if it goes along with the solar chassis but when you're in a dark room the lighter finish does reflect the colors exhibited by the display and it looks gorgeous it's certainly photogenic if you were to ask me the keys themselves are okay they're not the best in the market right now I think the Lenovo x1 carbon takes the crown with that because it's got solid feedback when you're typing on it this I mean I really wish the razer improvises on their next-gen Blade notebooks because it's the same exact setup that's found on my blade 15 notebook so yeah it's it is what it is the trackpad is one of the best on a Windows based notebook it features Windows position drivers and it surprised at the actual footprint because for a 13-inch notebook it is pretty big especially when compared to the XPS 13 from Dell and even HP Spectre x-360 the IO remains the same just like the gtx 1650 model so you get two USB Taipei's two USB type C's that are also Thunderbolt 3 compatible and an audio jack the blade stealth 13 comes with a tan DP IPS display I love the fact that it's a matte screen versus glossy screens that you'll find on other notebooks thin aligned notebooks specifically so this will definitely help you with travel needs because you don't have to worry about reflections or whatnot this is definitely gonna cut that significantly and it's a very color accurate panel as well in terms of upgradability it's the same layout as the GTX 1615 max Q model so the only thing that you can upgrade is to storage unfortunately memory is soldered on to the mainboard but if you pay close attention to this area of the mainboard you'll notice that that's where the 1650 max Q is housed on the top-tier spec model so it's interesting to see that they're so using the same layout just that now you have two fans just cooling and that isolates CP which is probably why they decided to go with that xx powered version because they have that thermal Headroom now battery life on this base model is good but not great especially when compared to the GTX 1615 max Q model as you can see it only lasts maybe 10-15 minutes longer than the top-tier spec model which actually goes to show how efficient and videos optimist technology is with that 1650 graphics card and now the moment that you've all been waiting for is this 25 one core i7 1065 g7 compared to its 15 watt sibling well the numbers do make a lot more sense now taking a look at Cinebench r15 there's a 30% improvement in the multi-core test the XPS 13 tune 1 still remains the fastest in this test single core performance didn't really improve by all that much and that makes sense since these notebooks didn't have an issue running at 3.5 to 3.9 gigahertz but the whiskey lake core i7 85 65 you on the older model was the fastest switching over to our 20 the story changes completely the 25 watt ice-like cpu on this blade stealth dominates this test it's 40% faster than the GTX model moving on to some real-world tests starting with blender running the BMW benchmark this health continues to surprise me guys it's once again 40% faster than the GTX model and close to 30 percent faster than the XPS 13 tuned one notebook unfortunately running DaVinci Resolve studio on these notebooks is a little bit of a challenge because we tried rendering the exact same project that we use for all of our benchmarks on the I select notebooks but particularly with notebooks that do not have a discrete graphics card and it just wouldn't work I think it's more of an Intel Quick Sync optimization issue with resolve and the giving hakuren hardware because with the GTX scenary 50 model and the MX 115 model and basically other you know systems that run a discrete graphics card it runs perfectly fine so I think maybe Blackmagic has to do something with optimization it's certainly not Razer's fault but yeah if you're planning on running DaVinci Resolve on this notebook which first of all I would not recommend because it's not an editing notebook it's something to know however I did run Adobe Premiere Pro and I expected to be slower than the GTX model since it is missing a discrete graphics card after all so this test certainly favors that model but when you compare to the XPS 13 this blade is 14% faster interestingly enough when you compare this to the whisky Lake models between the MX 150 GPU it's relatively close to wrap things up we have Corona add-in for 3ds max and this Razer blade once again shines with flying colors leaning this test so overall b2 version of the core i7 i6 CPU on this blade is certainly the fastest that we've tested among other notebooks and I didn't expect it to be that fast compared to the XPS 13 2 & 1 featuring the exact same CPU with the same TDP now that has to do with how well Razer was able to sustain clock speeds on this notebook at 2.8 gigahertz under a full multi-core workload now I do want to bring up something important that is when you hit this with a full load right off the bat clock speed show up to 3.5 3.7 gigahertz but temps reach 93 C and then it down clocks it to 2.8 gigahertz while maintaining temperatures around 70 C now can you actually game on this notebook well you can't really throw anything intensive since the iris plus graphics is really meant for light gaming loads at 1080p at the lowest possible settings titles like rocket league csgo overwatch run pretty well and it's a significant improvement over UHD graphics from last gen also for some reason 3dmark Cloud Gate refused to run on this notebook I tried everything I could to diagnose that issue but I was out of luck so to conclude this baseline Razer blade stealth surpassed my expectations especially in terms of its CPU performance because it really is one of the fastest that we tested so far and I really wish if the gtx 1650 model had the exact same configuration but that isn't the case so it's it's really weird to have two different versions of the processors on both these notebooks and it's kind of ironic because you're spending 300 ollars more to get that 1650 graphics card but you're not getting the best CP performance on that model then again this isn't a gaming laptop after all because I think Razer's really targeting this towards others thin and light notebooks in the competition especially from Dell HP Acer so I wouldn't say that this is a great primary notebook I think this would be more of a supplementary notebook that would go along with your desktop PC or if you're someone just looking for a clean simple laptop that has really good CP performance pretty good battery life and something that looks like I don't know a MacBook Pro then why not I think the price is pretty justifiable although I am pretty bummed about the fact that Razer doesn't give you the option to upgrade storage on their site but I want to invite someone who might actually consider switching to this blade notebook from his Lenovo x1 carbon or not I don't know if that's gonna happen maybe not maybe yes I don't know but I'm gonna invite Mike over because he's gonna he's he has some thoughts about about this laptop so why don't we when we get him on board so I was never a Lenovo ThinkPad user I always use the Sony vials but after the last year of using the x1 carbon I absolutely love this thing would I switch to the Razer that there's a couple of benefits going in the Razer's favor first of all this screen is so much better than the one I have right now on my x1 carbon in addition to that the form factor is a little bit smaller the keyboard is nowhere near as good as the x1 carbon and at the same time I'm really not a big fan of the the white keyboard now from a performance standpoint I actually prefer the Razer device the reason for that is if I need to have something that's a little bit more adaptable before I want to play I don't know sieve or something like that at the airport this is capable of it whereas the x1 carbon completely shits the bed but as somebody who has a high powered desktop and just want something that's portable a good battery life would I even think about getting this it would be on my list but I would still go towards the x1 carbon just for all of its benefits oh okay I'm doing the sign-off again here we go I'm Michael with Harvard Canucks uber is once again behind the camera he's smiling at me right now because you know what I'm gonna screw this up you can find a couple of other videos from us here you can subscribe up there and our other channel boot sequence is somewhere down there so I will see you in the next one or maybe not or May it's just gonna be Ebert",

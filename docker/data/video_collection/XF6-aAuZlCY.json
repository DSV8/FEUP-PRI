    "transcript": "hello people I'm Dimitri and today we're talking about my final dual system configuration inside the evolv X you know my first try going air-cooling wasn't exactly satisfactory to me you know my initial idea of going full air meant that I have to avoid any drivers from all-in-one coolers and pumps and things like that and I really just wanted to go a full Noctua route because their fans are fantastic their coolers are fantastic however for my 8600K the ITX configuration that tiny little cooler while sufficient enough for maybe a pea use and lower tier i3s and I fives I just wasn't able to keep up with my 4.8 gigahertz overclock and so we had to step up our game now based on the initial video everybody was commenting about why not go you know with a custom loop why not go with dual all-in-one coolers which is what I did here and I really just wanted to get into the mindset of someone who would use two systems for their everyday tasks and really try to utilize that hardware so yeah let me share my experience with you right after this the new animatic slick tech TR for AI a liquid CPU cooler now features this beautifully diffused RGB lining around the CPU block that can be customized via this control box or through your motherboard it covers 100% of the IHS plus it comes in two forty to eighty and three sixty millimeter variants learn more in the description down below so obviously one of the main advantages of having dual systems inside something like the evolv X is the fact that you're saving on space you have two functioning systems one power supply they revolt X so that is an additional expense but it is a 1200 watt unit and there is also platinum efficiency which is awesome but the $250 it is an expensive unit however the fact that it can power two systems it is an added value versus other 1200 watt power supplies that are also platinum efficiency you're looking around like 150 to 200 dollars so significantly cheaper than the revolt X so you're upfront cost of doing something like this is going to be much higher versus if you were to just build two systems in two separate cases and of course if you go into the full custom water cooling look for the do systems all that additional you know cost on water cooling gear is going to offset the additional price you'll spend on the power supply so that's not really an issue and I'm thinking majority of people who would gravitate towards doing a dual system inside the Evolv X might potentially just go with like a low-power you know high-efficiency ITX system that you can maybe use for an ass or your banking or for security reasons also let's not forget you would need a KVM switch to actually optimize your workflow with dual systems when they're so close together and the KVM switch allows you to use one set of peripherals so you route everything into it and with a click of a button it switches between the inputs from one system to the other and you can also get them really expensive ones that allow you to reroute HDMI and other video signals too but for you know if you're using one monitor simply switching the input is enough for my own personal use but a KVM switch is crucial now that's what the assembly process this is my third time building inside the evolv X so the first thing you must do is just completely assemble your ITX system pre route everything so that is working fine and only then insert your ATX components and the rest of the hardware it is important to double check to make sure the ITX system is working and it is hilarious to see you know monitor being powered by the GPU and then the entire body of the case completely empty and really highlight the unique position of that ITX configuration inside the evolv X it almost like hides your system and you know mounting an ATX motherboard and the rest of your hardware in there it doesn't really compromise on clearance you know it is a bit more difficult routing certain things above the ATX motherboard but all in all it is a pretty decent assembly process for cooling I went with NZXT Krakens I love how they look the pump and that whole mirror design on the interior especially because there are two of them I wanted them to match so I have the X 42 which is a 140 millimeter radiator for the ITX system and the X72 for the ATX system which is a 360 rod so plenty of cooling I kept the original noctua fence for the front nice static pressure through that dust filter so I get the best air flow and there the front so they are Brown but really visible when you're looking at the side which is what I wanted because the original plan of going full knocked or you know it didn't exactly render a beautiful system versus now I pretty proud of what came out of it my GPU of choice for the ITX system is the gtx 1060 it is blower style so that will help with cooling because it is right against the glass I didn't want anything too powerful and I really just wanted to test out the temperatures when both systems are fully engaged in some type of workload situations both for the CPU and the GPU and I'm actually quite surprised at the temperatures all the hardware is adequately cooled both CPUs are at 4.8 gigahertz which is amazing and the only Carter item here is the Titan XP I'm guessing it is because it is getting that hot air from the front all-in-one cooler plus the backplate of the gtx 960 so airflow is a bit challenging in that section but I don't know 82 degrees Celsius is kind of what you'd expect in like a normal shot see anyway so I'm pretty happy and the one thing to keep in mind is that you can actually offset the vertical GPU for the second system slightly away from the panel to give you a little extra breathing room but that is only possible if your main GPU is does no it's not too tall and if the PCI cables don't actually interfere with the second vertical card and that's for noise levels because everything is kind of contained and the only added noise making element is the pump and the additional fan for the X42 it is still pretty quiet and you can't tell that two systems are on right now now as you can see I matched everything in green and that is just because the Jedi Order logo on the Titan XP that is in green and you cannot change the color unless you turn it off and so I just decide to go full on green for the whole system you know the coolers look fantastic in green the memory looks awesome in green you can even have lighting underneath the motherboard on the Asus boards on both them actually so that's fantastic and the only mismatch people the only mismatch is that GeForce GTX logo on the gtx 960 that is more like yellowish versus everything being like totally green I do have a knock to a fan for my exhaust which is brown but because of the hey looks Lux Digital RGB fan frame it lights up the blades and really kind of hides the brown frame which is a really good alternative that I didn't think would be a possibility to like camouflage the Browns fan inside there but it looks absolutely awesome and for cable management I literally spent no time I simply closed those behind doors onto which you can mount three SSDs onto each so that's awesome for extra storage if you are doing let's say an as for the ITX system and the only kind of weird thing that pops out is the riser cable because it's it's not totally flush against the frame unless you really pull at the bottom tabs but I don't feel comfortable doing that and so the only thing is they stick out more than the cables and there's something to keep in mind now I also reverted back to using an air cooler for the main ATX system just to see what type of opportunities would open up you know the knocked oru 12s there's a fantastic cooler and it's also pretty low profile so it does not interfere with anything above it and with this configuration you could remove those sliding covers beside the motherboard and insert hard drive cages so if you're using actually you know the ITX system for nass solutions to populate hard drives in there that is one option and that would also clear up any heat generated by the old one cooler at the front and therefore you'd have nice fresh intake instead of it being slightly warmed up and if you're not using a GPU for the top ITX system it will clear up some of that space for the main motherboard area may be going sli so that things don't get really cooked in that section and this whole experience of building this dual system configuration three times now has been kind of eye-opening because I realized that it's not for me and I would never use the second ITX system for like majority of recommendations that you guys had suggested in the previous video I do have a NAS in a separate room but I realized the potential of building everything in one to potentially offset some of the cost and everything being your own I don't game while I'm rendering so that does one the most popular recommendations I'm doing other things and I'm not like thinking about oh let me jump into you know a pub G match while my videos rendering which only takes ten minutes anyway I don't stream but I realized the potential of offloading some of that processing to the second ITX system instead of your main ATX but also you know the system hardware here is pretty powerful so I don't think it would be too much of a bottleneck and the main thing I can actually see myself using that second system for is building a hackintosh so they can have like nice Mac OS experience and you know standard PC and editing all that stuff or maybe banking and security purposes just doing all my really critical and for you know important things in the ITX system and nothing else there and then having everything else offloaded to the ATX system but that is kind of it maybe I'm not going outside of my comfort zone and really trying to figure out how to utilize that second ITX system but I just realized it is not for me but I'd love to hear you know your thoughts and if you have any dual system experience in one enclosure what is the purpose of each system so let me know and potentially help others to come up with ideas on why or why not they should go with something like this improve your workflow it's stream deck mini by Elgato giving you six fully customizable LCD keys for macro commands hotkeys app launches media control and a full array customization for OBS Twitch xsplit and more check out the stream deck mini down below all right guys I'm Dimitri thanks for watching we'll see you next video I'm very proud of the color configuration",

    "description": "The ZTE Axon M is a specimen not seen in the world of the smartphone in some time: it's a clamshell. No, not a flip-top communicator of the Starfleet variety, but a side-flipping design previously reserved for fancy wallets. Some, like MrMobile's esteemed thumbnail designer, might go so far as to call the ZTE Axon M a \"folding phone.\" But MrMobile himself would never be so bold.  For real though: in a sea of single-sided slabs, the Axon M is a legitimately interesting design. Featuring two 5.2\" displays bonded by a solid-feeling hinge and a thick aluminum midplate, the Axon M has the kind of heft that makes you take a smartphone seriously ... and the double-wide screen real estate that'll get you noticed even in Best Buy's big-TV section. Tune in for MrMobile's first look, and stay tuned to the channel for the Axon M Review coming soon!   [SUBSCRIBE]     [ABOUT THE ZTE AXON M HANDS-ON]  MrMobile's ZTE Axon M hands-on was produced following an hour with a ZTE Axon M review device on loan from ZTE. The device was a preproduction smartphone running prerelease software.   Additionally, the briefing venue had poor lighting which resulted in the inconsistent white balance in this video; the greenish blue hue you see on the display is a symptom of this problem and does not appear in person.

    "transcript": "- [Narrator] It's tough to find a surprise in smart phone design these days, but ZTE has risen to the challenge with an Android that goes from candy bar to hand held flat screen in about two seconds. The Axon M is the first folding smart phone to hit the scene in a long time, and this is a Mr. Mobile first look. (upbeat music) I only got to spend about an hour with the Axon M, and it was a pre-release version with pre-production software, so don't take this as anything close to a full review. But I'm glad I got the time with it I did, because I loved checking out this funky folding form factor. It's actually pretty simply. When the phone is closed, it looks like a thicker than usual monoblock smart phone with Gorilla Glass 5 on front and back separated by an aluminum mid plate with a volume rocker, an application button, and a combination power key and fingerprint scanner. When that 5.2 inch display starts to feel a little confining, you just pull on the backplate, which rotates on the side hinge until a second 5.2 inch screen clicks into place alongside the main one. The result? A more expansive Android canvas than you'd otherwise be able to fit in a pocket. This isn't the first time we've seen a device like this. The Kyocera Echo from 2011 used a similar design with a more complicated pinch. Sadly though, the Axon M suffers the same principle shortcomings as that older phone. Because its screens aren't perfectly bisel-less an ugly stripe bisects the display area when the screens are joined. But ZTE compensates for this with software that lets you leverage the screens differently, depending on what you're trying to do. You can use them as a single, integrated canvas, you can mirror the displays side by side, or you can run two apps independently, one on each screen. While that multi-tasking mode is a neat trick, I actually like the mirror mode better. Fold the phone into a tent, and you can share the same screen back and front, which could be helpful for showing off videos over dinner, say. Having screens on both sides also lets ZTE pull off another neat trick. There's just a single camera here, which you use for both standard photos and selfies. The camera specs are a mixed bag. The f/1.8 aperture is pretty big, but the IMX 350 sensor uses pixels that are pretty small, and while there is EIS onboard, there's no optical stabilization. So again, the whole thing is a big we'll see. ZTE didn't have exact pricing or availability in phone by the time this video hit the server. I'll throw 'em in the comments below once I get them, but the company did tell me that it's definitely not positioning this as a budget phone. That's concerning, because it's not exactly shipping with the brightest spec sheet I've ever seen. Processor is from last year, the Android Nougat version is old too, and most frustrating of all, this model will be exclusive to AT&T in the United States. That's good for Big Blue, who gets to pitch this phone as a portable screen for Direct TV. Not really good for anyone else. Now, for what it's worth, the ZTE heavily inferred that should this phone do well, others like it will follow on other networks. And helping to make up for the disappointments on the fundamentals, the Axon M features a dual speaker design that splits output between a single bottom port and the earpiece speaker. It's got a headphone jack with the same audio chips that is in the Axon 7 Mini, and it's packing a pretty big battery, given how much space the company didn't really have to work with. Finally, ZTE also promises that the Android Oreo update for this phone is already in the works. I love it when a company throws convention to the wind, even if the result is a variation on a theme we've seen before. And the hardware here feels very well made, with tight hinge action, satisfying locking clicks and enough mass to avoid feeling cheap. But given the older internals, the carrier exclusivity, and the expected mid- to high price point, I'm not confident the Axon M will find its way into many pockets this holiday season. Stay tuned for the full Mr. Mobile review for my final verdict. Make sure you don't miss that by subscribing to The Mr. Mobile on YouTube, and if you wanna see test photos from this phone when it does launch, be sure to follow me on Instagram at the same handle. Until next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends.",

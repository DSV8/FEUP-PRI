    "transcript": "- Hello, welcome to This Is. Matt, why does the Pokemon company consistently make terrible decisions? And why do we keep making videos about them? - [Matt] They announced Pokemon Home a while back, the same time they announced Sword and Shield. - [Austin] Right. - [Matt] And so, that was gonna be the upgrade or the next generation of Pokemon Bank. However, now we have the details for it. And it's terrible, it's completely, it's, completely defeats the purpose of itself. - If you are a super hardcore Pokemon fan, you are likely have played many, many, many Pokemon games. And because you've pretty much been able to transfer Pokemon from every generation. So starting from generation three all Pokemon, you can go transfer up through the games. But it used to be a really annoying process. You had to go from like, the Game Boy to the Game Cube to the DS. To this, it was like. It used to be this huge hassle. However, with Pokemon Bank on the 3DS, you could then just upload them to the cloud. It was only like $5 a year? - $5 a year, well 4.99 if we're getting technical about it. I mean, so you could have 3,000 Pokemon. So, every time you had a new generation or a new game you could just transfer over your squad, and keep going, and going, and going and going. And it was a really good system, and for five bucks, a year. I mean that's a really solid way to, you know, have this generational gap between Pokemon. - Considering, but some of the Pokemon you could've had could be 15 years old and you could have them transferred through pretty much every game, very cool idea. - You're 100 IV shiny mewtwo, like that could go with you-- - 31 IV. (sharp ringing) - Now, we have Pokemon home, which is exclusively for the Switch game. So, Sword and Shield, Let's Go EV, Let's Go Pikachu. And eventually, it's gonna be Pokemon Go. - So essentially, Pokemon Bank, you can transfer your Pokemon from Pokemon Bank into Pokemon Home. Then you can transfer from Let's Go, you could transfer from Sword and Shield, and you could transfer again, like you said at some point from Pokemon Go all into this one service. However, once you get your Pokemon then, not only do you have to pay a lot more, but sometimes the Pokemon can't come out, right. Its pretty much a one way process. - Because of the limitations to the Let's Go EV, Let's Go Pikachu, and then the Sword and Shield Dex, there's a lot of Pokemon there just gonna be in limbo at that point. And you, so like you'd be transferring them over, with the hope that you could transfer them later. Which if you look at our video on the controversy from that, where there just cut out hundreds of Pokemon, all those hundreds of Pokemon that got cut, can not be transferred to Sword and Shield. - So you can have them in Pokemon Home, but you can't do anything with them because it's a one-way process end. - Yes. - So the problem here, is that say I have a Pokemon from third gen, 2003 Pokemon Ruby. I've transferred it to all of my games, its in the Pokemon Bank, I've transferred from Pokemon Bank to Pokemon Home, but if it's not in the GalarDex, then I can't take it out. So its pretty much, I'm paying to have the Pokemon sit there in the cloud, but until there's a game or an expansion pack for Sword and Shield, I can not bring that Pokemon out of Pokemon Home whatsoever. - Yeah, and it's so, you bring up the DLC for Sword and Shield. Which is BS to begin with because Nintendo was adamant that there was A, not gonna be DLC for Sword and Shield and that there was also not gonna be adding in all these other Pokemon. Both of which turned out to be not true. But with this now, to get the full Pokemon experience, we're up to $135, for one, to get the full Pokemon experience. - And walk me through that. - So you got $60 for the game. - Got it. - I mean to be fair, you could probably get it used, whatever. But - For $57. - Yeah, 55, 60, whatever. 60 bucks for the game. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] $30 for the DLC. - [Austin] Okay, yeah. - [Matt] $15 for Home. - [Austin] Per year. - [Matt] Per year. Right. Lets face it, you're using Pokemon Home, it's because you're a competitive player. So with Sword and Shield as well, you need online for the max raids, - [Austin] You're pretty much paying that $20. - [Matt] Right, and again if you're a competitive player, you probably don't want to give up your 3DS team. So you still need to pay the $5 a year for Pokemon Bank. - Oh right, 'cause Pokemon Bank's not going anywhere. - They're completely incompatible. Pokemon Bank is not leaving. - But you can transfer out of Pokemon Bank but nothing can ever go back in it. But if you still wanna play any of the 3DS games like X and Y, it was Ultra Sun and Moon and, (overlapping speech) - [Matt] You could even do gen one, if its the 3DS downloaded emulated game. Anything that was on the 3DS store. - [Austin] Can I try to explain this in one concise sentence because I'm really confused right now. - Yes. - With Pokemon Bank the previous generations cloud service, I can take Pokemon from pretty much every Pokemon game, since the dawn of time. So the first and second chain games on 3DS, as well as all the games ranging back from Ruby and Sapphire on Game Boy advanced. All the way through if I want to spend the time to transfer them from game to game to game to get them to a 3DS game. And then upload them to Pokemon Bank. Now if I want to do anything more than that, I can still continue to do that, and it's $5 a year. - Yes. - But if I want to get them on my Switch game, specifically Sword and Shield, I will then need to pay $15 a year. $16 a year? - $16 a year, - To get Pokemon Home, but the problem is as soon as I transfer all my old Pokemon in there, the only way to get them out of that, - [Matt] They're stuck on home. - [Austin] They're stuck on home until Sword and Shield support those specific Pokemon. But the flip side is, I can also, inside Pokemon Home, dump Pokemon from Pokemon Let's Go and I can dump Pokemon from Pokemon Go and Sword and Shield all into one place. But I can only bring them out onto Sword and Shield because those games support not all Pokemon, but most Pokemon. - Yeah. Its dumb, and it totally defeats the purpose of having this service. So with the free version, you can only transfer from the Switch games and Pokemon Go whenever that happens. - [Austin] Yes. - [Matt] You can not transfer from, you can't even transfer from Bank. - [Austin] Right. - [Matt] With the free version. And you can only have 30 slots available of your, of your cash of Pokemon. Now that's fine if your trying to just transfer a handful of Pokemon. - Kind of. Not very useful. - No it's not super useful, and definitely again, who this is for which is most likely for the competitive players. 30 is just not gonna be enough. So one of the actual cool features of Pokemon Home, is that their gonna have the judge appraisal system from Pokemon Go. But you don't get that with the free basic thing. So to basically to make any use of Pokemon Home, you have to go to premium. So to use it, $3 a month, $5 for three months or $16 for the year. Its not expensive but its definitely, it ends up being. - You sure about that, that's pretty expensive. - For 20 bucks for, I mean 16 bucks for the year. - Your storing like a megabyte of data in the cloud. - This is true. - Its like, - This is incredibly expensive. - It's kind of the other features you get with it that justified the price. And them I'm using justified super loosely. But it ends up being, four times the cost of essentially the same service with Bank. - It almost makes sense, to not take advantage of this until the third generation game can actually support all of your older dudes. So essentially what's happening right now, is Pokemon, it's a new era, right. So now that we have these Sword and Shield games, on the Switch, instead of doing that third generation of like, you know this blue, red, and yellow or Ultra Sun and Moon and additions. Instead they're doing with the expansion packs. I totally agree with that, I think that is the smart way of doing it, maybe they didn't necessarily pitch it in the correct way, but its the smart, modern way of doing it. However, this seems like it's a step too far, and it's really quickly gon from $40 to play a Pokemon game and you buy a new one every little while, to, what was that, over $100 to buy-- - [Matt] 130! - [Austin] Games, all the different yearly passes, extensions, its kind of gotten to be a little bit ridiculous but I think the biggest issue here, is they're charging you $16 a year, to bring Pokemon forward that you've had potentially for decades, over a decade. And then you can't do anything with them. - And there's really been no other way to actually have that collection than Pokemon Bank and then now they're saying \"Well, now that's completely incompatible with this new generation\". I wanna be fair here, there are some legitimately useful features that Home is introducing. So you can actually trade, right and directly in the mobile app. - [Austin] Okay, that's cool. - [Matt] You can do things like open mystery gifts from certain shields right through the app. You don't have to actually boot up the Switch everyday. - So you can do everything from you phone essentially. - Not everything, but a lot of things. - Okay. - But then you can also do, like, wonder trades, but-- - The other side benefit here is, obviously its not out yet but you can in theory, trade Pokemon from Pokemon Go, all the way in here. - Right. Which would be really cool. - Pokemon Go is currently what has the largest collection. It's the most complete collection, out of any of the games right now, so. - It'd be cool to bring them into an actual, mainline Pokemon game. - Yeah. - Not tap fest 3000. So it's $16 a year, Pokemon Home will be out in February. And while there are some good things here, it seems way over complicated. I don't understand why couldn't just extend bank, into the next generation. - Because they wouldn't make money that way. - Are they not making enough money already? - No. - Have I not bought 100 Pokemon games over my life span already? The answer is yes, Matt. - You know what I'm gonna do right now? Go check out Pokemon sleep.",

    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to \"This Is\". Today we have to talk about something which is very important. For the fifth time in as many months, we are wrong about a piece of technology, I know, it's hard to believe that you're your buddies, Austin and Matt got it wrong. However, today we had to talk about the Samsung Galaxy S21, specifically why it does not in fact suck. - Samsung, based on all these leaks that we had, was potentially ruining the S21. And I'm happy to say that we were wrong. - So, a lot of what we said in the video is very true. When you look at what you got with the Samsung Galaxy S21 in some ways it is a bit of a downgrade, right? So things like the display, right? So we spent a lot of time talking about how they had lowered the resolution of the normal display, which was something that they had had for like five years or something. - [Matt] Since like the S6. - [Austin] The downside there is that, while yes, this is gonna make the screen slightly less sharp, thankfully they are not just removing that and removing the charger and removing the micro SD card slot-- - I mean, don't get me wrong, they are. - They are doing that. - They are doing all of that. - But the main thing that we talked about in that video was that the rumors were showing that the phone would be more expensive, right? So you were gonna be paying the same if not slightly more. That is no longer the case as the Galaxy S21 starts at $800, a full $200 less than the Galaxy S20 that it is replacing and very much on par with something like the iPhone 12, which I think is very quickly becoming kind of like the sweet spot of the smartphone industry. - So we ranted about these but we straight up said, a lot of our argument becomes invalid if the price is cheaper and it is, and that's why I'm glad-- - Wait, wait, wait, pause for a second, can you play that clip back where we said that we were gonna be-- (beep) - I'll be honest, I'm fine if it was a downgrade if they go ahead and downgrade the price. (beep) - Now, see, there we go, see, we were right in a way and we get another click bait title out of it, so it's a win-win. So the Galaxy S21 and the 21 Plus and the 21 Ultra are now official. And while we have not gotten our hands on them, thanks, censored word that I can't say on YouTube before we get demonetized. But we have now seen all the specs and we will be getting our hands on a Samsung Galaxy S21 soon, so make sure to stay subscribed. The things we know now are actually mostly positive, right? So first of all the design language. I think the S21 looks good in so much as a flagship that is not a foldy boy can lock in 2021. - And me who's not a foldy boy, I like it better than the S20. I still would love it, I don't love the notches at, not notches but the camera bumps that Samsung does-- - I disagree. - I like it better than the S20. - See here's the thing, most, all smartphones at this point have just a camera bump, right? And while yes, you can look like the iPhone and like various different devices that they try to like style a little bit, but it's just like, oh, bump. But this is actually really the main part of the design. They're not relying on a bunch of flashy colors. It's just, it's a nicely integrated chunk of the phone. - And it's funny you say that because the only thing I like about it is like the two-tone... - That is very... - That is like literally the only thing I'm like, you know what? I like that. - Yes. - But I know Ken likes that. - It's good, I totally agree. So there are other things that are new here, right? So we'll just go down the spec list. It's got the new Snapdragon 888, better processor, impressively this is actually coming out sooner than pretty much any other phones. So like typically, this way that works for Samsung is that they will bring out the Galaxy S21 or the S line before everyone else right. So if you want to get like the latest and greatest processor, they bring that out first. And alternatively, it also means that you're gonna have your phone be not obsolete sooner, right? - Yeah, full year of - Exactly. Of being in date? - In date. Yeah. No, I think it's a good thing, right? So you buy the S21, it's got 5G it's got everything you need, it's not gonna be out of date anytime soon. There are some other things which I do think are worth talking about. So the screen, so it is a high refresher display which means that it's smoother, more responsive. It looks better, et cetera, et cetera. Now, the Galaxy S20 had that but it didn't actually work the way that you wanted it to, it locked it to the resolution and you didn't or locked it to the frame rate and you couldn't adjust it. So you either had to have high resolution or high frame rate. You couldn't have them both at the same time. This has been relieved because with this display it will go from 48 to 120 Hertz. Essentially, just like something like promotion on the iPad pro it means that you get that smooth, responsive experience when you want it when you're scrolling. - But-- - But you get the battery life when you're not because it will slow that screen down and keep it from having to work so hard. When you're staring at your doom, scrolling Twitter feed except it actually only works when you stop scrolling but you get one right now. The good thing here is that the S21 line is I would say two thirds good. So you have the base S21, which is a 6.2 or something. It's like a fairly reasonable size flagship, personally the phone thing I would like to rock, you have the larger 6.7 inch S21 Plus, which is a bad idea. Don't buy that one. And then you have the S21 Ultra. Then you might wonder why should you not buy the S21 Plus. Price, so here's the thing, the S21 and the Plus they are essentially the same phone, right? So you have a slightly larger display on the Plus. You have a little bit more battery and you have the ability to use your phone as a car key. If you own a brand new BMW, if you do congratulations on your opulence. If not the two phones are nearly identical and the kicker is the S21 Plus costs $200 more. You heard that right. $200 more, and you get the same storage, everything. There's no advantage in going to that phone besides the slightly larger display, essentially. - And again, my tune is completely changed since the last video, just because we're the price point starts. - Yeah. - I'm gonna say kudos to Samsung for the same reason. I said, kudos to Apple. They have a phone now at like every price point. - Yeah. - For whatever you want. So like, one of the things we had talked about I personally don't care about high resolution high refresh rates. - Sure. - I'm fine with a 1080 60 screen. So I'm willing to buy the cheaper, smaller phones because that's one saving money, but it fits better in my hand, it's like, there's-- - A lot of small phone gangs. - Yeah. There's a lot of good things for it. But if you want to have all the full specs and everything like that, you have an option. I agree with you that you shouldn't get the S21 Plus. - But what you should consider, is the S21 Ultra. So this has also seen the price cuts. So essentially the lineup here is S21 is $800, S21 Plus is a thousand and S21 Ultra is $1,200. All of which are roughly $200 less than their counterparts last year. With the Ultra, now you're getting a 1440 piece. So the full resolution display you also get up to 120 Hertz, and it is a more a wider dynamic range on that. So we'll go down to, I think it's like 10 frames per second. It will go way, way down. So it should help with battery life. It's also the most advanced panel that you've ever had. Brightness, et cetera, et cetera. Very nice display on the Ultra but around back is where it really shine because you now have one, two, three, 4.5 cameras I think would be the way I would describe it. You have a time of flight sensor. So four actual cameras - [Matt] Four actual cameras, all of them capable of 4k 60. - Yes. - Including the selfie one. - [Austin] So that's actually, that's five cameras. - Yeah. And then the back, the rear ones can do AK. - You can do AK, okay so here's the deal, right? So the S21 Ultra has the same ultra wide, I believe as all the S21's. And to be fair, don't forget that the S21 line the non Ultra, and this is getting confusing. All of the S21's have at least three cameras ultra wide, wide, and telephoto, right. Which is something that, as we'll talk about later something like the iPhone 12, can't really say doesn't have the ultra wide or the telephoto version. But, what the ultra has is a much larger and supposedly higher. Well, we know it's high resolution. We'll see if the actual quality line's up but a 108 megapixel main camera, right? Much larger sensor, much bigger glass, which is nice. - Interesting because the reports we had gotten, all have said that it was a smaller sensor. So-- - It's hard, yeah. To be fair we're recording video, we don't actually have the exact spec list on the sensor sizes, but I would be very shocked if it is not pretty much the same as last year. Apparently it's like an upgraded version of that 'cause I know that the Ultra last year had some issues with like, auto focus but regardless, very nice supposedly main camera. Then you have two telephotos. So as opposed to last year where you had the 100 times speed zoom, which is a four times zoom and a lots and lots and lots of cropping. Instead this time you have two options, you have a three times a telephoto, which is a nice usable range for a lot of things. And then you have a proper 10 times zoom. And then you can, of course use the space zoom to go and zoom in beyond that. This should essentially mean that you are able to use the telephoto camera for, portraits of people and stuff. But if you really want to zoom all the way in, this space zoom should be much, much better. So there are legitimate reasons to go for the S21 Ultra and while $1,200 is certainly expensive. And this Ultra premium flagship range, first of all it's cheaper than it was last year. - It wasn't that long ago they were doing videos on like, how the hell do we have a thousand dollars smartphone flagships? Well, they've taken both companies who really dictate the prices of the market have taken huge steps to go away from those thousand dollars mark. - We've seen huge changes right? So think about this, right? So like you said, when the iPhone tempers came out, thousand dollars, what are you talking about? That's crazy. Then we see everyone's shooting up to, you know, 11, 12, 13 $1,400, - $1,400. - But the over the last six months we've seen a correction. So the pixel five was not even an Ultra premium device right? $700, not full flagship specs. We also saw things like Apple keeping lowering the prices of a lot of their phones, the same, but even lowering them a little bit. You now have the iPhone 12 mini, you have the iPhone 11 was a little bit cheaper than the one before it. And now we have Samsung cutting the prices of all their major flagships. Part of that I think at least on Samsung side is that they're trying to sell you Z flips and Z folds, which is obviously the best phone of all time. (clears throat) But the other side of that is that I think people are certainly just getting kind of tired of like, look I'm not gonna spend $1,200 on this new phone unless it does something crazy when you could buy a $500 phone, a $600 phone that will do basically everything 95% as well right? There's certainly a major difference there. - So then how do you like with them in similar price points? How do you compare S21 to the iPhone 12 line up? - I think it actually compares pretty favorably. So if you look at the iPhone 12, the standard model not the mini compared to the S21, they're essentially the same price, give or take 30 bucks. If you use apples with a light traded or not traded and they're like carrier aggregation, - Carrier credit. - Basically the same price. What you're looking at is the S21 has a, maybe a quite as high red screen, it's fairly close but you do have that high refresh rate, which is a in my opinion, a nice feature, especially if you don't have to actually fiddle with all the settings if it just works, it's smooth when you want it. And it's power efficient when you don't - I'm gonna step in there for one second, because there was something that we had mentioned in our last video, that end up getting cut out. And it was me saying that most people do not change the settings in their Samsung phones. And everyone's, you're like, \"Everyone's gonna come and yell at you.\" You know what the number one comment was on our last video? I've never changed the setting on my Samsung phone, meaning that most people had it running a 1080 even though the 1440 screen, they had it running at 1080 - [Austin] To be clear, at this point, we don't know for sure if this is all by default but I would very strongly suspect that it is - [Matt] They've been doing it for years. I don't see why they would change it now. - With the S21, you get three cameras on the back instead of two, you get the Ultra wide and the wide which we'll see the hardware isn't really necessarily better on the S21, but they have better processing. Generally speaking, the S20 had a great camera. So I would say that it's going to be in the ballpark maybe not quite as good, but in the ballpark. And you do have a three X, 12 photo on the S21 which is a major point, right? On the iPhone you have to bump up to the pro or the pro max to get a telephoto which is significantly more expensive. You got 5G, which is the same across the board. You've got design, which I would say the S21 in many ways looks just as good as the iPhone. I mean, obviously that's a matter of personal preference. You have wireless charging and reverse wireless charging on the S21. You don't have Mac safe, I suppose neither have a headphone jack, neither have micro SD, but I would say that they're pretty similar but the S21 does have some real advantages, especially if it does get cut in price, like the S20 models, it usually do. - Especially when the note comes out is usually when-- - Well, here's the question, yeah. - We'll get to that in a second But usually the note comes out three, four or five months later and then the S line gets a pretty hefty discount. But what we don't know this year is if there's even gonna be a note. - Yes, because as we move on to the S20 Ultra, we're gonna get to the S21 Plus because it sucks. And the S21 Ultra is just better. At $1,200, you're getting a lot. So you not only get WiFi 6E, which is something that we haven't really talked about much, but essentially is a new spectrum, that's been opened up for WiFi. Essentially, this is an addition to WiFi six. So you will need new routers and phones and everything to use it. But it should give you much better performance because it's a brand new swath of spectrum, which has just opened up. The Ultra, does have that car key feature. It also does have support for the S pen. So this is something which people have been asking for for a long time. Now, to be fair, - Me specifically, - the Ultra does not have an S pen included in the box, and it does not have a place to store it, right? But, you can buy an S pen. And I believe you can use an S pen, some devices like-- - Any of the recent ones. - Yes. I don't actually have confirmation on exactly which S pens work, but at least some recent ones if you have like a tab, or if you have a note, you may be able to use the S pen from that on your ultra. This is a nice feature. This is a very nice thing. - I'm gonna rant about the note for a second. And I just think that this is the final nail in the coffin for the note lines. This is like the third year that we've talked about this. Like, why does the note exist in this year? Why does it know it exists this year? What made it special, became more and more blurred until ultimately it was just the S pen. If I'm gonna have to choose between losing battery life to have a pen inside the thing, I think I'm choosing the S21. So like what else could they put in a note to make it different this year? - I will look if you're in her diehard note user, props to you, I'm sure they'll keep making it for a bit but the thing is the S20 line has now pretty much entirely like cannibalized everything that the note does. Well, there are certainly some minor things here and there but generally speaking, it has everything the same and it comes out six to nine months beforehand right? So you're almost getting a half outdated phone when the note comes out - Which is, that was the case last year. - Yeah, but I'm very curious. What do you think about these Samsung galaxy S21 lineup and how wrong we are with our continuous clickbait titles but thank you very much for watching. Thank you very much for Ringling the ding-a-ling bell and being notified of all of our future mishaps and mistakes. And every once in a while we say something that's my liitle intelligent and until next time, thank you very much for watching. (upbeat music)",

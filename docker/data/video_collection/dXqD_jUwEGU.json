    "transcript": "- So you've been delving into this for a while. What's your advice to people who are all white hat? Is it worth them spending time going through that stuff or is it only just like a curiosity? - Oh, super good question. What is my advice for this though? I would advise anyone that is interested in this and wants to kind of see the action as it unfolds. This is one of those ways to do it, but you kind of have to have a strong stomach. You know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah. - You might stumble across some things that are really weird, maybe not the most heartening thing, a lot of ethically questionable stuff if you're just scrolling around in the Dark Web. So avoid that, the best, the best you can, but you can see a little bit more. I don't know if you wanna pull up any of those ransomware blog sites between REvil, or BlackMatter, or some of the others, we can certainly do that. - That'd be great, yeah, yeah, yeah, REvil will be good, or I need the ones that you recommend, yeah. - So I think one of the more purposeful means or reasons to be kind of exploring and lurking over here, and these onion sites is that you can get a little bit of visibility into what's happening for ransomware gangs or ransomware operators. And we know that there are a ton, and obviously between a lot of things happening in the news recently, colonial pipeline has become a talking point and stand point for so many things, JBS meat. We have the Steamship Authority, we had Kaseya, there were so, so many things between different gangs or different cybercrimes indicates. We've heard of BlackMatter, we've heard of DarkSide, we've heard of REvil, we've heard of Ragnar Locker, we've heard of Babuk, we've heard of Avaddon, we've heard of, the list goes on and on, and on. Oftentimes if you have a ransom note or if you are a victim of ransomware and you take a look at the instructions on how to recover your files, quote, unquote, they'll tell you, \"Go access this webpage in the Dark Web or with the .Onion site. And they will communicate with you like a weird support staff, on, \"Hey, here's how we could get back your files, pay us X million dollars in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.\" Alongside that, typically, the ransomware gangs have their own blog or a public presence where they will literally dump all of the data that they've stolen from that victim, if that individual, if that organization does not pay, thus holding your data for ransom. So you could see these, they're really there, you could download them, you can explore through them, you could see some of the crazy stuff, and there are a lot of different aspects to it. So I have pulled up the homepage of Ragnar Locker and their leaks, there leaks site here. Here's a Wall of Shame, a permanent list of companies who would like to keep in secret, the info leakage, exposing themselves and their customers, and partners, to even greater risk. I'll scroll down here, but a lot of this, I think we might be able to redact because they are real companies that would have data released. Some of these are announcements that are really, really interesting, some of them, with Ragnar Locker specifically, they've got a lot of chatter lately in the news where they're saying, \"Hey, if you're a ransomware victim, don't go ask the police to help you, don't go ask the FBI, don't try to ask for help from federal agencies because we don't want that, and we're just gonna make it worse for you. We will go ahead and publish all your data if you were to do that stuff.\" So kind of spooky. (John chuckling) \"Well, we will find out and we'll punish with all our efforts.\" (David laughing) Man. - I shouldn't laugh, I mean, it's really sad what goes on. - Yeah. Some of it's crazy, sometimes you just have to laugh because like, wow, this sounds so absurd. - [David] Yeah. - But we are a team of cybersecurity enthusiasts, crypto punks, entrepreneurs, and ultimately businessmen. (David laughing) We wanna make a profit. We can pull up REvil. - Yeah, got Revil, but REvil is quite popular, isn't it? Or I shouldn't say popular, it's been in the news a lot. - Yes, so REvil has what they call Happy Blog, and again, each of these blogs are victims. - So these are people that didn't pay the ransom, so they've published their data, is that right? - Yes, you could see a passport right open there. I'll click on this. All right, that's, sometimes you're like, \"I don't know, I don't wanna look at this anymore. This is just too insane,\" but here's legitimate documents. I have yet to make a YouTube video where I actually go through and do this because redacting and obscuring it is just gonna be awful. (John laughing) So I'm sorry. (John laughing) - Yeah, so the Happy Blog is this one that when we spoke about, when we did our malware analysis video, you mentioned this, so this is actually that blog where the stuff being published, yeah? Go on. - When we were chatting about Kaseya, I wonder if they have this displayed here still. Oh, here it is. When you and I did a video together discussing the Kaseya ransomware incident, Happy Blog and REvil had posted this update, and you don't have to redact this, this is, I think, very well known. They say, \"Hey, on Friday, just before the 4th of July holiday in the United States, we launched an attack on a bunch of managed service providers. More than a million systems were infected.\" I don't know if that's true or not. They might just pumping their chest. There might just trying to be all braggadocio, but say, \"Here's our asking price. If you give us $70 million in Bitcoin, we'll give you a public decryptor.\" Those that have been following the Kaseya incident know there's a little bit more to the story there. (John chuckling) There's been some chatter on the decryption key and how folks are recovering, et cetera, but that was certainly a hot topic, and you could literally find this post. You could see this on REvil's blog and that's what we're doing right now, 'cause there was legitimate devastation, I think, for the Kaseya attack, a lot of organizations thinking they're going out of business. - Yeah, BlackMatter, this is just another site where they're dumping stuff, yeah? - Yup, yup, BlackMatter is just another ransomware gang, and this, again, is a list of their victims. (John laughing) You can see all the flashy, \"Hey, we published this data, and if you want to go to the post, here's what you could download.\" Here's our 30 gigabytes of data or however much, I could literally click download here and it could start the file transfer. I have no reason to do that, I don't suggest others do, but I'm telling you it's real and you could do it. - Yes, I mean, the stories in the news, I mean, and that's the important piece about what you're showing here. This stuff is out there and you're gonna show us how easy it is to find this because we've discussed malware in the past, we've seen the Happy Blog now, we've seen these other websites that are on the sort of Dark Web, it's actually really sad what happens. I mean, we, on the good side, don't want this to happen, but it must be soul destroying for you really, because you encounter this all the time with the malware stuff, yeah? - Yes, it's funny when I'm asked to kind of have these conversations and do talks and presentations, especially now being a Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I tell folks, \"Hey, if you're into cybersecurity, awesome, that's incredible, it's a ton of fun, you're gonna love it, but, man, is it hard work?\" Lots of late nights, lots of sleepless nights, lots of work in the weekends, trying to respond to incidents where some ransomware actors have just blown up at an organization and now leaked all the data online, this being a prime example of that. It's something you really have to know the adversary, and I think maybe this is a good way to do it. - Yeah, I mean, we always hammer on this, but you've seen the stuff on the Dark Web, this is the real thing, but you advocate always CTS to that's how the good guys make sure that they know what they're doing and how they protect organizations, yeah? - I think that's what absolutely captured the flag in training, and learning about this all in different ways is the best thing that you can do to sharpen your own sword and make sure that you're in this fight and in the trenches here, because the more that you expose yourself to, the more that you learn, the more that you understand, the better armed you are for when incidents occur. (upbeat music) - Hi, everyone, David Bumble, back with John. John you've shed quite a few things in the past, you've spoken about CTS, you've spoken about malware, but we wanted to change it today, so what are you talking about today? - Yeah, thanks, David, today I thought, well, we've kind of run the gamut of things that I could bring to the table or showcase with you. - That's not true, man, you've got a wealth of knowledge, but you're too humble, but go on. - No, I think one thing that we could kind of bring to light is this whole notion of the Dark Web, - Yup. - Or Tor and these Onion Tor hidden services. I think there's a lot of chatter on that, and I know it makes for kind of like spicy, sometimes click baity content, but I hope to bring out the real tangible, actual content and worthwhile information there because as spooky as it sounds, it's kind of creepy as, oh, the Dark Web, I think there is a lot of really worthwhile education and learning value when we're looking at cybersecurity, real cybercrime, real ransomware gangs, and hacker forums. Some of that stuff is real, some of it's not, and it'd be cool if we could kind of take a peak. - Yeah, I mean, that's great, I mean, I'll preface it with us. You've done a whole series on this. - All right, and welcome back to another YouTube video. (John laughing) I'm just kidding, the thing is so stupid. (John laughing) Hi, hello, how's it going, everybody? Welcome to another YouTube video. I'm excited about this one, I think this one should be a little bit of fun. I wanna get started with a new video series. - But I want to pitch this from, let's assume we're just starting. So can you explain, what is Tor, what is the Dark Web, and just give us like the foundation and show us practically. - Yeah, absolutely. Maybe I might get this definition wrong, and I'll add that disclaimer. Tor and the Onion router or the Onion kind of network that we're working through, in this whole idea, is really changing the way that you access the internet. Normally, your traffic is routed through your internet service provider and then it'll have your IP address kind of be communicated and known to the remote server or whatever other computer that you're talking to. The whole idea behind Tor or this Onion router, is to kind of layer or take different steps as to how you get out to the internet. They move all your packets, all your traffic, move across through different relays, and those could be different locations or different ends of the world that bounce your traffic around until eventually it traverses through the exit node or the exit relay, and that is the final landing point that we'll have end up touching the remote server and that IP will be displayed, but your own IP address will be kind of hidden or masked, or tucked away, and not as readily accessible or well-known to that final end point, your destination. - You mean, so you would download the Tor Browser, which is just free software that, if I remember, originally, one of the U.S. three-letter security agencies created the Tor Browser, and it hides you on the internet, doesn't it? But what you're talking about here with the Dark Web is taking it a step further, is that right? - Yeah, so when you are on, or when you're using this Tor network, you have access to a couple different top level domains or TLDs, 'cause we're so used to seeing a google.com or a facebook.com, or whatever, .org .net, et cetera, all those different domain names, when you're working through a Tor, and I guess even in some other cases, you could see a .Onion domain. And oftentimes those are called Tor hidden services because it will try to mask, okay, where that's being hosted from and how it's being served. A lot of really interesting conversations and shatter, and services can go on on those Tor hidden services or .Onion websites. A lot of privacy information. If folks are in that realm, they just wanna be secure, they wanna be anonymous all online. Oftentimes, you'll be in that .Onion realm. - Yeah, I mean, sorry, the famous one that I remember from a few years ago was Silk Road. - Yeah. - Was he Canadian or American? I can't remember, Chap, who he was selling all kinds of, how should we put it? Not so legal substances and stuff. - Right, exactly. - And he had, it was like an eBay type site, isn't it? That was selling all kinds of nonsense, and that was on the Dark Web. So what's the difference between the Dark Web and say, like a standard google.com website? - Yeah, so there are different distinctions between the Dark Web and the Deep Web. - Yeah. - And I guess what folks sometimes hear as Clearnet or how you traditionally think of the internet, you get into facebook.com, you get into your bank, your website, whatever. And I think that is one of the most defining differences. Hey, if you're looking at .Onion links, you may very well be on how you could classify the Dark Web or the Deep Web. I think that that term, that name, the Dark Web is so silly. (John laughing) It has a little bit more of like, sure, some spooky mystique to it, but I tend to refer to it as like kind of the corners and the crevices of the internet, because it is still the internet, it's just kind of accessed in a different way. - I mean, perhaps it'll be easier if you just show us practically. - Sure. - How do I get access to this? Like, let's say, I'm curious, and I wanna try this at home? Or I shouldn't try this at home. Is that the warning? But let's say I wanted... - Yeah. - Go on. (John laughing) - I always offer the cheesy disclaimer that I know doesn't hold a lot of water, but hey, when we're talking about this stuff, it is totally for education sake. - Yeah. - It's to shine the spotlight on this stuff and look, hey, it's real, this thing really does exist, but by no means, should you want to go out on the Dark Web or buy whatever illicit things or hire a hacker, and some of the crazy shenanigans that aren't always legal. Absolutely not a proponent of that. - Yup. - Absolutely not what we're doing here, so I got to lay that out first. (John laughing) - Yeah, but it's important to know that it exists. I mean, it's- - Totally. - We've said this 1000 times, if you don't know about it, how can you protect companies against it? You need to be aware of this stuff. So, John, I don't know if you wanna talk more about the theory or do you just wanna jump into a demo and show us how to access this stuff? - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'd be happy to show you a little bit of a demo, I don't know how much we could do, but I will go ahead and share my screen if that's totally all right. - Yeah. - So I am currently in a virtual machine for Tails Linux. Tails Linux is one of those very, very privacy oriented and security built with security in mind to be able to use a computer and on a habit, really be amnesia. I think that might be the right way to define it, but it has amnesia, in the sense, okay, we, if you were to turn off this computer, none of the changes that you made while you were using it will retain. Tails is typically meant to be used as a Linux distribution and operating system that should be booted from a live USB or a live CD. - Yeah. - It's not really intended to be a virtual machine, and I've gotten a little bit of flack for that. (both laughing) Because, hey, there are plenty of other options, you could be using Qubes OS or HuneX, or some other different variations. I'm still just kind of dipping my toes in the water, so right now I've just been playing with Tails, and getting to learn and know this a little bit better. - So you're running this into VML, yeah? - I am currently, yes. - And isn't this the one that's Snowden uses, is that right? - I think on the homepage, it does actually have some nice testimonial from hammer or somethings, if I scroll down here. Here's a good, recommended by, and there's our man, yeah. - Yeah. (John laughing) So, I mean, this is just adding layers to protect you, so you don't wanna try those kinds of stuff on your live main work desk, or how do you say? Your main computer? - Yeah, I've seen some web browsers like Brave. I think Brave will actually go ahead and properly route, and Onion or .Onion website, and domain for you, but typically, again, I just try to like to keep these things as distinctly separate as possible in the same way that, oh, we used a virtual machine to explore malware, or if we used a virtual machine to test windows domains, et cetera, et cetera. Whenever you possibly can, I think it's great to compartmentalize out to a virtual machine. - And does Tails come with Tor pre-installed, is that right? - Yes, In fact, you can see that we are using the Tor Browser right here. I have a little icon over in the top right where you could kind of figure out, hey, what are all the relays that you're actually bouncing through, when you look through different kinds of circuits that will be displayed as over here? And you could get a little bit more Intel and information on those, if you'd like. - But I'll just say this, you don't have to use Tor on Tails. You could just run Tor. - Correct. - On windows or Linux, or something else, but I like your idea of separating your stuff so that it's not all together. - Yeah. - And yeah, I use Brave, and Brave definitely has tools built in, it's is great browser, yep. Sorry, go on. - No, I think that gets to the gist of it. Tails and Tor is one great way that we could kind of start to explore what might be out there on the Dark Web, and again, putting that Dark Web in air quotes. (John chuckling) One thing that I think is a worthwhile learning point for folks is that there is like an equivalent of Google or Bing, or Yahoo or DuckDuckGo, or whatever search engine you might fancy, there is an equivalent in this .Onion hidden services realm. Very interesting, because then it might allow you to search for other .Onion or Tor hidden services websites, kind of neat, because I think it poses the question hey, if these things are meant to be hidden, how do you find them? - Yeah. - How do you track them down? - I wanna ask the dumb questions. - Yeah. - Or the novice questions, if you prefer. So you started Tor, how did you get to this page? Does it start immediately when you boot it up, or how do you get to this page? - So if I were to move over to the applications within Tail, sorry, you can see one of the suggested ones is the Tor Browser. That'll automatically pop up, bringing you right to the Tail's homepage. That will be the default, but if you wanted to create a new tab and go to a different location, you totally could, but you would need to know the address for that specific Onion site or the Tor hidden service that you wanted to go to. Now, that's not going to be a google.com or facebook.com, but it looks like a very, very long and obscure kind of esoteric, big, long link of random letters and different things. I actually tend to keep a list of, hey, what other links, what other Tor hidden services could I reach out to an access? Because without knowing what they are, you won't know what they are. (John chuckling) - It's, I mean, you went to that like sort of search engine website. Is that like just one of these crazy links that you have to find somewhere? - Yes, here, I'll see if I can bring this over super quick. So I tend to try and keep a dump of potential Onion links that you might be able to access. Really, again, these are things that you would kind of have to find and keep track of on your own. If you were just getting started and trying to explore this, you could categorize whatever you're interested in learning about, or seeing or tracking down. This is just a big, long pile that I tend to use for my own series or videos, but it's interesting where folks might suggest like, \"Oh, John, I remember you were looking for different search engines, or you could try to use maybe some in this link.\" And here's the one called Excavator, but as you can see, this is some long, basically nonsense domain, kind of very hard to memorize or remember, like a facebook.com or a google.com. So once you have that noted, we could go try and access that specific page through Tor. - I just wanna ask you, so on your series on your YouTube channel, and again, I always recommend that everyone go and have a look at John's channel. You go through this in a bit more detail, is that right? You've got all the links listed, is that right? So if someone's off to- - A bit, yes. - A bit, yeah? Okay. - First we start out in the Clearnet, we start out with our own basic Google searches, and then we try to see, hey, what have other people known as decent search engines in Tor or things to look for other .Onion websites, and then we start to build our own list, and then we start to explore different websites through those search engines. So a lot of those are worthwhile to do but you really have to build out your own repertoire of things. - Okay, so we've found a search engine link, and from here we can try and find websites, yeah? - Yeah, yeah, and there are a ton of these, I will say, I am a usual fan of Ahmia, which was kind of that first one that we saw us on. There are others between Excavator that we just saw. I am unsure if these will all end up being safe for work, right? - Yeah. - Sometimes you never know what you're gonna stumble across over in the Dark Web. There could be crazy advertisements, there could be strange pop-ups. A lot of folks recommend, \"Hey, turn off JavaScript so that your browser won't go to different locations or drive and do different things.\" But again, you could literally see some strange, strange stuff may not always be appropriate, right? (John chuckling) - Yeah. Yeah, so a warning about those sites. Can you go back to that original web browser? I threw you kind of like a curve ball there. - Kind of worse. - Which one do you wanna start with, John? I'm just trying to think, okay, so you're using Tails, sorry, as the operating system, I could use another operating system like Ubuntu or CALI, or something, and just boot that up. And now I've got Tor which I could download and install for free, or it comes as part of Tails. Now the next step is I go to this link, and let's say, sorry, this search engine. Now, how do I find something? - Yeah. So, personally, I think the most interesting aspect of looking and kind of lurking around in the Dark Web is to potentially get some more Intel on what other cyber crime is going on in the world right now, hey, company X or Y, Z was hacked, or someone got hit with ransomware, or there's a new malware strain. Is that being shared around on some forums? Are people talking about this? There's a lot of chatter on that. So I like to super easy, absolutely super simple, search for different things that you might be interested in or wanna learn more about in that search engine. Again, you might see some strange results, you might not even get results that you're looking for, but you can at least fall down the rabbit hole a little bit. I am not sure what we'll see, but a lot of things are really interesting because you could see, oh, do you wanna hire a professional hacker? Do you want to purchase this custom made ransomware? Do you wanna look for fully undetectable stuff? And I don't know whether all of it is true, right? We not to say some of this is legitimate, very well, some could be a scam, but it's kind of crazy to look through and crazy to see, right? So where should we go, David? Do we wanna kind of explore some, hire a hacker or- - Yeah, let's hire a hacker, come on. (John laughing) - All right. - Or we wind it for real, but let's see what we can find. - Right, right. - Is that one of the interesting ones that you found in your sort of investigations? - Yeah, I think it's silly that a lot of folks kind of offer this or put it out there. Here are some, okay, quote, \"Hacker for hire, Dark social network. Here's a hacker for hire, hire a hacker to change grades.\" And again, how do we? - Changes your school grades. It's funny, you probably get this every day. I get it constantly, \"David, please hack my school website.\" (John laughing) \"David, please, I failed my exam, can you hack my university so that you can change my grades?\" It's hilarious. - Yeah. - I won't do that and neither will you, but it's interesting that people offer those services. - And again, I don't want anyone that watches this video who is thinking, \"Hey, let's change my grades.\" Don't go out and track this down, you won't wanna do this, it's very well not legitimate. I think this one is a well-known, rent a hacker webpage. I think a lot of folks have seen this if they'd been kind of interested in this, but of course, \"Hey, we'll take payment in cryptocurrency,\" right? Whether it's Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or Monero, that's a whole nother world in itself. I can go to a homepage. - And it's guaranteed that they're gonna do the job once you pay them, yeah? - It's so funny, some folks will say, \"Hey, we offer 24/7 support. We guarantee satisfaction.\" (David laughing) \"We're the best around.\" It's so crazy to think of, I don't know, the sales and marketing. (John chuckling) That goes into this. Again, whether it's real or not, but one sobering thought is that maybe some of the cyber criminals do a better job of advertising than us good guys do. - Yeah. Yeah, that's true. (John chuckling) So, like in your investigation, did you find it fairly underwhelming or was it like really exciting, what you discovered? - I think it varies between, does this hold water, does this look real, does this look very fake. Is there anything that we could particularly see? 'Cause you see, some of these products, if you were to buy them, quote, unquote, hey, buy a hacked credit card or a hacked PayPal account, or whatever other elicit things you might see off on the side. It's funny when some of them have these, quote unquote, testimonials or ratings, or user comments, right? And you're like, \"Wow, this is supposed to be the Amazon for the underground syndicates. This is supposed to be E-bay or Craigslist for criminals,\" and those are just kind of silly, it is sometimes. - So you shown us like hire a hacker. I think you were saying offline, there's this sort of marketplaces like eBay, and is this what we're looking at at the moment, yeah? - Yeah, yeah, so I'm over here on, quote unquote, best market. (both laughing) Which is very silly in my mind, and you could see kind of, if we were to load the homepage, this cheesy animation to say, oh, the best hackers platform, and quote unquote, allegedly, \"Hey, here's a deal. Here's a quick 10% discount.\" And you could get a Bitcoin hijacker, here's some malware, here's some counterfeit money, your private keys or access to different credit cards. I see a lot of conversation in the word Fullz, F-U-L-L-Z. Oftentimes, I hear Fulls is like, hey, full information on some person, like a full background report on, hey, where they're live, who their family is, what their phone number is, their Social Security, et cetera. Strange, silly things, right? - Okay, so I could hire a hacker here, hopefully, perhaps, maybe. I remember on your series, you were comparing like different websites and it looked like the same guy, but you could just get him a different prices, you just had to like shop around. Hey, could I buy DDoSs? 'Cause I always get asked, like, \"Can I get a DDoSs?\" And again, we're not recommending that anyone try this, we just wanna show you that it's supposedly available on these websites. - Yeah. - So could you buy, or hire a hacker, buy a DDoS, that type of thing? - Allegedly, right? And again, I haven't gone through and made this purchase, so I don't know. (David laughing) But there are, of course, advertisements for this or that, or anything, strictly, particularly here's a WhatsApp hacking for, hey, the ripe price of 140 to $180, or social media hacking, email, website, bypassing 2FA authentication, ransomware, and here's our DDoSs attack. Hey, what is it? 100 to $200 supposedly? Crazy. I don't know, but these advertisements are things, whether or not they're real or not, whether or not it's a scam, some folks might fall for this, if it is, or it isn't. - Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. So this is not the career part we're advocating, we're advocating protecting against this nonsense, but this is a good example of actually what's out there, that guys are selling their services and it was very, very easy for you to find this, once you knew the links. I suppose that's the hard part is I run Tails or some operating system, I have Tor, and then it's an Onion link, that's the domain name rather than .com, and then I just find these links somewhere. You said you found these links by people giving them to you or did you just fumble around on some of these so-called search engines and find things? - Yeah, truthfully, I would fumble around in some of these search engines, and the more collection of search engines that you might have, the more you might easily be able to look for. Not all of it could very well be appropriate, I think I see a couple that are very off-putting, right? We can get off that. The same thing with plenty of others. Yeah. That's the fine line, that's the absolute risk that you would run. - Don't do this at school. Don't do this. - Yeah. (John laughing) - Don't do this at work. This is not the right stuff to show. - Yeah. So, here, if I were to use Ahmia again as a search engine and say, I wanted to look for malware, maybe this could be folks advertising their custom made malware that they've written about or they're discussing things that would be in on the news, things like that. Here's a strange one. - Yeah, John, you're big in the malware space 'cause that's your day job. - Yes. - Have you found malware that you have found like in the wild for sale, yeah? So has it helped you in your job or has it helped you like sort of get code, stuff like that? - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I wish I could find a good, or knew off the top of my head, a good forum that would kind of showcase this sort of thing because there are a lot of bulletin boards or forums where folks get together and say, \"Hey, this is my cool, new remote access Trojan. This is my cool, new command and control framework. I've made this fully undetectable, it bypasses whatever antivirus or endpoint detection response.\" And then if folks chat about the news or what's going on in the real world, maybe you'll have some of the ransomware gangs pipe in and say in a weird, strange way, put their flag in the ground and say, \"This was us. We claim that horrible, crazy thing that we did.\" There is a very, very well-known shady Russian hacker forum called XSS.is and it is all in a language that I can't read, of course, so you might have to run it through a translator, and there's others between Exploit.in. But Exploit.in is pay to play, XSS you would need a actual username to move in and work around in the forums, and read the posts. Truthfully, I do have one, but I guess, I won't burn that and display that out. (John laughing) - Are those available only on the Tor network or are they publicly available on standard internet? - XSS.is, these are not strictly in Tor. This one is Clearnet. - [David] Okay. - You could go open your Chrome Web Browser and go straight here if you want to. - So, I mean, these guys, they blatantly just showing what's... Well, I mean, you've got to get an account but that's available in the normal as we call it Clearnet, just the standard internet. - Correct. - But a lot of these forums aren't available there, you have to go through the Tor network. John, what's sort of the craziest thing you've kind of come across? - In the tech space or in the morality ethically questionable space? (both laughing) - Well, I mean, I don't wanna put you on the spot, so what was like the most interesting thing to you personally? Let's put it that way, like you would say, \"Oh, I'm surprised this year,\" or \"I'm surprised they're selling this.\" - So, one of the craziest things in my mind is the link that we were just looking at, the XSS.is and some of those hacker forums. - Yeah. - Oftentimes on those websites, there is a specific segment of the forums that might be called the people's court or the hackers court, and it's such a strange thing because it's a space for users to write a little bit of a complaint and say, \"Hey, this other member, he ripped me off,\" or \"He stole money from me,\" or \"He didn't go through with the hack when he promised me that he would,\" and it's a weird sort of like code of conduct for criminals. (John laughing) - Wow. - It's a weird sort of, yeah, hackers court and the judicial system where you could have your day with a jury and see if folks will help write the wrongs against you. - Oh, wow, so, I mean, so in the community of hackers, there's sort of this, like you can't even call it that, but like you said, code of conduct or some kind of ethics, supposedly - Yeah. - Where they hold each other accountable. You did a whole series on this, I mean, it sounds like it was quite difficult to put it together, John, because it's like, rather than just going through and purchasing a hacker for hire, you can just show the website too, but there's not really too much more than that, is that right? - Yeah, so truthfully, when you're asking about the series that I had put together, I always kinda mentally struggle with putting that out because I think from the viewers perspective or for someone watching this, it's really not all that interesting, it's sort of just spectating and going on the safari ride, and you pointed all these weird animals in the zoo or something, like, \"Wow, look at how crazy this is. I'm not gonna go touch it.\" (John chuckling) - Yeah. - I'm not gonna go interact with it, but it's weird that it's out there. So I hope that there's still some value in seeing that but I agree, I haven't gotten yet to the point where, \"Hey, let's send some Bitcoin to some supposedly criminal and let's see if they give me any payload that could run or do something.\" I haven't tried it yet, but maybe there's some competition. - We'd love to get you back when you do that, yeah? - Yeah. (John laughing) - You showed us earlier, this Russian website, and offline, you told me that we could perhaps look at that, is that right? - Yeah, so I am accessing once again, that XSS.is hacker forum. This is in Google translator right now, so the Russian language is being translated in English so that I can make better sense of it and kind of understand it a little bit better, but you could see all the different chatter and see some of the posts and communication is as recent as today or yesterday, or Saturday, et cetera. A lot of different discussions, \"Hey, what if you are writing your own malware or your programming, or developing in different languages?\" If you wanna be chatting about the news, some of the recent things that could be happening between ransomware, decryption keys, et cetera, or proof of concept for different CVEs or vulnerabilities. I'll scroll down until we can get to some interesting stuff. Of course, marketplace idea, whether you're selling access to companies or whether you're selling malware, et cetera, but here's our people's court, odd enough. (David laughing) And there is a complaint, it says, \"Hey, have you been deceived or thrown? You can right here, we'll get things sorted out. If the facts of the scam is proven, the person gets the ripper status and is added to the blacklist.\" So you'll be publicly punished and shamed for this sort of thing. So here, we're checking out the complaints in the people's court, and here's a little craziness here, we're throwing some individual because they're hiding and waiting for something, or this one ripped me off. Here's a scammer, here are some other bad people. Any of these we're interested in, anyone that we should take a look at, David? (John laughing) - [David] Is that a $20,000 someone ripped him off? - [John] Oh, this one here, you think? - [David] Yeah. - [John] I don't know, it has 16 responses. - [David] Someone got banned. - [John] I'll go ahead and click on this. All right. Now again, looking through this post, this is a translation of the original language, so it might not be readable. There might be a lot of random different words that aren't what was originally displayed in the language, but it looks like here's some conversations about virus total, or finding some payload, or malware. And a lot of chatter, this being some violation, supposedly. We can see, if we were to scroll down, what other people had said. Goodness. (John chuckling) This is where our language translation is really hurting us. The music played for a short time. Okay. - [David] Yeah. (John laughing) - So interesting. - Well. Yeah, we're not quite sure exactly what happened, but someone got banned, so basically they did some arbitration and someone was affected through the complaints court or whatever it is. - Yep. - So, John, have you found like solar winds hacks or anything that you were surprised on that website, or was it like just a freefall? - Yeah, if you dig through a lot of the malware marketplaces, you can find other utilities, you can find other frameworks or tools that folks might put out there into the world. And it is surprising to me, how many of it is kind of a rip off. - Yeah. - Or kind of a portion of other built, well-known open source, remote access, Trojans, and command and control frameworks, and just sort of shield as someone else's product. It's a strange, weird world in those syndicates, because sometimes it could be very, very clever and very, very cool novel payloads and exploitation techniques, but sometimes it's, oh, this is just an off the wall mockup or skin of something else. - Yeah, you don't expect thieves to be honest, so- - Right, exactly. (John laughing) - Yeah, so what do you expect? I mean, it's exactly right. So you've been delving into this for a while, what's your advice to people who are all white hat? Is it worth them spending time going through that stuff, or is it only just like a curiosity? - Super good question. What is my advice for this though, I would advise anyone that is interested in this and wants to kind of see the action as it unfolds. This is one of those ways to do it, but you kind of have to have a strong stomach. You know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah. - You might stumble across some things that are really weird, maybe not the most heartening thing, a lot of ethically questionable stuff, if you're just scrolling around in the Dark Web. So avoid that, the best, the best you can, but you can see a little bit more. I don't know if you wanna pull up any of those ransomware blog sites between REvil or BlackMatter, or some of the others, we can certainly do that. - That'd be great, yeah, yeah. Yeah, REvil will be good, or I need the ones that you recommend, yeah? - So I think one of the more purposeful means or reasons to be kind of exploring and lurking over here in these Onion sites is that you can get a little bit of visibility into what's happening for ransomware gangs, or ransomware operators. And we know that there are a ton, and obviously between a lot of things happening in the news recently, colonial pipeline has become a talking point and stand point for so many things, JBS meat, we have the Steamship Authority, we had Kaseya, there were so, so many things between different gangs or different cyber crimes syndicates. And we've heard of BlackMatter, we've heard of dark side, we've heard of REvil, we've heard of Ragnar Locker, we've heard of Babuk, we've heard of Avaddon, we've heard of, the list goes on and on, and on. Oftentimes if you have a ransom note or if you are a victim of ransomware and you take a look at the instructions on how to recover your files, quote unquote, they'll tell you, \"Go access this webpage in the Dark Web or with the .Onion site,\" and they will communicate with you like a weird support staff, on, \"Hey, here's how we could get back your files, pay us X million dollars in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.\" Alongside that, typically the ransomware gangs have their own blog or a public presence where they will literally dump all of the data that they've stolen from that victim. If that individual, if that organization does not pay, thus holding your data for ransom. So you could see this. They're really there, and you could download them, you can explore through them, you could see some of the crazy stuff, and there are a lot of different aspects to it. So I have pulled up the homepage of Ragnar Locker and their leaks, their leaks site here. Here's a Wall of Shame, a permanent list of companies who would like to keep in secret, the info leakage, exposing themselves, and then their customers and partners to even greater risk. I'll scroll down here, but a lot of this, I think we might be able to redact because they are real companies that would have data released. Some of these are announcements that are really, really interesting, some of them, with Ragnar Locker specifically, they've got a lot of chatter lately in the news where they're saying, \"Hey, if you're a ransomware victim, don't go ask the police to help you, don't go ask the FBI, don't try to ask for help from federal agencies because we don't want that, and we're just gonna make it worse for you. We will go ahead and publish all your data if you were to do that stuff.\" So kind of spooky. (John chuckling) \"Well, we will find out and we'll punish with all our efforts.\" (David laughing) Man. - I shouldn't laugh, I mean, it's really sad it goes on. - Yeah. Some of it's crazy, and sometimes you just have to laugh because like, wow, this sounds so absurd. - [David] Yeah. - But we are a team of cybersecurity enthusiasts, crypto punks, entrepreneurs, and ultimately businessmen. We wanna make a profit. We can pull up REvil. - Yeah, got REvil, but REvil is quite popular, isn't it? Or I shouldn't say popular, it's been in the news a lot. - Yes, so, Revil has what they call Happy Blog, and again, each of these blogs are victims. - [David] So these are people that didn't pay the ransom, so they've published their data, is that right? - [John] Yes, you could see a passport right open here. I'll click on this. All right, sometimes you're like, \"I don't know, I don't wanna look at this anymore, this is just too insane,\" but here's legitimate documents. I have yet to make a YouTube video where I actually go through and do this because redacting and obscuring it is just gonna be awful. (John laughing) So I'm sorry. (John laughing) - Yeah, so the Happy Blog is this one that when we did a malware analysis video, you mentioned this, so this is actually that blog where the stuff's being published, yeah? Go on. - When we were chatting about Kaseya, I wonder if they have this displayed here still. Oh, here it is. When you and I did a video together discussing the Kaseya ransomware incident, Happy Blog and REvil had posted this update, and you don't have to redact this, this is, I think, very well known. They say, \"Hey, on Friday, just before the 4th of July holiday in the United States, we launched an attack on a bunch of managed service providers. More than a million systems were infected,\" I don't know if that's true or not. They might just be pumping their chest, they might just trying to be all braggadocio, but say, \"Here's our asking price. If you give us $70 million in Bitcoin, we'll give you a public decryptor.\" Those that have been falling in the Kaseya incident know there's a little bit more to the story though. There have been some chatter on the decryption key and how folks are recovering, et cetera, but that was certainly a hot topic. And you could literally find this post. You could see this on REvil's blog, and that's what we're doing right now. - So give us the update, what happened with the Kaseyas since we did our interview, John? - I believe a decryption key was brought to light and there was not disclosed originally how, it was not mentioned what third party provided this savior magic decryption key, universal decryptor. I think, maybe as early as last week or a little bit ago, now there are other stories saying, \"Hey, this was retrieved by a federal agency, why didn't so-and-so agency give this to us earlier?\" - Yeah. - Because the decryption key came in like three weeks after the incident. So it's still, I think a little bit of disgruntlement, still some salt in the wounds on that, 'cause there was legitimate devastation, I think, for the Kaseya attack, a lot of organizations thinking they're going out of business. - Yeah. - BlackMatter, this is just another site where they've dumping stuff, yeah? - Yup, yup, BlackMatter is just another ransomware gang, and this, again, is a list of their victims. (John chuckling) You can see all the flashy, \"Hey, we published this data, and if you want to go to the post, here's what you could download. Here's our 30 gigabytes of data or however much.\" I could literally click Download here and it could start the file transfer. I have no reason to do that, I don't suggest others do, but I'm telling you it's real and you could do it. - Yeah, so, I mean, the stories in the news, I mean, and that's the important piece about what you're showing here. This stuff is out there, and you're gonna show us how easy it is to find this, because we've discussed malware in the past, we've seen the Happy Blog now, we've seen these other websites that are on the sort of Dark Web, it's actually really sad what happens. I mean, we, on the good side, don't want this to happen, but it must be soul destroying for you really, because you encounter this all the time with the malware stuff, yeah? - Yes, it's funny when I'm asked to kind of have these conversations and do talks, and presentations, especially now being a Cybersecurity Awareness Month. I tell folks, \"Hey, if you're into cybersecurity, awesome, that's incredible, it's a ton of fun, you're gonna love it, but, man, is it hard work?\" Lots of late nights, lots of sleepless nights, lots of work in the weekends, trying to respond to incidents where some ransomware actors have just blown up in an organization and now leaked all the data online, this being a prime example of that. It's some that you really have to know the adversary, and I think maybe this is a good way to do it. - Yeah, I mean, we always hammer on this, but you've seen the stuff on the Dark Web, this is the real thing, but you advocate always CTS. That's how the good guys make sure that they know what they're doing and how they protect organizations, yeah? - I think that's what absolutely captured the flag in training, and learning about this all in different ways is the best thing that you can do to sharpen your own sword and make sure that you're in this fight and in the trenches here, because the more that you expose yourself to, the more that you learn, the more that you understand, the better armed you are for when incidents occur. - So, John, tell me, I wanna become like you, I wanna get into this game. You've obviously had a really rough year, I mean, you've had a tough. Would you still recommend someone young or someone old, doesn't matter, get into this field or you're getting tired of it already? (John laughing) - Oh, it's such a pointed question. - No, I'm being nasty. I mean, it's like, if you could go back in time, would you follow the same path or would you say to your younger self, \"You know what? It's just too much work.\" - I think, no matter what, this field is extremely fulfilling. - Yeah. - Because you can see the difference in however way and whatever way, how little, how small, how great, how big, doing the sort of work you really do. You're fighting against real threats. I think sometimes that gets lost in translation. - Yeah. - Especially even for me, because I talk about how we like to gamify things. We do these red versus blue exercise, we do these tabletop role-playing games, but when you pull the curtain back on the Dark Web and you see these real things, these real threats, these real adversaries, it's not a game anymore, - Yeah. - And that's something that we gotta take really seriously because they are real adversaries, and real devastation could come from incidents in cyber crime. - I think that's important, I'm glad you said that because when you become a cybersecurity professional and we wanna be the good guys, you're literally saving people a lot of pain. I mean, some of the stuff you showed me, I wouldn't mention it too much, but a lot of that was confidential, like a passport information, stuff like that. You're gonna save people a lot of pain if you can protect companies against that. - Absolutely. - Yeah, it's a real, it's not a game. - I don't know if you've seen some of the recent news, but there were some chatter, hey, when ransomware hits a hospital. - [David] Yeah. - It suddenly becomes a real matter of life and death. And you can see in some of those leaks that we literally got to see, you mentioned confidential data, cool, legal documents, medical documents, sensitive personal information, now out and available because some bad actors thought they wanted to make some money. - Yeah, I mean, I'm glad you mentioned hospitals, I mean, the NHS here in the U.K. - Yeah. - A lot of the hospitals were shut down, and that can have the consequences that people die. It's not a game, and I think, I wanna say this as an inspiration for people who wanna get into this on the good side, you are doing a good job, those late nights are worth it, if you're protecting companies because you get to do something that's really interesting. I mean, John, you're a shining example of this. You do stuff that's really interesting. I don't wanna make it all philosophical, but there's a bigger purpose to this because you're protecting people, and I mean, a lot of that has real, real consequences. - Absolutely. - So, yeah, kudos to you. John, really appreciate you sharing this. Thanks for, like, as you said in the beginning, you've pulled back the veil, if you like, showing us what's actually happening. Thanks so much for sharing your knowledge. - Thanks so much for going on a safari ride with me. There's a lot to explore, but I think it really does have some value and there's a lot of education to bring, yeah. - I just wanna say this again, I mean, John, sorry on your YouTube channel, you've covered a lot of this in a lot more detail, yeah? - Yeah, so I've done what I call a Dark Web documentary series, which is very similar to this style. It's sort of a discovery based video where I don't always know exactly where I'm going, just kind of stumbling along and looking through different Onions sites, and seeing what's out there, whether it's a scam, whether it's legitimate, whether it's a real threat, whether it's malware or what have you, it's just bringing to light all that could be kind of buried beneath here.

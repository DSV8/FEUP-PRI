    "transcript": "(upbeat music) (clapper clapping) - There we go, here we go. Ow, this is that time of year where you shock everything metal that you touch in here. All right, what's up, MKBHD here. Just wanted to talk, just me and you for a real quick minute, what's up? So there's a bunch of things that have been evolving in the background that you haven't seen, that have been completed right around now, so I wanted to share them with you. A lot of these things, when they're an announcement, they end up as a tweet. So, if you're not following me on Twitter already, a lot of these things end up there first, but here we are. This kind of feels like a little New Year's update video, basically, because we always have, we know the second half of the year in this tech world is product-focused. There's so many things that come out. I mean, you guys know about Techtober, but we're always so in the thick of it about covering and sharing all this new stuff that's coming out and figuring out if it's any good. And then we get to January, and then who gets CES, and then there's kind of like a little bit of a chill period. Now there is still some products here and there, but this is definitely January and now February is more of a chance to sort of refresh things a little bit, and that's actually something I enjoy just as much as the rest of the videos, because if you don't change things up a little bit, if you don't stay on your toes a little, you might find yourself in cruise control, so we've been doing exactly that. You guys have seen the new intro, also new channel banner for 2022, fresh new graphics, absolute fire, just freshening things up. I'll always have a place in my heart for all of the previous year's graphics and banners, but if we're not moving forward, we're standing still, so we're getting better. The Studio channel is going strong, and we're trying all kinds of new things over there behind the scenes looks, tutorials, many reviews even, shorts. and also, that channel has a new banner too, by the way. So, if you aren't subscribed to The Studio, you're missing out, there's so much good stuff. But speaking of new, there's some even bigger new stuff that, low key, I kind of wanted to launch everything right around New Years, but some of it took a little longer, 'cause we wanted to get it just right, and so we've got to that point now. So, it's February 1st as I record this, but there's some good stuff. So number one, new channel. I have officially launched an MKBHD Shorts channel for the hashtag shorts, link is below. There's already two shorts there as of right now with many more to come. And so now normally, launching a new channel, I'd be like, \"All right, go over there right now \"and subscribe,\" but I'm not gonna say that. I'm not gonna do that. Only go over there to that link, to that Shorts channel, if you really want to. See, I really like TikToks and shorts, and that's probably like sacrilegious to say in the cinematography communities, although 30 FPS for life, so maybe I'm not in all of those communities, but there's just something different. It's obviously a very different format, but it's a different challenge to package information in that way and to make a really good short. Like, I can make a video, an MKBHD video, but the new challenge of making a good, what is an MKBHD short? That's actually really fun for me. So, it's still tech-related, it's still high quality, but I wanted to give you the modularity basically to be able to subscribe also to Shorts, if you want to or not subscribe, if you don't want to see them. So instead of putting them all in one place, you can decide if you're interested in shorts and subscribe there if you want. I'm not ruling out the possibility of posting occasional shorts on this channel. I haven't done it yet, but you know, I might as well. It's fun to play with, but that's the idea is to give you that ability to subscribe to exactly what you want to. That's why we have a separate channel for the \"Waveform\" podcast and a separate channel for The Studio. Now, if you want MKBHD shorts, you know exactly where to go, plus it's got a pretty sweet new banner too, so why not? And then another brand new thing, brand new website. Oh yeah, MKBHD.com used to be pretty embarrassing if I'm being honest, probably the only way you can actually see what it used to be is if you're on like a archive or something like that, but the new site is everything I wanted. We took the extra time and now MKBHD.com is a beautiful, functional, secure, dope site as a hub for all things here. It is mobile friendly, of course, as you'd expect. And, as a bonus, we created two entirely unique websites that you can flip between with the flick of a switch, because there is a dark mode toggle, so there is a dark mode version of the entire website. And that site, of course, is where you'll find the new merch, and we've refreshed the entire MKBHD merch store. That's where you'll find all this stuff, and by the way, we're graduating from more than just apparel, so we've got the whole checkout process streamlined. It's entirely contained on MKBHD.com, but it's gonna be more than just clothes stuff. So we still got the soft shirts and the long sleeves and the hoodie and the windbreaker, that's all great. Also, now we've got hats. We've got five panel hats and beanies for the winter months and then some actual products. So the desk mat, slash mousepad, we've been teasing a few times is actually incredible. I love this thing. And then, there's also a matte black WoodWick candle, that is a New Studio scent. Now, I don't know if you've ever made your own candle before, but the process for making your own candle is quite fascinating, and you end up obviously designing the outside, but also it smells like a studio full of new gadgets, and that's kind of awesome that we actually managed to make that happen, (chuckles) so we have a candle. So there's that, and there's even more coming soon. I'll keep you guys posted on when the new stuff drops. I'll tweet that of course too, but I think this is the best drop we've ever had, and it's the most complete store we've ever offered, and it is the best way to support the channel directly. I think probably one of the biggest misconceptions about running a channel, in general, is that it's easy, and it can still be easy to make super simple, basic videos. It started off easy, but if you have ambitions to do better things or to do more, which many do, it's not easy, and that's exactly why we're hiring. So that's sort of the last mini announcement is that I've updated the application that's on the site to join the team at The Studio. It's a slowly growing creative team, but it's responsible for all of the stuff that you see on all these channels and on the site and in the store and on the separate projects we're also working on that you'll see coming soon, that is happening. So a couple of positions that I know I'm definitely looking for right now are an assistant \"Waveform\" producer for the podcast, ad sales and an editor. So, after 13 years of editing all these videos, maybe there's some room for growth there too. But basically, anytime there's updates to that, for what positions I'm hiring for at The Studio, you can always just click the apply link, and you can see that right there, and if you ever want to apply, that'll always be there. And then last thing, I'm gonna be doing, I'm gonna be trying some live stuff, some live chats directly with you guys, maybe Q and A type stuff, and I'm running it as a trial with people who are members of this channel, so you've had that join button down below, and many people have generously been members of the channel, supporting and all they've really gotten is a little badge next to their name. I appreciate y'all, but we're gonna have, yeah, I'm gonna do some members live streams and just do some chats and Q and A's and games and stuff like that and see what that's about on this channel as well, so while we're at announcements, just one more quick one for you and that's pretty much gonna do it. (upbeat music) New graphics, new channels, new website, new dark mode theme, new merch, new people, it's all coming together. I love this time of year. That's been it. Back to your regularly scheduled programming, see you later, peace.",

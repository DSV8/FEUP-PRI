    "transcript": "Remember that time I made a video about TOSLINK? I sure do, it was just last week! (almost) Well, before I ended that video, I left you with a question. Why havent we seen fiber... *THUNDER CLAP* [ominous music] Youve angered the Hi-Fi gods! You said TOSLINK is impervious to electromagnetic interference but what does that matter in the digital space? But you didnt mention ground loops and the devastation they cause! OK, OK, just, settle down! Ill address that. Right now! When you connect two pieces of equipment with an RCA cable, you also connect their respective grounds together. In some circumstances, this can create audible humming or buzzing because even though the signal being sent is digital, the amplification circuitry is not. Because it is connected to ground, if theres an imbalance between the two grounds of the sending and receiving equipment, that creates a current in the ground of the signal wire which can affect the analog amplification circuitry. Because TOSLINK is an optical signal, the two devices are galvanically isolated and it doesnt matter in the slightest if theres a ground imbalance. TOSLINK is, in effect, an opto-isolator and this benefit should not be ignored. Now, I would like to provide an explanation for my careless oversight. For every person who touts the benefits of TOSLINK, theres another that complains about clock jitter. Those individuals claim that if youre encountering a ground loop, for the love of god dont use TOSLINK with all its totally real imperfections, sort out that problem you heathens! Audio forums are worse than Twitter, each of you likes what you like and anytime anyone presents any opinion regarding the pros and cons of one system over another, yall lose your minds and get real pretentious and Im just kinda over that. I, admittedly, chalked up the concern for ground loops to be one of those opinions, but its not. TOSLINK can, does, and has many times presented a meaningful solution to the problem of ground loops or other electrical noise issues, and it may in fact be the entire reason Toshiba developed it. It is interesting to note, however, that the ground loop problem seems to have gone away in the age of HDMI. Whether thats down to better isolation inside the equipment itself or some other thing, it suggests that the problem could have been solved without going to an optical fiber. It may have just been easier (and, lets not forget, cooler) to use TOSLINK. Alright, now that thats taken care of, lets get back to the question at hand. With TOSLINK being developed in 1983, why havent we seen fiber... *THUNDER CLAP* Youve angered the IT gods! You referred to CAT5 cable as Ethernet! You fool! Ethernet is a standard series of protocols and fiber optic cabling is routinely used in larger networks! Youre right. I am but a lowly network plebeian, barely capable of setting up a WiFi router. Forgive my callous equation of Ethernet and that cable. It wont happen again. Wow, were almost three minutes into this and we havent even gotten to the question at hand. So. Why havent we seen fiber optics in the consumer space aside from TOSLINK? Actually, in some very niche circumstances we have, and as the IT gods reminded us, it does exist in big networks, but Im talking on a broader, more basic scale. Your average consumer is probably familiar with things like USB, HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, Eth..., I mean, Cat 5 cabling with 8P8C (often incorrectly referred to as RJ45) connectors, and maybe FireWire or SATA or perhaps other things. All of these use wires, like some sort of technologically regressive lazy person. Why not use light? Well, lets start with the obvious thing. TOSLINK works great for connecting pieces of audio visual gear together because each one will have its own power source. All that needs to get sent between them is a little bit of data. But lots of things need power, too. Have fun using that keyboard and mouse connected to your computer by nothing but light. And, as we moved away from the days of RS-232 serial connections and into the holy land of the Universal Serial Bus, suddenly we found that were not sending little bits of power just to keep your mouse alive. Were sending loads of it. I dont want to go off on too much of a tangent here... Oh who am I kidding I do this all the time. It seems like USB turned into the power delivery standard it is today kinda by accident. Remember that even in USB 2.0 days, officially a device could only draw 2.5 watts, and that was considered high power. In those wild west days, different companies were coming up with their own ways to determine the current a given port could supply, and it wasnt until 2007 that the first USB Battery Charging specification appears, finally getting everyone on the same page and allowing for USB ports on computers to finally, officially, provide more than 500ma when asked nicely. Anyway, now that USB is ubiquitous, we can expect any modern device to provide a decent amount of power through its USB ports for things like portable hard drives, charging your phone, and of course the monumentally important task of powering all those RGB LEDs in that gaming keyboard you bought because, you know, +5 Agility. But you may recall that the switch from USB 2 to USB 3 didnt just involve making the data transfer go faster. The 4 conductors of the USB cable werent enough, so we had to add more of them for USB 3. Five more, to be exact. Add too many more and we might as well just start using HDMI for everything. But with fiber optics, we could potentially have much, MUCH faster data throughput using only a pair of optical fibers. Or, potentially, just one if you, for instance, send data in each direction using two different wavelengths of light, and separate them with a prism on each end. So sure, we need to send power to devices in addition to data. Why not create some sort of composite cable (no, not that kind) a cable that is a composite of both optical and electrical? Like a USB cable where the data lines are replaced with optical fiber? Then, the same cable could be used for nearly everything! Alls we gotta do is just make the LEDs go blinky blinky a little faster and we coulda been using the same cables since the 80s! Well, not so fast. Heh. Not so fast. Optical fiber is complicated. It doesnt seem like it should be, after all what are we really doing but flashing a light source and moving it somewhere else so we can see the flashing and decode it, but thanks to PHYSICS, its not actually as simple as that. Stupid physics. Making everything difficult. I dont want to get too far down this particular path because its importance to potential consumer standards is arguably minimal, but its important nonetheless. Since light travels at the speed of light, it may seem as though a pulse of light down an optical cable will reach the other end in exactly the same way that it was sent. But it wont. Thanks to a phenomenon called modal dispersion, also known as multimode distortion, multimode dispersion, modal distortion, intermodal distortion, intermodal dispersion, and intermodal delay distortion (jeez guys pick a name already) the signal actually gets a little smeared. Lets imagine we send a pulse of light down this optical fiber. Will it all get to the other end at the same time? It seems like it should, its light after all. But just because something happens as fast as we know things can happen doesnt mean geometry doesnt apply. If the individual photons in that pulse of light manage to stay perfectly parallel to the sides of the fiber, they will all arrive at the other end simultaneously. But this is the real world, and nothings perfect. Some of them are gonna enter the fiber at an angle, which means they dont take a straight path. They bounce off the sides, and although total internal reflection keeps them from leaving the fiber, this zig-zag path is much longer than a straight line so those meandering photons will in fact arrive later. And this limits the speed at which we can pulse the light on and off and still have it be intelligible on the other end. This is that smearing of the signal. Even though on the sending end were putting in a clear-cut, on-off signal, on the receiving end the photons who lollygagged and bounced around in the fiber cause the signal to look like this. Some of the photons from the last pulse manage to arrive at the same time as some of them from the next one. So, we have to limit the frequency at which the pulses happen in order to make the received signal decodable. This means that optical fibers do actually have a bandwidth limit. Just because were using fiber optics doesnt mean we have theoretically endless upgrade capacity. That said, you might have already surmised that the bandwidth limit depends on how long the optical fiber is. No matter how poorly the light behaves in the pipe, if its a short pipe then the time difference between straight-and-true photons and disastrously off-course photons is quite small. And this is why discussing the bandwidth limitations of a given optical fiber is not really a big deal if were dealing with consumer applications where cables arent likely to go beyond 10 meters. But, since its interesting, lets get into how we deal with bandwidth limits anyway. In the land of fiber, there are two basic kinds of fiber optic cabling. Single-mode fiber, and multi-mode fiber. Now, mode here doesnt mean a method of operation. Here it means the field pattern of propagating electromagnetic waves. Ideally we want the light to travel only in the transverse mode, and thats what single-mode fiber allows us to do. It accomplishes this by having a very small internal diameter, what we in the business call itty bitty. Generally its between 8 and 10 micrometers across. This tiny size of the fiber allows the pulses to remain distinct over longer distances because the light traveling through the fiber mainly stays in the transverse mode. Because of this, long-distance links on the order of thousands of kilometers are usually done with single-mode fiber. But, single-mode fiber is really finicky to deal with, requiring special tools to make connections since its so darn small. So for applications involving shorter fiber runs, like networking a building, well use much easier to deal with multi-mode fiber. This thicker fiber allows us to make cable terminations more easily at the cost of a messier signal on the other end. Still, its a fair bit of bandwidth. Using just LEDs, gigabit speeds are easily achievable. And if we get into higher-grade fibers and start using lasers as transmitters, we can get 100 gigabit speeds over distances on the order of 100 meters. And remember, the shorter the run, the easier it is to achieve high bandwidth. But if were talking about a fiber like TOSLINK, well thats nothing like even multi-mode fiber. Its actually in a third category. Generally TOSLINK is a plastic optical fiber. Its much thicker inside, about a hundred times thicker than single mode fiber, so it exhibits much greater modal dispersion, and thus its bandwidth limit is much lower. But how much lower is it, really? I mean, shorter lengths make the bandwidth go up, so even though that fishing line in there has wicked bad modal dispersion, over just a few meters it shouldnt matter much, right? Right! In a 2009 paper by Yasuhiro Koike, the possibility of using plastic optical fiber for high speed networking was explored. By using different modulation methods, it was found that plastic fiber could easily achieve gigabit speed at lengths up to 100 meters. And, with the development of graded-index plastic fiber, 40 gigabit speeds were achieved. Pretty impressive. But, now were stepping into messy territory. Lets rewind a bit. Graded-index plastic optical fiber is a new development. And the question Im getting at here is why havent we been using fiber forever? Imagine that in 1985 we had come up with one standard cable, like a bidirectional TOSLINK cable with a pair of power wires running through it. Ill call it UniLINK. Could we have been simply been using the same cable to replace the functions of all these, and had a future-proof design because the speed could simply be boosted with each new generation of hardware? Well, maybe. A TOSLINK cable with a 10 meter length could perhaps pull off 10 gigabit speeds. And so, if we had designed a cable like my theoretical UniLINK cable, then perhaps we could have simply had one cable to rule them all. Oh, and wouldnt ya know it, I found this product guide from Toshiba and it turns out that TOSLINK did have a few bidirectional connectors out there. They are generally limited to professional and niche applications like automation control, but this high-speed TOSLINK connection is capable of a quarter gigabit at 20 meters. Not too bad, and I dont doubt that could be improved. But, well, now heres where the heavy weight of reality steps in. As the old adage goes, just because you can doesnt mean you should. It may seem silly to use such complicated cables when commercial fiber optic links are now pushing past terabit speeds, but just looking at the various connectors and cables weve used through the ages doesnt really explain what theyre doing. An HDMI cable doesnt have 19 conductors running through it for grins and giggles. Most handle the video data in various ways, but others handle things like the audio return channel (and notably that pin was unused in early versions of the standard), the display data channel which allows displays and whatever theyre plugged into to get a nice introduction and learn their respective preferences (also this is where HDCP runs along for the ride), a 5v power supply, the consumer electronics control which is what allows other devices to turn on and off your TV for you, and many of these pins have been given more and more tasks as HDMI has matured and improved. Could we do all of that with one single fiber optic cable? Perhaps. Though HDMI 2.1 has a total bandwidth of 48 gigabits per second, which might not be possible with plastic fiber at all. Or at least, only over relatively short distances. See, its interesting to think about the blazing fast speeds fiber optics allow, but a super fast serial datastream isnt necessarily useful for driving the pixels of an LCD panel in a logical fashion. And therein lies the problem. We have a bunch of different cables to deal with because theyre all designed to do specific things in specific ways. The end! unexpectedly smooth jazz Just kidding! Though, that pretty much is the answer. At a very fundamental level, theyre all carrying power and data. But how that data should best be transported depends on what kind of data it is and what we want to do with it. As new standards came up, their cables were designed to address those needs. And oftentimes the best way to take care of a specific need is to add another conductor for doing just one thing. So, while we could just send everything over a high-speed fiber connection, the extra processing that might be required on each end can make the whole idea more complicated, and expensive. And so, new cables for new applications often make the most sense. If you can simplify the data processing with a more complicated cable, its often worth it. And now, Im about to shoot that argument in the foot. Did you know that there are HDMI cables which are actually fiber-optic? If you need to run an HDMI cable over a very long distance, one of the easiest ways to do it is to take an HDMI signal, convert it to a fiber optic data stream, send it over a fiber however long you need, and convert it back to HDMI on the other end. Commercially available products can do all that in what looks like any ordinary HDMI cable that just happens to be very long. These cables actually cheat a little bit and have four fibers going through them, probably one for each of the three sets of data lines and the fourth for the clock signal that a normal HDMI cable carries, to make encoding and decoding easier, but they demonstrate that the actual hardware required to convert to fiber and back again isnt that complex. It all fits inside these connectors. Back in 2014, LinusTechTips demonstrated a USB 3.Optical cable from Corning that, well did the same thing but for USB. The tech to convert to optical and back was a little more expensive at the time, but it still all fit in modules barely larger than your basic flash drive. So, whats the deal then? What exactly is stopping us from using a UniLINK hybrid power and optical cable for everything? Um, nothing. Except of course for all the other cables we already have. This is why I love looking at technology through a historical lens. TOSLINK is surprisingly old for what it is, but at the same time its kinda in its own little corner. Consumers havent needed fiber optics for bandwidth reasons until very recently, so unless there was some reason electrical isolation was absolutely necessary, using a pair of copper wires was sufficient. So, throughout the rise of the digital age, we just kept on going with copper. Because it worked. Lots of technological progress comes from using existing things in new ways. Just look at how we first got the Internet into our homes--using ordinary telephone lines! [dial-up modem sounds] Just by calling a specific phone number and having your computer screech at another one, youre online! And then, we adapted those phone lines into basic broadband using DSL, and if youve got cable Internet, youre getting your memes over the same coaxial cable thats been delivering ...must-watch television programming for decades. And it works! Backward compatibility is also partly to blame for keeping optical tech in the dark. Like in the case of USB, more data lines were added to the existing connector, rather than create an entirely new one. It was another case of using existing things in new ways, though with a little more flair. The only practical time to introduce an optical standard is when creating an entirely new standard. Speaking of creating entirely new standards, Thunderbolt was almost optical. In fact, it was originally called Light Peak. But somewhere in the development process, Intel realized theyd like to be able to send power through these cables, and while they pondered stealing my idea and bundling copper wire with optical fibers, by 2011 they gave up the fiber thing altogether, realizing that copper worked just fine. Though, its worth noting that in the development stages, they were pushing 10 gigabits a second through plastic fiber, and believed they could get to 100. Also of note is that, just like Cornings extra long optical USB cable, optical Thunderbolt cables were a thing, but this hasnt yet become a reality for Thunderbolt 3. Speaking of Thunderbolt 3, we do seem to be headed towards a One Cable to Rule Them All future. Or at least, maybe. USB type C can do nearly everything we might want a cable to do, and it can do it pretty well. Nevermind how incredibly confusing the whole situation is right now because the connector is called USB type C but that doesnt actually mean anything in regards to what data can go through that port or any specific cable because the USB Implementers Forum sucks at branding and bundling Thunderbolt into the same thing as USB is making this mighty confusing. Get it together, people! So where does this leave us? To put it simply, its complicated. We do sort of see fiber optics in the consumer space. Though most of those implementations are indirect and just a way of getting around cable length limits. It doesnt seem likely that wed end up with a TOSLINK-like cable that sends only optical data, because we need copper to send power, anyway. And if we need some copper, why not just do it all with copper? I imagine thats the conclusion Intel came to in the development of Thunderbolt. Will another attempt at creating a truly optical standard find success? Well, Im doubtful. Thunderbolt 3 and/or USB 3.2 or wherever we are in this situation is probably way faster than what any casual consumer is gonna need for a while. I wont say ever, cause you just cant do that when it comes to tech, but then theres this other elephant in the room I havent mentioned yet; WiFi. [in a Valley Girl voice] Wires are sooo yesssterday. Why use a wire when I could live life untethered? Ugh, so gross these wires. I hate to break it to you, but your average consumer is not your average enthusiast, and so if theres a wireless option, thats probably preferred. Why do you think headphone jacks are going away? I mean, I was mad at OnePlus for ditching it but today I rarely miss it. So yeah. There will always be a need for super-fast wired connections in the professional space, and lots of you enthusiasts out there love to live in that same tier. But lets be honest. Youre not the average user. Thats not a bad thing, not at all! But it deserves to be said. For now, I imagine optical connectors will stay right where they are. Simultaneously at the very bottom with TOSLINK, and at the very top with crazy fast networking equipment. For everything else, coppers pretty OK. And for everything else else, microwaves are fine, too. And for those weird niche cases where we are running fiber as a Frankenstein solution to getting around a length limitation, well to that I say, why not? Thanks for watching. Theres a lot I didnt get to before ending this video, so as these fine Patreon supporters start scrolling up your screen, Ill bring a few of them up. When we make long-distance fiber optic links, we usually cant send light all the way from one end to the other because even the best optical fibers do attenuate the signal somewhat. In the past, we used electronic repeaters which simply read the incoming signal and repeated it using another laser to enable longer connections. However, these days we use optical amplifiers which use some physics magic to passively make the light beam more intense without actually creating a new beam of light. Because you dont need a bunch of active devices repeating the signal along the fibers length, you can speed up data transmission within it. I dont understand the operating principle of optical amplifiers well enough to provide a good explanation of how they work, so if anyone in the comments wants to take a crack at it please do. Also, I do want to point out a valid criticism from the last video. HDMI sure does have more audio bandwidth than TOSLINK, but what if you only want to send audio? Since HDMI is primarily a video interface, audio-only just isnt a thing it does. And, thats a fair point. However, when were dealing with multichannel high-resolution audio, I think its fair to say that were usually talking about the home theater space, and thats why I was ignoring that potential use case. Also! The Audio Return Channel was until HDMI 2.1 limited to S/PDIF, meaning until very recently TOSLINK and the ARC were essentially the same thing, and since many people reported having issues with the ARC, TOSLINK provided an alternative with just-as-good audio and with better compatibility. Now, though, the ARC is truly better, so assuming you dont run into problems, it leaves TOSLINK in the dust. Another fun little thing was that I did run across some research looking into how to send electrical power over optical fiber. Yep, power over optical fiber is a thing, but I cant seem to find any specifications on exactly how much power can be sent. And I doubt its very much at all, though Im willing to be surprised. And lastly, following along those lines, one of the things that CAT5 cabling lets us do is send power in addition to data over the same lines. This is called Power over Ethernet, and wait. Its called power over ethernet, eh? Hmm. How interesting. Anyway, power over Ethernet allows for things like powering wireless access points without needing an A/C power source at the location, providing power to IP phones in office buildings, or any other such need. And up to 50 watts! Thats some powerful stuff, that Ethernet is. abridgedly smooth jazz",

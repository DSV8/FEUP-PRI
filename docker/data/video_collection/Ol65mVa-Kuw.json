    "transcript": "You might remembering me mentioning in a few of my previous videos that we have a giveaway coming up. And that giveaway is now here. I have 10 brand new OnePlus 8 5G's from T-Mobile, and we're going to be giving them away to some of you guys. It comes in two colors: Onyx Black and Interstellar Glow, which should be interesting. Let's get started. [Intro] T-Mobile is the wireless provider exclusive for the Interstellar Glow. And since T-Mobile and OnePlus are sponsoring this video, they provided the phones, I've decided to invite my buddy Dez on the channel to kind of explain the rules of the giveaway and explain more about the phone. I've known Dez for quite a few years now. You might recognize him from some of his unboxings like with Sharks, and jumping out of airplanes and stuff. But yeah. Hey Des, welcome to my desk. -[Des] Oh hey Zack! How's it going? Nice to see you're keeping up the haircut even through quarantine there. -Right! Can't grow hair and brains at the same time. -Hey, have you unboxed the new OnePlus 8 5G yet? -Just waiting for you. -Oh perfect! Well, you know, these video chat features are getting really great on the T-Mobile 5G network. Check this one out I'm beta testing right now. What do you think?! -I did not see that coming! -Do I say, 'Hey let's get started' now or what? -We already said that part. Oh okay. Let's open some boxes then. -Well this should be interesting. The OnePlus 8 5G was built around getting the most features for the least amount of money. And in my opinion it's currently one of the best phones for the price on the market right now. These are the phones we'll be giving away to the 10 lucky winners. So 2 of them are already going to be open...I hope you don't mind. But inside the box we have an instruction booklet, along with a bunch of OnePlus stickers and, of course, we have the OnePlus 8 5G itself, with it's 30 T warp charger. This guy is able to charge the 4,300 milliamp hour battery from 0%-50% in just 22 minutes which is pretty crazy. And take a look at this color it's kind of like a simultaneous rainbow glow along the edges with a gradual gradient on the back. There are a lot of different colors depending on how you look at it. -I bet you can charge your car with this. -Des, you should tell us more about this 5G stuff until I get this phone turned on. -Awe man, with T-Mobile the first and only nation-wide 5G network, we've got both low band and mid-band spectrum. We've got 2.5 gigahertz coming over from Sprint. Love having these two great companies coming together. The network's just going to get better and better over time and we've got great features. Like T-Mobile Tuesdays, and Netflix on us. You're going to love it. But you know what I want to know, what's one of you're favorite new features on the OnePlus 8 5G? -One feature I like about the OnePlus 8 5G is that it actually has an IP rating this time around...which IP68....meaning that it should be water-resistant. As you can clearly see, the screen is still on. I normally don't do water tests so this is kind of fun. And yeah, we'll just let it marinate for a little while. There are 2 colors coming out and the other one is Onyx Black, so I want to take a look at that and see what that color's all about. The same stuff is in this box...you know, the stickers and the warped charger. But we're here for the phone. This is the Onyx Black version, and it's, you know, black. But it does look like it has an almost metallic shine to it. It's more of a glossy version and not so much of a frosted matte version like we saw on the OnePlus 8 Pro. If you remember, the OnePlus 8 Pro at 120 Hertz refresh rate. This guy, the OnePlus 8, still has a faster than average refresh rate of 90 Hertz, which is on par with the gaming phones out there right now. You can see the difference between 90 Hertz and 60 Hertz when you're scrolling or playing a game. The 90 Hertz is able to produce a new image faster, which makes for a clearer image overall and could be easier on your eyes if you're on a phone a lot. The OnePlus 8 5G is a 6.5 inch 8 bit screen. But since we're giving this one away, I probably won't start it on fire or anything. -Do it! There's nothing wrong with a little unboxing with fire right? -We got to leave this phone undamaged. It's got a pretty good form factor though. Even with that big of battery and big of a screen, it still just about as thin as a pen. Let's take a look at the cameras on the back. There's a 48 megapixel main camera, along with a 16 megapixel ultra-wide camera, and then a macro camera as well for taking pictures of things up close. So the OnePlus 8 5G costs $699 and comes with 128 gigabytes of internal storage and 8 gigabytes of RAM. And does have that IP68 water-resistance. Let's see if this phone still turns on. I'll find the power button. Oh oops, spilled some. And there we have it. It's still turning on and it's still alive. I'm leaking everywhere. Of course liquid damage isn't protected under warranty but it's still good to have it there. It's nice to have that extra layer of protection. Des, when can people start picking these up? -The OnePlus 8 5G will be available on April 29th in both Interstellar Glow and Onyx Black, with an incredible launch offer. So check that out at t-mobile.com. What about the giveaway Zack? -Well now one of the phones we're giving away has your little footprints all over it. -Woop, sorry! -So the rules of the giveaway are down in the description. We are using a gleam link and it is going to be on social media. The gleam link is there to verify all the steps. You'll just be following me, OnePlus, and T-Mobile on Twitter or Instagram. You'll get one entry for each. And if you're already following, don't worry, it'll still count you. -Nice! And don't forget we're doing a whole bunch more giveaways over on the T-Mobile Tuesday app. So if you want another chance to win the OnePlus 8 5G, go ahead and download and enter over there. -Nice. No complaints here. That was pretty easy. -Yeah. Now what? -Well I guess we ship you back to T-Mobile. -Okay. Probably. -Get in the box. The giveaway link is down in the description, and huge thanks to T-Mobile and OnePlus for putting this on. And thanks to Dez for helping me out. -[muffled from inside the box] You're welcome! -Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

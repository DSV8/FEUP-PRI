    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, it's Justine, and we're back with another baking video, and I am so hyped about this one. This one is super festive. I saw this little Santa cake as an inspiration on Google. I googled \"Santa cake,\" and this was one of the first things that popped up, and it's really cute. And I was looking at it, I was like, \"I think I can do this.\" Like, there's really not that much involved. Okay, well, actually, there's a little more involved than I thought. Maybe I should have looked a little bit harder before I started this video. Anyway, let's get started. I was going to make the cake for you guys on video, but I dump cake mix in and mix it up and then bake it, and I didn't wanna do that on camera, 'cause it's actually quite boring. So I already pre-made all of the cakes. Bye-bye, cakes. And if you thought I was gonna make homemade icing... Yeah, no. I even made two red cakes so that we could have a little rainbow action happening. Now, I am so excited because all this week, I'm doing something called Vlogmas where I'm giving away a gift every single day. So check out iJustine.com/vlogmas for all of the ways to enter. Psst, there's also a secret code somewhere throughout this video that you can use to get some extra entries in the Vlogmas giveaway. Now, let's get to baking. Okay, well, the baking's already done. Basically, what I need to do now is color some icing. So let me check my reference, Santa. It looks like we need some red, some white. We've got these little sprinkles, some little buttons on his little jacket. It looks like we need like a flesh tone color. I'm gonna make my red icing first. I don't really have a plan of attack. Also, upon further investigation, it seems like they may have used fondant for some of this, which we're not gonna do. Oh my god, that smells so good. This smells like... (inhales) (smacks lips) 140 calories per serving. 20 grams of sugar. Oh, geez. Wow, geez. (whispering) Geez, that's a lot. Okay, we're gonna put all of this in here. I feel like we're gonna need a pretty healthy amount of red to cover all of this. Trying to do cake math right now. How much icing I'm gonna need. I definitely got extra icing, because I know how these things go. Oh, no. We have creamy supreme vanilla and creamy supreme white. There's a little discrepancy of color. We're gonna be dying this red anyways, so I think it'll be okay. Yeah, look at that. Can you see the difference? Oh, no, stay in there. I think three of these should be enough. I'm just gonna put one more in. I think just one more will... No, no, no. I think that's good. We're gonna make it work. Let's put in some red food coloring. Get this all mixed up. Start you stirring. (mixer whirring) Pour it... Oh, this looks like Dexter was here. We need more red. This has gotta be super red. Wow, this looks great. This consistency is beautiful. No one should ever consume this amount of red food dye ever in one sitting. (mixer whirring) That looks beautiful. Oh my goodness. This is a great... Oh, come on now. This is a great consistency. Okay, all right, let's give you another mix. (mixer whirring) Let's just pour it all in. Just see what happens. Get in there. Go to your home. It's definitely still pink, but we did use an excessive amount of red food dye, so I think this is gonna be good enough. Looks good to me. Icing, check. This is where it's gonna get fun, because we're gonna do a couple layers of the cake. Bring out our trusty little Spinny McSpinner. I haven't done this in so long. I'm so... I'm rusty. I'm like a rusty tea kettle. All right, I think we're gonna do white, red, white, red. This is a nifty little cake leveler, if you've never seen one before... Pretty freaking cool... That saws the cakes evenly. Look at this, look at that, look at this. What do you know about cake sawing? This reminds me of the \"Westworld\" episode when they cut the scalp, and then they just lift it up and they're like, \"Oh.\" (tool squeaking) First little piece is ready. This is like our little mortar for the cake house that we're building. Now red cake. (cake landing) This one's thick. (pan clattering) What happened to you? (tool scraping) There's this guy on TikTok that I watch. He cuts down trees, just chops 'em down. I feel like him right now. Wow, oh my god, that is so red. (laughing) Ho ho ho, wow. (gentle bright music) Do I open a bakery? Do I quit everything I'm doing? Is this my calling? Hello? I'm here. (bright festive music) Mm, it's beautiful. It's beautiful. Wow, so talented. Another cake coming in. (cake landing) This one's already pretty level. That's nice. But we want them to all be perfectly even, because it really matters. It doesn't matter. I'm just gonna dust it off a little. (music continues) Wow, another impeccable placement. Oh my goodness. Should I play a sport? (music continues) But I get super obsessive about making sure it's perfect. I'm like, \"It doesn't matter. \"You're not even gonna see it.\" But it's just gotta be straight. We have one more cake to pile on here. Now, if I was making this in my actual bakery, I would definitely load on way more icing in here, but I was a little concerned that I wouldn't have enough to complete the decorating, so we're going a little light. Santa's watching his Christmas figure. Okay, here we go. Here you go. Here you go. Mm, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful. Perfect. This is now where we're getting down to the nitty gritty. It looks like there's a little skin flesh tone kind of thing happening on like half of the cake. Oh, god. I don't really... Oh, boy. (exhales) I dunno what's gonna happen. Let me clean up my area, and I'm gonna think about it. Cake is ready. I'm gonna make the flesh colored Santa skin now, and then we're gonna ice this thing up. So we're gonna put some icing in here. We're not gonna need too much. We're gonna... I don't know. I don't know. Ooh, this may be a little too red. What if we add more yellow? Maybe Santa has frostbite. There's some more white in here. We'll just... Maybe we can use that to even it out a little. I feel like we might need a little yellow, just a little. That's not a little bit. (laughs) That was actually quite a lot. Whatever happens with this, we're sticking with it. (bowl clanking) Okay, that works. Even if it doesn't, I don't care anymore. This works for me. We gotta get decorating. We've got our red icing here. I think that I'm still thinking too much about this, and I'm just gonna go for it. We're just gonna do it. I'm so nervous. (laughs) All right, so half of this is gonna be his little hat. I'm just gonna ice up the sides and hope for the best. Ooh, quick save. That was a save. That was a save if I've ever seen one. This is way more difficult, not icing the whole cake, 'cause usually, I'll just go like this and then put it down the sides, but we gotta save that other side for Santa skin. (music continues) My arm's getting tired. No, get back on there! Okay, so things are going pretty well. I'm starting to get super obsessive about it, and I need to stop, because I will be here all day trying to perfect this icing. Just one more. Just one more round. One more round. Okay, good enough. Good enough. I'm gonna... We gotta draw the line somewhere. The line has been drawn. We're gonna try to fill this part up here with Santa's little face. I feel like it's actually turning out not bad. And this also doesn't have to be perfect, because this will be covered up with the white icing. Okay, it actually doesn't look bad now that it's on here. Just hoping I don't smear it into the red too much, or we're gonna be in trouble. Have yourself a merry little Christmas. Yeah, I think that's good. Look at that. Look at that. Yeah, that's great. Okay, I'm not touching it. It's good. I'm happy with that. Now we're gonna get the white icing into the piping bags and go to town. Oh my God, this is actually... I'm pretty excited. Okay, it's been a while since I've used piping bags, so I don't even know what's gonna happen. This could be like not the right icing for it. We're gonna find out, though. Gonna find out real quick. Oh, no, I wasn't ready! So it looks like they just put some little splotchies around here. Okay, that's not that good. That's not... I don't know my technique. It's not bad, actually, now that I'm taking a step back. (bubble pops) Ah, air bubble. That's problematic. (playful music) My wrist hurts. Okay, there we go. Okay, yeah, that's nice. That's very nice. I think I might need more icing. Oh my gosh, I just don't even know. I don't even know. Oh, I'm stressed out. I'm stressed. This is working out way better than I thought it was going to. All right. Oh, boy, this is so scary for me, 'cause this is like the main thing. (music continues) That's nice. Yes, beautiful. (music continues) That might be a little too big. It's a little aggressive. Love to see it. And then he's got one big poofy right here. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we like that. We're so close. Now I gotta make the beard. I already have the icing in here, but I need a different tip, hmm. So this is the beard tip, so maybe I'll just do this into this one. Don't tell Rosanna I'm doing this. She would probably be offended. (laughs) I feel like this is something that you should not do, but it's working. Maybe I taught her a trick. Look at that, Ro. What do you know? A lot more than me. Starting to fall. Oh, shoot. Shoot. Okay, I gotta get this beard taken care of very quickly. (laughs) I have no idea what I'm doing. If you're like, \"Wow, Justine, you look like \"you know what you're doing,\" think again. Okay, okay. And he's got like a little mustache situation happening here. And then we'll just fill this in with a little moment like that. That's nice. Looking at what they have and what I have, we're pretty close. I think now, I just need to put the little eyeballs and the buttons. We've got a little problem happening here. It's starting to kind of run down the side. Ooh, I better do this quick. Okay, we gotta sort through here, get out the buttons. So, there you go. One... Oh, these actually work out perfect. These are great. Beautiful. Beautiful. And his eyeballs, maybe right there and right there. Oh my gosh, it's great. It's so good. Look at that. Ta-da! Absolute talent. So here's the final cake. I'm actually really excited how this turned out. This, I don't know what happened here. I think the icing was a little bit warm, but all things considered, I think it's very beautiful. This turned out really, really well. I know there are some things that I could have done a little bit better, but that would've required me to be here all day working on this cake. We did a good enough job. Good enough for me. Now let's cut into it to see how the little inside turned out. Let's see what that looks like. (gasps) Wow, look at that. The layers, the consistency. That's beautiful. That is art right there. I do feel like if I were to ever do this again, I would definitely get a lot more icing to put in between. But all things considered, I think it turned out pretty good. Let's take a bite. There is so much red food coloring in this thing. (doorbell rings) I think I'm getting a package delivered. Should I offer him some cake? Okay, this is really good. I mean, I had no part in what this tastes like because it's basically a boxed cake and icing from a can. Dude, this is incredible. Like, you can't go wrong. Mm, so good. Well, thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video.

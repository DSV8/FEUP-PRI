    "transcript": "- That's right, we've got the Genesis GV60 and this car is fantastic. Not as fantastic, the look. To comment on it, we have the owner of a successful fashion business and online personality, Linus Sebastian. - I don't think it's that bad. I don't know, it has kind of these cool lines along the top of the windows. I think the wheels are cool. I mean, the grill is probably unnecessary, it is an electric car. But I think the headlights are pretty cool. What? - In all seriousness, though, in a vacuum, I think the GV60 is a pretty good-looking car, but unfortunately, it is not in a vacuum. This is the same platform as the IONIQ 5, one of just the best-looking EVs on the market. And Genesis's whole line looks fantastic, in my opinion. And this one just kind of falls flat compared to them. This line, why does it go to there and then this way, and, ugh, maybe you like it. Moving around to this side, we have one of the worst things on this car. Genesis, you are not trying to get on the cover of a sex spec magazine in 2002. You do not need 21-inch rims on this. Now in fairness, these do look pretty good. They come with the performance model. But it just kind of makes the whole ride sort of (rumbles). There's so much harshness from the road that could just have been avoided by having 19s on it. And honestly, the suspension in this is not good enough where you're going to want the trade off. Over here, we have one of the strangest things about this car. This is a facial scanner. So you can walk up to your car, facial scans you, unlocks it, get in. Then there's fingerprint readers on the inside that allow you to just boop, go away, drive away without any keys at all. It's very cool and, unfortunately, I wasn't able to test it out because it was set up for some other journalist. Hmm. The trunk is a bit of a sore spot. It does have this thing where you stand back here for three seconds and it opens, but, as you can see right now, it doesn't always work. Also, reaching down here to get this, it's not too bad, but it just doesn't work great. The worst part, though, up along here, water collects while it's raining and it creates a little waterfall. It doesn't fall into the trunk, but you have to go through it to put your stuff in. It's ugh. Also, while the trunk itself is large enough, this is probably the worst cargo cover that I've ever seen. You have to do that if you wanna use it, instead of attaching to the lift gate, and it's just, I don't know, kind of janky. At least you are able to easily put down the seats. I haven't actually tried it yet. There's... Oh, (groans) there it is. You can't do it from the trunk. That sucks. One nice thing about back here, though, big old spoiler. Love it. (chuckles) Now, here's the charging port. This thing is good for 350 kilowatts of fast charging. That is frigging rapid. Now, 77.4 kilowatt-hour battery, which is good for just under 400 kilometers of range. I think, though, that's more than enough for most of your daily stuff. One thing that's been the case in a lot of the cars that we've had lately is white interiors, and I do not get it. Please, just buy a black interior. This thing was cleaned this week, proper detailed. It is filthy in there. I have no clue who can keep this clean, but it is not me, that's for sure. (boots thudding) I'm trying guys, it's not possible. Oh, gross. (laughs) Hopping into the back seat, these are extremely comfortable. There's plenty of leg room, and if there isn't, you can move the passenger seat forward and back. There's enough headroom. There's a little area where there's enough. You go back, you hit it, you go forward, you'll hit it a little bit. Anyway, just stay here, you'll be fine. These seats are very comfortable. They have heating, they also have charging, heaps of storage, and a nice little armrest. Oh, one thing we have to take points off, though, manual peasant blockers. Nothing spoils a fancy vehicle like having to do this yourself. (blocker snaps) Nearly forgot about it, but this is our frunk. (hood clicks) I really hate that when EVs first started becoming a thing, we were all promised that all cars would have frunks. And now, these days, it feels like, yeah, no one's really done much with that idea. (laughs) You're not putting anything in there. Hopping into the driver's seat, this is a very nice spot to be. Now, these seats, it took me quite a while to get comfortable. I sort of have to be leaned back and the headrest is out a little bit too far. It's pretty clearly just designed for someone that's a lot smaller than myself. And given this seems like it's very squarely aimed at elder millennial women that are rich, I think that's totally fine. Now, one of my least favorite things in here is the steering wheel. It is very plush, incredibly squishy, but just. (leather squeaking) Ugh, I don't know. It just squeaks all the time. Every time that you move your hands, it's just like. (leather squeaking) Oh, it's terrible. I hate it. The party piece of this interior, though, happens when you turn it on. Watch this. (button clicks) The gear selector orb flips 180 degrees to reveal the gear selector. And then when you turn it back off, it flips back around. Is it a complete gimmick? Yes. Do I like it? Also yes. This is the sort of thing, strange EV stuff can go into two categories. In 10 years, everybody will be like, \"That was stupid.\" And in 10 years, people will be like, \"Look at this strange thing they did. I love it.\" Overall, the quality of the interior is very high. There might be some plastics around, but the finish of them is very nice. Lots of other stuff is very soft to the touch. And overall, it just looks and works really good. Now, there are some bits that are not fantastic. So the climate controls here, it's sort of half a screen, half a little knobby chum. It's fine, but it isn't dreadful like some of the stuff that we have seen. Also, there are dedicated media buttons down here, but it's a little bit too much of a reach to get them, so I just end up using the knob here. But that said, knob works great, so just use that. One thing that's absolutely hilarious, in order to change the mirrors, there's this little knob over here, which works perfectly fine. But on the passenger's side, you get this ultimate, little drug compartment. Look at this. The stuff you could stash in here. What were they doing? (chuckles) Wait, is this supposed to be for perfumes? Okay, maybe don't put your weed in there. Also kind of interesting, the glove box just slides out. Doesn't really matter for the functionality, but it's kind of nice. This shares the platform with the IONIQ 5, and also, the stupid way you connect your phone. So heaps of storage here, there and there. But for whatever reason, the charger for your phone's down here, so you need a long cable that you have to plug in there, bring it up around to in here where they do have a wireless charger, for some reason. It's clearly where you're supposed to put your phone, but Android Auto only works with the USB plug down there. All right, let's go drive it 'cause that's where this thing really shines. Just like I shine at segueing to our sponsor. Thanks to Secretlab for sponsoring today's video. Secretlab chairs are engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play. The TITAN Evo 2022 chair keeps you feeling comfortable for longer. It has four-way lumber support, an ultra comfortable line of different seat materials, and more. All chairs come with up to a five-year extended warranty and a 49-day return policy. Head to the link in the description and check out Secretlab today. (upbeat music) As I said before, this thing is stupid fast. Now, normally, you get 430 horsepower, more than enough. But you press this boost button right here and it goes up to 483. (water bottle thuds) Oh, my god. Zero to 60 in this thing, 3.8 seconds. Holy frig, this thing is fast. Oh, it actually slams you back. Lttstore.com water bottle just got thrown. I need to go secure that. (cover thudding) Seriously, this is one of the most hilarious cars I've ever driven. It's just like a mom soccer wagon, whatever, but, oh, it's actually like, you can nauseate your passengers. It it is one of the quickest cars that I've ever been in. And just look at, oh, my god, I love it. (laughs) The most hilarious thing about this is that you can turn off traction control and it proper just turns the front tires into smoke. Tesla model Y, nothing on this. Not even close. That right there, the nannies immediately come in and they're like, you're having fun, you shouldn't be doing that. And this right here, it's like, hmm, do you want to do a front-wheel drive burnout? You can. Now, this thing is kind of weird. It's somewhere in between very comfy and plush and outright performance monster. In corners, it's also very far from a slouch. It does have a fair bit of body roll, but it just grips the ground in a way that I feel like only EVs are able to do with their super low center of mass. It is very huggable, even if you don't quite have the level of feedback through the wheel that I would really want. That said, compared to something like the G80 that had a very clear target demo where it was just outright comfortable. You're driving down the road, it's very quiet, very plush, just an incredibly nice spot to be in. And also, IONIQ 5 N will be coming out soon, which again, if you want performance, that's what you go for. This right here, it's just kind of weird 'cause I don't quite know who this is for. And I really wish they had just taken it all the way to being super comfortable. That said, I do really appreciate how much of a sleeper this thing is. Is this the most hilarious car of the year, Andy? - [Andy] Oh, yeah. - Yeah, this is an absolute hoot. I have my own custom drive mode, which is basically just sport mode, but with the comfy suspension, and it is just so huggable. (laughs) The whole thing's just like (whoops). If they had just made it a little bit more plush and just said, (beep) we'll give them all the power in the most comfy vehicle. Who cares if it really goes around corners? (laughs) You can just do burnouts, it wallows around, who cares? Now, one of the things that I feel prevents this from really entering the upper echelons of super comfy, nice on long road trips cars is the sound system. This right here is the Bang Olufsen one and it's fine. Now, possibly the worst thing about this sound system is how you configure it. Now, you know how every single person knows what bass, mids, and treble are? Here, they decided you don't need that. It's a lot easier to have warm, bright, energetic, relaxed. I think only audio files describe stuff as bright or warm. Fortunately, I have kind of figured it out. So energetic is a V curve, more bass, more treble. Relaxed, less treble, less bass. Bright, more treble, warm, more bass. And we found that the most neutral that we could get was relaxed, four notches over. The worst thing about the sound system is it's staging or complete lack thereof. Instead of a feeling like you're surrounded by speakers, it sounds more like you're in a empty room with an exceptional Bluetooth speaker. It's just kind of like sound. It's not coherent. (upbeat bass music) One thing that B&O could have done that would take this to the absolute next level is to have different impulse response profiles for it when the sunroof is open and closed 'cause it is quite a big problem when you have all the sound bouncing all around and confusing things. In the end, you're left with something that, even though it does smoke $40,000 car sound systems, doesn't really live up to an 80 grand one. Oh, and the most disappointing thing, it has an infinite baffle subwoofer in it. That is a really cool way to do it that should deliver extremely clear bass. And this guy is passing us on a double yellow. That is super illegal, dude. Anyway, an infinite baffle subwoofer is when, instead of having your subwoofer in a box or something, you have one side that's on the inside of the car and the other side that just vents to atmosphere. There's an actual hole in the wheel well of the back left tire where it just, sub pushes the sound out that way. This, in theory, delivers much cleaner and coherent bass, but in practice, I don't know if it's the reflections or just how big this is, but it all just sort of mixes all together, and I don't know. Looking at the graphs, when you compare it to our target curve, there's some real weirdness around 100, 200 hertz. And it's too bad 'cause it obscures kind of the low-end and the high-end. So your bass just sort of sounds more like (rumbling) instead of like boom, boom, boom. Ah, it's doing a U-turn here. And one of my least favorite things about this is the turning radius. Parking this, even despite having a really good 360 cam, is a lot more difficult than I would like. What is great, though, is the infotainment. Everything very easily controlled by this knob. If you don't wanna use the knob, the touchscreen also works really well. Android Auto goes all the way across. And yeah, it all just works well. One thing that's hilarious, though, in all of these, the voice memo app is one of their favorite things. And just, who really wants this? - [Concerned Citizen] Oh, yeah, how's it going there? I heard that down in Outer Battery, they have lights on, they're way too hot and everyone's complaining. - One thing that's kind of strange about this, it does have a one-pedal driving mode. So that means you hit the gas to go and you let off the gas to stop. I absolutely love it and it's one of my favorite things about EVs 'cause I feel like it gives you a connectedness to the drive that you just don't get in an automatic transmission. Problem, though, it just turns it off all the time for no good reason. So you start the car, one-pedal driving not enabled. You need to click it here on the pedal to turn it on. Then, you put it in reverse, turns it off. Then, you put it in park and start driving again, one-pedal driving is going to be turned off. It isn't really a big deal 'cause, again, all you have to do is press this little paddle here, but it means that every single time that I get into the car, I forget to do that and overshoot the first stop sign or stoplight that I go to 'cause it just starts creeping forward and I don't expect it. I don't know why they did it. It just doesn't make sense. Now, I do feel like I've been a little bit hard on you, Genesis. This is an absolutely fantastic car, and I think I'm just being hard 'cause I want it to be as good as it can be. 'Cause, again, you guys are kind of leading the EV space right now. Tesla drivers just got so (beep) mad. (laughs) I just feel like I've spent a lot of my time just nitpicking things because this is an exceptional car. It just smokes what? Mach-E, destroyed. Tesla, in many ways, it's better. I trust the driver assists in this. I'm not going to spend an extra $10,000 so that I can get killed on the highway. Let's beta test some software on the open road. That's a great idea, ha, ha. But seriously though, at 80 grand for the performance version, this thing is not cheap. But at the same time, what other grocery getter has nearly 500 horsepower? This thing is an absolute hoot to drive. And I just really appreciate what EVs are doing where they're just taking regular, what would be a very boring car, and just giving it. (engine revs) Oh! The sort of performance that can murder supercars from a couple years ago. I do really like this thing, Andy. I tried to not like it and I was not able. That much power, man. If you guys liked this video, hit like, get subscribed, and just have a fantastic, old day. I'm gonna use the boost mode a couple more times. Woo hoo.",

    "transcript": "So I have this digital piano. Or keyboard. Or whatever, lets not get hung up on the nomenclature. Ivehad it for about 5 years - Im no professional pianist but I do enjoy tickling thosesynthetic ivories from time to time, enough to be bothered by a keyboard without weighted keys. But it also didnt make sense to spend lots of money on some ultra-lavish thing because my level of piano proficiency would waste such an instrument. So I got this. Hold on, I just gotta boot it up. Windows XP startup sound Thats right, its still No Effort in November, and this pianas gonna learn us a thing or two about user interfaces. Andthen well talk about some other stuff. Being the most basic model in Yamahas Ariusline, this model is pretty basic. I mean, its even got a manual transmission as youcan see by the presence of the clutch pedal. That was a joke. Those are just your normalpiano pedals. Except of course theyre not real, theyre just switches. But theyre notbinary inputs either. And also this piano handles the sustain pedal in a surprisinglywrong way which Ill show you in a bit. But anyway, like most keyboards this thing offers a fair degree of customizability with things like key sensitivity, a slew of reverb options (which are annoyingly always on by default) different voices so you can pretend youre an organist or a harpsichordist or annoy your friendslike this. iPhone Marimba ringtone That voice is a vibraphone and not a marimba but whos counting? Oh, it also offers a built-in metronome and some other stuff. Its a pretty fully-featured if on the cheaper side instrument. Look at the controls, though Hi! Ive now edited the video and while I kinda thought this would be the case, uh I just wanna make sure that you know... Yes, Im aware you can't see the keyboard at all from where the camera is but remember what month it is. So. Just keep that in mind. Look at the controls, though, and you find there basically arent any. Thats one of the concessions you make when you buy the cheap one. Over here you have a power button and a volume control - an actual potentiometer, even! But, uh... thats it. Over there you have a single button labeled Grand Piano Function. Im glad it can at least dothat. And, uh, well now were out of buttons. That doesnt seem like enough. Apparently thisthing has a bluetooth radio in it because of course it does and theres an app you can download for your phone to control things because of course there is but all I can say to that is gross. Oh but it does have an integrated key cover! Fancy! I was perplexed by how the heck I was supposed to control this thing to change is settings, but after staring at it for just a little while I thought \"oh\" [said by a woman's voice coming from the piano] Thats right, theres a whole 88 other buttons sitting right here! Theyre just piano-ey. Yamaha rather smartly designed this thing an awful lot like a computer keyboard and this button here is your modifier key. Like Alt. Or Control. Or Command. Or Windows. Or Function. Press it once and it will revert back - someone got mad at me for saying revert back so I said it again! Be careful what you wishfor - it will revert back to being a standard piano from whatever function it was in. Or at least a facsimile of a standard piano. But if you hold the button down and then press one of the keys - well, now youve done who knows what. Like started asample song. The Entertainer begins to play Oh good. Cant have a piano that cant play the Entertainer. Side-note. [ding] I think Scott Joplin gets a bad or perhaps incomplete rap for being the ragtime guy. Yeah, ragtime as a genre has a veryparticular sound, but it doesnt help that just about the only three pieces anyone everhears are The Entertainer, Maple Leaf Rag, and sometimes The Easy Winners. Maybe Pine Apple Rag,too. Basically everything that was in The Sting. It also doesnt help that people like to play these pieces ridiculously fast because,well, Maple Leaf Rag played ridiculsouly fast I mean its very fun. But have you everheard the second section of Solace? Bet you weren't expecting a piano recital now, were you? Or the Magnetic Rag (a personal favorite of mine?) Appreciation for ragtime and indeed for Joplin seems to come in waves and, well, maybe were overdue for another one. Anyway, Yamaha gives you a cheat sheet so you dont have to memorize all of these. They are grouped to help make this a little more obvious, though, and theyve put the most-likely-to-be-used functions at the very bottom (selecting voices) and near middle C (the metronome). Although, using the metronome is probably the most clunkyexperience of this scheme, as you enter your desired beats per minute using these keys. [apre-recorded voice reads Six. Five. One. Two. Three.] You can then have it read back toyou the set speed. [sixty-nine] Nice. Then you can turn it on or off and also adjust beats per measure and volume. [One. Two. Oh. One hundred twenty. On. [metronome begins ticking]] It does work, but honestly youre better off just using an external metronome. This probably isnt the only keyboard in existence to use its keys in this way but it nonetheless delights me. Because its avery meta take on a user interface. Every piano, going back to the days when we called it thepianoforte (or fortepiano if you like that order better) has some version of this keyboard. Andwhat are the keys themselves but a user interface? Even an acoustic instrument of strings, mallets, and dampers has a UI and the keyboard (and pedals) is that. Using a simple modifier button to turnthat centuries-old design into a parameter-setting tool for the digital copy of the thing the designcomes from is just I dont know exactly but wow! Outside of the UI thing, the evolution of digitalpianos like this is just a fascinatingly w e i r d blend of new technologies built into and around a very old interface but the goal of each new development is to make it seem to behave exactly like the acoustic version it emulates. Its like engineering specificallyfor nostalgia - each step forward is at the same time a step back and I love it. I - Justthink of what this thing is actually doing. When you get right down to it, this is a really weird machine that calls up a pre-recorded sound sample of a real pianoproducing a single note the moment you push any one of these buttons. They just happen to be shaped like piano keys. Then it plays that sample through a pair of loudspeakers. Thats just reallygoofy when you think about it, isnt it? But, if you press the buttons in the right order [Third part from Solace] you get music. But then again I suppose thats exactly what happens with a real piano. Anyway if you cant tell thinking about this too hard makes my brainhurt. I mean, its just a skeuomorphic nightmare. So lets talk about some of the things weve done to make fake pianos fake it better. The earliest digital keyboards were basically sound-sample-caller-upper machines and not much else at all. In fact it might nothave even been a sound sample or even digital, it could have been synthesized. But thatsa horrible substitute for a real piano, especially if the keyboard doesnt have some kind of force detection. Which early ones didnt, and so each note sounded at the same loudness with every press. Now this isnt to say that early piano replacements werent cool in their own ways. Electronic pianos certainly have their place and brought new and interesting sounds to the world of music. And lets not forget the earlier electricpiano though thats an entirely different beast. And there are so many other weird concepts out there like the mellotron which is an analog sample-caller-upper but again,different beast. Im solely talking about the continuing work to faithfully mimica real piano in both sound and function. To that end, we pretty quickly developed keys that could determine how hard they were pressed by way of velocity detection (basically eachkey has two switches at two different depths and it just determines how quickly thekey moved between those two positions to work out how hard you pressed it). Thatwas combined with new software which would alter the volume of the played sample basedon that. This allowed the player a similar degree of expressiveness as before andbrought the forte back into the piano. But thats not great, either. Just playing thesame sample at different volumes isnt actually a good approximation of what an actual pianoactually sounds like actually. In a real piano the key pushes a mallet into the strings and the forceof that strike changes not just the volume but also the timbre. Softly-played notes are mellower and not as bright as keys gettin smashed. So to add realism, digital pianos and keyboards startedincluding multiple sound samples of every note, recorded at different volumes on a real piano, thus allowing for approximating that timbre difference. How hard you press the key now determines not only how loud to play a sample but also which specific sample amonga set !! should be played for that note. And what about how to stop playing the note? Mostkeys on a piano lift a damper from the strings when you press them and replace the damper whenit is released. Thats why a note continues as you hold the key but stops when you release it. This piano does a simple quick fade-out of the sample when the key is lifted, which honestly isclose enough. However, the sustain pedal (the one on the right) allows the player a very importanttechnique. In a real piano, this pedal lifts all the dampers from the strings meaning every notewill continue so long as the pedal is pressed. This digital pianos sustain pedal isnt just an on-off switch and mimics partial-pedaling, where the dampers are rested slightly on the strings which quiets them somewhat but not completely. [loud chord is played, then suddenly gets quieter but doesn't stop] This may not sound veryimportant but trust me, it is. Oh, and speaking of the pedals, I said earlier that this piano gets the sustain pedal wrong. Heres how. If I were to play a loud chord withthe pedal depressed, then play the same chord again quietly but keep the keys held down withmy finger thingies, releasing the pedal shouldnt do anything because Im holding those virtual dampers off the strings with my fingers. And yet [loud chord, soft strike on top, then it suddenly gets quieter] Can you hear that? [same sequence] That is very wrong, and I cannot believe Yamaha screwed that up here. Though in fairness theyve only been making pianos since 1900. It seems thelogic in the piano reset the keys sustainedness status on the second press and dampered the firstloud sample that was started on the first keypress when I released the pedal but again, that isvery wrong and not how it should work at all. Though, in fairness, I actually only recently discovered this so its not that bad. Interestingly, though, this was handled correctly with the middle pedal. Which is great because nobody ever uses that one! Plus lotsof pianos dont even have it, and when they do theres no set rule for what exactly it does. Hereits implemented as it often is in grand pianos. Called the sostenuto pedal, this pedalwill lock any dampers that are lifted the moment the pedal is depressed but leave the restalone. Heres what that sounds like in practice. [a chord is played, then all the keys are played rapidly. When hitting the original chord, those notes are still sustained] Hopefully you understand whatsgoing on here its not super easy to describe with words and if youre not familiar with pianos this might be baffling but in any case if I do the same thing as before and then lift the pedal, [loud chord, soft chord, then no change] now it correctly lets the original loud sample continue on until I actually release the keys. Im thinking if they got the middle pedal right, somebodyjust forgot to put a line of code somewhere for the other one. Oh, and the pedal on the left is known as the una corda or soft pedal. In a nutshell it just makes the piano a bit quieter while its depressed. A bit like this. [he said softly] OK, so thats about as far as this particular piano goes when it comes to the reproduction ofsound, but of course theres also the fact thatthese keys themselves are weighted to mimic the feel of a real pianos keys. Theyre evenprogressively weighted more heavily towards the left side of the keyboard just like a realpianos bass notes because big hammer make key go slow. But this is actually a prettybasic key-weighting system as things go. They only get more complex from here, and somedigital pianos go so far as to implement actual, real piano actions where a real keyboard movesreal hammers that hit force sensors so basically its an actual piano except the strings havebeen replaced with sensors and a computer. Remember how I was saying digital pianos are a fascinatingly weird blend of new and old tech? Yeah, those so-called hybrid pianos are the epitome of that sentiment. Then of course theres polyphony. That word means a lot of different things depending on context and itsconfusing so Im not gonna touch it. To end I want to talk about some of the other wild stuff that folks like Yamaha are putting into their highest-end digital pianos. Real pianosare much more acoustically complicated than a mix of sound samples played in the right order. Oneof the most basic things this keyboard is missing is sympathetic vibrations. With the sustain pedaldepressed and all strings free to vibrate, hitting any note will induce some vibrations in thoseother strings, particularly those with harmonic frequencies shared with the original note. Thisadds a richness to the notes played with the sustain pedal that this piano is not reproducing, at least Im not noticing it, but others do. As you go up in price with digital pianos thesedays, you not only get the niceties like real wooden keys and actual piano actions if you want, oh but hold on if youre buying one of these digital \"grand pianos\" just dont. I dontunderstand how people find this impressive and not objectively goofy. But anyway, over-the-top casesaside, new software modeling allows these instruments to not only account for sympathetic vibrations of other strings but also the acoustic profile of the pianos soundboard and woodencase. Combined with better and more powerful audio systems, were at a point where digital pianos are realllllly close to their acoustic counterparts. There are still reasons to have an acoustic piano, to be clear, but there are also a lot of great benefits to these. Perhaps chiefamong them is that they dont weigh hundreds of pounds. Thats nice. Also very importantto me is that they dont lose their tuning. Oh but on that note, I only recentlydiscovered that this piano allows you to play two voices at once. One of my gripeswith it is that its not a very bright sounding piano with its main voice, andthe brighter piano voice it does offer doesnt sound that real to me. Well, in a happyaccident, if you select both piano voices it puts the bright piano an octave up and makes a surprisingly nice change to the sound. [arpeggiations] Whats more, if you adjust that second voice backdown to the original octave, you end up with a detuned sound. [a detuned sound as notes are played] It's not quite honky-tonk, butmore like a parlor sound, which I personally find great for ragtime. I hope you enjoyed thismeandering off-the-cuff look at the world of digital pianos. Its by no means complete, andthere are many rabbit holes you can fall into if you want, so sorry if I sent you down one ofthose. But for now, as Mozart would say, toodles.",

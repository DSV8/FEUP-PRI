    "transcript": "hello you people hope you're excited today is gonna be awesome my neck feels much better let's begin so we have the new crystal 280x from Corsair oh I got the black one you know I love me a good mic right X enclosure I think Fred would agree but the Corsair 280X is not entirely new because it's based on the air 240 frame design they have made some modifications on the interior and on the exterior as you will see but before we get into the case review I want to discuss an important topic so we got contacted by the Canadian men's health foundation to talk about little ways that we've improved our lifestyle that has overall benefit our health one of the most important things for me has been to prioritize the time so actually find the time to go to the gym twice a week for the last five months and yeah I can finally do pull-ups the proper pull-ups which is how I hurt my neck but yeah don't overdo it I've also started taking cold showers because the boost your immune system and great for the muscles and let's not forget the food I have cut out my favorite staple of all the potatoes and let's not forget cucumber water it's super easy to make it's refreshing it's hydrating it's good for your internals why not now this whole idea of don't change much campaign is awesome because it's all about the incremental little changes that you can make in your life now the benefit you overall in a long term so two hours a week for me the workout is not a significant amount of time but I feel better I have more energy in from the camera I can write faster boom so don't change much that's the message check out the links below for more information now let's go back all right good people so the system is now assembled and the entire experience has been extremely satisfying and I really hope to see more dual chamber layout cases in the future because this whole thing of moving your hard drives and the power supply to the back of the case instead of a bottom chamber it's sure it widens the case but in terms of actual like height the case it is significantly smaller than your other micro ATX cases and you know looking at something like this in next to the Leonie PCO 11 you can definitely see that both them share that dual chamber layout and are therefore extremely compact cases when compared to standard mid towers now design wise this is part the Crystal series which means it is loaded with glass panels the front the top and the side I do like the front glass panel how it sits on these like pegs at the bottom it is not removable you have to remove the entire front panel in order to reach the dust filter and that fan mount while the top one is mounted via these really long thumb screws and there you can access it dust filter as well which I don't understand why it's there because this is tough for your exhaust anyway so why would you have a dust filter there especially because you have a piece of glass in the top you can further remove the top plastic piece which I don't understand why but yeah it is separate from the frame itself now the glass side panel has the worst mount seriously I'm not sure why Corsair is doing this there are no pegs that hold the glass in place so mounting it and removing it is super difficult it always just falls on the table and it scratches furthermore the glass has no blackout perimeter so you can see the frame underneath and the good thing is they've changed are the rubber pegs that are actually kind of built into the glass mount so they don't fall out like we saw on previous Corsair cases the i/o is basic in the top right corner we have 2 USB 3 power reset buttons and Jax now the 280x comes in two flavors the standard addition at the hundred and ten dollars it's a little bit pricey for micro ITX enclosure sure there's a bunch of glass and two fans included but the RGB edition which has to RGB fans and a lighting note Pro that's already pre-installed at the back which is very nice and you can control the lighting of those fans and you can connect other lighting accessories from Corsair is a hundred and sixty dollar Edition so it's a little pricey for micro ITX market but I guess it is all Rhenish anyway so it doesn't hurt to bump up the price for that premium now for airflow you can install two 120 or 140 s at the front at the top and at the bottom so plenty of airflow options here however the case is not really tall enough to suck in any air from the bottom although that section is dust filtered which is nice you can install a 240 rad at the front the top or the bottom as well so radiator options are plenty there for options of plenty however this whole like glass approach you know the glass here is not separated enough from the frame so the front especially like it's is gonna get choked up and the top here sure it is exhaust and if you can set your fans to a low rpm it's not an issue but the gaps here are just not high enough in my opinion so it would be nice for them to raise it a little bit and looking at the temperature data so the system runs cooler when the front panel and dust filter are removed that's understandable so and this is what the keys fans running at the hundred percent so the Delta here would be even greater with lower rpm but I found it interesting that the GPU temperature is cooler with the stock configuration with the front panel on and the dust filter on not sure why if you do let me know in the comments coming inside I love the interior plenty of space to work in and route to cables however a standard micro ATX motherboard will cover those two rubber grommets so you'll be just left with one unless you go with an ITX motherboard or a non-traditional micro ATX form factor there's plenty of room above the motherboard for a radiator and the set of fans the same thing in the front and here I have mounted my sapphire pulse Vega 56 which is an 11 inch GPU and I still have about 80 mm of clearance from the front so you can left the route rad there and not really compromise your GPU clearance the one thing I will say about this whole bottom section is that it doesn't really make sense for air flow because it's not high enough and number two my motherboard cables are all over the place they kind of block access to those mounts so unless you're going for an ITX motherboard that is significantly smaller and allows that clearance at the bottom the only then you could use those fan mounts now coming to the back I'd love how much room we have for all the cables i even mounted my giant d quiet power supply we have to drive cages so one for SSDs that has three caddies and they pull down so if you have any cables that are right there it might be a little bit difficult but then we have another one that you can access from the back and that has two three and half inch caddies and it's really awesome that both of these cages are removable so you can install things outside the case and then remount them back or just have this entire section clear if you don't need that area for storage as you can see cable management is absolutely flawless I do like how the top rubber grommet that is covered by the motherboard still has a little bit of clearance so you can pass some cables through it but the other one is actually a really good position for the 24 pin cable and those SATA cables too now with my cooler mounted in the standard orientation I wish that we had a slightly more open rear exhaust section because you cannot mount any fans here that space is just too little so it would be nice to have a slightly more open section so airflow can simply exit which is why I left the top exhaust fan to kind of aid with this whole air flow exhaust situation at the back alright so those are my thoughts for the 280x I really want to see more dual chamber layouts from Corsair and other companies because it just makes assembly process so much easier and while we do have a slight extension in the width dimensions the whole idea of like compressing at height wise I would say is a greater benefit than going for something slimmer and much taller and you know the O 11 air and dynamic are quite popular because of that exact direction but with the compromise of not having the best CPU tower clearance with this micro ATX direction I don't think that's a big compromise because the case is already quite small so if you're going for something of a CPU tower clearance then you have to stick with something that is below 150 millimetres or go with a standard 240 ohm on cooler at the front or the top I will say the price point is not competitive sure the micro ATX market is quite a niche market and you do get a fantastic building experience on here but going with a simple mid tower that's like 69 bucks 79 bucks that will give you all the same features in terms of the build quality and you know the visual aesthetics - like the mesh if I see the P 350 X and many others but again those are ATX cases and I feel like for micro ATX direction there aren't that many specific micro ATX cases that could compete with something like this but then you could also argue that buying a standard mid tower and then populating a micro ATX motherboard inside has benefits of cost savings for sure one of the best gaming headsets is now available through mass drop the PC 3 7 X has fantastic drivers incredible comfort and the best microphone in class plus they look awesome for a gaming headset check out the drop link below now I would love to hear what you think about the crystal 280X let me know

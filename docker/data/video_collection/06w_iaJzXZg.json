    "transcript": "so today we've shopped like the Z and it's quite a depressing smogus Board of crap we've got here this isn't all of it I still have a gaming chair and a gaming Monitor and they're branded as gaming stuff this entire table worth of crap including the chair and the monitor was like $500 Canadian dollars so yeah a good deal for a whole gaming setup but before we check it out today's video is sponsored by corsair's brand new third generation of rmx power supply I've always loved the rmx power supply suppes but this new generation adds some needed improvements like full ATX 3.1 support and my favorite feature these new rubberized stock cables which if you kind of squint look like they're sleeved cables but aside from looking better they're also more malleable making them easier to work with and it's got manual fan control M so treat yourself to a kick-ass power supply using the link down below [Music] now starting off with the ergonomic wireless mouse because they don't have a gaming mouse now I have quite high hopes for this mouse that feels like it's made of air uh which is a good thing people want that these days and considering how legendary the kind of basic Microsoft mouse was I'm sure this thing's going to be amazing ooh that's a nice touch it comes with a battery that's very exciting it also has a little hole for us to store our wireless receiver in and aside from not very much feedback on the scroll wheel it's reasonably clicky and it's got shoulder buttons which I use a lot so that's very useful next is the mini USB condenser microphone so we can get some crisp vocals for us to shout at people on the internet with a little swiv bit and then here is our little condenser microphone with a mute button now considering that this is a condenser mic which tends to be more sensitive to background noise and stuff combined with the low stand makes me think it's going to have a real problem with things like keyboard noise and Rowdy roommates I also got some Bluetooth wireless onar headphones little charging cable that's very short so that you can't charge it while you're using it that's a nice touch now unfortunately this isn't a gaming headset it's more the kind of thing Jeff would wear while commuting on the bus as we know he does that a lot but I'm sure it'll still work for gaming yeah I mean it it feels like on ear headphones they they're always quite uncomfortable but there's a reasonable bit of noise blocking I'm I'm struggling to hear myself so that's good whoa the charge port is hidden under the hinge so even with the longest Cable in the world wired operation was never an option I I was kind of assuming from XXL that it was going to be a desk mat as opposed to just a bit of an awkwardly sized mouse pad but but we do have lots of room for all of the low sensitivity 360 no scope flicks we're going to do all this stuff has a real e-w peripheral vibe to it this looks like every e-w peripheral keyboard I've seen in my not very long life medium long life oh yeah M that's good this is keyboard it's it's very much just keyboard uh it's nice that it has a num pad so all the XL enthusiasts will be happy with their Amazon Basics keyboard and honestly that's probably what this thing most is used for is just for people typing in spreadsheet numbers yeah I mean that feels like it was just pulled straight out of a Dell pre-built box it may be the same manufacturer it's also not got any adjustable footies on it so no incline for you wao that is an obscenely thick user manual for our for our headset oh it's it's in a whole bunch of languages okay never mind cuz bilingual thickness isn't nearly as impressive as lingual thickness now these are the computer speakers and it's quite promising this is the heaviest box so far why are these packaged like this just put them in the box like why do you have to suffocate them with a plastic bag I guess the Amazon basic Packers like playing manslaughter or something now these remind me a lot of the speakers you used to get with PC p s way back in the day like with a compact system except for the fact that they're not That Hideous beige color which just turns grosser and grosser with time instead they're the now very thematically consistent hideous black plastic interestingly you have to plug them into a wall outlet which if vibrator logic applies to speakers these should be real powerful and you also get a volume knob which is very exciting I'm surprised to what extent all the weight in them is in the cables but these may be okay they may be fine I'm I'm sure they'll be terrible and then finally of this batch is the adjustable monitor stand and this may be one of the useful accessories we've got going here this thing feels like they made it out of the same plastic that they wrapped it in just kind of with more density in fact oh yeah that's a that's just build quality right there now in terms of adjustability you've got two settings this is the the base one it's the flattest there arrows pointing in in that direction so do I um what why do you have to slide it in the opposite direction that the arrow points for it to come out that is that's wildly misleading and then you get slightly more elevation but then there's a third setting which you get to by pulling this out and putting it in the other way around then it's slightly higher oh this is some high tech plastic manufacturing we've got going on here I'm sure it's going to make a great addition to the Pacific garbage patch in a couple months when this inevitably breaks and then when you have your monitor on it you can also hide some knickknacks under it okay let's go make a [Music] setup oh wow that already looks wildly terrible but we still need to get our Monitor and gaming chair ready to turn this into a complete [Music] setup there's a hair on it that's pretty gross but aside from that that is not as butt cheeks a stand as I was expecting I thought it was just going to be one of those like flat ones I'm going to have to be very careful building this chair because I have a pretty dodgy history with building gaming chairs on this channel what is the point why do you want your chair to be able to do this so I need to make sure that the seat goes on the correct way around okay now is that really so hard just putting a big red arrow labeled front on it although those welds are shocking it looks like I did it it's looks a little bit like it was built by me look at that stapling work oh that is a hard se but aside from the shocking craftsmanship assembly was very straightforward I just had to do up some bolts and soon I was rewarded with chair that's hard it's also quite leaned back which which it doesn't like very much you can see it's going to fall over and as far as I understand there's nothing you can do about that because it's it can just go up and down that's as high as it'll go wow this is a rubbish chair and then all there was left to do before we could try out our new setup was plug everything in and the question the setup immediately raised other than where did they find all this terrible black plastic was the scale of it all this is not a comfortable Mouse for me because it it feels like I'm just swallowing it with my hand this is designed for people with very very small hands the armrests are way too low I feel like all of this stuff is designed for really tiny little people because they have to be so short for these armrests to make sense this is a weird position in terms of chair I'm not sure why this is what they decided on as the only setting so this is something that you need to bear in mind when watching this video is that a lot of what I'm going to be complaining about is very preference-based and if you think that it's a stupid complaint maybe it won't bother you but having just made that disclaimer there were a couple things I was immediately excited about ooh an exciting thing about the keyboard it has dedicated volume buttons uh even though we don't really need it necessarily because speaker wise we've got a volume knob going but the immediate standout from the crowd was the monitor the monitor is surprisingly good how much does this display cost on Amazon Canada it cost $200 Canadian and for that you get a surprisingly good display 1080p on a 24in display gets you reasonable pixel density and it's got an IPS High refresh rate panel that gets 100% srgb color space coverage and look at that color accuracy that's amazing and you can really tell while using it the display looks very good motion rendering is very nice it's honestly way better than I was expecting so I've spent the entire afternoon gaming on this Amazon basic setup and one of the things that always gets me about this kind of thing is the extent to which you can get used to pretty much any peripherals although I'm pretty sure you can get used to being waterboarded if it happens to you enough so I don't know if that really means anything and uh even having gotten used to it a lot of this stuff is terrible the mouse for example I really wanted to like but it feels like aiming with a drugged elderly cat being real slow and heavy to respond to inputs the shape makes my hand cramp for some reason I don't know if it's because it's so tiny but it just is really uncomfortable to me it also tends to to ignore inputs and behave erratically with fast changes in direction again not unlike said drugged cat but it was the same for the keyboard I felt like with both of them it it it sometimes ignored what I was doing when it comes to the keyboard it's usable uh but it's got an issue that I have with pretty much all of these e-w peripheral keyboards there's something about the alt and Windows key placement that means that about 50% of the time I'm trying to hit alt I hit the Windows key which is really bad while gaming it just throws you out of the game and gets you killed now moving on to the headset this headset is a complete Abomination and maybe the worst headphones I've ever used for gaming not only is their wireless connection spotty so they just drop signal every now and then they also have no ability to create directionality in the sound honestly I would rather play Escape from talkov with no audio than with these on because you just hear the footsteps kind of rattling around in your head here's a clip where you can clearly see the weird audio signals baiting me to change position getting me killed and then there's the weird dynamic range issue where everything's either whisper quiet or super loud so you can't turn the volume up to hear The Quiet Things cuz otherwise it'll shatter your eardrums on the loud things I hate these headphones they're terrible which meant for the majority of my gaming I used the desktop speakers which were actually I guess maybe it's in comparison to the headset but they were better than I was expecting once I figured out that the the volume knob one needs to be on the right which is countered to all of the pictures on Amazon's website for some reason uh but once it's on the right you can actually use it in a game like escape from Taco yeah they were generally a decent bit less offensive than I was expecting but their cable situation is a nightmare so they're very difficult to place because the cables walk the speaker around a bit so that's pretty annoying especially considering how directional they are you really need to point them straight at your ears now moving over to the m micophone the cable that it shipped with was broken but once I replaced that cable it worked okay so this is the microphone test they're both recording now uh I've put the microphone on the desk where it it belongs I guess this is the this is the closest you're going to get it to your mouth uh I'm comparing it to my lavalier mic which isn't an amazing mic it's supposed to be more kind of convenient than super high quality so there's no gain knob on it but there's also no Auto gain okay so with the microphone a much more kind of normal microphone distance from my mouth this is what it sounds like again compared to the lavalier mic uh so this is a test of noise rejection so I'm going to try and keep my levels the same I'm going to speak at the same volume but turn the microphone around so that we can see when the microphone isn't facing towards the subject how much levels you lose it's not massive but it's a little bit quieter on the back it's not massive but but it's a little bit quieter around the back now when it comes to things I liked I've already spoken about how good the monitor is but yeah it's really good I would happily game with this thing every day it's a little bit ugly but for the price it really has got it where it counts it's even got a decent stand now when it comes to the chair I I don't like it very much uh there's no padding the only position that you have is just not good like this this is such a it's like a half recline but it isn't really a recline there's no adjustability it's it's not a good chair it feels like it's going to break very quickly it makes my back sweaty and hurt the mouse pad is fine I guess but it's a dumb shape for how big it is so I had to hang some of it off the bottom of the desk so that it didn't get in the way of the monitor stand now when it comes to the monitor stand it's a very flimsy bit of plastic that you put a monitor on it functionally does what it says so I can't be too hard on it but I feel like it's it's barely A step above just putting your monitor on a box or some packaging it it it doesn't look nice it's not like I I I don't know but I don't think any of this is a surprise to any of you I don't think any of you clicked on this video thinking that this stuff isn't going to be garbage in fact I think they should rename it from Amazon Basics to Amazon ew aside from the display it's a surprisingly good display which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching bye-bye oh [Music]",

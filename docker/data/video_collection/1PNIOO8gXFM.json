    "transcript": "- Can you really trust someone who leaves a one star review? Well, today we're about to find out. We're going to spend a little bit of time purchasing some of the worst reviewed items from Best Buy, to find out are they actually great? or are people trying to warn you? and you should listen and not walk toward... I'm sorry, let's check it out, shall we? So after a surprisingly short wait we have all of our items in from Best Buy. Ken, do you have any idea what we're looking at today? - [Ken] No. - Cool. This is the CAT S62 Pro NextGen thermal... Wait, what? That's a thermal camera? I didn't see that on the listing. - [Ken] Oh, oh, oh! It's the, oh, like caterpillar. (engine humming) - [Austin] Yes. - [Ken] Okay, so this is like a rugged phone. (phone thuds on table) - [Austin] I swear if you break this thing, Oh God! (tripod clinks) you gotta break our tripod. - [Ken] Oh, I like that orange power button. - [Austin] It's got the Pixel style, fingerprints sensor on the back as well. - [Ken] How much was this? - [Jared] $650. - [Ken] 600... that's a lot of money. What do people say about it? - So three of them are about how it's not actually unlocked, one of them is about how it crashes and freezes, and then one is about how the power button fell off. - Okay, so those are some things we can test. Now see, what are this things that you actually great? We're now into the interface. I'll say it's pretty stock looking, like with the standard Android stuff. 128 gigs of storage though, totally fine. (camera shutter clicks) (phone chimes) Okay it did... You're not making that, wait, that's not actually the sound, is it? (camera shutter clicks) No, I just got a notification at the exact same time I took photo. (Ken and Jared laughing) All right. So this is what 4K video looks like on the CAT S62 Pro. You can see it's having some problems with exposure. It keeps dimming and then brightening, but, and also the frame rate, it's seems wildly off. Wow! that is terrible, holy! All right, let's try the Flir app. I'm actually excited for this one. Okay, this is what the video looks like. So you can see that Ken's toasty. Other things I can see in the video mode is that Jared is glowing with a warm aura. We also can see some of our recording equipment is warm, right? So you can't really spot it when you're looking at it normally, but the microphones and the recorder are all fairly warm, and it really pops out around the area. If you swipe down, you can see the actual photo. - [Ken] Oh, that's cool. - [Austin] Yeah, - [Ken] Oh, that's neat, okay. - If you're, you know a contractor or something, you're walking around, you actually can see, you know like, oh, maybe this line is hot, or maybe the the AC unit's frozen up or something. And you can just quickly spot it using the thermal camera. Look, this might be one of the worst reviewed products on Best Buy, but I'm actually kind of impressed. I don't know how durable it is. We have to do a little bit of testing to actually... No, no, (phone thudding on the floor) Obviously it's fine. - [Ken] Can I run over it with my car? - Yes, you can run it over with the car. (Ken laughing) You're good to go. (car engine revving) Just go slow though. (phone thudding on the road) - [Austin] Okay. - [Ken] I felt it. - [Austin] All right, you stopped. - [Ken] Yeah, stopped. - [Austin] I mean... - [Ken] It's fine, right? - [Austin] It's still on. Okay, I mean, it looks like it's in fairly good shape. The screen still works? Yo, that's a pass. - Is it? - [Austin] Yeah, absolutely. - Wait, wait, there's only one more thing we have to do. - [Austin] What's that? - Huh! - [Austin] Oh no. (phone bangs the ground) Uff! That was a very solid hit, but it's definitely still recording. - [Ken] It's just dinged up now, right? - [Austin] Honestly, totally fine. Thumbs up to the CAT phone, huh! (rattling in the box) (Austin laughing) Something tells me this is not packed particularly well. These (Ken laughing) are Google Pixel buds. - [Ken] Can I throw these in the garbage already? - They're not just regular Google Pixel Buds, oh, no. They're Geek's Squad Refurbished Google Pixel Buds. When we were looking at the reviews, they're saying that people found ear wax in them. - [Ken] Oh! - And then they were already paired, so it was like Andrew's ear wax is on here. I know because Andrew keeps trying to pair to Andrew's phone. Jared, how much should we pay for these? - [Jared] We paid $115. - [Austin] They make the Pixel Buds A, which are cheaper than this. It's literally, by the way, it's just packaging tape holding this together, it's not sealed in any way. Surprise, surprise. Oh! I actually see ear tips. - [Ken] Oh, that looks more or less new. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Ken] I can't imagine people that have owned these used them for that long. - But I mean that, there's no ear wax here. I actually don't think these have been used, but if they have, they've been cleaned. Good first sign, I think, at least we didn't get ear wax. I will say one thing. They are incredibly comfortable. It fits nicely in my ears with that little like ear tip. These actually feel really nice though. Let me actually pair them, 'cause they're actually not pairing out of the box. It says it should just pop up if you're using Android. I've got a white light now. That seems like I'm making progress. - [Ken] Just like every pixel product, it's slowly disappointing me. (all laughing) - Oh, wait, hang on, here's the problem. It only sees the right one, it doesn't see the left one. It somehow paired with only one earbud. - [Ken] Man, - What! - [Ken] What a flawless experience. - No, this is not good right now. It's really hard to judge just with one ear and know, 'cause this one left one is just dead. It does absolutely nothing. - [Ken] This is literally the Lance Armstrong of earbuds. (Jared laughing) - [Jared] What? - [Ken] I think only kids from like 1995 will get. - Yeah, it makes sense. You definitely dating yourself on that one, friend. This next one. This next one's for you, Ken. - [Ken] Wait, me? - Yeah. - [Ken] It is? Is this another phone? - [Austin] No. - Wait, it's a camera. - [Austin] Maybe. - Is that a GoPro? (gentle music) (Austin laughs) - [Austin] Stunned silence. - The Kaiser Bass. First of all, what a [censored] name? (all laughing) So this does not shoot MP4 video. - [Austin] Wait, what? - It shoots MP$ video. - [Austin] What? Wait, get over here. Did they hold the Shift key when they hit the number four? (all laughing) Oh, my God. - These GoPro rip offs usually go for like a 100 bucks. - [Jared] This was $70. - So this might not be bad for $70. - [Austin] Boy, (Jared and Austin laughing), okay, he hears that and he goes, Sweet! - The price got lower, and he is like that means it can only be a good product. - Look, I mean, like price to performance, right? Here's the actual camera. - [Austin] This looks exactly the last time I unboxed a GoPro. - It does. Oh, look at this some mounts. We're gonna use this for our GoPro. - [Austin] Our actual GoPro, - [Ken] Yeah, 'cause they will fit the same thing. So there are two buttons on the top and two buttons on the side. They are all the same finish and size, so good luck trying to figure out what anything does. - [Austin] It also has a screen, which is a legitimate feature. - Yeah, GoPros didn't have that for a while. - [Austin] Yep. (Ken laughs) - Now to be fair, the cheapest GoPro on their website right now is $350. It's on sale for $280 right now, but. - [Austin] What's the cheapest GoPro you can buy from Best Buy right now? - From Best Buy, let's see. It's like $300. - [Austin] What! - Yeah. - [Austin] Well, let's fire it up, let's see what if it's actually any good or not? Wait, can you get the micro SD in there, 'cause people are complaining about that in their reviews. - Oh, oh. - [Austin] I don't like those noises. - Oh, why are these ports so bad? Well, the SD card is working. - [Austin] Okay. - [Ken] That screen is terrible. - [Austin] I can't see anything on camera. - [Ken] Viewing angle? Look at the viewing angle on this. It just turns to white. - [Austin] Yeah, I noticed. - Here's the thing, you can get a dash cam for $80 and plug it into a battery bank and have a better camera than this. - [Austin] And strap it to your helmet? - You can. All right, so we are recording using the Kaiser Bass X230. Okay, so I tried plugging in the micro SD card from the camera onto my computer to see what the footage looks like, and we're running into a problem. So, it is just not mounting properly. So I actually had to go into disk utility to see if it even mounted. And it sees it, but it's not letting us open it. It's exFAT too, so the formatting is totally kosher for macOS, but it's just not showing me anything. - [Austin] So when people are complaining about SD card issues, this is pretty clearly the issue here. Jared. - [Jared] Yes, sir. - [Austin] Try this on Windows, see if this actually works. 'Cause otherwise this footage is just gone forever. - Oh, here we go, that's the video. - [Austin] All right. - Just rip the headphones off me. - [Ken] All right. - [Austin] Oh, God, that audio. - [Ken] So we are recording using the Kaiser Bass X230. There's Austin Evans. - [Austin] I mean, image quality looks dash cammy. - [Jared] It looks like there's absolutely no stabilization. - You can do a lot better for $70. You can buy a smartphone for 70, and probably get better image quality. - So, this particular product, I think by far, (box thuds on table) had the worst reviews of anything that we purchased. This is the MSI Aegis Gaming Desktop. Let me direct you to exhibit A, which is, it's old. So it's got Ryzen 7 3700X, so it's a, - [Ken] Oh Wow! older processor. - [Ken] Ancient. - RX 5600 XT, older graphics card, 512 gigs of storage, 16 gigs of RAM. Now this is probably if I were to take a guess, a roughly 2019 spec of a system, that seems like what they would've been shipping then. However, we're buying this in 2022 for the grand total of $1,200 and change. If the reviews are accurate, some of these systems ship with a grave flaw. - [Ken] A grave flaw? - A grave flaw. Power your desktop, flip on your power supply switch, important component. Apparently some of these systems ship without a switch for the power supply, which means that they're completely unable to function, seems strange to me. - Despite the fact there's like the blank for where the power switch would go, there is none. And apparently after plugging it in and everything, they couldn't get it to power on. Just to put it into perspective this computer has 35 5-star reviews. - Yeah. - [Jared] But it also has 83 1-star reviews. - [Ken] Oh, okay. - That's bad. - [Ken] That actually sounds like a worst. - [Austin] And the reveal is, - [Ken] Oh! - Oh my God! - [Ken] Wait, really? - Yep. - [Ken] Really? - No switch for the power supply. - [Ken] Oh my God! - [Jared] Wow! - [Austin] No switch for power supply. You're right, there's like a little blank where it should be. It's a Delta 540 Watt, 80 plus bronze. - [Ken] They couldn't afford the bronze sticker, that's OK. - It's just, yeah. If this power supply works, this is acceptable. Although the price to performance is still gonna be whack, no matter what. All ready to fire it up and see if this thing actually works? - [Ken] Yeah. - Here goes nothing. Three, two, one. (button clicks) (soft music) - [Ken] Op! Well. - Okay. Well, power supply is power supplying clearly. Pretty quiet too, actually. - [Ken] Those RGBs look nice. So, what they look like from the front? - [Austin] Can see a little bit from the front. - [Ken] Oh yeah, look at that. - [Austin] There we go. It's firing right up in the Windows. - [Ken] Wow! - I mean, it's still weird that you don't have a switch on the back of the power supply, when the instructions clearly tell you to turn on the switch for the power supply. But. (box thuds on table) We have one more item that actually goes with this, Ken, I think you'll be especially excited for this one. - [Ken] Will I? - would you consider yourself to be a bit of a keyboard aficionado? (cutter clinks) - [Ken] Oh no! - We bought the worst reviewed keyboard on Best Buy. - Oh Ew! Wait, so hold on. Get the cable out, get the cable out. Damn! That's a wow! I can't believe someone said that's a good idea. So like whenever I get like poster board from like Michael's or something, my first thing that I do is fold it the other way. It, well. - [Austin] A little bit. - I hope creasing it doesn't break it somehow. I mean, I know it's flexible but I don't know if you're meant to like. - [Ken] Well, like, - Like, it's not paper. - The worst case it doesn't work anymore. The best case is it doesn't work anymore. (both laughing) - What do we think about this MSI system? If you get one of these and it's DOA, that's obviously really unfortunate. You're better at buying a scalped aftermarket GPU than buying something like this. - You can buy this. - [Austin] Yep. - This, for almost the same money. - [Austin] I mean... Yeah, that's a better idea. It's just too expensive. - Don't buy this scrap. - Don't buy that. Definitely don't buy that. Holy! Ken, this right here, this particular item was one of the best named products I've ever seen on bestbuy.com. This my friend is the Prestige Elite 10QH. - [Ken] 10 inch tablet. - [Austin] The Visual Land Prestige Elite 10QH quad core Android tablet. Okay, you'll see the tablet itself which is impeccably high quality. Actually what It's looks like. - [Ken] Oh no! Don't, that's not high quality. - That's, I'm being sarcastic. The fake leather tablet. - [Ken] Oh, that's cute. Wow. - [Austin] Some high quality accessories. - [Ken] This looks like I'm gonna write about all my past boyfriends. - Ken, we don't need to talk about that right now, okay. You have therapy for a reason. Does that have magnets? How does it attach? - [Ken] No, of course not. - [Austin] Wait, but how does it attach them? Show me Mr. Prestige worldwide. (Austin laughing) It's so easy to just take your tablet off and use as a tablet real quick. - [Ken] I never said it was easy, I just wanted to do it because I don't trust you. This does not secure on. - [Austin] I know. - How does, how do they expect you to...? what? Oh, you know what? - [Austin] Oh, oh, oh, I hate the noise. Oh! they just expect you to lean it on them. (tablet thuds on table) Nope. (all laughing) - [Ken] I think they, I mean that didn't work, but I think that's definitely what they were banking on. You just lean it on like that. - [Austin] Oh yeah, my super comfortable typing experience. Oh wait, let me just touch the screen. Oh!",

    "transcript": "-[Zack's conscience] Hey dude, you told everyone last week that you would make a sun guzzling electric vehicle using lasers. -Did I really say all that? -[Zack's conscience] Yeah. And now it's this week and it's time for you to deliver. You better have some major lasers. Look, they're watching. Don't mess this up. -Welcome back to the military Humvee electric vehicle conversion. I'm super surprised that I didn't know this until yesterday, but Japan actually made their own imitation military Humvee It was manufactured by Toyota. And this is real and it was called the Mega Cruiser It had the same transmission tunnel, about the same size, and even had portal axles down by the tires. And I'm sure the Mega Cruiser was pretty great with its 280 pound feet of torque, but that's still going to be peanuts compared to the over 800 pound feet of torque that my electric Humvee's going to have. Today we're going to mount that electric motor, along with all of the drive train components. It should be pretty fun. Let's get started. [Intro] We've drawn up motor mounts for all of my electric vehicle components in a free program called Fusion 360. Taking measurements of the hummer frame and trying to use as many bolt holes as possible from the previous components that we removed earlier, because the less we have to change, the quicker and easier it is to get things mounted. But how do we take those computer designs and transition them into reality? The answer is with lasers. You thought I was joking, huh? Right now I'm inside of a giant industrial laser from a company called OSH Cut, which is conveniently in an area close to where I live. This thing behind me is a 10 kilowatt laser, which means there are over 10,000 watts of light focusing power that can slice through over inch thick slabs of metal pretty easily. This video's not sponsored, I just think it's pretty fascinating and I'm going to show you how it works. I can take my motor mount designs, throw them on the website, and have them cut and sent to me the very next day. It makes prototyping projects like what we're doing pretty simple and pretty quick. We're talking 3.3 million times stronger than your little laser pointer at home. One example of how all this works is we have a model of a Tesla Cybertruck right here, you know, laser cut right out of metal. We can take this design, throw it on OSH Cut's website, pick which metal we want like brass, stainless steel, aluminum. We're going to go with stainless steel since that's what the Cybertruck is actually made of. And in less time than you've spent listening to me talk, the laser has finished cutting it out, and can box it up and ship it out the very next day. Like I said, makes prototyping pretty quick and easy. If you want a laser cut Cybertruck of your very own, I will have the design for this down in the video description for free. All you have to do is pay for the cutting and the shipping. And, of course, you'll have to bend it into shape yourself. Now, let's get to the big stuff my motor mounts. I decided to go with 304 stainless steel for my motor mounts since that's what the Tesla electric Cybertruck is made from. And it's just, you know, a little shinier than regular steel so it'll match all of my electric components. The aesthetic aspect of stainless is kind of cool. Luckily OSH Cut keeps a lot of cool material on hand so I can pick pretty much any metal that I want to for my motor mounts. It'll make more sense how all these pieces get assembled in just a second. As you can see, the laser is cutting out flat sheets of metal. But in order to make our metal mounts a little more structural we can add some bends. And OSH Cut has a machine that does this as well. The piece you're looking at here is the motor shelf. And this piece is going to help support the motor from behind. The laser gets directed through a fiber optic cable to the head of the machine where it gets focused onto the surface of the metal in a super fine line. The laser is capable of cutting through one inch thick pieces of steel and aluminum. The head of the cutting machine accelerates at 1.8 G's, which is about the same force that you would get in an F1 race car. It gets a lot of work done really fast. The nice thing for me is that my motor mounts are relatively small and OSH Cut isn't charging me for the full sheet of metal since they can divide out the pieces of metal and reuse the scraps, which is a win-win for everyone. One of the reasons stainless steel is used a lot in medical equipment is because it doesn't rust, and it also doesn't become brittle in super cold temperatures. So if for whatever reason I was driving my hummer around on Mars where it is super cold, my motor mounts would be just fine. The finishing machine takes the stainless steel and suctions it to the rubberized belt, kind of like a reverse air hockey table, and slides it through a bell sander along with a couple pairs of drum sanders which deburr the sharp edges and give a clean finish to the metal. We cut hexagons into the platform for the inverter. This decreases the weight of the metal while not decreasing too much of the strength. Then we make our way over to the press brake. The press brake is a massive machine that can bend full sheets of metal with the force of about 150 tons. If you're American, that's about the weight of 60 Ford F1 50's. We're bending the metal for multiple reasons. One, we need it to fit the shape of the hummer. And two, bent metal has more strength than just flat metal. With everything laser cut, cleaned off, and bent, it's time to install it in the hummer. So welding this up is kind of fun. We're using stainless steel so when it's underneath the truck it'll always stay shiny, cuz stainless steel doesn't rust. And we're using something called TIG welding to put it all together. With TIG welding we have a couple different steps. We have the electrode here, the grounding clamp which is attached to the metal table, and the electrode...take a look at this. The electrode has a tungsten tip and it's called a non-consumable electrode, which means that we can add any amount of filler material that we want. Because as the arc is generated between the electrode and the stainless steel plate, the temperature gets hotter than the surface of the sun, which melts the stainless steel rod I have onto the stainless steel and creates a bond between the two materials. TIG welding, which is what this is, is much more difficult than MIG welding which is the type of welding that has the wire feed and all you do is press a trigger and you're basically done. With this setup there's a lot more variables to control. One, you have to control how fast you're feeding the filler rod in, and two, there's a foot pedal that you have to press to control the amperage or how hot it gets. In order to get a good arc, the tungsten needs to be ground down to a super sharp point. Which is probably hard to see on camera, but it just makes a more controllable weld. So this is going to be the plate that the inverter sits on in the front of the Humvee And since there's nothing structural going on with this, I think I'm going to try a few welds myself. [Welding sounds] Not too shabby. I do think I'm going to stick to just the cosmetics welds though. [Sanding sounds] Joining up the EV torque box with the UQM electric motor, I'm using alibdimim grease which is a super extreme temperature resisting grease, which allows the spline shaft to enter into the torque box and mate smoothly. Because the tolerances are so tight, if there's not some kind of lubricant between the two, it makes insertion fairly difficult. Stainless comes in a lot of different finishes. This is called a mill finish which is what it looks like straight out of the mill. And as we've been welding you can see it's kind of discolored a little bit. The discoloration is oxide from the heat of the welder. [Sanding sounds] But once you take a wire brush to it or wire wheel, it can take the color right back to the mill finish that it had before. We are taking special care to use a brush made out of stainless for procedure because if we were to use a regular brush, it might leave little bits of steel inside of this stainless and that would rust and we're trying to avoid that. Some welders are able to control the color coming off of the weld and it makes some super cool pieces of art with it. But since we are just making motor mounts, we're going to keep everything the same color. So remember how I said everything needs to be rubber isolated? Well we have these little bushings that are just going to sit right inside of here on this motor mount. And this is what the frame is going to connect to and support the motor to keep it rubber isolated. [Hammering sounds] Now for this one. [Squeaking sounds] So we ended up getting the torque box attached to the UQM 220 Plus. It was a very difficult experience. I didn't film a lot of it, but we did reach out to the manufacturer and they are going to change some things with this junction. So hopefully no one else has to go through the same things we did. Either way, this is still the best match up since peanut butter and jelly. And we are going to throw it in the Humvee There we have it. The motor is in place. We have the rubber bushing on this side and this side to keep it from tilting left and right. And then we have the rubber mount here to keep it from tilting forward and backward. And it's a pretty low profile too. You can see all the way through the dog house, but my favorite thing is over here. This is about eye level where I will be driving. And inside the dog house, which I'm hoping to make like a clear covering so I can see everything in action. Because as we know, transparent technology is the best technology. Now let's get the inverter in place. Remember, that's what's going to change our DC power from the batteries into AC that the motor can use. So we did cut the hexagon pattern in here to save weight, but also because it looks cool...kind of like my JerryRig Knife. Link down in the description. And the reason we have an AC motor instead of a DC motor is because with AC we can use it as a generator when we're going downhill, and put power back into the batteries. Pretty cool. So the inverter is now in place with a stainless steel mount. We have the motor and torque box in place with their stainless steel mount. The only thing we have left is the transfer case which does the 4 wheel drive and its stainless mount. -[Neighbor] Oh you're impressive. You need to tell my wife about this, you're so cool. -So here underneath the Humvee we have the old transmission mount that was sitting where the transmission would sit on top of and we're going to reuse those same four bolts for our transfer case. But we do need to drill two more holes on each side because our new stainless mount has 4 holes on each one. [Drilling sounds] It's interesting that the original bolts come from the outside of the frame and stick through. But our bolts are going to go through the inside of the frame, and rest between the body and the frame of the Humvee It is pretty easy to take the body off of the frame, and by easy I mean I think it's like 6 bolts. So it would be easier if we came in from the outside like AM General did way back in the day, but I think we'll be just fine going in the opposite direction. The shifter for the atlas transfer case isn't a park or drive situation, it's more of a high and low. You know, four wheel drive and not four wheel drive situation. There are two shifters. One controls the rear wheels and one controls the front wheels. Independent front and rear controls are pretty fun and I'll have to show you more, you know, when this thing gets rolling. But once I have the shifting cable situated at the base of the transfer case, routed in a circle up around top, and inserted into the bottom of the shifters, then I can get the cables screwed into the bottom of the shifters and we're good to go. This is a temporary setup at the moment. I do want to laser cut a stainless steel plate for the top, but at least now we can see everything is working. The forward, reverse and neutral shifter will probably be more of a button here on the dashboard. One thing to keep in mind as well is that the atlas transfer case is a synchronized unit, meaning it won't always be able to shift if the hummer isn't moving. Sometimes it takes the wheels spinning just a tiny bit to get the gears to line up so it shifts into place. Speaking of rolling, let me show you the driveshafts. Driveshafts are what connect the motor to the transfer case and the transfer case to the differentials. Without them, we're not rolling anywhere. So if you remember from the tear down video, these are the driveshafts that I ripped out of the old Humvee, you know, all those parts over there. This is the one that went from the transmission to the rear differential to around the rear tires. And this one went from the transfer case to the front differential to run the front tires. Now, look at the size comparison with my new driveshafts. These had to be custom designed because of the massive torque that my electric drive unit is outputting. Bigger shafts for a higher workload. Inside the u-joint, which is these little guys here, we have to be a little bit careful to make sure these never fall off. Because if this falls off and hits the ground, each of these little needle bearings could go everywhere, which would be hard to clean up and restack inside. We'll have about 815 pound feet of torque coming off of the torque box, and this should be able to handle it. And it's not just the peak torque, it's that it's instant. It's ready to go right off the bat with the electric motor. With regular diesel or gas powered engines, it takes a while to build up that torque and the driveshafts don't have to be as big because they don't have to be immediately ready to take it all. The parts that connect the driveshafts to the components are called yokes that allow for a little bit of angle adjustment and can just bolt together. I like this shot from underneath the hummer. We have both the tires, the front differential, then we have our electric motor here with the driveshafts heading to the transfer case. The transfer case can let the power flow out through the rear differential to the rear tires for rear wheel drive, or it can send power to the front differential for front wheel drive. Or all four at the same time for four wheel drive. My electric military Humvee should be able to handle anything that gets thrown its direction. I think my view from the driver's seat is going to be pretty sweet, especially if I get that clear dog house cover built. With the drive-line done we're making good progress. I think in the next video we're going to do the 12 volt system which is what powers, you know, the headlights, the power steering pump, all of the basic accessories that don't need the high voltage. When we start working with a high voltage things are going to get a little more intense. Huge thanks to OSH Cut for laser cutting all of my motor mounts. If you want your very own Cybertruck, I'll leave a link for this down in the description. The design itself is free and I'll leave instructions for the rest. I'll put the design for the baby Cybertruck down in the video description as well. With the code I'll include it'll be about $20 to print and ship the small one. And about $60 to print and ship the big one. Right now OSH Cut is only shipping inside of the USA. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. You definitely don't want to miss what's coming. And leave any questions down in the comments and I'll try to answer them for you. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.",

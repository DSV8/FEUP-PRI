    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to \"This Is\" We looked at tech from Home Depot, but now we're gonna look at it from their biggest competitor, Lowe's. - Is there a bucket of keyboards we have? - Sure is. - Oh my god, he got a bucket again! He did the bucket again! What's in the bucket? (slapping) - We're gonna do it right. So, first off, we got (item slamming on desk) Whoa, that was loud. - Okay, that is loud. This is the ToughBuilt Reload Utility Knife with blade magazine. - You ever wanted to feel like you're firing a device, but still don't wanna have a device in your hand? Well, we got the utility knife for you. - It's got a quick eject magazine and you've got utility blades, as well as hook blades. How often (swallows) do you need to change your utility blades? I have a JerryRigEverything Knife here, which also uses utility blades. It's quite nice. I basically never change the blade. - They call me Bond. James, Bond. (knife clacks) Ejecto seato 'cuz. (knife clangs on table) (laughing) - Wow. Okay, So... (object whipping through the air) (crashing) So, essentially you have a series of blades in the magazine and then you've got yourself the ability to load them up and then you just fire it up. I will say that I don't use a blade often enough that I need this 'cause I can make one blade last me months, and months, and months. - That's because I do all the work around here. (abrupt synthesizer) So we have the regular blade. All right, let's get that down. Let's ejecto seato. (knife clacks) Now, quick change hook blade. - Oh, I didn't understand exactly the logistics of just why not change the blade, but if you could just pop the magazine out and swap over to a different kind of blade, that makes a ton more sense. Okay. I apologize Mr. Lowe's, this is a cool product. (garbles) Maybe don't fidget with it too much, Matt. - If you take the blades out. - Yeah. - This is great for any of your kids. (boom) (distant laughing) - What? - The Baby Shark alarm clock and Bluetooth speaker. - It's a sound machine, wireless alarm clock, and it plays the \"Baby Shark\" song. I'm not entirely sure how this relates to being sold at Lowe's, a home improvement store, but sure. - Hi, I'm Baby Shark - Oh God. (crashing) At bedtime, half an hour before the set sleep time, Baby Shark clock will close its eyes halfway, indicating that it's time to get ready for bed. - We're just gonna do it right now. You ready? - Yeah. (upbeat music begins) Baby shark do-do-do-do-do-do, baby shark do-do-do-do-do-do Baby shark do-do-do-do-do-do baby shark Mommy shark do-do-do-do-do-do Mommy shark do-do-do-do-do-do, mommy shark (sharp inhale) - I'm not gonna lie, this actually doesn't sound bad at all. Hold on, let me set my bedtime. I'm gonna set it up for, like, five minutes from now. - I'm gonna take a nap now. - I don't know how to set this. It's not... - I'm sleeping, Matt. - Wait! Ah! Oh! - I'm sleepy. - Oh! You wet the bed. - I'm grumpy and I need a nap. - You wet the bed. You wet the bed. - You better change my diapey soon. (yells) (glass shattering) (yells loudly) (upbeat music begins) Baby shark do-do-do-do-do-do, baby shark do-do-do-do-do-do - Works like a dream for putting babies to sleep. Yeah, I'm gonna listen to a actual music here. - Oh right, it's Bluetooth too. I knew that. - Yeah. - It's not just \"Baby Shark\". (cheerful music) That sounds really good, actually. (cheerful music continues) - This thing is actually really good. - I'm impressed with the build quality. I actually think it's a cool little gimmick. The eyes are disturbing, but, you know, what else is new? How much was this, Matt? - I have no idea. (laughs) I bought 'em, but I do not remember. - [Producer] 30 bucks. - [Austin] $30? - [Matt] 30 bucks. Your phone's looking a little dead. - It's so, so dead. - So dead. We gotta charge that bad boy up. On Lowe's, we have the Juice Wireless dual wireless charger from Helix. - This claims that it is a folding design with a dual 10 watt wireless charger that you can close up, and it looks like an adorable little- - Watermelon. - I was about to say pineapple. (low abrupt synth) Pineapple. - No, it- - Pineapple. Say it with me. Pineapple. No. What did I do? I brought this upon myself. - You summoned it. - You put the pine- oh no. No, Matt, no. No. - Now the pineapple has bared fruit. - Ew! Where's my baby shark when I need it? Don't mind me. (funky synth) So I'm gonna drop this on the wireless charger and it is charging. - What if our phones kissed on the watermelon charger? - They're both charging. So, if this is more than, say, $25, I think it's too much. - [Matt] What have we got? 30? - [Producer] 30. - [Matt] Too much. Too much. (glass shattering) All right, so last time in the Home Depot video, some of you gave me some flack for not having a certain set of devices here, and it's because I got 'em for the Lowe's episode, dummies. All right, first up, we have (aggressive metal clanging) - DeWalt. The job site Pro X One true wireless earbuds with charging case. And you know that it is built for professionals who are gonna spend all day on the job site because it's yellow, and that's easy to see when you lose it in a pile of mud. - Woo hoo. This case is not for the pocket. (soft click) Oh, that was not good. Here we have, like, an example of compared to Air Pods. Little chungusy of a thing. - It's not even rubber, it's just plastic, And it looks like baby's first DeWalt earbuds. Each earbud is actually, I mean, obviously quite large, but they have both volume up and down buttons on the side which is interesting on each earbud. Matt, do you wanna do the honors of listening to the DeWalt earbuds? - Not really, no. - Okay. All right. So the passive noise isolation is actually quite strong. it feels like- - Can you hear me calling you an idiot right now? - No, I can, but it sounds like my fingers are in my ears. I'm gonna listen to the Home Depot theme song. - That's blasphemous. That's blasphemous. - Okay, fine. What's something that a good Lowe's boy would listen to? (crashing) - So, while Austin listens to that, one thing I gotta ding for these is just how boring this charger is. All right? Because this doesn't look like the DeWalt quality that I'm used to. So, let's get rid of that. We have a DeWalt charging cable. This is one of the best Velcro tabs I've ever experienced. You have a nice braided cable. Good luck fraying your cable here. This is solid. Now it works great for an iPhone. Just kind of pop that bad boy in there. How you doing over there? - These earbuds are really weird. They actually don't sound bad once you, like, kind of give them a minute and you kinda start listening to it. But the sound signature is very, like, inconsistent. Sometimes they sound good and sometimes like- - Well, so the reason behind that, there's actually, I read it in the manual, is because they're designed to be listened to with a jackhammer going. - Oh, it's filling those frequencies. - So, when you kind of, yeah. - That makes sense. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - If you wanna charge those bad boys, what we have here, go ahead and open that bad boy up. - A 10,000 million power power bank. That's a lot of millions. That's 10,000 of them. They're playing in the case right now. - I thought they were supposed to detect when they're in the ear. - This is what they sound like, in case you're curious, in the case. (muffled music) - How much do you think I spent on ordering this? - 70 bucks. - [Producer] The actual headphones are 80 bucks. - What about the cable? - Oh, God. $15? - [Producer] 16. - How about the USB power bank? 40 bucks. - [Producer] 50. - So I was pretty close on all of them, and I don't like any of these prices. Like you're paying the DeWalt tax. - What do you think I paid- - For all the DeWalt stuff? - To get these shipped to me? - Free. - No, no, no, nope, my little friend. - Okay, how much was it? - $80. (laughing) - Why would it be $80, Matt? That's a lot of money. What? - The weird thing about a lot of these places that are not really a online front centric store, is we're so used to like free shipping and all this stuff. The way I understand is there's free ship to store, free ship to home, and then there's ship to home, which is not free. There apparently is no warehouse where the Lowe's stuff is coming from. When you buy it- - Comes from stores. - Most of the time it's coming from a specific store. This is where it gets, wait. I trick the system and I'm going to jail. (police sirens) Every time I would try and buy it, it would say, \"oh, this store near you has one.\" But then that store would call me and be like, \"no, we do not have that in stock. Our system says we do, but we don't.\" I did that three times. So I VPN into another store, and it cost $80 to ship it. - This is a $50 power bank. - Uh huh. - You VPN into a neighboring town's- Internet. - Uh huh. - And then they go, \"sure, we'll take your order.\" And they charge you $80 to ship the $50 item. - Yeah. - How far away was this town that you VPN into? - Like, 10 minutes down the road. - Now that we put that out of the way, let's take a look at this Power bank. - These are the same cables. - I'll just, let me try my Kevlar cable real quick. - If you wrap that around you, legally you are bulletproof. (gunshot) - So, it's a reversible USB-A. - Yeah. - Hold on a minute. This is a USB-A! It goes both ways. Call the secretary of state. What the- - Of all the mystery tech we've ever looked at, the thing he's most excited about- - Call Mr. Lowe's Man. Have him bring us more of this technology. (garbles) I gotta make sure. What if it's a scam and it doesn't actually power? Wait, okay. It's powering right now. I'm gonna flip it. I'm gonna flip it. (phone bings) It does it. (Matt yells) It works. Do you know what? I went from being massively bitterly disappointed to happy for the first time in several days. - So we got you covered for your portable setup. DeWalt's got you covered, okay? - It's very Kevlar-ed. - Unfortunately no more of that from there. What about your setup at home? Did you know? - Yeah - That Lowe's is the place to gamer-fy your life. - They sell R, G, and B devices, and if you put them all together, you get a... Oh no, Matt! not this (Minecraft oof) again. Matt, did you forget that we've already done this? - Sure did. The fun thing about it , it just goes (rubber flapping) - I don't want my keyboard to be that wiggly. I swear if you've seen us unbox this item let me know in the comments blow. - All right, so you got your mobile gaming setup. you're just gonna- - Yeah. - Hacker voice, \"I'm in.\" What about... this is not ergonomic. - I know, laptops. - So we have- - Totally not. - The Tilted Nation RGB laptop stand with USB ports- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa - To elevate your game. - Hold on. That's not the name. - Tilted. - Tilted Nation? What is this? The petition to bring back Tilted Towers? (rim shot) We have 10 lighting modes, four port USB 3 hub, and for laptops, up to 17 inches. (lo-fi music) It has stickers, so you can let her know that you're part of the hashtag #TiltedNation. - Tilted Nation. Can we dim the lights please? - [Producer] Yes. (Matt exhales) - That's some gamer-ness right there. - You got the gamer keyboard over here. But we have one more item that's the RGB Fire Life. The Rip Tunes Raw Energy Sound bar. (cartoonish bonk) - This feels so cheapie though. Like this feels so- - You feel cheapie. - Like, hollow. Yeah, I'm discount Linus. (abrupt violin) - That's fair. - [Sound Bar] Hello, Bluetooth mode. - Yep. - Mm hm. - Yeah, yeah yeah. - Now everyone at the job site knows that you're a true gamer. - Can we blast the Home Depot theme song? (Home Depot theme plays) Subscribe. Subscribe. Ring-a-ling, that ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling. subscribe and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling, yo. - Let us know what other stores you want us to find products from. Like, follow, subscribe, and we'll catch you in the next one. (music continues) (music fades)",

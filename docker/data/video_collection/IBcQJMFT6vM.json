    "transcript": "Which technology allows a switch such as the Cisco switch to forward a multicast only out of ports where there are subscribers? In this example, I've got two phones who have subscribed to the multicast sent by this laptop that's been sent via router1 to router2 which is then forwarding the multicast to the switch but the traffic is only sent to these two phones and not to my PC. On my PC I'm running Wireshark and I can't see any traffic I can open up the stream to 239.1.2.3 and notice I receive the traffic there is one stream of data sent from this laptop to phones but it's not received by the PC. On the switch show igmp snooping groups we can see 239.1.2.3 that multicast is only sent out of these ports. Notice what happens when I disable IGMP snooping suddenly I start seeing traffic on my laptop going to 239.1.2.3 IGMP snooping allows a switch to listen in on IGMP messages sent from a device to its local router and only forward the multicast out of specific ports.",

    "transcript": "in today's video we find out if Intel's new graphics card can do the hardest Graphics in thing rage racing but first today's video sponsor today's video is sponsored by Corsair and their fancy Dominator platinum ddr5 in White NOW aside from the obvious hello epine that comes with these top blad kits they also perform very well you can get 32 gig kits in up to 6200 megahertz speeds in the white version and that performance combined with their 12 ultra bright capellex RGB LEDs make these a great option for any high-end gaming system check out the Corsair Dom Platts in white using the link in the description below thank you Corsair for sponsoring today's video thank you I finally get to lay my grubby little mitts on an Intel GPU for some reason Intel went with a naming scheme that's suspiciously similar to airbuses now I really wanted to buy this Intel Arc A380 but I just couldn't because it seems like Intel allocated like three to Canada and considering that I don't live in Ontario I I just couldn't find one for sale so I ended up reaching out to Micro Center who did get an allocation and they were very nice to send it over so if you do want to buy an Intel Airbus GPU go check out Micro Center thank you wow that is some of the nicer graphics card packaging I've seen it kind of feels like unboxing a very fancy whiskey not that I have any idea what that's like I'm just imagining here so I'm assuming this is like a little RGB to internal USB cable and then we've got a bit of documentation telling us the logo was used with authorization but what about the naming scheme I know that you know they've been out for a while and we knew that they were coming for the last several eons but still holding an Intel GPU does kind of feel like I'm grasping A Relic from an alternate universe it's it's pretty weird it's cool on the side it does say Intel Airbus with not weird catching on fire power connectors and then I'm assuming under there we have the RGB connector thing I really hope that you're going to be able to control the RGB without that because any additional cabling you need always looks a bit weird but this is quite a cool looking heatsink design it reminds me a little bit of older EVGA graphics cards from like the 900 series you know on the front there is some threaded holes I'm assuming this is for like non-saggy mounter things and then the back plate is quite nice I really like the design of it I think it's a cool looking GPU it's not too overstated and it's actually two slots it's not a massive ass graphics card and I like that this the highest end version of the graphics card doesn't cost three million dollars so that's cool uh on the back we have a nice blacked out rear i o Shield yeah that's a very standard rear i o for a modern graphics card to have so it means this is probably not a GTS 450. now when it comes to the ray tracing performance of our little Intel Airbus graphics card the specs are relatively promising because it actually has 32 Ray tracing units in it whatever that means but hopefully what these units mean is that we won't get horrendous performance hits from Ray tracing so with that let's drop the little a770 into a system and see how it performs now I'm going to plug the Intel graphics card into an Intel powered system because I assume it would be the most comfortable there oops I definitely didn't just bump it against the tripod okay turn it on so much lighting we've also got a signal out that's awesome uh oh actually on the note of the monitor we're using I swapped out the ViewSonic display that I've been using for years now with the monitor by NZXT of all people it's one of their new canvas 25f models which is a 1080p IPS 240 hertz display so also curious to see how this Stacks up I'm very interested in Arc control because I want to see what kind of screen capturing options and stuff you have with this Intel GPU that is an odd smell for a graphics card to make wait the driver is telling me to manually set the allocated graphics card to the external GPU not the igpu surely it doesn't expect me to do this for every game right I'm I'm not gonna do that and see what happens just because that would be ridiculous okay and there is a screen capture facility so that looks useful anyway with that let's get to gaming um that is not a very high GTA 5 frame rate is it a 1080p although a very big advantage of not having a super high frame rate in GTA 5 is that you don't run into the stutter Zone damn it's actually using about 95 of the GPU as well the A380 is working it's little it's a little behind off and we're not getting the most frames per second here wow Battlefield 5 seems to be on some interesting drugs here uh let's give it a minute well it's definitely improved but we still get these very heavy stutters maybe dyron X12 has something to do with it so let me switch it to dx11 and see what that does okay so we're in DirectX 11 now and it stopped having seizures it's actually running very smoothly now uh and we're getting quite a high frame rate except for just now we've been averaging above 120 frames per second and then in terms of power drawing temperatures it's actually looking pretty good we're hovering at around 140 watts and temperature wise we're sitting in the low 60s that is with a very low ambient temperature though now I'm really hoping this DirectX 12 stutter apocalypse thing is a Battlefield 5 specific problem because otherwise the ray tracing tests for this video are not gonna go well right after saying that I went and tested Battlefield 5's Ray tracing performance and aside from some of the most stuttery gaming I've ever seen we actually didn't lose that much gaming performance enabling Ray tracing in dx12 so that's a promising start in a delusional way after that very interesting result I tried to get cyberpunk to launch which just refused to Black Mesa also didn't want to launch which I just tried on a whim but luckily Quake 2 RTX was more than happy to play ball it's Quake two time you can see that we are getting hella frame rates almost a thousand but this is without any of our Rays being traced so we do need to give that a shot whoa this is going very well that is a high frame rate for Quake 2's RTX setting and it's it's set quite High here as well but we're well over 100 frames per second this is promising not even just in a delusional way that's good stuff little Airbus Graphics gone next I wanted to try control but epic games refused to download it because it was having a bit of a compatibility kerfuffle with the Intel graphics card apparently the system didn't support any of my other games on Epic Games either luckily a walk around wasn't too difficult I just had to download a bit of software that bypasses the minimum requirement thing which got the game to install but there was one more problem so when launching control it doesn't give you the option to launch in dx12 for some reason so you have to go into the game file and specifically find the dx12 exe that's not annoying at all wow that is running the crap out of control at medium settings moving over to Ray tracing with medium settings we actually didn't lose that many frames per second it's handling this surprisingly well let's see what happens when we Crank It Up To High rage racing again this is very impressive we're still consistently sitting over 60 frames per second despite having cranked Ray tracing settings in control now if only it was less of a faff to get running and I'm not quite sure this balances out what happened with Battlefield 5 earlier but still it's it's impressive so this is fortnite running a 1080p competitive settings it's not a super crazy high frame rate but it's nice and responsive and you know it's difficult to complain when you have 200 frames per second uh there is the occasional stutter but that that's just fortnite things I guess okay let's turn Ray tracing on wait is Ray tracing on I feel like we've not lost any frame rate here yeah it's on it's even like reasonably on I'm confused are settings just not applying or is this thing just a complete Ray tracing Beast I feel like it looks different let's just do epic apply oh okay well setting everything to Epic has just broken the world so I think the settings are applying it's just a beast apparently no I'm not sure if this actually is Ray traced but if it is it's mighty impressive now before we try some Ray traced crisis let me just quickly try and get cyberpunk running again okay it works nice all I did was restart the PC and that seems to have cured it for some reason at 1080p medium settings this is not the greatest result and for some reason the power draw is down quite a bit from some of the other games we're just drawing about 130 Watts on the GPU although I'm not sure how accurate that is not super promising in terms of Ray tracing performance but let's give it a try okay 30 frames per second but in all fairness before we turned medium Ray tracing on we were sitting in the high 40s so we haven't actually lost that much frame rate and at least the graphics cards drawing more power now let's try psycho Ray tracing for the hell of it okay jumping to Psycho we've barely lost any additional frame rate we're only getting about 24 frames per second depending on where we're driving around but this kind of makes me think that once they sort the drivers in optimization out this Airbus is going to be a real monster now I'm also curious to see what happens when we use Fidelity FX with the Intel GPU so I'm gonna put this on quality yo I love that I love that Fidelity FX works on graphics cards that aren't just AMD gpus you know that's really cool what happens if we do like super Fidelity FX Ultra performance whoa that is is shocking that is really crazy looking I love all the smearing behind everything it looks like we're role playing as a VA access sketch now of course we also have to try crisis remaster I did get a driver warning that apparently Ray tracing isn't supported with this graphics card but it does let us turn it on so I guess we'll figure that out in a bit what happens there but let's get into the game and see wow okay at high settings we are getting many of the frames per second okay so the frame rate is kind of all over the place uh we're averaging over a hundred but occasionally it dips to under 60. so let's see what happens if we turn Ray tracing on again it did tell us that it doesn't want Ray tracing to happen so it'll be interesting to see if it lets us turn it on now if I remember correctly visually Ray tracing makes no difference in crisis remaster so we're gonna have to rely entirely on the frame rate to determine if it's on and it's lower so I'm assuming there's Ray tracing happening now okay then finally I do also just want to do the can it run crisis mode I love the fact that there's actually a setting that implies that the game is terribly optimized but that's that's fine you know whatever we've now lost more than half our frame rate and the stutters don't take us down to 60 frames per second anymore they take us down to like 10. oh look at it stuttering and with that very eloquent description of the stuttering it brings me to the end of my first video with an Intel GPU which was interesting it was kind of like living with a very smart drug addict sometimes it has these moments of clarity where it runs very well but other times it goes on a stuttering binge and then refuses to play random games anyway thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video consider watching another one a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye-bye foreign",

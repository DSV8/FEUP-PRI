    "transcript": "what's up guys I'm Dimitri visiting cool master is always fun let's see what they have in store but first huge thanks to our sponsors Thermaltake Corsair Phanteks MSI and Razer for making see as possible so this is what happens when we get swag we got a woman's large yeah put yours on alright check this out so this was not expected at all we got the Hardware Canucks dust filters with printing over here on the new Q500l and Q500P now if you guys recall this is that whole modular micro ATX enclosure that have now been modified to support ATX motherboards I find that whole direction really good because the enclosure itself you know because of the perforation on all sides that means you can mount all the types of things regardless of you know where the fans are located on the the top frame or the the front frame and now because the power supply has been relocated because the power supply bracket you have you basically open up a lot of space at the bottom so this is the power supply bracket that will now be installed in the front of the case it only attaches with several screws to some of the perforation material over here now the thing is you could technically align the power supply bracket with a power supply at the bottom as well to turn it into the you know traditional micro ATX form factor if you want to power supply at the bottom but the whole idea was to just make some rooms so that you could fit a long graphics card and then ATX motherboard inside a micro ATX chassis they're also trying really hard to expand their modularity elements for the Q you know 500L and Q300 series cases with these almost like fabric pieces that you can magnetically mount to the front or the top they are still working out on the ventilation areas but they're I think really hoping they would stick with a great color scheme and they have a bunch of all types of patterns on dust filters which I find really cool especially for the lower tier model because that way you can is the exterior so it's all just a bland metal box but have these cool filters that reveal a unique pattern they're also working on different place and different colors so this is not wood it's just a plastic piece that looks like wood that you can mount on the corners which I find really cool the customization element with handles as well and really going kind of like out of the way to also make these whole thing stackable so you can actually install a second case on top of the original case if you're going for that type of thing and the i/o has now been improved with the type C Gen 2 connection pattern all right so I found the H500p mesh this is by far my favorite color this is the asrock edition so some red accents which are tasteful but the metallic gray is still here what a beautiful release let me know if you agree once again we're drinking so this is interesting we're at the master suite and they have a professional editor over here working with premier yeah we got the new keyboard them behind there a little beer it sounds like a fun time at Cooler Master and then we have the new master box NR600 so it's the refreshed model from the original and 600 I like this approach it's kind of basic very similar to the like the 350X from Phantkes in terms of the layout so a tempered glass side panel power supply in the shroud that's kind of built into the frame I do like the approach for the front panel because it's kind of like a dust filter and the mesh at the same time so there's nothing blocking the airflow and the internal frame is kind of cool because there are three families built into the same 360 sort of combination which is pretty cool a $69 enclosure and there's the NR400 that is a micro ATX variant basically everything the same in terms of power supply shroud that's built in we have a little space in the front for power supply shower to fit through and the NR400 as you can see looks pretty compact a micro ITX variant $59 version here so really happy to see me only and 400 and 600 get updates so that's all that's near with cooler master in terms of case design the new Q500LMP and the NR400 and 600 let us know if you'd like us to review any of these thanks for watching we'll see you in the next video",

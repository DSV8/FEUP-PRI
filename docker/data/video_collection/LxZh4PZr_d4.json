    "transcript": "- As of recording this, this is very well the last Mystery Tech we're ever gonna shoot in this space. So we've got, basically, the entire crew. - [Matt] That's not why we're all here. - [Austin] That's not why we're all here. - [Matt] No. - Oh. - We're here because it's your birthday. - Who me? You guys remembered? - It was on the calendar. and it like reminded us, and like, but whatever. What we've decided to do for you today is we all have gotten you an item for Mystery Tech. - Ah. - And you're gonna have to guess who got you which item for Mystery Tech. - Hmm. - So this is a true test of your knowledge of our personalities of everyone in the office to see if you're really the boss that you say you are. Competent, amazing, wonderful. - I never said any of those words. None of those words have ever been spoken by me. It's fine. You know what? I'm sure that you all have been thoughtful and insightful on every single item, including this Charmander Kigurumi? Wait, do I wear this? - [Ken] That's what a Kigurumi is. - Oh, I'm sorry. - [Matt] I like how you say that like it's like common knowledge. - Of course! Eight-year-old Austin, this one's for you. Wait, do I get to know how much these things were? Or is that rude to ask for gifts? - [Matt] Uh, that's rude to ask for gifts. - Who paid for these again? - [Matt] Even though you pay for all of this. - Just double checking. - [Matt] You think we paid our own money for this? - Oh, look! I got a tail! - [Ken] Oh, that's cute. - All right, all right. - Sorry, Ash, I hate to break it to you but Charmander died. The upside is he's a coat now. (Austin laughs) - [Matt] Are you gonna do the thing where you hide behind the desk? - No. - [Matt] 'Cause I would say I'm sorry to the peanut gallery. You have to see what happens behind the desk. (Ken laughs) - Yeah, I usually like to, look, it's my birthday, okay? I don't need judgment. - [Josh] Birthday suit, you know? - [Griffin] The only thing is that the editors are here. - [Matt] Oh, there's-- - [Ken] What song are you playing? - No, this is my idle animation. - [Matt] I feel like you'd be game, yeah. - [Ken] Yeah. - Hmm. Who would pick the amiyamigami? I'm gonna lean toward Kenzie. - No. - No! (buzzer blares) (Matt laughs) (Austin grunts) - [Matt] It was the one person that has got them for you every single time. - Oh, it's Ken. Thanks, Ken. - You're welcome. - This is gonna be a long video. I'm ready to evolve into my next stage with a Slowpoke shirt. Okay, first of all, everyone clearly knows me. Second of all, I think there's a lack of coordination going on right now. I'm about to look ridiculous wearing both of these at the same time. - [Matt] Wait, careful, careful You might catch on fire if you put it over your-- (Ken laughs) - [Ken] Damn. - [Matt] That was so concerning, and then he's like, \"Oh, yeah, it's a joke.\" - For this shirt, I am 62% confident, Karen. - No. - [Austin] No? - [Ken] Wow, at least pretend to be married. (Austin laughs) - Okay, who did this? Whose is this? - [Kinsey] Remember your last guess? - I was close! (Ken laughs) See, Kenzie know Pokemon! Thank you, Kenzie. - Bop It Extreme. What makes it extreme? So Bop It, for those of you zoomers out there, was a very popular game back in the '90s? - [Ken] '90s, 200s, something like-- - Yeah, maybe early 2000s. - [Matt] Is that affecting your guess of who got this for you? - Yeah, obviously none of the zoomers. - [Matt] Okay. - This is, oh, wow, this is extreme. Twist it. Flick it. Spin it. Pull it. - [Joanna] Wow, that sounded just like the commercial. (Ken laughs) - I need someone to play one on one with. I am 23% confident-- - [Matt] That confidence level keeps going down. - It is 'cause I keep being wrong that this came from Josh. - Ooh, it was not me. (Ken laughs) - No! (buzzer blares) Bro! - A good guess though. - I gotta get one of these right. I gotta get one of these right. Okay, whose is this? Hey, Rio! Okay, all right, good pick, good pick. Rio, do you wanna Bop It with me? - [Rio] Sure. - Okay. It always, it always-- (group laughs) - [Matt] I like how you-- - Oh, is that the little sauce? I do apologize, but you did pick it. - Have fun. - Okay, so all right. I am twist it and pull it. - Okay, and then I'm-- - Flick it and spin it. Are we ready? - No. I mean, yes. - [Matt] Rio kick his. - Okay. Ready, set. (upbeat toy music) - [Toy] Pull it. Pull it. Twist it. Spin it Oh! - Oh, I win! I won, I won! Okay, sure, we can do a do over? I just destroyed Rio. Okay. - That was a warmup. - All right. - [Josh] Represent for the editors! - Yeah, it's editing versus Austin. - [Matt] Rio, literally all of us are rooting for you and only you. - I know, okay. Okay. - Okay. (Ken laughs) - [Toy] Pull it. Bop it. Green wins! - [Group] Oh! - No! - I think that counts more than the first try. - [Matt] Definitely does. - It definitelY does. - [Matt] $1,000 extra for Mystery Tech. - Well played. - Thank you, thank you. - How do you turn it off? - [Matt] Oh, it never turns off. (Ken laughs) That's what makes it extreme. - [Toy] I'm going to sleep. - Yoto! The Yoto player. You know, the more I look at the box, the less it makes any sense to me. How much is the Yoto? - [Matt] We established that's rude. - I've made so many episodes of Mystery Tech that it's ingrained in me to ask how much it was. All right, so you turn on the app, you connect it to wifi, then you put these cards in to make it do things? And it's got like a wireless charger on it? I still don't fully understand what this does though. Is it an alarm clock? Is it a, oh, playtime and nightlight. Okay, I guess it's my playtime. - [Matt] I don't like that you said that. - It's my birthday! It's my playtime! I wanna play! - [Matt] How is your actual child less childish than you? - 'Cause the apple fars, falls far from the tree. - [Ken] Wow. - He can talk better than me too. I gotta say, I'm sweating so hard right now. I'm sorry. - [Ken] There's a part of the internet that wants to see that. - Ken, are you the one who deleted my wikiFeet? - Wait, it was deleted? Wait, actually? - Don't delete my wikiFeet. (Ken laughs) Quick start guide. Turn Yoto player on. - [Ken] Yeah. Oh, there you go. - Oh, okay, it's on. All right, Yoto player is on. Thank you. I can make my own cards? This better be really cool. Or otherwise, I'm gonna be grumpy and need a nap. I might poop my pants. (group laughs) What now? - [Matt] You're all set. - I'm all set to do what? (upbeat music) Au-Au-Au-Au-Austin Au-Au-Au-Au-Au-Au-Austin Happy birthday (group laughs) - I might cry, I'm so embarrassed right now. (group laughs) Who did this? - This player, you can upload technically whatever you want to these cards. - So that happy birthday, Austin song is just a video on YouTube? - From a YouTube channel called the epic happy birthday songs, and it's called Epic Cat Happy Birthday, Austin. - Is there one of those for like every name ever? - Yeah. (laid back flute music) - Is this my medieval birthday? - [Kinsey] It's Runescape. (Austin laughs) (whimsical music) (group laughs) - This is my birthday jam! - [Jared] Austin: I'm not a child. Also Austin. (group laughs) - Wait, is that the biggie version? - [Matt] No, it's not the biggie version. - Who chose this magnificent piece of technology? I have absolutely no idea. - [Matt] That would be me. - Okay, Matt. As soon as I heard Sea Shanty, I knew crew was involved. Am I really O for four. - Yeah, and as much as you say your odds get better, I have a feeling you don't remember who got you anything so. - [Ken] He's gonna say like-- - Matt, you know me too well. - That was actually a pretty good throw. I'll give you that. The MOXE smell training kit. Okay, y'all know me too well, too well. Smell training to help promote and restore your sense of smell. Now, I am offended that someone thinks I need to enhance or restore my sense of smell. So this actually seems like a real item for people who maybe have lost their sense of smell. Use all four twice daily for a minimum of 12 to 16 weeks. - [Ken] Wait, this is a long-term thing, okay. - Smell with intention. I have never resonated with a sentence more in my life. I'm gonna sit down. I'm going to snort, I mean, sniff these as hard as I can. So I'm gonna start with the some ropes. - [Matt] The rub was unnecessary. - That's fine. That's smelling with enough intention. (group laughs) I felt the thing at the top, hit the top. Dude, do you see this? It's leaking outta my nose right now. (cough) Thank you. - [Matt] You know, if this was downtown LA, I would've thought this was normal. - I'm not okay. I'm a big fan of our roll bliss. This would be nasal necrosia. (laughs) - [Ken] It can actually smell that from here. - It just continues to burn. I'm going to-- - [Ken] Oh, it's burning. - Yeah! This is 12 weeks of twice daily that I just inhaled in one sniff. (Ken laughs) Who was clever enough to give me the smell factory? I'm gonna guess. - [Ken] Don't look at us. (laughs) - Yeah, you guys are out. This one's Griffin. - I really wish it was me. - What's going... (group laughs) - [Matt] If you keep guessing Griffin, it'll be him at some point. (group laughs) - Whose is this? - [Jared] The was me. - Good job, Jared. - [Jared] I did it just for you. - Thanks. I will never smell again, now. I'm gonna be really real with you right now. That might be the worst thing I've ever done for Mystery Tech, and that is saying something. - [Matt] It wouldn't be a Mystery Tech-- - Yup. - [Matt] Without our good body. - Roboraptor will never assault me like that. He'd just nibble on my fingers and it would be delightful. - [Matt] I'm glad you say that. - No. You are not gonna give me the Intelligent Dinosaur. - [Ken] Wait, he has rockets on his back? Whoa! - Gimmicks. Gimmicks! He has about to fight and then destroy the Intelligent Dinosaur. - [Matt] This also looks like it might have been opened prior. I got scanned on my birthday, #noclickbait. - Oh, it is clickbait! He's not, he's a different color. - [Matt] What? - [Ken] This could be like red or something. - [Austin] He's white. (group laughs) - [Ken] Oh, you gotta assemble its tail too. What the hell? - This is Roboraptor's even clone! They have the same legs! They have the same neck! They have the same arms! Someone knocked off Roboraptor. I'm calling the police. No, get the-- - Now they have the same. (laughs) - Do you see this blatant ripoff of the one and only Robo T Raptor. It's unacceptable. Whoa. - [Ken] Roboraptor, you gotta buy dinner first. - Bad Roboraptor, activate. Oh, he's got light, lit up eyes. - [Matt] Oh, no! - [Ken] Whoa. Whoa! Whoa. - He got wheels! He has wheels! Roboraptor, no, no! We've been through a lot. If you don't wanna do this, I'm not gonna blame you for it. He might be your match. Roboraptor, fight! Roboraptor sizing him up. This one's just being dumb and staring here. Hey, do something. - [Ken] Just like the other Roboraptor, you need to touch its butt. Hmm. - [Matt] He's presenting. - He just keeps singing Gangnam Style. - [Matt] Roboraptor's digging it though. - Wait, is Roboraptor making a friend? I thought we were about to have a duel. They're just buddies now. - [Matt] They're dance off. - Oh, that was a twist I didn't expect. Now get 'em, get 'em, get 'em! Oh, no. Oh. What the hell's happening? I don't like this at all. - [Matt] Oh, oh, oh, oh. - [Joanna] Austin! - [Josh] You let that happen. - [Matt] You say he's your friend but-- - He made friends with the enemy. Who got Evil Raptor? - [Matt] We're not calling him Evil Raptor. He didn't do anything evil. This is K-pop raptor. - I think I know this one. Aaron. - No, I wish it was though. (buzzer blares) - Is it you, Josh? - I wish it was as well, but no, it is not me. - [Austin] Who is this? - I honestly don't even know. - It's not me either. - [Austin] Karen? - Who is this? - Joanna? - [Joanna] Oh, it only took you like five guesses. (group laughs) - [Matt] So that's five wrong answers. - Yeah, you're in a lot of debt right now, Austin. - Hey, guys, what about payroll next week? Ah, looking a little-- - Or we could just fire Griffin. (group laughs) - [Matt] Oh, great. - I wanna thank everyone for being a part of my super cool birthday bash. And if you would also like to be part of my next birthday bash, subscribe the channel and you won't even be invited, but you'll be invited in spirit. Is there a problem over here? I'm just used to being able to do my thing on the table. I wasn't expecting a bunch of people over here. - None of us want you to do your thing on the table. - Okay, well, don't make fun of my birthday then. Oh, okay. Hold up, hold up, hold up. (siren blares) Time out, time out, time out. Is this is a secret sponsor item? - [Matt] No. - Did someone sneak a secret sponsor item in here? - [Matt] a promise there's no sponsor. - Highly sus. - [Matt] We tried to get the sponsor. They said, \"We're not interested.\" - So you bought it? This is the Insta360 link that purports to be amazing, incredible, and next generation because unlike the old webcams of yore, this will actually be able to turn and follow you. Aw, it's a little guy. It's really, really tiny. It's basically like a little baby gimbal. We still use a last generation G14 around the office a lot. And while it is a terrific laptop, ASUS no put webcam. I like webcams! They're super neat! - [Matt] I mean, to be fair. that's the first one that hasn't just sounded like a bad Mickey Mouse. - Ooh, boy. - [Matt] There it is. - This is brand new high quality piece of technology. Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I still taste a lot of rose in the back of my throat, which is probably not ideal, but it's okay. I'm gonna connect this up. I'm sure I'm gonna need to download some software, right? Or does it work out of the box? If works out of the box, I'll be much happier. Guys, this will do 4K24. - [Ken] Ugh, wow, the worst frame rate. - I am now recording using the Insta360, and boy, this looks choppy. It says it's running, it's running at 4K24. That's definitely-- - [Ken] Yeah, 20, that's 24, yeah, 24 is choppy. - Let me switch to 1080p 30. 30 looks much better. Oh, oh, it's blinking at me. Wait. Is it gonna follow me now? Oh! - Oh, look at that! - Whoa. Okay, that's actually pretty impressive. - All right, but here's the test, here's the test. Come over, come over. Yeah. - Oh, you stole my webcam-- - Ah, I'm sorry, man. - Ken! - It's still really smart though. Like, that's probably the roughest thing that it had to go through, right? - [Austin] Wait, you can vlog with it. Look how smooth that is. - Yeah, look. Look, yeah. - [Austin] This is ridiculous. - Gonna do some of this. - Dude, that is incredibly impressive. This is actually a cool webcam. Assuming that this playback works fine without dropping frames, which it does seem like it's dropping a few frames, that will be my only sort of caveat, this seems super neat. Also, the fact that like most of the time, we have like webcams and other things in here, they don't really work well with like the lighting and the white belts and stuff. This looks terrific. Like, this honestly really, really holds up pretty well, which is why I'm gonna say that I'm gonna keep this in my bag now. If we could record Mystery Tech with this, this could just be the cam-op. - So we don't need to fire Griffin. We just need to fire Joanna. - [Austin] We can fire Joanna. It makes sense! - [Matt] Payroll saved. - So what you're saying-- - [Joanna] I'm just gonna, I'll just point this towards the ground. - [Austin] Yeah, it's okay. We're just gonna, robo-Joanna's here. - It's a shame that we can't see this right now. - [Austin] Oh, right. - [Joanna] Oh, geez, wish you had a cam-op right now. - (laughs) Job security. - You live another day. - Yeah, tell the Insta360 to do this, Austin. (Ken laughs) - We're gonna come in tomorrow, the Insta360's gonna be smashed. - [Austin] The Insta360's stuck on Joanna now! - Don't lie. Don't. - [Austin] It's really following you! - [Josh] It senses competition, you know. - I like how we thought we were gonna get an AI battle between the Roboraptors. (Austin laughs) And the real AI battle is between Joanna and the AI camera. - Now who chose the Insta360? Is there anyone from the Insta360 marketing department in the building? I'm gonna stare each one of you down to see who cracks. Okay, it's not Josh. - All right. - [Matt] You guys should like shuffle around. He might lose it. - [Austin] Griffin. - Yes. - Yes, I finally got one! - Oh, finally! - Hey. Hey, Insta360, I finally got one! Finally! I've been waiting for this for so long! - [Ken] You can only guess Griffin so many times before it's right. - Dani Ricc! Aw, is Dani Ricc gonna have a seat by the time that this video goes live? - [Ken] Nope. (group laughs) - Wait, this is Max's. - [Ken] Wait, did you get all of that wrong? - This is the angle I saw. - [Matt] Saw it definitely, on the other side, says Ricciardo on the side. - Yeah! See, Daniel Ricciardo! Sorry. This is Max Verstappen's car. I look like a big dummy now. Yeah, I'm opening it, yeah. I'm not even gonna like pretend I'm not gonna open this. This is really cool. Oh, and even the tire. Oh, yo, and the wheel! Yo, do you see the wheel turns? And you can see this is an older car because the bargeboards are very simple and not full of all kinds of absolute like shenanigans. - [Josh] There's no halo either. - Yes, oh, you're right. - Oh, wait a minute! - So that would be 2017. - Wait, yeah. - [Austin] Wow. - Josh. - This is really neat. Okay, whoever picked this is very thoughtful. I feel relatively confident that this is a gift from my lovely wife. Karen. - Unfortunately, no. - Ah! - [Ken] Once again, act like you're married. - [Matt] Have you two met each other? (group laughs) - Josh, thanks for the car! - Again, it's not me. (group laughs) - [Austin] Aaron, thanks for the car! - I could not feel any more embarrassed for you, dude. (group laughs) - Two boxes. Oh, FedEx. Wait. Are they Pokemon cards? - [Matt] They're not Pokemon cards. - I smell Pokemon cards. Look, if I smelled anything in my day, it's Pokemon cards. - [Ken] What's the over under that this is tech? - I mean, what's the name of the show again? - [Ken] Mystery. - [Matt] It's been like, we haven't had tech on the show in about three years so-- - Fair point. Are we ready for the big reveal? Ready, and. Star Wars! Is this an R2D2 lava lamp? Hold on, hold on. - [Matt] They turned him into a lamp? - This is not a toy. Don't get any bright ideas, okay? See, see? I got the puns! - [Kinsey] This almost doesn't look like a lava lamp. - [Matt] It looks more sus. - [Ken] It's like something else. - [Matt] Yeah. - What's wrong, what do you mean? - [Matt] I'll tell you when you're older. - It's-- - [Matt] Maybe next birthday, we'll tell you what that looks like. - Is R2D2. We've got R2's head. - [Ken] Again, I can't believe they killed him. Oh, oh. - [Matt] Forbidden soda. (Ken laughs) - I'm gonna insert the base later. - [Matt] Oh my god. - [Ken] It's like VOSS with like blue liquid on the bottom. - I will say this thing seems a little jank 'cause it's like not straight. Do you see, it's like-- - [Josh] Nice grip. (group laughs) - [Matt] Do you remember the motion you had for the Shake Weight? - Moving on, all right. Flipping the switch in three, two, one. There we go. - [Matt] Hey! - All right, so you can see the lamp, and now you have to wait for the lamp to get warm. - [Matt] Oh, while that heats up, maybe you open the other box. - Okay. Is that a Millennium Falcon posable light for 59.99 at GameStop? - [Matt] Well, I didn't know they were gonna keep the price tag on it. (laughs) - Also, do you see how they butchered this box? I gotta figure out which one of you gave me the R2D2 and which one of you gave me the Millennium Falcon. I'm supposed to be able to tell who got what? - I'll give you a hint. You still have another gift left. - [Matt] Process of elimination, buddy. - Oh, so one person got me Both of these. Is this like the Pixar lamp? - [Ken] I mean, look at the picture on the box. Like, it looks cool. - [Matt] I think it needs to be bigger for it to look cool. - [Ken] I also agree with that. - Okay, everybody ready to see how bright the Millennium Falcon is? - [Matt] If you turn it on right now, it's gonna fly right into the R2 lamp. That did nothing. Wait, is it very barely turned on at the back? - Oh, no. It's just flickering, that's it. - [Group] Oh! - [Ken] Wait. Wait, what? - [Matt] You know what? This is exactly on brand for the Millennium Falcon. - It is actually on brand for the Millennium Falcon. It looks neat on camera though. Do you get like, is it the JJ Abrams Millennium Falcon? Woo, anamorphic lens flares. - [Ken] We're not on anamorphic, dude. - This is neat, this is neat. I'm gonna guess these came from Karen. - No. - [Ken] Dude. - [Matt] Man! - Thanks, guys. - [Matt] You had a 50-50 shot, man. - I know, and I failed at every possible opportunity! - Well, they were from me. They were from me. - [Austin] Okay. - [Kinsey] See, just like anniversaries, you have to win this one by default. - If I don't get this right, I'm gonna be very upset. (group laughs) In a Home Depot bag, which makes me a little sus. - [Matt] I was, I thought this was sus. (group laughs) - [Ken] Oh, no, what is it? Oh, no, what is this? - Amirce, your home massage expert. Heightened mental alertness, improved skin tone, reduction of stress hormones. Is this a face massager? - [Karen] I mean, now that you're 30-- - [Matt] Oh! Oh! (Ken laughs) You killed him! - It's my birthday! Why do I feel so attacked? Okay, now. (group laughs) - What is it? What does it look like? (group laughs) Wait, what does it do? What? Wait. (device vibrates) (group laughs) - Okay. - [Ken] Why is it gold? - [Matt] Have you ever seen Austin Powers? - It's even matching my Charmander shirt. (device vibrates) - [Karen] Get in there. (group laughs) - [Matt] You look 30 years younger. - [Robot Voice] Not. - I love how all of like the cute thoughtful things that are from us, you're like, \"Oh, this has to be from Karen.\" - [Karen] Do you need any help? - [Ken] Oh. Ah, ah, ah! (laughs) - [Matt] Uh, should we be doing this in the workplace? (group laughs) (camera clicks)",

    "transcript": "all right good people so welcome to this very interesting comparison between what I would consider to be two best full towers of 2019 the reason why I want to compare these two cases is because they basically cater to the same audience they are large enough to accommodate ambitious water cooling systems they're also priced in the same bracket with a Phanteks slightly cheaper at 189 versus 199 and actually available to buy versus the o11 XL that's been out of stock everywhere one interesting timbre about the Enthoo Luxe 2 is that it's been renamed to Enthoo 719 because thermal take out of all brands had suggested it was too similar to their sister company Luksa - that makes like mobile stuff so Enthoo 719 it is may I remind you thermaltake has an H200 enclosure how interesting so let's do the feature breakdown so you can decide which one suits you best after this your eyes haven't seen anything like it yet the new razor blade Pro 17 packs it beautiful and fast 4k 120 Hertz panel with gorgeous vibrancy and color accuracy with incredible clarity awesome for creative work that will never disappoint with a fantastic future-proof IO as well it's also a touchscreen so your fingertips get some action the bezels a tiny the chassis is sleek the fiery keyboard is perfect that tracked by this massive the hardware is epic with r-tx man the blade pro 17 is a complete package experience a smooth 4k gaming link below alright so first let's cover the size difference as the O11 XL is significantly smaller but with a slightly wider frame despite the dual chamber design on both cases I was also quite surprised to find that they weighed the same - about 14 kilograms 431 pounds and that is because of material differences so the exterior frame on the nine one seven is actually mainly plastic which is how they're able to achieve all these smooth curves and style complications without skyrocketing in the price point the only non plastic pieces on the outside are centered which are sandblasted aluminum and look awesome while on the O11 XL if there isn't even a single drop of plaster anywhere the exterior panels are all brushed aluminum with strong metal frame and that's probably why it's slightly more expensive the TG panel on seven one nine is humongous and swivels to open it can be locked at the front with a thumb screw and has a long peg for support to eliminate any sag while the rear side panel also has so much going on for it first we have another TG window that partially reveals all three SSD caddies secondly I love the ventilation pattern on here that matches the character of the case and lastly the fine dust filters are magnetic with a special frame design that lets you easily place them in the correct spot on the panel to eliminate any potential dust gaps the O11 XL also has a unique panel approach where the top panel secures the rest of them in place and you pull them out individually this means no thumb screws and the exterior remains beautiful the dust filtration on here is not as fancy as those Phanteks with just this regular magnetic strip that are quite restrictive that is why I preferred the dust filtration on the 719 because the fine mesh used here is very effective against particles without choking off the airflow and they are magnetic with a pullout type for the bottom the same on the XL by the way as this is the only fine mesh filter present on the linee case let's continue with many other similarities between the two like the exterior ambient lighting strip I love the integration on the fan text enclosure that spans all the way from the bottom across the top with this good-looking cohesion and in the interior strip too right below the motherboard to separate the bottom chamber while the O11 XL has a strip running across the front only looking good without too much bling on fanfics you can sync the lighting with your motherboard and even add accessories to the male connector or if you have any other fan text lighting gear just plug them in into this port while on the O11 XL it only has the motherboard sync 5 volt a RGB connector the i/o is pretty much the same as well on fantex it's hidden behind the front cover which for USB 3 ports type C gen 2 separate audio jacks with lighting buttons on the O11 XL it has the same way of the front but 2 USB 3 ports are located in the front foot to break it up a little bit and that means that you'll need 2 motherboard connectors for the USB 3 cables as there are 4 ports total now the interior of each case is quite different but notice no fans are included out of the box both support up to EB motherboards so your preference will most likely depend on what's radiators you plan to use for your system and if a second system is something you care about so for example with the seven one nine you can install an ITX motherboard in the bottom chamber this ITX panel is included and but I will say the metal is quite thin so careful not to show off your finger strength but you will need to buy a riser cable and the revolt X power supply that's capable of powering two systems at once and you can reroute the reset connection from the front IO to power the second system this area can also be used for an extra power supply or for storage when you stack any of these four drive cages here or if you're mounting a radiator at the bottom this is the only bracket that's actually removable from the case as mounting anything in the front or top means working inside the case as usual all the mounting is on strips for most flexibility but I am just a little bit surprised at how soft all these parts of the frame are especially for the price point while everything on the O11 XL is properly rigid the main interior highlight of the Ilia knee case is how the motherboard tray is almost layered opening up a lot of the room at the front for the side radiator mount that is also just built into the frame with mounting strips the bottom fan bracket however is removable as that is the least accessible area when installing radiators or fans and so here's the entire breakdown for radiator support inside the O11 XL you could do triple 360s with a beefy 65 millimeter at the bottom and the top but with my 45 millimeter thick rod and the set of fans we are right underneath that motherboard 280 mils are compatible to 4 top and bottom and because the case is now wider versus the original 11 you have a 120mm fan mount for the rear exhaust and up to 169 millimeters for GPU height what's really cool is you could install the radiator on the side with the fans outside in the frame as you have 65 millimeters until you hit the bottom fan bracket and 50 millimeters on the other side until the panel now the fan --tx case has larger radiator support because it is taller up to 480 on the front or the side with up to 364 the top and bottom the bottom is limited to 120 mil wide radiators nothing wider will fit while the front and side radiator relationship is almost binary you either have a front rad or side one as they're so close together only slim radiators will fit when you occupy them both important to note that fans can be installed on the other side of the frame with these SSD plates covering whatever side you're not using so the fan takes case has basically more options but also more limitations including if you install these drive caddies on the side plate you can no longer mount and radiator to the front also only the Phanteks case has a drain and fill ports I'm surprised there isn't one on the end Lee also the vertical PCI slots are available by default on seven one nine you just need a riser cable while on the accel you need to buy a full bracket that rotates all your PCI slots separately I also find it super interesting that we have hot swappable Drive cages with Lian Li for caddies in total to avoid any cable mess you could further install three SSDs on the rear side bracket but this will be a painter out and we also have these individual covers with SSD mounts that go instead of the side radiator while with fan tags the back layout is more traditional with dual channel velcro cable passed through a fan hub with seven headers and a large cover and from the power supply for visual organization and I do prefer the motherboard tray layout on the leonie case as it just gives me a cleaner outcome when it comes to cable management versus the flat tray on the fan Tech's enclosure and so the thing is my standard case system does not represent what these two are designed for the m27 1:9 is way too large for air cooling only so you have to fill it with radiators especially that whole area beside the motherboard and because of that there's no height and the bottom chamber either an ITX motherboard and/or a bunch of water cooling hardware and the same goes for the O11 XL also that case I feel it covers a larger audience because it is just a slightly larger O11 dynamic and that's a really popular enclosure to accommodate taller GPU blocks and extra radiator spacing in the bottom and the top while the seven one nine is really pushing that whole duel system agenda forward which I appreciate because this case is affordable for what it can do and it's orientation and I appreciate that the target audience between these two cases overlaps it's the enthusiasts water-cooling community but either of these cases is doing something uniquely different in their own right all right guys let me know which one you would pick thanks so much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content I'll talk to you in the next day",

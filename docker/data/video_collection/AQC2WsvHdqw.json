    "transcript": "Well now, its time to turn this negative image into a positive one. Its not not easy - whoops, double negative, sorry. Its easy, but alittle weird. If youre just joining us, welcome. Were talking about photography. And this is the third video in a series. We first looked at the earliest days and this lovely Daguerreotype as well as an Ambrotype, then we took a look at the modern black and white film development process. That second video has about 2/3rds as many views as the first one so if you missed it, you might want to check it out first. This one is building upon it for sure. For your convenience Ive summoned a clicky thingy. Theres also alink to the whole playlist in the description. This video is about photographic printing. Whats exciting about this process is that we actually get to see it occur. Unlikephotographic film which is generally sensitive to all wavelengths of visiblelight (we call that being panchromatic, by the way, which is why so many black and white film stocks have \"pan\" somewhere in their name) ... That parenthetical went on too long for this sentence to make sense without restarting it. So... Unlike photographic film which is generally sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light, black and white photographic paper is not. And byphotographic paper, I dont mean that glossy paper you might buy for your printer. I mean this stuff. Actually photographic paper. Notice this warning; \"Open only in photographic darkroom.\" Opening thisbox right now would quickly ruin all the paper inside. Heres a little secret, though. The best part of a photographic darkroom is how not dark it is thanks toone of these: Its a safelight And quite the safelight , too. I promise thats thelast time Ill do that. This Thomas Duplex Super Safelight is not only super, its Thomas! Andit contains a very special kind of light bulb. Those of you who have beenfollowing the channel for... a while may remember when I did a couple of videos on high pressure sodium lighting. I mentioned that in the not-too-distant future wed be looking at a low pressure sodium lamp. Well, three-and-a-half years later, this isit. Well, its inside of here. This is it. I wont spend too much time on this tangent but this is a now very-obsolete lighting technology that previously found somewhat widespread use in roadway lighting. Its technically a kind of high-intensity-discharge lamp but in actualityits much closer to a fluorescent lamp in terms of how it operates. It just happens to use metallic sodium and not mercury vapor to create its discharge. And thats why its in this special borosilicate glass tube inside another tube. Metallic sodium really hates being itself and would gladly tear other molecules apart with gusto if it had the chance. It requires special containmentconsiderations. For a very long time this was the most energy-efficient light source we knew of, hitting 200 lumens per watt, so it made great sense to use for public lighting. Theres justone small problem with it. It looks like this. [60 Hz humming is heard from the fixture] Low pressure sodium lamps are essentially monochromatic light sources. Theyre not quite because of the starting gas - the pink glowyou see when the lamp is cold is a result of the so-called Penning mixture, a mix of usuallyneon and argon which allows the lamp to strike and maintain an arc as the sodium vaporizes. But once the sodium gets all boily and glowy, it very much overpowers the starting gas and all you see is a sea of very yellow 589 nanometers. You cannot tell colors apart under thislight source because everything it hits reflects the exact same wavelength backto you, just in different proportions. This makes everything you see under it look as if its black and white (or, I guess, black and yellow) which is prettytrippy but also inconvenient for a lot of reasons. So we pretty much dont use this technology anymore except in very particular applications. Like this one! The photographic papersthat were about to be playing around with are not sensitive to this wavelength of light. OK, theyre a little sensitive - with enough exposure they will be affected but lets not splithairs. Now, you might be familiar with safelights that appear red. Thats an option as well, butits sort of old school at this point. Early photographic plates and films werent really sensitive to red light. Some werent at all. As a tangent to a tangent, this means that in old black and white photos the colors of objects could seem wildly off if red was a major component. For example, a red dress may appear black, and a yellow flower would seem way too dark as to the film it might as well be green. These films were very sensitive to blue, however, so a brightblue blouse of hues might appear close to white. Anyway, those early plates and films could be handled under a red safelight without affectingthem, but since our eyes are much more sensitive to this yellow wavelength than they are red, and since modern panchromatic films need to be handled in complete darkness anyway, this is generally a better option for black and white printing work. By the way, a couple of filters in the safelight are placed over the lamp to remove the purply-pink light from the penning mixture as well as dramatically reduce the overall intensity to safer-for-the-paper levels. Oh and, by the by the way, a safelight like this is by no means necessary - LEDs or even simple filtered fixtures like these are a much morereadily-available option. I just bought one of these on eBay because it was an excuse to have anLPS lamp in my life. Oh, and by the by the by the way, the reason this thing is designed like this is that its meant to be hung from the ceiling and bounce its light off of both it and these moveableshutters, which not only serve as a light output control mechanism but are also fitted with filters of their own for other darkroom applications. So now lets talk about the paper. First, though,lets make it safe in here. How very yellow! Just as a note, I have the cameras exposure cranked up just about as far as it goes so you can see whats going on. But the safelightisnt actually very bright at all - its just to allow you to see what youre doing, not to light up the room so well that you could read a book. To me, the room looks about like this. And asa warning, this video is going to be going back and forth between very dark scenes like this and ordinarily lit ones a lot. So, Im gonna do my best to tame that with slow fades but be warned brightness is all over the place today. Anyway, with no other sources of light in this room except for the safelight, it is now safe to open these boxes of paper in this room under thislight. The paper is kept inside a black plastic bag to protect it from ordinary danger light. I will unfold the bag, grab exactly one sheet of paper, then fold it back up and put it backinside the box. Why? Well because thats good darkroom practice and allows you to turn the lights onat any point without worrying about it but more importantly I want you to see what happens to the paper when you accidentally bump the light switch. Turning the room lights back on reveals that the paper isnt white - its a kinda gross yellow,actually. And leaving the lights on causes it to become increasingly discolored with time. Take a look at this sheet thats been out allday. Why does this happen? Well, because these pieces of paper are coated with a gelatin emulsion of silverhalide crystals, just like whats on the film. Thats right, this here paper is actually a large piece of film that, rather than be transparent and made of plastic, is white and made of (mostly)paper. Exposing it to light like weve done causes the silver halide crystals to beginreducing into silver, and the longer we leave it out like this the grosser a color it will become. Also, its thoroughly ruined at this point. Im sure a lot of you can see where this is going, but theres a critical piece of equipment I havent talked about yet. Lets ignore it fornow and take a look at how this paper interacts with light and photography chemicals. All weneed is uno dos trays, some tongs, the paper, and the same three chemicals we were talkingabout last time. Developer, stop bath, and fixer. Well be using a different developer than before. Paper developers tend to be formulated differently for various reasons, however the stop bathand fixer well be using are also suitable for films and indeed are the same ones Ishowed you in the last video. When dealing with paper I do use stop bath because we cant easily rinse it between developer and fixer. The stop bath will neutralize the developer, both stopping the development action and, importantly, prolonging the life of the fixer. So its neat stuff, and the yellow coloring (beside that this is really just vinegar) is a pHindicator so you know when its no longer acidic. Under the safelight the liquid appears clear, butthe indicator will make it appear black when its exhausted. Though really its more like a purple. But you wouldn't know that under this light bulb With the chemicals placed in these developing trays, and the room lights turned off again, lets watch what happens when we puta piece of paper fresh from the box into the developer. It gets wet. Thats allthat happens. This paper hasnt been exposed to light other than the safelight so theresnothing for the developer to act upon. But now, lets turn on the room lights. Almostimmediately, the paper starts getting darker. Just like in film, the photons coming from the lights cause reduction reactions in parts of the halide crystals, creating nucleation sitesof pure silver within them. Since its sitting in developer, those seeds are immediatelyembiggened and the entire crystal becomes solid silver which darkens the paper. In this caseevery single crystals gettin turned to silver so this papers gonna be solid black. Why isnt itshiny, you ask? Isnt silver, like... silvery? Well, these are tiny tiny crystals of silver which scatter and absorb incoming light. Essentially they keep light from hitting the bright paper base and then reflecting back to your eyes - just like how it blocks light from going through film. So they reduce the apparent brightness. OK, so lets see how we can play around withthis. What if I took a flashlight and turned it on against the paper? Could we see shapesafter developing it? Indeed we can. What if I put a bunch of objects on top of the paper and then shined a flashlight at it from a distance? We get a sort of wacky collage where items which shielded the paper from the light kept it white - or, in the case of the marbles, focused that light into intense points. I wonder what if I put my phone screen on the paper like this? Could we see the image that was on the screen? Huh, look at that. We sorta can. Though, its inverted. The cat shouldnt be white. Say, this gives me an idea. What if wetook this piece of film and put it over the paper? Maybe use a piece of glass to holdit flat. Lets see here. Flashlight. Developer. Look at that! The dark areas of the film blocked light from reaching the paper which kept it white, but the light areas let lightthrough and so made the paper dark. We got a negative image of a negative image so now we have a positive! Now, before we can turn the lights on to take a close look, remember that we still need to fix this paper. Right now the undeveloped silverhalides are still there and without fixing the paper it will look yellow and gross - and continueto get grosser over time. Fixing is a critical step both for making a pleasant image, but alsofor long-term image stability. So, after spending a brief time in the stop bath to neutralize thedeveloper, well put the paper in the fixer for at least a couple of minutes. Once its been in therefor as long as the fixer youre using calls for (and assuming its reasonably fresh) we can turnon the lights and evaluate what we just made. What we have created is a very sloppy contactprint. Its very sloppy because, well, for one thing I put the negative in upside-down sothe image is backwards, but also the light source was a flashlight and I wasnt keeping track ofexposure time all that well. This would be tricky to reproduce. Thats no matter, though. We canuse a light source which makes an even spread of light, and then we can use a timer to help makethis reproducible. For a while, contact prints were quite common. Take a look at the box forthis Spartus Full-Vue Twin Lens Reflex camera. (this isnt really a TLR, by the way, its afancy-looking box camera meant to mimic them in appearance only). It says the picture sizeis 2 by 2 inches. Thats the size of the negative it makes with 120 film, and back in itsday you would get prints made pretty much exactly how we made this one. The finished print ends up the same size as the negative taken in-camera. But what if we want to make a larger print from this negative? Lets consider how this negative was created in the first place. A camera used a lens to collect light from a large area and concentrateit onto the film which recorded a latent image. Then after development we ended up with a negativelike this. If we had a sort of backwards camera, we could take the film and send light throughit, then use a lens to spread the image the film contains over a large area. We could then pointthat backwards camera at a large sheet of paper and end up with a bigger print froma small negative. Enter... this thing. This Beseler Printmaker 35 is a photographicenlarger. Its a pretty basic condenser enlarger - dont worry about that it just hasto do with how the light source behaves - but the fundamentals between all enlargers arethe same. In here is a light source - a 75 watt incandescent lamp - and a condensing lensspreads that light in an even column down through a film carrier. A second lens below the carrier projects an image onto the baseboard below. The key thing is if you put a piece of film into that carrier, you project an enlarged image of that very piece of film. Andnow you can make big prints from small negatives. Lets do that, shall we? Unfortunately I donthave the appropriate carrier or lenses to hold 120 film in this enlarger so were gonna go withsome 35mm film I shot when I took a train trip over the summer. As a matter of fact Im missing several things from this second-hand enlarger. You may have noticed that the lens carrieris glued on. Yeah - I dont think this is the right one for this enlarger because Icouldnt for the life of me figure out how this was supposed to attach to the enlargerhead. So high-school me just used hot glue, and while it looks pretty cruddy, its held upall this time so whos laughing now? Anyway, first lets make a contact sheet! Just like wemade that contact print, we can take this whole sheet of negatives and place it over a sheetof paper to make a quick reference sheet with positive prints of all these images. Then we candetermine if there are any we might want to print. First, though, we need to figure out an exposure time. To start, Ill lift the enlarger head up niceand high to make a big spread of light on the baseboard. To figure out the exposure I shoulduse, Im going to take a strip of paper that Ive cut for testing purposes and place it underthe film - any part will do - and then both of them under a piece of glass. Because the filmhas a slight tint to it, its going to lighten the paper slightly and skew the black level. Thistest strip will allow me to compensate for that. To test for exposure Im going to cover up most of the film and paper with something opaque, then expose the paper for two seconds. Ill thenmove the cover over and do it several times more. This creates a strip of paper that will show banding, and each band has been exposed for 2 seconds longer than the next. Now Illdevelop it, stop, fix, and take a look. This section was exposed for 2 seconds, thisone 4, this one 6, and so on. The first section where the film base stops getting darker is the time I want for the contact sheet. So now, lets make a contact sheet with this film and expose it for however many seconds we just determined we should do it for. Youllnotice that I cant fit the entire thing over the paper. Thats because I dont have paper large enough to use with these negative holders, and I use these negative holders because my film scanner - yes sometimes I scan film like a digital heathen - can handle strips with 6 frames, plusthese actually hold 36 images unlike these holders that, while they DO fit an 8 x 10 sheet of paper, force you to sacrifice a frame on each roll. Frankly Im just making this contact sheetfor you because I already have a digital copy of all of these sitting on my computer. Ordinarily I dont bother. Anyway, get on with it! Now, to be clear the timinghere isnt really critical. Contact sheets certainly dont need perfect exposure but getting it close to ideal will help identify shots that might be troublesome to print because they werent exposed correctly in the camera or are really contrasty or something like that. If all you want is a sheet of positive images for reference you can easily just guess a time and if you can see the film against the paper, oh well no big deal. But with correct exposure, we know that clear film - that which wasntaffected by the light in the camera - will make the paper at least close to completely black, andany part of the image on the film will lighten it. That makes the images more-or-less representative of how they will actually print without adjustments. Anyway, with our contact sheet made we can pick a frame to print all big like. How bout this one? I like it. So now lets print it! Ill take thefilm strip containing that image out of the holder, and now we need to take the negative carrier out of the enlarger like so. Were gonna put the negative in with the emulsion side down. Because were using a lens, its going to flip the image horizontally and vertically, so we need to take care that we put the negative in correctly so that its projected normally. I mean, you dont have to, if you want a mirror image Im not gonna stop you. And also, because perspective is flipped between looking down at the filmfrom above and the baseboard looking up at it, confusingly you want the image to not be reversed when youre loading the carrier. Its easy to mess this up at first but with practice youll eventually only mess up occasionally. Now heres a very important step: dusting forprints. Particularly when using a condenser enlarger, dust on the negative will be very visible in the final print so you want to do your best to get it off. Ill give it a little dustingwith one of these blower brushes. I tend to have decent luck with these. but you could alsomaybe use compressed air, or one of these things, do what you like best. Then well put the carrier into the enlarger and now well switch the light on. One thing I havent talked about yet is the fact that the enlarging lens has an aperture ring just like a camera lens. This thing really isa backwards camera that barfs light through the film down onto the baseboard to duplicatethe image. When youre composing your print, youll probably want the lens wide opento make the image as bright as it can be. Composing your print? Yeah, theres a lot youcan do here besides just make a big positive from a little negative. For one, most standardpaper sizes are not the same aspect ratio as a 35mm film frame, so youre likely gonna becropping in somewhat. But you can also crop in more - put the enlarger head way up here and youre projecting a large image which your paper will only occupy a part of. To help withthis process (and with keeping the paper steady) we use an easel like this. This particular modelhas a space to hold 8 x 10 paper on one side, and various smaller sizes on the other. Whenthe paper is aligned with these indexing tabs and the top closed, the overlap of thetop blocks the edges of the paper from the exposure and creates a small white borderaround your print which looks nice. But you could also expose the paper with the top open to make a borderless print if thats your jam. In fact in that case you dont even really need an easel, but have fun with alignment! The top of the tower is barely captured on this negative so Im definitely using the easel and the border. Youve probably guessed that you need to adjust the focus of the enlarger. As you move the head up and down the focal point changes, so youll need to adjust it as you do so. This knob here changes the distance between the lens and the negative to accomplish focusing. That also means that the image size changes as you focus so there is a bit of finagling to be done here. But when youre happy with how your print is composed, you can use one of these thingies to help ensure focus is spot-on. This lookslike a microscope and kind of is but what it really does is bounce the projected image off this mirror and into the eyepiece so it's magnified a lot. This allows you to actually see the film grain when its focused correctly. I sometimes put a piece of paper under it to ensure that the focal distanceis as spot-on as possible - but honestly I doubt that helps much. Anyway once we have our print composed and focused we are almost ready to print. Almost? Yeah, now we need to do anothertest. Because each negative is unique and the distance we have the enlarger fromthe easel changes the image brightness, we need to figure out an exposure time just like we did before. So well use some test strips and an opaque object to block it whilewe do that repeated exposure trick again. This time, though, we need to decide what part of the image we want to test. Remember this is a negative, so the lightest areas of the image will be the darkeston the paper. We could test somewhere that should be black in the print, or you could also test on something that will be grey, really its up toyou and youll get better with practice. You may want to use the contact sheet to help determine where you want to test and what to shoot for. Dont forget that we have the lenss aperturering. When printing, its usually a good idea to close it down so that the exposure takeslonger. This gives you more granular control. The paper is really quite slow - nowhere nearas sensitive as typical films. So with the lens closed down to f11 or f16 the exposure could easily take upwards of 30 seconds. This allows you to fine-tune the exposure much more easily, and well see shortly how a long exposure can be really helpful fordifficult prints. Speaking of exposure times I havent yet talked about this timer. Becausefor me, its only useful at the very end. This is a timer made specificallyfor photographic enlargers. You simply plug your enlarger into its power outlet and now it is in control of the light bulb. It has a dial that points from 1 to 60 -thats seconds. A button to start it. And a toggle switch for bypassing the timer. The ideais you point the outer dial to the time you want, and when you hit the button the timer starts. Itmoves this pointer to the time you have selected, and a motor slowly moves it back to thestart. Once its there, it shuts off. Now, the reason its only coming into the picturenow is because its not very accurate. While I could set this for 2 seconds or even just 1 for making test strips, its just not precise enough to be reliably consistent. I have a pretty good internal brain clock for counting seconds so Ijust use the toggle switch manually. But even if I didn't, stores sell these clock thingies which are pretty handy to have in adarkroom. However, for longer exposures thetimers little bit of inconsistency doesnt really matter so once Ive worked out the exposure time I want, I use the timer. Now, you can get more modern digital versions of these darkroom timers, but wheres the fun in that? Anyway, looking at the test strip we made, thiswas exposed for 2 seconds, this for 4, this for 6, and so on. This was a clear blue sky so we want it to be light in the print but not white. We can look at some of the features of the tower to help with this too, but perhaps of even greater help is the contact sheet. If we like how this looks,we can compare the test strip with the image on the contact sheet and work out an exposure time. Ithink I want the exposure to be somewhere between these two values, so well split the differencebetween 6 and 8 seconds and shoot for 7. Now that we have determined our exposure time we can set the timer to that time, put in a fresh (and whole) sheet of paper, hit thebutton and just like that weve taken a picture. Or I suppose given a picture? Now of course wecant see the image yet, but we will in a moment. Now Ill finally tell you about an importanttechnique. When putting paper into the chemicals, you want to sort of slip it under the surface so that it immediately gets covered across the entire emulsion. You dont want to just plop it in there cause thatll be weird and bubbly. Then you want to gently rock the tray back and forth to keep moving the solution around and, of course, cover whatever might not havebeen submerged. Alright, here it comes. Our im- no, that thats... that's not what we were just printing you pulled an editing trick on us you you tuber! Thats the one we just did. Yes that one. OK,so after its been in there for a sufficient time - yet another variable you can play aroundwith - well put it into the stop bath for thirty seconds or and finally into thefixer. This fixer only takes a couple of minutes to dissolve the undevelopedhalides and now this print is complete! Well, aside from rinsing. You want to get allthe fixer off of it because it can damage the print over time if you dont. There are anumber of print-rinsing products out there, or you can fill like a two-compartmentsink and plug one side of it and just sorta trickle some water over it while youslosh it around in there for a while - there arent hard and fast rules here, dont listento anyone who tries to tell you otherwise. Except, maybe if you work in a professional photofinishing lab but then you knew about all this already. What are you doing here? Anyway, afteryouve rinsed it for a while youll want to dry it. You might put the paper up on some sort of flat surface and use a squeegee to get most of the water out then hang it to dry. Or just put iton some towels. Or use a dedicated print dryer. Theres ever so much incredibly specificequipment you can buy if you feel the need! So thats the basic printing process. This print,though. Its pretty dark. One of the struggles with darkroom printing is that its really, reallyhard to judge the print under the safelight. Everything looks much darker than it really is, and even a light gray looks quite different from the white border. So its pretty easy to see areally dark image and think its probably fine when it isnt. Honestly this just takes a lotof practice to get good at - practice that I havent had in years. So, uh, lets try again butwith less exposure. This is a much better print, though it could still probably do with abit of lightening up. It could probably do with some extra contrast, too. And wouldntya know it, theres a way to make that happen. The majority of black and white paper in use these days is variable contrast paper,or VC. The RC, by the way, isntRoyal Crown, or radio-controlled, its resin-coated and describes the constructionof the paper. Im not gonna delve into that here because that whole topic is just filledwith very, very deep rabbit holes but basically resin-coated paper isnt very absorbent and is a lot easier to process, handle and dry but has its own downsides of course. Oh andpearl is just the surface finish. Anyway, the emulsion on variable-contrast papers is madeof multiple parts, and these parts are composed of silver halide mixtures that are differentlysensitive to particular wavelengths of light. Of course none of the silver halides are sensitive to this yellow safelight orred light. However, their sensitivity tothe other parts of the spectrum is different between them. All of the crystals are equallysensitive to blue wavelengths. With blue light they quickly capture a latent image and have a compressed dynamic range in the final result. However, some of the halide crystals arent very sensitive to green wavelengths. Under green light, those basically dont form a latent imageat all, and it takes much more exposure time to turn the paper black since only some of thecrystals are affected. This may sound trivial, but with the aid of simple color filters betweenthe enlarger and the paper, you can adjust the ratio of sensitivity between these components and thus adjust contrast in the final print. Heres how: This is a set of Ilford Multigradecontrast filters. They are graded from double zero - thats very low contrast - to five -very high contrast. Without a filter in-place, most paper behaves as it does with a grade twofilter. Now, Ilford includes a grade two filter because all of these filters arecalibrated to produce the same exposure, so if you want to adjust contrast up or down you dont need to figure out a new exposure time assuming you printed with a filter in placefrom the start. Grades four, four-and-a-half, and five require a doubling in exposure time fromthe rest, however thats still pretty easy. If you look at filter 00, youll see itsyellow. This filter is blocking the majority of blue light from the enlarger, meaning only theslow-to-respond green-sensitive halides will be affected in the exposure. Filter 5, on the otherhand, is magenta. That blocks the majority of green light but allows blue through, eliminatingthe effect of the slow-to-respond crystals. Remember, theyre all equally sensitiveto blue. This causes the paper to quickly become fully-exposed, compressing dynamicrange and increasing the apparent contrast. All of the grades between five and double-zero have slightly different ratios of blue-to-green, allowing you to dial-in a sweet spot between these two response curves. I dont know if Ive explained that allthat well, but lets re-print this image with a contrast grade of 3.5. I didnt usefilter 2 when making the initial prints so I am going to need a new exposure test. Im also going to test between the wall here and the sky because I want this part of the skyfairly close to white. That might be a mistake but theres only one way to find out! OK, lets gofor this exposure time, and make one more print. Since were now biasing the light towardsblue, whats essentially happening is the darker parts of the image are getting exposed more quickly. Requiring less light to turn the paper black means the highlights can stay brighter compared to the shadows, and the range of brightness values we get on the paper is compressed somewhat. And... heres the resulting print. What do youthink? I think its a big improvement. Now lets talk about when youd want to gothe other way. I like this image a lot. The bystanders on the platform combined with the perspective convey a sense of the immense scale of the locomotive, and the casual stanceand luggage of the people tells the story of train travel. We are looking at a digital scan ofthe negative, though. This is a very challenging image to print in a darkroom. Film can capturea much wider dynamic range than paper can, and since the front of the locomotive is in shadow, exposing the paper so that we can see detail in the sky crushes the front of the train intoa sea of black. But we know theres detail to be found there - looking at the scan we can clearlysee the engine number but in this print... you just cant. The people are also now in silhouette, when we can at least see some detail here. This is the exact sort of image well want to use the lower contrast filters for. To show the effect of the lower contrast filters, I madethese three 5 by 7 prints. These were exposed for the same length of time with the 2.5 filter,the 1 filter, and the double zero filter. Notice that the filter is pulling up the shadows but notaffecting the highlights. We see just about the same darkness in this corner across all threeprints. But as we go down in contrast grades, the shadows are revealing more detail. With lessand less blue light in the exposure, it took a lot longer for the paper to darken to black, and in fact on thisprint it didnt really make it there at all. To get more detail out of the highlights we need to expose for longer. These three prints were all done at 7.5 seconds. Now, lets take thedouble zero print and add exposure time to it. Heres double zero at 11 seconds. And now 18. More time finally pulls the highlights down to the point we can begin to see the skys detail, and indeed more detail in the train cars, too. But of course the shadows are also gettingdarker, now. I think the exposure on the 11 second print is pretty close to ideal, but I wish wecould pull a little more detail out of the sky. I wish there were a way we could combine thesetwo exposures somehow. Oh wait, there is! Dodging and burning. Users of photo editingsoftware who have never spent any time in a darkroom are about to get their minds blown. If we stop the lens of the enlarger down so that the exposure will take a good 30 secondsor so, we can play around with casting shadows over the paper in regions that we dont want toget too dark while the exposure is happening. That is called dodging, because youre blockinglight from the enlarger and causing it to miss the paper. This image is a perfect candidatefor dodging - I want the front of the locomotive to be brighter but still want the paper exposedlong enough to see detail in the sky. So, with a bit of shadow-puppetry skills, Ill justblock the locomotive for part of the exposure. You are witnessing the first time Ive ever attempted dodging and you know what? Heres the print. Its not bad, is it? I mean,Im pretty pleased. If youre doing as sloppy of a method as shadow puppets you want tomake sure youre moving a little bit so you dont create hard edges. And there arentany hard edges here, though you do notice some blooming around the locomotive. The otherflaw with the method as Ive done it is that my fingers are attached to my hand so I endedup dodging this area of the platform as well. Its not too bad here but I did a second print with more aggressive dodging and honestly this looks like a light-leak in thecamera or something. This one was a little overdone. If I wanted to do a better job, here, I would have obtained or even fashioned a dodging tool on a stick so I could cover just the locomotive. Then I would just rotate the tool to make sure the shadow casted by the stick didnt stay in oneplace. If there were an area that I wanted to be darker than the rest of the image, I could useburning. Here you block all of the image except what you want darker and expose that further. Asimple yet effective photo manipulation technique. If you want, you can get really precise andcreate masks. Ilford gives you this red filter with the set of contrast filters which you can use to project your image onto photo paper without actually exposing it. If I were really committed, I could compose myprint on the easel, then put a piece of ordinary construction paper or similar below the enlarger and trace out the shape of the locomotive. Then I could cut that shape out and make whatever trimmings I might need to to get as close to the shape as possible and create a very precise mask. WhatId then do is put some photo paper in the easel, then use the red filter to project the image ontoit without exposing it. While its projected, Id place the mask as precisely as I could, turnoff the enlarger and remove the red filter after Ive done so. Then put whatever contrastfilter I might want in there, and then finally expose the paper for 20 seconds or so. If I developed the paperas is thered be a big hole where the front of the train was because the mask blocked the light. However if I expose for another 20 seconds after removing the mask (and being careful not tonudge the paper), now that hole gets filled in with the front of the train but exposed for half asmuch time as the rest of the image. Simple, huh? Anyway, I think we should stop now. We haveonly just scratched the surface of this topic. Ooh thats gonna show up in the print. Uh,anyway, Im just giving you an overview of the process and thats about as deepas Ill go. There are lots and lots and lots of YouTube channels out there dedicatedto film photography and darkroom printing, and if this interests you I'd encourage you to check them out. Its hard for me to pick out one of these film-based channels becausetheir scopes are so different between them, but I have recently found The NakedPhotographer who has not only got a much better (and proper) darkroom setup but has beendoing a lot of great experiments and comparisons. If youd like to check out that channel theres a card and Ill probably pin it in a comment, too. I said in the outro of the last video that wed look at why 35mm film became the dominant format and pretty much remains so to this day. Well, uh,were out of time. But the mere existence of this thing should give you a decent clue. Enlargingthis tiny film frame to an 8 x 10 inch print is about a 6000% increase in size, and yet it stilllooks pretty sharp. Film is pretty amazing stuff. contrastingly smooth jazz Resin-coated paper isnt very absorbent and its a lot easier to process, handle, and dry but oh you sharnt you arentsupposed to see this image yet. Right. Then I will fold it back up, put itback in the box which is upside down. For a very long time, thiswas the most efficient energy dangit! For a very long time, this was the most efficient energy lights I did it again! I said efficient energy! The paper is kept inside ofa plack plack blastic plag! But even if I didnt, stores sell theseclock thingies which are pretty han pleurgh dangit! I dont mean that glossy paper youmight buy for your print yeah I need to have it in my hands! Wed be looking at a deuhhh!! So, how many of you had no idea how this process works? I sorta get the sense that it's a lot, but also I'm not sure. Like, I imagine even a lot of the older folks out there who used film cameras for decades didn't know this, but maybe I'm completely off base there. Anywho, toodles!",

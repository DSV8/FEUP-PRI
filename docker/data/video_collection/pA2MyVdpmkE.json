    "transcript": "hey guys it's justine and i am so excited because i just got this massive delivery of a new traeger timberline xl grill i have been working on redoing my patio and when you see the before and after it's been a pretty extensive makeover and this is the final piece in the patio makeover that i was waiting for and it's here and now it's time to set it up the last time i did an unboxing it was for my parents we got them one of the traeger girls so now i'm so excited i have one of my very own so the unboxing process is well we've got a very big box so let's let's do it here we go yeah we're moving and grooving now like these are holding this whole box together like it's pretty much together is it the right way oh yeah it is the right way oh this is exciting wow it's beautiful where are those instructions at are you in there i bet they're in here oh more things i was just looking around for somebody else to put this together but it's me and jake this is it we we don't have anyone else nice love to see it love it oh oh i hope these are just empty boxes these are not empty boxes there are in fact items inside the wheels are here start your journey here i took another path on my journey so um if you're on the same journey that i'm on you might want to open the box that was on the top first the first thing that we have to do is tip this over so that we put the wheels on it and this is where i'm going to need some assistance jake please ah shoot your fingers watch your thingies they are number or letter b look at that this looks right right no it's upside down yep it is i we're technically like almost done and if that's the case then these are the two missing screws that i need we've got some accessories i'm so excited because there's so many different things that you can get for this we're still building but all that's left now are the accessories and to get it all set up on wi-fi so i'm so excited to actually start grilling i thought i was gonna be able to grill tonight but i'm getting tired so tomorrow will be the big grill out day i've invited some of my friends over and they're going to enjoy my cooking well i'm going to i'm going to make them enjoy it so it's all put together i'm going to do all of the setup process get this hooked up to my phone get it connected to wi-fi and do the cleaning process so tomorrow it'll be time to grill i'm so excited do you like steak uh do you like burgers i do do you like chicken i do like beef yeah great because that's what's on the menu this is the newest traeger model that is more versatile and convenient than the previous models it comes with meter wireless probes and an outdoor induction cooktop so you won't have to go inside to use a stove top it has configurable storage and accessories with easy cleanup cutting board 22 pound stay dry pellet bin a new grease management system that collects grease and ash a grilling lights and even more grilling surface than ever before it is an exciting day it's grill day and the meat cave my friends is all set up this morning the first thing that i did was get it all ready i did the seasoning and i've almost tripped on my wood pallets which is incredible because i already have one of the bags inside of here which is where you put the pellets and that's what actually fires this grill good morning it's day of the big grill out and i have to season the grill i'm getting everything prepped i just woke up but i want to get this seasoned and get everything all clean so i can start prepping so the first thing it's telling me to do is add the pellets so let's do it ignite my grill another thing that i love so much about this type of grill is you can use it not only to grill but you can use it for smoking and baking like you can actually make muffins there's recipes inside of the app that shows you all of these things that you can make and i am by no means a grilling or cooking expert and if you're new on my channel here well go watch some of my old cooking videos but the thing that i love so much about this is traeger has a ton of educational resources in their app they have traeger tv so i can go and watch all sorts of recipes get inspiration and even go through and this will give you step-by-step recipes of all sorts of different things like this week their recipes they have a moroccan spiced roast chicken red curry salmon and a baked halibut sandwich with smoked tartar sauce wow that sounds incredible also something cool about traeger is they have a ton of accessories and they also have some spices and some sauces this is the traeger q barbecue sauce and we actually went out and got this this morning we did an online order at a local retailer these i found all at ace hardware and ordered them online and jake who's behind the camera here he picked them up and brought them here for us to start our grilling process i don't even remember what i bought i just kind of went to whole foods and was like burgers steaks kebabs yes please also excited to cook some vegetables this is a nice little traeger vegetable tray that we got with the grill this is really cool this is the induction stovetop so it's a little accessory that just connects to the grill not only does it connect wirelessly through bluetooth but it also connects with the power to the grille so you don't have to have any additional power accessories and this is great because if you do want to make something on the stovetop a lot of times you'd have to go back inside but now you don't have to because it is right here next to your grill i just love that everything works together and it's just so convenient i can't wait to get cooking another thing that i love so much are these little pop and lock accessories so these are just like these little hooks that you can get and those just snap right into place and over here is this little roll bar so you can put paper towel they also have some trigger meat paper wraps that you can get i decided to put some foil here because i have a feeling that we're gonna need some foil for all of the things that we're making today i love this tray this just lifts up and it folds down but this is another one of the pop and lock accessories that just goes right on this little ledge right there these are the bluetooth meat thermometers i already have them connected to the grill it's so easy you just go in and you add accessories here on the lcd oh let me just find a new home for them maybe here on these beautiful wooden shelving i love this color combination too like this black and this light brown love that you know what i can do i can put these in here look at this a perfect fit i love that okay check this out this is where the pellets go and you just dump those in there there's also a pellet sensor so you'll be able to know if this is running low and one of the notes that they have been very adamant about is making sure that you don't leave these in here for a long amount of time if you're not going to be using them that could affect the pellets ability to help you grill to perfection definitely want to keep those away from humidity which links us under here we've got this little container which we can put all of our pellets in when we're not using them this is also great because they've got little stickers they have tons of different types of flavors the one that we're using now is the natural flavored hardwood and they have these little icons right here that show you what it's recommended for and thankfully this one is good with anything which is great because we are making a wide variety of things today we gotta start doing some kitchen prep also while shooting this video the fire pit that i got which was basically like the two last parts that i needed for this patio redo was the grill and the fire pit and it's here so my sister's gonna come over help put that together this is gonna be the best impromptu grill out that i've ever had i've never actually had one before so it's actually my first my first grill out are you excited oh my god yes this is cool let's go prep the meat so we've got all of our things prepared to take out to the grill we've got burgers cauliflower steak we've got some beef kebabs we've got some filets potatoes we've got some chicken kebabs they still have to prep so let's get to it food is prepped friends are on their way the grill is now going to get preheated and we are about to drop on the meat and veggies i love this lcd because basically you can control everything through here so we just turned and pressed the dial to set grill temperatures we're gonna set to 400 ready to ignite oh we have liftoff we have liftoff make sure to keep your grates drip tray okay everything is clean because you're brand new this all connects to the app so i'm able to keep an eye on the heat and i can even adjust things like the temperature so i can keep it warm or i can even shut it down so now we wait and i'll go get our goods so to show you guys before and after of this back patio it was full of weeds it was disgusting it was so terrible and now this is the transformation it is finally complete we've got our fire pits and we've got our grill and i could not be more excited they did such a great job they kind of took my vision i wanted like this rock wall with succulents they told me that i probably would kill the succulents in there so we're gonna put some fake ones in which i'm a-okay with but we've got some really cool planters we've got some plants all around the outer perimeter but this rock wall was my favorite piece of it we've got these little market lights as well that connect to the rock wall the sun will be going down soon so you'll be able to see the ambiance now it is time to cook first meat on wait i need i'm gonna put it over here because i want to stick the temperature sensor in it no we're jamming this in there when cooking internal temperatures yes these are jalapeno burgers get ready for the meat the induction soap is something i'm so excited to try out i've got my cast iron pan here and we are going to cook up the asparagus so we just put this on and then we're going to turn it all the way up to turbo just to kind of get it started and you can notice the color change here that turns orange and it'll show you where in the heat range you're at of course i'll just dump them in i could do these in the grill but for the sake of testing purposes we're making use of the induction stove so we're gonna take our first little peek see how they're doing oh yeah these are looking great so everything looks pretty good we just received the internal temperature warning on this steak so we're going to flip them looking very good okay burgers you're getting flipped that looks incredible there's cheese on it so that's going to be leaking cheese through the bottom steaks are done everyone i can't believe it i cannot i am just as shook as you grab yourself a plate our first delivery has been made of our steaks and now i'm gonna test one out for myself while the burgers and chicken continue to cook i like mine usually pretty well done so this is perfect it's really hot oh yeah and the rub that we put on this too is so good i'm a happy camper looks like our chicken is also done time to serve the guests this has like a chili flake rub on it let's try this one huh oh i think i like that one even warm that's nice yeah that's really good you want pieces of chicken kebab i do yeah hand it out here that's really it's nice it's on there oh this is really good yeah yeah big fan i'll tell you what this trigger key though look at that it's like a chicken nugget night you're allergic to chicken so i folded the cheese in so it doesn't drip down there's a little bit mess here here put it put it in put it in we're losing we're losing fire yep put it in put it in there bye-bye little grilled cheese jenna doesn't eat meat so she made herself a grilled cheese the cauliflower was really good but i just was still hungry i'm sorry cheese i'm just gonna push all this stuff off to the side because now it's time to bake cookies you can actually use this grill to bake jenna my dear sister has prepped us with some cookies that are basically already made we just kind of pop them on the pan look they're gluten free too alrighty look at these cookies oh my god these look so good it's like okay so gluten-free will be over here so one two three four five six so we'll do six on the side let's go put them on the grill it got dark real quick

oh nice you wanna bite i've got such an interesting buffet of meal really bad oh my god that's actually so good i didn't put any butter on her neither it has like a little smoked flavor from the the pellets yeah it's quite nice i was gonna bring tomato soup next time same brain this is actually really good who would would've thought me drum roll please the cookies i think they're done it's

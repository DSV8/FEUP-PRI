    "transcript": "- Today we are checking out DJI's new FPV drone. This is the DJI Avata. It's 50% lighter, has built-in prop guards, new smaller goggles, an improved camera, and it could be flown with RC or the motion controller. Let's open it up and check it out. (plastic crinkling) (package sleeve scuffing) Here it is. So, we've got the goggles and, it looks like the motion controller, in this box. And, we have the drone in this one. (boxes thudding lightly) (plastic crinkling) Let's check out the drone first. It's crazy because this looks so tiny. The previous DJI FPV drone was pretty awesome, but this... is so small. (plastic crinkling) Oh yeah, this looks like a legit FPV drone. One that I would've went out and built myself. (uptempo instrumental music stops abruptly) But, I didn't. ( instrumental music resumes) (plastic crinkling) Wow, oh my goodness. (Justine gasping) This is so cool. I have so much respect for FPV drone pilots, because this right here, what's happening right now, opening up a pre-built FPV drone that you can go out and fly... That is a privilege that we now have the ability to do, because most drone pilots create their own. They start from basically scratch. They buy the parts. They build these things. They program themselves, and it's this mix match of pieces, and they make these incredible flying cameras. And today, you know, I just opened up a box, and I'm going to put on a headset. And I'm going to go out and fly. It is exciting, though, that DJI is giving people the ability to experience FPV in a way that most consumers never really would've had a chance to do before. I do like that this has the built-in prop guards. This is going to be so much easier for me to travel with because the other one was quite large. (plastic crinkling) (plastic tearing) Got some extra propellers. Here, we've got the tools to actually take off the props. Tiny little screws. Oh, geez. Here's everything that comes in the box. We've got our drone, a USB-C to USB-C cable. We've got an adapter to charge the battery. Two propellers, a little tool to screw in the propellers, and the propeller screws. All right. Let's look at this little guy. Check this out. (Justine blows dust) A little dust on you. (drone beeps) Oh, so dusty. So, here's the battery and much like the previous DJI FPV drone... It does clip in right there. So, you just plug in the battery to the drone, and this battery should just pop right out, but not too easily because you don't want these to fly out when you're flying. Obviously, when you're flying FPV, you're probably flying pretty aggressively. So, you definitely want to have a good support system. And, this is definitely very supported in there. Right here, this is where you can put your microSD card, and there is also a USB-C. All right, here's the goggles and the motion combo pack. Look at those. They're so cute. (plastic crinkling) (box thudding lightly) (plastic crinkling) These are so much smaller. (Justine gasps) I cannot wait to fly with these. I'm heading out on a trip here very shortly. I feel like I say that every single time I open something up and I get to take it out on adventure, but this is going to be so much easier to travel with because it's so much smaller. We have a headphone jack, microSD card slots, USB-C, and a place to charge. I like how this has a little lens protector too. That's cute. Here's our USB-C adapter to the power adapter. So, like the previous version, this will plug into a little external battery to keep your headset charged. Here's the motion controller. (plastic crinkles) Pew. Pew. This reminds me of the temperature checks that they give you at the doctor's office. They're just like...please hold. Good to go. (covering whooshing) This looks like a little strap for the headset. Here's our battery. (plastic covering sliding) Oh, I like... this has a little clip to make sure that that doesn't pop out. Definitely, something that you don't want to happen is if you're out flying and this USB cable pops out... (Justine grunting) Lost sight of the drone. Peace. We got a few more things to open up before we can take this and start getting it set up. (plastic crinkling) Here's our FPV Remote Controller 2. (plastic crinkling) (box thudding) I like that this gives you the option of how you want to fly. Do you want to fly with a controller? Do you want to fly with a motion controller? (joysticks rolling) Yeah. This is where I shine. I am going to definitely be trying out the motion controller to see how that works, but I feel like this is where I'm most comfortable flying. Although, who says I can't learn to fly with the motion controller? (joysticks rolling) That's nice. That's real nice. We also have the Fly More Kit which will allow us to do just that... fly more. We've got additional batteries and a little charging dock. (box lightly thudding) (plastic sliding) So, we have the Charging Hub here which will allow you to charge four different batteries. Normally, these things don't charge at the same time. It'll just kind of cycle after one charges- the other will then continue- but it will be nice to be able to just charge these without worry, and set them up overnight. In the morning when you're ready to fly, you're good to go. (plastic cover sliding) Two extra batteries. What a treat. How do we plug? Oh, you plug in with the USB-C port, and they did give you one with the drone. So, we'll be able to plug that in. We have so many things. One last thing to open up: These are the ND Filters. (plastic falling) (Justine gasping) There we go. We have ND8, 16, and 32. (calming music) So, now that everything's unboxed, I'm going to go get the firmware updated. Get everything connected. Then, we can take this thing out to fly. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) I should have brought a chair, but I basically forgot all the things that I wanted to bring today. So, we have a blanket to sit on. (upbeat music) (upbeat music beat drops) So, we're now outside, and we're about to fly the new DJI FPV Avata. And, I'm so excited. I already did fly this for my first try in San Diego. Here's a few clips of that. It was kind of fun because I just kind of wanted to go out and kind of get a sense of what this feels like: what it's like to fly. See what the differences are between this one and the previous version. And, I met up with my friend Faruk who's also working on a review video of this drone. I'll put a link in the description if you want to check out his channel, but we had so much fun. And, he also gave me the confidence to try out the motion controller. Now, this is kind of interesting because this drone does come with the motion controller as opposed to the regular RC controller. And at first I thought: I don't like this. I don't like this at all. Until I actually tried this out, and I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to control. There are obviously some maneuvers that you can't do with this that you could do with the controller, like go backwards. So, I really loved trying this out. Another thing to note is: yes, this is an FPV drone. And, today I don't think I'm going to have the confidence to test it out in manual mode. So, there's three different modes. There's normal, sport, and manual. In manual mode, when you take those little fingers off those joysticks, that drone is going to fall. So, I don't feel completely confident flying in that mode today, which is unfortunate because you can fly up to 27 meters per second. Which is really freaking fast. Sport mode, you can fly 14 meters per second, and in the normal you fly 8. That is a huge speed difference. And, it's interesting because the first time that I did fly this, it did feel like it was going a little bit slower than I thought that it would. That, my friends, is because we were in sport and normal. So, if you really do want to use this to its full potential, get comfortable, get cozy with flying FPV, and you can really take advantage of that. I really do need to work on my skills because I don't want to lose this before I finish this video. So, let's get this prepped, out there, and ready to fly. (upbeat music) They also came with some ND filters. So, I'm going to pop on an ND filter, since it is a little bit bright. So, I'm going to see what that looks like. I didn't get a chance to try out the ND filters in San Diego. So, we'll see what the difference looks like. (bag unzipping) Here's our little ND filters. Look at you. You're so cute. We've got an ND8, 16, and 32. (upbeat music) So, here's the headset. Here's our antennas. And, this has a nice little eye protector which is actually quite nice. The thing that I really like about the headset so far is that this is a little touch pad right here. This is how you control the settings and access the menu. Pretty intuitive. And, it has a little raised bump right here, so you'll be able to know where the center of that is. Here's my gripe with this headset: It's much lighter, but they did not put a top little head strap on. So, you have to tighten this pretty tight around your head. When I was in San Diego, after I got done filming, I had an indentation across my forehead for at least 10 hours. It finally has dissipated today, which is great because it was ridiculous. So, what I've decided to do is I brought a headband. I have two of them. I brought this one here, which is a little bit aggressive, but I think that this might alleviate the indentation. This look nice? Do I look like an official drone pilot? (upbeat rap piano music) Let's see how this feels. This actually feels great. This feels so much better. It is a little bit heavier on the bridge of my nose. It really needs to have a top head strap. There's no doubt about that. - [camera man] You kind look like cyclops from X-Men. - I'm available for hire. Phone is connected. Goggles are on. Okay. Ready? (drone whirring) (Justine wooping) We have lift off. There I am. I look so stupid with this headband on. (drone whirring) Here we go. (drone whirring) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (Justine yelling) That was so close to you. Was it really close to you? - [camera man] Yes. - [Justine] Oh my God. (drone whirring) (drone beeping) (Justine wooping) Okay. We did it. First flight here in Palos Verde: it's done. So, this seems like it feels nice, a little extra padding, but now it's pressing on my nose. But man, that was so fun. Wow. Wow. I freaking love it. I do feel like the first version of these... I felt way more motion sickness every time I'd fly. So far, I've felt actually perfect. Maybe that's the trade off. Dent in your forehead. No motion sickness. Swapping out batteries. Then to show you guys the motion controller, and how much fun this thing is. Batteries swap out. These last about 19 minutes which for a drone is still not bad. I mean, obviously, we wish the drones would have longer battery lights, but it is what it is. Still, it's not bad. I have three batteries. So, that gives me plenty of time to test. Looks like our ND filter has survived. Okay buddy, you ready for your next ride? Here's our motion controller. This basically works with just that. You guessed it: motion. So, we have this big button here, which is our break. This switches our modes. This is how you start the motors, take off, and land. This is a tilt. And, this is a little button to press to start and stop your recording which I'm going to hopefully not forget to press because I always seem to forget to record. Now, this is fun because this will basically let you control this drone with just one hand. So, I'm going to start recording already, so I don't forget. Headset's going on. Now, the problem that I have with these goggles is around the edges. There's definitely... it's a little bit blurry. So, it makes it kind of hard to see things that are on the edge, but everything is pretty crisp and clear in the center. And, to adjust, there's these little knobs down at the bottom, which will allow you to kind of move the eye pieces depending upon how your eyes are. Connected. (controller beeping) Recording. We're going to stay in normal mode, and once I get it up, then we'll go to sport. (controller beeping) (drone whirring) Here we go. Okay. This is how we control. Up, down, left, right. And... to accelerate, you pull the trigger. So, here we go. (drone whirring) That's it. We're driving. We're driving. We're cruising. It's so fun. It's like a whole different way to fly. If you've never used the motion controller before, it's pretty awesome. You could just cruise down. Oh, we're cruising now. We're going. We're cruising. Thankfully, there aren't any surfers out here that I could accidentally hit. So, we're in normal mode right now. We're going to switch to sport. So, here she goes. Oh my gosh. It's so fast. It's so much faster. It's basically double the speed. My God. I'm so close to the ground. So close to the ground. I'm so scared. (drone whirring) (Justine wooping) Oh God, those leaves really were close. Somebody got a haircut. (Justine wooping) This is so fun. It's so weird. Looking at myself outside of my body. This is an actual, true out-of-body experience. (drone beeping) Oh, so dusty. We did it. Didn't crash. This was a very successful flight. I've been having so much fun checking out this drone. My foot is asleep. Oh gosh. Most of this video, I was shooting it in sport mode which will get us about 13 to 14 meters per second, which is still pretty fast. Little drone, look at you. You're looking pretty dusty, but you did a great job today, little buddy. Like I said at the beginning of this video, this will go into full manual mode. And with that, you're able to actually fly this like a real, true FPV drone. So, if you do take your fingers off those joysticks, it will fall from the sky. So, you need to be fully prepared for that. (Justine blowing on drone) So, comparing this to the previous version, it's kind of interesting because of the size difference. I feel like this is so much more portable and compact. You can take this more places. Also, the handling was a little bit different. I did feel like: with the previous version, I was able to maneuver a little bit faster and a little bit quicker in sport mode. But, one of the things that I liked about this is: yes, you can use the motion controller in the previous version, but I did not actually test that out fully in the previous one. So, this was kind of my first time testing out the motion controller. And, one of the things that's interesting is with this, this does come with the motion controller. It doesn't come with the RC controller. So, if you are getting one of these, you would have to get the RC separately. Using the motion controller was one of the more surprising things. Because this does come with it, I really wanted to make sure I tested that out to see what that is like. And, I was pleasantly surprised. It does kind of give you an all new way to fly. And, I feel like I would probably use that if I was just kind of doing a casual, going out to fly. Whereas, the RC controller that gives me a little bit more precise movements, and that's obviously what I'm more familiar with. You can also go backwards using the RC controller, but you cannot fly backwards using the motion controller. So, I think for a lot of people, if you are used to flying with an RC, you might be surprised how cool the motion controller actually is. Thank you guys so much for watching. I'll put a link in the description if you want to check out the new DJI FPV Avata. I had a lot of fun getting a chance to fly this, and I look forward to flying this more. I'm also very glad that this is a lot smaller because this is going to be way easier to travel with. With that, my friends, I will see you in my next video. If you haven't already, please subscribe. Hit the bell to be notified when I post new videos, and I will see you guys in the next one. Leave me some comments below, and let me know where you would like to fly a drone at. Where would you love to go travel to and explore? See you in the next video. Bye. (calming music) Anybody want to take some guesses how long the indentation will last on my head? Is it bad? Okay. So, it's not even that bad. This is nothing compared to what it was before. (sad trombone playing)",

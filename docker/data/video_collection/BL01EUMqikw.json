    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and I'm here with Ro. - Hello! - So, we've been doing a lot of fun videos and you guys know that I have a tech channel and sometimes I stray away from tech to do some fun food things. But today, I thought I would bring Ro back into the fold of some tech. - Yes. And then I'm super jacked 'cause I had a lot of Wiz Fizz, Fizz Wiz. - We did a video on her channel trying Australian candy and snacks and I've never had Vegemite before in my entire life. I thought I had until I tried it and realized - It was a lot. - Spoiler! It was not good. You can go see that video on Ro's channel and I'll put a link in the description. Today, we've got a little blindfold and I brought some tech. - Yes. - So I kinda have like a tech closet where a lot of stuff that I don't get to right away, it kind of starts piling up after a while. So I went through my closet today and found a few items and I was trying to find them that would be kind of difficult for you to guess, but also not too difficult. - (gasps) Oh no. 'cause some of them, you might even look at it and not even know what it was anyway. - Oh, no. - [Justine] Yeah. - So Justine comes over and she's got a bag of stuff and she wouldn't even let me peek. She had me get my cute little blindfold, I got my bunny blindfold. - I just knew that if this was a reverse situation, even though she told me not to look, my eyes would be like, Uh! I need to look. So let's start with our first item if you'd like to get blindfolded and set - Okay. - [Justine] I think the first one I might start out very easy. - Easy for you may not be easy for me because I am not a tech expert. I don't think anyone would describe me as a tech expert. - I don't think they would. Now, you may have trouble unboxing some of these things so I can give you like a little hand. - Okay. - Okay, so here's the first one. Okay, there you go. - [Ro] All right. Oh, this is nice. But you know what? This is a... it's small. - It is, yes. - Okay, and it's bigger than a DVD. People don't do DVDs... - No, they do. (Man laughs) - Anymore. - There's still DVDs. - Do they? - Yeah, yeah, they love their Blu-rays and stuff. - [Ro] Oh, look, it's like a hang-y thing. - Yeah, careful you don't get your finger stuck. - Like a display thing. - Well there's something inside of it so you can open it to really help you out. - Oh, what is this? (playful music) Oh, there's a hole here. Whoa! Okay. It's a... What is this? This opens. - Well, I can't tell you. Well, yeah, you got to figure it out. So the hole, what do you think would go in the hole? - I don't even know what this is. - Well, yeah, but okay, So you would hold it this way. (playful music) - Okay. This feels like a phone size. This is a phone. Oh yeah. But what's this? - Well, but it's not a phone. But it is a phone... - A phone case. - Yey! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! - Yes! I did it. - So this is actually one of my favorite companies, Nomad. They make so many cool leather accessories - What? - And it's like a little wallet thing. And since I have the larger phone, you have the smaller one. So this wouldn't fit on my phone. So this will fit on yours. - (gasps) Justine, I love it. - [Justine] Yes. - Oh look, it even has a billfold. - Oh I actually didn't know that. Oh, put some money in there. - Ooh! I can put some money, money in there. - Wow. - Okay. I got one out of one. This is going better than expected, Justine. - So the next one is something. You wanna feel the box. I'll help you open it 'cause I'm gonna keep the box afterwards. So I just don't want you to rip it so I will help you open it. - It's square. - It is, yes. - It's a pop socket. No. No. I take that back. - It is not a pop socket. - I take that back, it's not official. - You can take it back, you can take it back. - Let me help you open, I'll help you open it. - Let me open it and then I'll... - So, let's just pull this right out here. - Headphones. - You're gonna have to see. - No, okay. - You're gonna have to see. Or not see and you're gonna feel. (playful music) - Headphones, right? - You are correct. (gasps) On one, but there's more. - Headphones, you guys. - Those are headphones. - Okay, I get half a point? - Yup. - Okay. - Yup. - What else is this? Okay, Justine. This is rope? - It is a rope. - Okay, a rope with a piece of plastic at the end? - That is Exactly what it is, but there's something else. (Ro laughs) Do you want a hint? Or do you wanna just give it a feel? - It's very light. - Pick it up. Here you go, here you go. - Okay, it's very light. I'm feeling a circle. - Yup. (playful music) - You can charge it. It's a... You know what this is... Oh oh it's an... Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. You didn't think I could do that? - Oh my God! This is so great. - Okay This is a... - Okay, do you want a hint? - Okay, so headphones is for listening for stuff. It has to be for listening, the listening to a movie. This is music. This is a music stick? - It is. (laughs) - This is a, excuse me. (laughs) - It's is a music stick. - This is the things, the old school with the music on it. - What was it called? - It was this big back in the day - Like a pod, maybe? - Oh my gosh, yes, an iPod. - Like an iPod? - Is this a new iPod? Oh my gosh. What is this? Oh, is this real? What? Shut up. This is an iPod these days? (laughs) These are so... They weigh nothing. - This actually came out in 2005. (laughs) - Are you you messing with me right now? - No. (both laugh) This is the iPod shuffle from 2004,2005. - Oh, no. (laughs) - Alright. - I'm ready, I'm ready. - Next item I'm on a roll. (gasps) Oh. - Oh. - This is a big box. - Big box. So here's the... - It's a wifi connector. - It is not. - It's a video game controller. - No. - I can tell by the weight of it. - No, you can't. - It has a good weight that this is an Nintendo switch. - It's not. It's not, but let me help you open it here. - [Ro] Okay. - Here you go. - Now don't give me hints 'cause I can do this. - Okay. - First it's this little box. Oh, another box. What is this? Is it a part of it, or is it just stuff. - This is here, that's a part of it. - Oh this is very thin. Okay. Here's the three boxes. This is a phone box. So I don't think it's an apple phone. I think it's a phone, but I don't know what kind of a phone it is. And I have no clue what this could be. - Okay. - Maybe it's headphones. (gasps) Yes? - Yeah. - Are you kidding me? - No. - Okay, I was about to say charger. - Two for two - I was about to say a new charger. - Yes - That was my second... - And then what do you think this is? - A case. - Yes. Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! - Are you serious? - Yes. - It's gotta be Samsung. Right? - No. What else is there? - Googles? - Yes. Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! - Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. There we go. - Okay. But what's exciting about this, Is this. - This, clean foam boxes - Is their Mandalorian Star Wars AR experience collaboration? - (gasps) Shut up. - Yes. So I've had this on my shelf and I have been meaning to open this. And finally, today is the day is the day. - Didn't plan this, I'm matching. - Okay. Ro, are you ready for the next one? - I'm ready, I'm feeling good. I'm feeling more confident. It's square, It's light. This is... - [Justine] Oh, there you go. Yeah. It's opening. - This box opens very easily. Very nice. This is foam. - So, there's the item. - This is a glass, this is a glass. Oh gosh, what is this? - I mean, if you guess this, I will, I will... don't even know what I'll do. I'll probably go to the nearest... - What the heck is this? A GPS? A GPS. - That is not a GPS. - This is a... Justine, I mean, what the heck? This is a GPS. - It's not a GPS Do you want me to tell you how much that costs what you're holding in your hand right now? - This is a... Yes, please tell me how much this is. That will help me. - That cost about $2,000. (playful music) - This little piece of metal? - That little piece of metal. - It's a TV. (laughs) - No, that's not a TV. - I can feel the screen. It's a mirror that you hold up to your face, and it scans your face, And it tells you your fitness facts. I'd pay two grand for that. - I would too. For it to tell me my heart rate and stuff and be like. - No. - No? - So there's only a hundred pieces of this specific item worldwide. (gasps) - Are you serious? - It is machined case from Aerospace Grade Titanium. - This is a limited piece of metal, costing $2,000, fits in the palm of your hand, has a screen on it, but it's not a TV, it's a computer. - This is number five of a hundred made. - And it doesn't have a GPS? - No. - Wait, let me see if there's any hints in here, - I don't think so. I don't think there's gonna be any. - It's a projector. - No. - You put it here. It projects what you're seeing on... - No. Do you want me to give you another hint? - I can't... Yeah! - So it has something to do with cryptocurrency. (upbeat mischievous music) - It mines crypto diamonds. It organizes your finances. - Well - Yes? Oh my gosh. - Do you wanna take your blindfold off? - Yes, I would like to see 'cause I'm very confused. I really thought it was a holograph machine. - So did I, and I know what it is. 'Cause you had me sold. - I'm looking at this and the brand name and I still could not tell you to save my life, what this is. - So it's a Trezor, basically like a wallet that stores your crypto keys on. - What the heck? - So it's not something that's stored on your phone. Your wallet is actually stored in this device. This is a rose gold. And it's custom made, it's beautiful. - Wow. This is... - I didn't think you were gonna get it, we had to throw a challenge in there. - Oh, wow. I mean, this has really blowing my mind. - It's so pretty and this company also has iPhone cases that are also in this aerospace machine titanium. This is their rose gold one, which is my favorite color. - Wow, It's Beautiful. - It's really pretty. - I mean, this is gorgeous and it's so heavy, it's heavy. - We have one more item. - Oh, ooh! Okay, okay, I'm ready. (excitement laugh) - [Justine] All right. - [Ro] this is so fun. - [Justine] This is great. - Oh, yes. Here's the opening. I'm gonna be careful because it's tech stuff. I don't wanna break it. - It's okay. - Oh, it's a box within a box, - Ooh, Surprise. - [Ro] Which is usually the case with these things. - [Justine ] And, we don't have to worry about the box on this one. This one doesn't need to be saved. - Oh, this is like another box, another, oh, I got it. I got it. - Cool. - Okay. (upbeat mysterious music) - Okay. That's all that's in there. - Oh, no. (mysterious music) Oh geez. What's this? Is this food product? You know what, Justine, this feels like a drawing rack. Where's that box? - Oh here it is, right here. - What's in there? - Here. - What's in... Oh, this is your charger. - Yeah - Okay, so charge, so something... Okay. (exhales) Is this some type of... It's a display? - What even would I display and why would I wanna put something in it? - iPad. - Okay. Yes. All right. - You could put an iPad here. - Yes, and what else? - You could display something that would fit in here. - [Justine] I don't know. - You could put... Would that fit there. - What's this? Oh, It's a phone charger. - Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! - It's a phone charging station. - Yes. - Its a phone charger station display unit. - You can charge all kinds of different devices. - Okay, I was right you guys. - Yeah. - Okay, I think I can half a point. - And look, you can also do wireless charging here too. - This is so cool. - Super cool. - Ro, thank you so much for doing this unboxing. This is actually really fun. (laughs) - Thank you for planning this, this was really exciting. - To be to fair, even if I wasn't unboxing it blindfolded, I don't even know if I would have been able to get them. So, you did a great job. - Some of these, I felt like I understood the ballpark, but there was a few like that... - The tech wallet. - The tech wallet. - That's fine. - There was no way. - I did not expect you to get that. It's okay. - This whole time, I'm like, it's a hologram. (laughs) It's a hologram device from the future. - It's a really good guess though. (laughs) - So I'm gonna put Ro's links down below where you can see a video that we did over on her channel. We have so many fun videos together. - Yes. - I Also have a full playlist of all of the videos that we've ever done and there's, I mean, there's something like 80 something. There's a lot. - Yeah, millions. - So you guys need to have fun wild marathon weekend. We've got a lot of content for you. - Woo woo woo. So many. It's basically a TV show on it's 16th season. - Maybe we should release it on Blu-ray. - Yes. - Why not? - I'll give it to my mom for the holidays. - She's gonna be like, I don't want this. - She's like over it? She watches all my videos. - She's like, I've already seen this. - She'll be like I've already seen this. - We can do a director's cut. (gasps) Like commentary over it. - Oh, yes. - Oh, cool. - Like, mystery science theater. - Yes. - I love that show. - Don't you have this theater in here? - I do. - Oh my Gosh. - We could sit in the front row and just talk smack about ourselves. - Love it. Well, we'll see you guys in our next video. Don't forget to like, comment, subscribe, hit the freaking bell. - Ding! - And, that's it. We'll see you guys later. - [Both] Bye. (upbeat music)",

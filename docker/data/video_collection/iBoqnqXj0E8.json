    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine, and today I'm extremely excited because I'm giving away a HomePod! So, if you guys are new here you might not know that I am obsessed with Apple and I love my HomePod. I've made so many videos about it so if you haven't seen those, they're somewhere here on the Internet that you can find. For this giveaway I'm teaming up with Goldieblox and she is hilarious. She does all kinds of really cool DIY videos for kids using tech and science. Next month she has a show coming out called Robot Runway and it's basically just what you would think. Kids making robots and then the robots face off on a runway. I absolutely love the concept and I'm so excited to see the show. But if you guys wanna win the HomePod, all you have to do is make sure you subscribe to my channel, to Goldieblox's channel, and leave a comment on this video. I'll also put a link in the description so you guys can check out the video on the Goldieblox channel talking about the giveaway. She's also throwing in one of these really cool wrench necklaces which is reflecting off of my lights right here. This is an official sign that you are a part of the Goldieblox squad. So guess what? I think this means I'm a part of the squad now. Anyway, moving on to the Ask iJ episode, you guys asked me questions and I'm about to answer them. I'm gonna put my HomePod off to the side. This isn't the one that you're winning, cause this one's mine. Have you guys ever had Blackberry Cucumber La Croix? La crooks, la cricks, la croc, the cricket? I still can't tell if I like this flavor, but I keep drinking it and I keep buying it. So I'm pretty sure I like it. What are your thoughts on the Fortnite Battle Royal? From SquidPlayzz. Oh boy, I've been trying to avoid playing this game because I knew that it is one of those games that will suck me in and I'm not gonna wanna do anything else. Which is fine, if you don't have anything else to do. Or if you do have things that you can just put off, put to the side and focus on playing video games. Which I feel like unfortunately, my time has been very limited lately, so, if I want to play video games then something else in my life has to sacrifice like making videos or trying to further my career of doing whatever it is that I'm doing. But I have started playing and I've been really, really, really enjoying it. I've been enjoying it, and so has my dog. Oh I know what you're saying, \"Oh, he's playing with the controller.\" But don't worry, he also can play with the mouse, too. Cyberpunk2098 wants to know if I'm gonna showcase my lavender S9. And oh my goodness, am I ever. If I can find... Okay, here it is. Hopefully you can see it, my lights are very bright. Like it just, it really, really looks good. Some of you guys might be here because the title of this video said S9 Vlog. These are some clips that I shot while I was in Hawaii. I planned on doing a bigger camera review video of the S9, but everyone at this point has already done it. So I thought, hey, I've got the footage, let's put it into another video. So, here it is. This is my vlog from Hawaii, all shot on the S9. (upbeat pop music) Look at this slug! Oh my goodness. It's disgusting. Eugh, he smells! We are about to go on a hike, but it's basically a thousand steps all the way up to the top of this mountain. It's the Koko Head Crater Trail. Jen, I don't think you're going the right way. (upbeat pop music) Do you guys know what these shoes mean? If you do, comment below. Oh, there it is. This is the beginning of the end. So we started the trail at 8:08, let's see how long it takes. How long do you think it's gonna take? - I dunno. (upbeat pop music) - There's also a gun range over there, but as you can see here, these completely do not touch the ground. It just goes straight to the ground, there's holes and people are struggling. We're gonna be struggling. Here we go. I don't really sweat a lot, but this might be one of the most exhausting things I've done in a very long time. Almost there, so close. If you noticed, Jenna has passed me up and she's already at the top. Hey, Jen. - Made it. - Barely, we're gonna have to get a helicopter. I need to be droned down to the bottom. So we officially, officially, officially made it to the top. We are here and we have to go back down. This view is so awesome, though. Definitely worth it. That's the end of this vlog because I need to focus on walking down these steps and not hurting myself. Josh is asking, what is one product that you might want Apple to make that they have yet to make? For example, a TV or high-end headphones. One of the things that I love about Apple is they have a tendency to find something wrong with something, and then fix it. For example, the music industry. They completely turned the music industry all around years ago, when they announced the iPod and iTunes. Then, when they announced the iPhone, did it again with smartphones. Also with the Apple Watch, granted, Smartwatch technology wasn't a new thing, but I feel like with the Apple Watch, it made it something that everyone wanted and everyone could have. I know there's a ton of other options but for me, I have absolutely loved my Apple Watch and I've used it pretty much almost every day since I got one, years ago. So what is that next thing, or problem that Apple is going to solve? Television is a very, very interesting sector. Because, if you guys haven't been reading in the news, Apple has been buying a lot of content recently. They opened up a studio here in Los Angeles, and they have all kinds of original programming coming out in the next couple of years. So I'm very excited to see what they do in that realm. Will they come out with a television of their own? I don't know. But that's definitely something that I'm extremely excited for. Another thing that I'm excited for that I haven't seen any mention of recently, is the Powermat. They announced it at WWDC, and I have been waiting, fingers crossed. I'd say I was waiting patiently, but I'm not really that patient. I want this thing now. I wanna be able to charge my AirPods, I wanna be able to charge my Apple Watch and my phone at the same time. That was what the whole intention of the Powermat, Power-air, air... The Airpower? Did I even answer your question? I don't even remember what your question was. Jacob wants to know where did I get that retro Mac picture? So, this photo here was my Senior picture. I have told this story a few times, so if you've heard this, pardon me while I burst into flames. Incubus, thank you. Pardon me while I burst into flames Anyway, I made my Mom drag this entire computer into the photo studio because I demanded that this be my Senior Photo. She's like, why don't you just get like, a normal picture? I'm like, no, this is it! This is what I want. My mom, being amazing as she is, she let me do this and lugged this whole computer in for this photo session. So this is probably around 2001. I graduated high school 2002, so I think the photo was actually taken around 2001. Then, this past, I don't know, like couple weeks, I decided that I wanted to recreate that picture. So that's where this came from. And then of course, the meme that was ever so popular, the if you don't love me when, then you don't deserve me, whatever. I think it's a very silly meme, but I though this was the perfect opportunity to make this meme work in my favor. Or not in my favor, I'm not sure. To be decided. Hunter, wow, these are a couple of questions, wants to know, would you ever surprise Jenna with a dog, how do I like Nintendo Labo, and what's my favorite color? Surprise Jenna with a dog, I probably would not do that because I think surprising somebody with a dog is quite possibly the worst thing that you could ever do. That person might not be ready for it, it might not be the dog that they had wanted, even though I'm sure if you gave them a dog they would love it regardless. But that's really not a good idea and I don't think I would ever, ever surprise Jenna with a dog because if I did, it technically would be probably partially my dog as well, because if she can't watch it, I would be watching it. And when I can't watch him, she would have both Maddie and her dog. Wow, I don't know. There's too much that goes into that and I don't think that you should ever surprise somebody with a dog, unless they're ready. Because there's a huge percentage of dogs that are given as gifts, and then they end up at shelters. So, please, do not surprise somebody with a dog. Nintendo Labo, yes, I love it. It's so much fun. I haven't got a chance to build any other things since I posted this video, but if you haven't checked that out, feel free to do so. I'm excited to build some more things from the variety kit. If you guys want me to do a livestream, maybe I'll do that, cause I feel like making an entire 'nother video about building the items. Not sure if you'd want that but a live stream could be fun. I could chat with you guys while I'm building. Tyler wants to know if I'm gonna open a giant Oreo factory. I got so many incredible memes from you guys from that Oreo video. I was dying just reading Twitter and you guys are too much, I love it, thank you. Marcus has asked me if I'm excited for this years iPhone. Ugh, yeah, you better believe it. Hello! I've got an I in front of my name. And we have one last question here from Jonathan asking if I'm ever gonna come to Canada again, if I will go to Comic-Con or the Entertainment Expo. I would love to, I had a really great time in Canada and if you're from Canada, I would like for you to leave a comment below. I don't know, something cool about Canada. Where should I visit? Where should I go? What should I do? I've only been there a few times so I would love to go up and visit you guys again. Well, thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed this quick little Ask iJ episode. I love answering your questions and it's always so much fun to talk to you guys. And don't forget, I am doing the HomePod giveaway. So be sure to be subscribed to my channel, to Goldieblox's channel, leave a comment below. My dog is barking. And also there is a link in the description to check out Goldieblox's video talking about the contest. So, with that being said, I'm gonna go and make sure my dog's alright, because he is barking up a storm downstairs. I'll see you guys later. I know! He probably just wants to play Fortnite again. That's my dog. (upbeat pop music)",

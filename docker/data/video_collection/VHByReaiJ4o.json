Check out their new EVO 15-S system at:   The team at LMG are a diverse bunch with a wide-ranging skillset - and they often use those skills to cast a critical eye on the choices Linus makes with his setups. Today though, we play the uno reverse card: its time for Linus and Luke to judge the choices their own staff make, and publicly roast their setups!

    "transcript": "- Our team here at Linus Tech Tips may be world class, but boy can they ever be critical. \"Hey, Linus, you spend ages on a fancy RGB reservoir and then you covered it up with a mouse pad.\" - [Luke] \"Cool server rack, Linus. Why do you paint it bright pink?\" - Well, I'm sick and tired of all of this nonsense, and it's time for me to hit back with some help from Luke. We got our staff to send in pictures of their battle stations at home, and we're gonna see how closely they follow their own CEO's advice. - But there's a catch. We have no idea which setup belongs to which employee. - Which means we're gonna have to guess. And it also means this video is sponsored by ORIGIN PC. Their EVO15-S thin and light gaming laptop has this fancy HD UV printing. Or you can get laser etching, which would make it really easy to identify people's computers. - We'll do our best. - Without further a due. Computer zero is looking pretty zero right outta the gate. (Luke laughing) That's frikkin' disgusting. - This is worse than mine. - [Linus] This hair here though. - [Luke] That means they have airflow problems. It's trying to pull in through the gaps. - What the heck? You know what's really gross about this? Is that this is actually a decent machine. - [Luke] Hard disk plus 2TB- Wait, is there no SSD? - You have a 2080 and you don't have an SSD? - I don't see one. (Luke laughs) - Like I'm not shaming you. I'm not being like, \"Oh, you're too poor for an SSD.\" SSDs aren't expensive anymore. 2080s are. Ew. Okay. - Why even get tempered glass if you're just gonna make it horrible? - Why would you send this picture? Like this desk setup is pretty sick. \"Nae a numpty.\" What the hell? Whoever it is games, needs extra batteries. - Vapes. - Oh wait, vapes. - I have no idea. - I'm guessing Dan. - [Crew] It's Scott. - Scott, what a dick. - Why don't you have an SSD, Scott? - You know what? I should have known from the mug. It had to be someone with an accent. A foreigner. Sick rig, bro. - [Luke] Okay, this is a lot better. - Wow. - That's very clean. - 30 Series. Did I build this? - Gotta love the der8auer. - Yeah, I built this. Wait, no, hold on. This isn't Nicole's room. Whose room is this? - [Luke] Are their blinds like shredded? - \"I don't want to see the light.\" Whoever it is still lives at home, because otherwise there's no way you put your TV in your bedroom. They're into records. Wait. Oh, there's pictures! There's pictures. Okay. They're white. Hey, that narrows it down a fair bit. - [Luke] They also have sunscreens so that backs that idea up. - SPF50. (Linus and Luke laughing) Okay. Definitely a creative type. I am saying Emily Seddon. - I have no idea. - [Crew] It is Sven. - Sven? - I like your setup, Sven. - I've hardly met Sven so I wouldn't have had a chance. Sven works in sales. Okay, Luke, you've gotta start guessing. (crew laughing) - Yeah. Yeah. - [Linus] Oh, my God. I don't recognize any of these. I don't know. - [Luke] I have no idea. - [Crew] It's the writer of this video. - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. - [Crew] The grills on the top. - I'm starting to panic a little bit. - [Luke] Very fresh and clean. - I don't think I'm going to get any of these. (crew laughing) No, I'm not. I don't know who this. - [Luke] I have a guess for this one. - Wait, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. This is like development stuff. Okay. Who is it? Luke, help me out here. This has gotta be your team. Oh, it's gotta be Peter then. - [Luke] Yeah. - Okay. (crew applauds) We got one. We've got one. This is too easy, Peter. Peter works on our internal like inventory management system. This is a sick setup. It's also Nicholas Plouffe's. - [Crew] Yeah. (crew laughs) - I love that it is even worse, even more cluttered, after I fixed it. - [Luke] There's a lot of things going on though. - There's a lot going on. - [Luke] It's fun and interesting. - Oh, my God. Plouffe, it's still not cool to clip your nails at your desk, and it's especially not cool to pluck at your desk. Plouffe's one of those guys that manages to make things dirtier by cleaning them. I swear to God. I left this system looking pretty shiny. Look at this side panel. - [Luke] Yeah, I noticed that as you said it. - [Linus] He used a dirty ass cloth to clean his glass side panel. - Or like a sweaty shirt or something. - [Linus] Nothing can surprise me after I saw that gross pizza board that he had though. It wasn't as dirty as this workspace. - [Luke] So this is the keyboard building station. - Yeah. You'd think you'd get bored of building keyboards. - [Luke] You'd think. - It means it's right in the name. Okay. I got two. - [Luke] You don't have to open it. - Why? It doesn't do anything. Well, whatever. No, I'll do what I want. How does everyone here have such like baller, amazing rigs? - [Luke] The lighting's uneven. - [Linus] What am I looking at? Oh, this is Ed. Wait. No, it's not. Wait. Yes it is? - This looks like a setup that Ed would do and have. - Yeah, but there's calipers on the table. This cable management is also better than Ed would do. (crew laughing) But this desk pad hanging on one side off the desk seems deliciously Ed. - [Luke] Which side is the employee? - [Linus] I don't know. SOs steal LTT store stuff all the time. It's good stuff. You should check it out. - I only have like half of mine left. - I'm sorry. I don't know. - [Crew] It's Callanan. - Nick Callanan. - So now go right. Use arrow key. Go right. - [Linus] \"Please roast it to medium rare.\" - For the amount of space that they have, this looks pretty good. - This is kind of sweet. - It's really clean. - You got that power play. You got that sick keyboard. - Very few visible cables. - Got the tissues right there. Man, this way you can reach them from the bed or the computer. I bet there's a VR headset in here. I don't know. - [Crew] Matthew Luu. - Oh. I didn't even think of that. Yeah, Matthew from Creator Warehouse would totally be this aesthetic. Whoever this is, doesn't know how to use- Wait. - [Luke] What? - [Linus] What am I looking at? - [Luke] A Panasonic desktop editor. - [Linus] This iMac is a server? You're using a drobo? This has to be Mark from the editing team. Yeah, this is Mark. Power for access point. Wait, wait. This is a next level hack. Luke, do you see what's happening here? - I do see what's happening there. It's actually pretty cool. - They're using their built-in vacuum conduit to run ethernet. How big is this brain? - Oh, my goodness. This is quite the write up too that you should have gotten to with arrow keys. (crew laughing) - \"This is my home server. My DAS,\" direct attached storage, for those of you who rightly are not familiar with anything other than NAS, because it's stupid. - Very cool vacuum cabling setup though. - Very cool. I love this setup. - I hate the mouse pad. - What? - [Luke] It's so small! - [Linus] Okay. Yeah, but it's cool. - [Luke] It's like unusably small. - [Linus] It's cool though. - What's the wood thing? I guess just a shelf with nothing on it? - Yeah. Yeah. - It's not holding the monitor up. - No, it's not. Oh, that's interesting. - It looks nice. - It holds the PS4 and this hard drive. - It holds them down. - Got a hard drive there. - It looks nice though. - These look like real plants. So whoever it is, you know, cares about. - It looks very nice, clean, fresh. I like the aesthetic. Don't like that the cooler's positioned weirdly. - [Linus] I mean, yes. There's only so much you can do. - Put the logo properly though. - [Linus] I know. And really, you have a Blu-ray drive. Who would be enough of a median- - \"4k optical drive LOL.\" (Luke laughs) That's correct. - [Crew] Marcus. - Marcus from the editing team. Okay. - Yes. - Ew! - TIE fighter. Let's go! - No! I don't like the horizontal dual-vertical. I also don't like computers that don't have their monitors upgradable. I think this is- This doesn't have enough Nintendo (beep) to be Lloyd. Wait, \"Startup Disk Lloyd.\" Okay. It's Lloyd. 'Cause I was thinking Lloyd! - I like the TIE fighter. I'm down with the TIE fighter. - I'm not down with the TIE fighter. - I can't run it myself. It drives me nuts. I like one vertical on the side and then horizontal, horizontal. - Lloyd, this is no excuse. Get an LTT desk pad on there. - Yeah, 'cause your mouse pad sucks. It's also in a really weird orientation. - [Linus] Yeah. Acceptable cable management. - [Luke] What are they watching? Is this a hint? Does this help us? I have no idea. Dota, Dota 2. - Oh, rocking the laptop daily driver with the stand. Oh, speaking of laptops, I guess we should probably tell you a little bit about the sponsor of today's video. This ORIGIN PC machine is sick. It's got a core i7 12700H, which will boost up to 4.7 gigahertz, an RTX 3070ti, in spite of its slim profile, 32GB of RAM, a terabyte of storage, it's of course our MP600, and probably most importantly, a 1440P, 15.6 inch, 240 hertz display. So it's super smooth for gaming. - Magic mouse pad with another mouse pad beside of it neither of which are the LTT mouse pad. - [Linus] Whoa. Someone's a hardcore Dota player. - Oh. Oh. And LTT store is there. Okay. You should figure this out. - Oh, this is another developer. - I should have put this together like insanely faster. I apologize to who this is. - Konrad? - Yeah. Dota 2, man. He's like insanely good at Dota 2. - Oh, okay. All right. - You need a new mouse pad though. Oh, look at the wrist rest. - [Linus] Whoever it is has even an oilier body than you. - [Luke] Yeah, that's gross. That's really bad. - Oh. - Oh, wow. It looks like- (Luke laughs) Yeah, that looks bad. It looks organic. - [Linus] It looks like a 20 year old potato. - Yeah. It doesn't look like your wrist rest. It looks like it grew from the desk and formed to just where their wrist was. I do appreciate the honesty in the photos. - [Linus] Yeah. - [Luke] I think that LTT water bottle has like grime on the bottom. - Yeah. No offense to you all, but like gamers should not own white things. \"We have three cats. Sue me.\" Okay. Well, it's Jonathon because he left his name in the screenshot. You know, for developers, our developers are not very security conscious. Okay. Knife enthusiast. - [Luke] Whoa. - [Linus] Which doesn't narrow it down that much, honestly. I know Ed, Emily, and some of the logistics folks are into knives. I think Jamie's into Knives. Baseball. Oh, Brock University. Oh, all right. It was one of my three. It's Jamie. Got 'em! - [Crew] Nice. - Were there gonna be records? You weren't even gonna gimme the records as a hint? Are those tires? - Snuck in the water bottle. Those are tires. - Are those tires next to- Wait, what? Why do you have tires in here, bruh? Not bad. - [Luke] Clean. - [Linus] It's clean. I like the lighting. Whoever this is knows how to take a picture, plays guitar. - I'm convinced already. - Is this Nick? - Oh, that cable management. - I remember this thing. This thing was super cool. There was a period where there were motherboards that just didn't have enough USB-2 headers and it seemed like there was this proliferation of USB-2 things, like, you know, every RGB thing in your thing had to plug into a separate header. So this was a way to take one header and turn it into a bunch of headers. - I also think it's kind of neat that they have their peripherals in there. If the connection is still good, then we're good. I'm like pretty convinced I know who this is. - [Linus] Okay. You gotta help me then. - Jadeon? - [Crew] Yeah! Nice. - I've been nailing. I think I've gotten everyone on my team so far. - Your team's a lot smaller (beep). Okay, we got the Flex Seal, we got the lube. - [Luke] Got candles. - Oh, my God. There's the trifecta. They've got that same stupid light that you have, Brandon. What the hell? Also, is that a Power Mac G5 kicking? - [Luke] With a legendary cooler in front of it. The chair's seen better days. It's okay. So has mine. - That's an LGTV monitor. Got the color calibrator. Okay, I'm gonna take the screwdriver hint. Maybe it's Kyle. I've never seen his setup. - [Crew] It's Hoffmann. - Hoffmann? Wait, what? I was at Hoffmann's place. And the LGTV remote. How did I not get this? - \"Oh, your team's much smaller. Except I've literally been in this location.\" I've never seen any of their setups before. I've never been to any of their houses. - The speakers. How did I miss this? That is embarrassing. Let's edit it so that it seems like I got it. Hoffmann, are you editing this video? Can you edit this together so it seems like I got it? This is an old system. Rockin' the Z-680s- No, this was the Z5500 or whatever. - [Luke] Zoom out slightly. - [Linus] Chronicles of Riddick. - [Luke] I think it's 2006. Yeah. - [Linus] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Got that Logisis, Logisis case. Water cooling. Okay, so you OG enthusiast. Old school nerd. San Diego. Got the code name. - There's a lot of things in this photo that I thought were wicked at this time. - Sick setup. Who's this? - [Harrison] Hello. - I thought we already saw your setup. Oh, you put in two setups. That's cheating! That's hacks! And your external water cooler is stupid. (everyone laughs) Whoa! We got our first Radeon gamer. - [Luke] Oh. - [Linus] I don't like this. - Ah. This literally looks like it was thrown on the desk. - Okay. You have a desk pad. So why would you put a (beep)tastic like giveaway quality, tiny mouse pad on top of it? And Smurfs aren't cool. Okay, now I'm in a bad mood. And these little Poppit things, my kids play with those. Grow up. - Hey. Hey. Hey. - That's probably too- - You're going too far, Linus! - I've gone too far. I've gone too far. Imma dial it back. Imma dial it back. How did you get your chair in here? You got your router here. - I think it's a perspective thing. I think the router's up on a desk and just barely- Mmm. - [Linus] And your monitor's broken. \"In the pic of my monitor, it just does that sometimes.\" - Like why is there this massive gap between your monitors? - [Linus] Yeah. That's pretty awful. - Like, how do you even use your keyboard? Where do your legs go? - [Linus] Yeah. - [Luke] It's not like- Ugh! This whole setup's driving me nuts. Is this person really tiny? Are they really small? - I don't know who this is. - I'm assuming it's a small person. - This is Emily. You know what? Man, now I feel really awkward about thinking that Emily had some of those sick setups that I saw before. Emily, it's kind of slobby. Not gonna lie. - Just put things like together and stuff. - Thought you were cool, bro. Whoa. Yeah. What's with these tiny pictures? - [Luke] Big swooping desk so you're sitting on a bit of a circle. - Why did you just like nail the carcass of an animal to your wall? - And poorly. (Luke and Linus laughing) - It's not even artful. - It's like flopping over. - It's just there. - Those pictures are so not even. You didn't even try. Oh, man. Dig the speakers that goes with the cool under-table sound setup. That really needs some cable management. - [Linus] Yeah. This is cool. So we have another musician here. Oh, my God. Is this that NAS chassis? - [Luke] With a pedal in front of it. - [Linus] Someone bought this. - [Luke] SOI because they didn't watch any of my videos. - [Linus] Ew. You don't even use a Mac and you use that God awful Mac keyboard? - [Luke] And a turned vertical mouse pad. - [Linus] Yeah. What is that? - [Luke] That's what I was saying. - What the- Are these 3090s? What the (beep) is this competing? - Hey, you did it right! Good job. - \"Power rails are garbage.\" What are you talking about? - [Crew] It's Dan. - It's Dan. Oh, man. I should just start taking wild swings at these. - What do you need all that power for, Dan? I understand the audio setup now. That makes sense. But the graphics cards. Streamer. - [Linus] Hundred percent streamer. - [Luke] Nice setup. I know this one. I know this one. I know this one. I know this one. - You do? - You have to guess. I'm a hundred percent certain. No question. I know who this. - Crap. Well, I know one of the accounting people has this. - Are those all pictures to the right of their desk that they haven't hung? They should be fired for that. - I love it. I love it. That's an exhaust. So that's after it's already gone through these fins, like the front of this computer must be freaking disgusting. There isn't even a picture. Yeah. You knew better. No, hold on. This looks like a kid thing. They have kids. They have kids. - Okay. Okay. He's narrowing it down. - That narrows it down a lot. - Who has houses? How many people have houses? - The most houses? Well, me. (everyone laughing) Okay, stop. Hold on. Who has the most houses? - Oh, my God. How did that not do it? How do you give a hint more blatant than that? - Wait. Is it Colton? - Yes! Oh, my goodness. - Actually, it's true. Colton has a lot more houses than me. That's a stupid place for his computer. - Well, I think he needed it for the baby room. - Oh, his computer room's a nursery now. This is a sick setup. - [Luke] I like it. Are they in a loft? - [Linus] I really like this. - I enjoy how this is like the fun and activity zone because they have like the computer and all that kind of stuff. And then they clearly do some work or modification or whatever on the left and then more on the left from there there's like board games and all this other kinda stuff. This is like the \"I'm gonna come do stuff and have fun.\" I like this area. - [Linus] I like this setup. Got the screwdriver already. Most people don't have the screwdriver yet. Got the full LTT fan setup? - That's pretty sick. I don't like, again, the EK logo is the wrong direction. - Oh, my God. - It bothers me. - Get over it. Got the CRT back there. - Stream deck with a nice streaming camera. - LTX 2019. Rainbow Six Siege first place. So this is Chase? - [Crew] Yes. - Oh, okay. 'Cause nobody else, who isn't David, would have a Rainbow Six Siege trophy. All right, I got it. Yes! - Cool setup, Chase. Okay. - [Linus] Well, this is Brandon's. (Luke laughs) See you later. Okay, car person. Wait, what? What the hell? Oh, it's gotta be Andy then. It's Andy. Okay, done. - That makes sense. - Wall-mounted PlayStation. Okay. - How do you not recognize the ones that you like did? - Well, because it's changed. Andy didn't have a butcher block thing. He had a small- Oh, the small farm factor machine is still here. But the Mac, the Honda thing here. The fact that he has this awful light on his monitor. The wall-mounted TV, which has moved. - [Luke] I have no desire to have it. But I just want to have it to bug Linus. Mic stand with no mic on it. Bit cringe. (Linus laughs) - [Linus] Yeah. - A very cool setup for back then. I like their older setup more than I like their newer setup. - [Linus] Yeah. Get wrecked. - I don't think the old photo's gonna help you. - Well, the old photo tells me a lot more than this generic ass new setup. - This is VFX artists react. Do you have anyone that does that a lot? That is also into keyboards? - Oh, yeah. Wow. Nice keyboard. - Yeah. - I don't know. - [Crew] Antoine. - Antoine. Okay. Yep. Antoine's actually our keyboard guy for Labs. Wow. Do not do that. That's not cool. Hard drives- - Don't angle them. I'm down with, you know, being kind of not great with the mounting of drives, but don't angle it like that. Scrolling on the blades of the fans on those lower (indistinct). - [Linus] Ew. (crew laughing) - [Luke] Those look like webs. - That's dusting. I mean, no wonder you use industrial PPC fans because you're never gonna dust your computer, not once. - [Luke] Whoa, that's wide. - [Linus] What am I even looking at? \"Please don't do drugs.\" Okay. I have no idea then. Writing team? Oh, my God. It's gotta be Tanner. (crew laughing) Oh sh- Wait, no. This isn't Anthony's machine is it? No, I built Anthony's machine. Okay, hold on. Hold on. (beep) off, guys. I'm going around the room, okay? Oh, my God. Adam, really? - [Crew] Yep. - But Adam's technical. (crew laughs) I mean they all are on the writing team. I hate it. We hired this guy? To give people tech advice? Look for some cheats here. - [Luke] There's a big one. - [Linus] We're actually cool in high school and you're James. - [Luke] Yeah. - Got it. Where's your computer, bro? Is that it down there? - Maybe. - \"Motherboard got nucked when my wife blew the breaker before I got a UPS.\" Ooh, too soon, bruh! Too soon. - [Luke] The company's not gone. - [Linus] Yeah. I know that Anthony has a huge collection of old console crap, but it's like back east or something. - [Luke] Some of mine, too. - Okay, we've got the legs in here. Got a bulge. Got a nice, big bulge. So that's good for you. Oh, wait. Oh, this is David. This is really awkward me talking about this right in front of you. - That's why I said how, I was like, how does he not know yet? This is crazy. - Well, no- - How do you not know anything about the people you work with? - There's other people that have old console stuff. - So this one has a lot of hints. First of all, there's the clear Xboxs, which he's been tweeting about a fair amount. - [Linus] I don't follow you guys on Twitter. I just do not open that tab on Twitter. I only look at at my notifications. That's it. If you mention me I'll see it. But other than that, I don't see it. - So vain. - What do you mean \"vain?\" - Then you literally see his legs and his setup. - Yeah, no, the TV I recognize. The TV I recognize. And the fit legs. You got fit legs, David. - [Crew] And the bulge. - Whoa! (Luke laughs) - [Luke] Oh, that's so cool. - [Linus] Whoa. And you couldn't even be arsed to send us some more pictures or do a writeup. - [Luke] Yeah, there's like no hints in here. But that's sick though. - Is that half-inch hardline tubing? What? - [Luke] That's wicked. - Maybe Jake's upgraded. - [Crew] Gary. - Head of the Labs, former marketing manager for Asus, reppin' the brand. - Has a super cool setup. Makes sense. - Has a super sick setup. I knew he went Threadripper. He was like, \"Yeah. After being in charge of selling this stuff for so long, it's nice to be genuinely enthused for something for a change.\" - Oh. - [Linus] Oh, oh, oh. - [Luke] Where are these cables going? - [Linus] Okay. Maybe we could like dust for fingerprints here and see like- What is this? Do you have like moisture problems in your walls or what? Look at this audio setup though. Wait, we already saw Dan. - [Luke] Look, they have it like suspended from- It's not actually attached to the ceiling. - Shut up. That's like Ace tier audio treatment. Okay. Who takes this this seriously? \"My setup before was pretty minimal, but kind of interesting.\" Is that a bone saw? (crew laughs) Are you threatening me? - This setup's really cool. And looks like very custom, which I'm totally into. - [Linus] \"My Vancouver setup. My stuff is still in storage, so I borrowed a computer.\" - Oh, no! - [Linus] \"Discover Canada study guide.\" - So relatively new employee, outside of the country, had to move local. - Oh, Sam from the lab. I wish I had a checklist so I at least knew which ones I'd seen already. Okay. Sick setup, Sam. Love it. - That's really cool. I love that, just mop. (Luke chuckling) - [Linus] Yeah. There's some clothes. - Playing \"WoW.\" - [Linus] External monitor- Yeah, playing some \"WoW.\" - No UI mods though so that's cringe. (Linus laughs) - [Linus] Open backed headphones. - [Luke] That's a yikes. - Hanging off this poor three-and-a-half millimeter jack with an adapter in the middle of a kitchen. \"Submitting for the memes: call it the just moved in setup.\" I don't even know who moved recently. - [Crew] Angus. - Angus. Oh, accounting. - [Luke] A lot of laptop setups. - [Linus] Yeah, a lot of laptop setups. But there's also a desktop, so. - Yeah. Controller for each console. - What the (beep)? Are you guys trying to mess with us? I mean, this one's more square in fairness. But the graphic is- (Luke giggling) I feel like it's time. I feel like it's time to disclose the real purpose of this. All the people who are monstrous enough to put their mouse pad like this are fired. - Yeah. Yeah. Good, good. - And you too, Adam, for that hard drive. \"No cable management because my girlfriend rearranges her apartment every few weeks so it's just a hassle.\" - Honestly, I liked the rest of it more. So maybe that's her input, because the plant and the little thing that's on the wall and stuff is actually kind of nice. - [Linus] Yeah. That's all fine. - [Luke] The setup's like definitely not the desk I would go with. I hate really, really, really tall desktops. - This looks really uncomfortable. - Yeah, that mouse pad. You have so much room on your desk, too. - Is it just sitting there? They're just sitting there. Leave them here. - Yeah. - [Crew] Sean. - You can do better, Sean. - Sean from the business team. - It's not your girlfriend's fault because she's moving the apartment around. You just didn't put the stuff on your desk properly. And you can get a new mouse pad. - [Linus] Is this a Power Mac G3? Is that a bunk bed? - Legit. That's the only one you're gonna give us? Come on. - You know what? No, Jonathan Horst. - [Crew] Correct. - Got it! I know he has a Hackinosh, I remember that from this interview. - That's pretty cool. - [Linus] Oh. Racing. Racing sim thing. That's Arlo. - [Luke] Yeah, okay, there we go. - If I know the cat's name, Jake, don't take this the wrong way, your cat's fat. Looks like he's gonna break this butcher block desk. This is definitely stolen from work. This has gotta be stolen from work too. - [Crew] Oh, yes. - [Linus] Oh, yeah. Hundred percent. Hundred percent. Hundred percent. Okay, this is easy. Robert. (crew laughing) Okay. Dude. This though looks like you've probably had it since you were like 12 and your parents probably got it for you. - [Luke] A lot of things here look like that and I'm down with that idea. - [Linus] What the (beep)? - [Luke] Except for that. That's horrible. Why is this a theme? - Okay. Did you guys conspire to do this? - I literally didn't know anyone did this. I didn't know anybody ever did this until now. - Like remember that first wave of gaming laptops that had the touch pad vertical? - [Luke] Yeah and it was stupid. - How stupid it was. This is the equivalent to that. - This looks like fake. This looks like it's rendered. - I already guessed Lloyd, right? Okay. This is someone I've never guessed. Is that a pool? Is this just someone messing with us? - [Crew] No. - [Linus] Because this looks like fricking a tropical oasis out here. - [Luke] Yeah. I'm telling you, it looks like a render. They could live it like an apartment that has a pool. - I don't know anyone in the editing department. - Oh, I was so distracted by how nice everything else looks. Your mouse pad. Come on. I understand that our mouse pad probably wouldn't work in this setup, aesthetically, so that's fine. But neither does that one. - [Linus] Mercedes-Benz. - [Luke] So this person watches F1, I think? 'Cause that's the Mercedes driver, I believe. (Linus stammering) - [Linus] Louis Hamilton. Oh, this has gotta be Maria. - [Crew] Yep. - The fact that it's all Mac, all the time. I actually talked to her SO at a work function and he gets so triggered by her just like Apple fanaticism. We like made fun of her for a while. - The setup looks nice though. I think you'd be more comfortable with a bigger mouse pad. I'm gonna die on that hill. - [Linus] Whoa. This is a cool setup. - [Luke] I love this. - I love it. Got the 3D printer. - [Luke] This is great. Love the PC setup right next to the \"work on things\" setup. - [Linus] Really? You took a picture of your fish? Who cares? That is a clean setup. Like literally, clean. - Or it was cleaned for this. That is a lot of hard drives. Also, yeah, where's the graphics card? - [Linus] Oh, this is the server. - Oh, that makes sense. - Okay. This is a Labs person? I don't know any of the new ones, so there's no point in me guessing them. So, sure, Jake. - [Crew] Tim. - I like your set up, Tim. - (beep). Oh, it's so obvious now. Okay. I didn't really think of Tim as Labs though. He's only sort of Labs. He's like mostly done video stuff so far. - I do think that's all the setups though. - But that's not all for this message from our sponsor, ORIGIN PC. We're gonna have a link below so you can play around with ORIGIN's configuration tool. Full transparency, our EVO15-S came in at just under $2,500, weighs just 3.7 pounds and includes their 24/7 lifetime US-based support for free. Huge thanks to ORIGIN for sponsoring this video, and you guys for watching. If you liked this one, maybe check out the time that we roasted your setups or the time Jake and Anthony roasted Craigslist's ads. Some of those people were asking for absolutely outlandish amounts of money for crappy computers.",

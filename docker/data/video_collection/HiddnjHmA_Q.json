    "transcript": "- Today we have got something in the mail and I'm so excited to try these out. I saw that these were announced fairly recently. These are Razer's Hammerhead True Wireless Earbuds. I feel like this is the earbud season, I think everybody has been launching these things. We've had Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, like everyone is getting into the wireless earbud space. I love Razer, I'm excited to check these out. So let's take them out of their little home. I really like that it says ultra low latency, not only is that great for gaming, but for editing. I just want you guys to know that I changed this light to green for Razer. So, just in case you didn't notice. (knife click) (knife slicing) This knife is so sharp. (knife click) (plastic rustling) How many times can I spin this? Not enough. Ultra low latency, touch-enabled voice assistant, water resistant, Bluetooth 5.0 and auto-pairing, charging case and earbud sleeves, all right. (plastic rustling) (whooshing) I love when I'm greeted with a letter, it's so personal. Oh, I love the packaging. This is nice! I like that they're already out here and displayed. You've got your case, charging cable and our earbuds! We've got our left, we've got our right. Case, cable, I'll just make sure. I just don't wanna be upset later when I find out there was a surprise at the bottom. I definitely thought that Apple was going to go with a matte black earbud this year but so far, I mean the year's not over, but they did just come out with the AirPods Pro and they were not matte black. So let's put these in the charging case. I'm already into it. If these fit in my ear well, I'm gonna be so happy. Oh, look at this! You guys that've been following me for a while, there's one thing that I absolutely love. Whenever I get these cables with point-and-shoot cameras, it's like the best thing ever 'cause I love being able to just attach things to other things. Okay, so my wrist doesn't fit in here. Well actually, it does but I think most people's wrist probably would not fit in here. It fits perfectly on mine! Was this designed with my wrist in mind? Probably not but I think it's wishful thinking. There's no way this will fit on anyone else's wrists. I mean, if you have a small wrist, maybe. Do you think this would fit on yours? - [Cameraman] Could try at it. - It's so small! (laughing) Look at this! - [Cameraman] That's as far as it'll fit. - It's a solid attempt. Hey, your tattoos look cool! So if you have a small wrist this'll work but honestly, this is great to just hook it on to things. Let's just ignore the fact that my dog is barking. It also comes with some little ear covers here so we'll put those on. I wonder if I need to put those on, I almost feel like I don't have to. Do I look cool or what? I already feel cool. Okay, I think I have to put these on. (techno music) (gasps) I love the charging case, charges with USB C. So let's get these paired up to my phone so I can hear what they sound like. (psychedelic music) So here they are, I'm listening to Tool right now. They're also touch sensitive so, if I double tap it'll change the track, which is great. As far as the sound goes I mean, I think they sound pretty good and again these are 100 bucks which is, I think, a pretty good price considering you get the charging case and they're water resistant. So obviously, you're not gonna be getting high-end audio quality out of these things, but for what they are, I like them. I just have a hard time with these types of headphones to fit in my ear, like even AirPods. So these are a little bit bigger than the AirPods. It might be something that you do want to try and test out. So if the AirPods do work for you, these also might work but again, I have weirdly shaped ears and very small so even the AirPods still kind of fall out. So these are much smaller and right now Siri is listening to everything I'm saying. So now I have the AirPods in. So I do think that the AirPods, these are the original version, does feel like there's a little more base. Might put these guys back in. (upbeat music) - Oh yeah, there's definitely more base in the AirPods and here's the Airpods Pro So let's take a look at those in comparison to the Razer Earbuds. Guess as far as size goes, it's almost the same size as the new AirPod Pros but these are like $300. This is a completely unfair comparison. I mean, obviously the AirPods Pro are gonna have a much higher sound quality and of course with the noise cancellation it shuts out everything! (upbeat music) So this was the Razer Hammerhead Wireless Earbuds. Razer has had earbuds like this in the past but they weren't wireless. So, this is exciting that they're also getting into the game but honestly, it is so overwhelming like I said earlier, I can't believe how many companies are coming out with something very similar to this. So to all things considered, when you're looking at what headphones to get, if you're looking for an AirPods replacement or a substitution 'cause you don't want the AirPods for whatever reason that is, I actually think these are really great but I will warn you, if you do have trouble with those types of in-ear headphones, these ones, much like any other headphones of this similar nature, they might give you trouble but I think if you are, again, looking for something different than the AirPods and something that is only $100 with a charging case. I also love that it has super low latency so again, Razer is mostly known for gaming so if you do have a Razer phone, this will perfectly compliment your Razer phone. I'd love to hear from you guys, what headphones are you guys currently using and if you have any type of earbuds, which ones do you have and which ones do you really want? I'll put a link in the description if you guys wanna get more information about this. This is not a sponsored video but Razer did send me these to check out and as you guys know, I'm a huge Razer fan so I love checking out some of the new stuff that they're coming out with. They have so much new stuff that they just announced and it's coming in the future, I'm overwhelmed! I will see you guys in my next video and I look forward to chatting with you guys in the comments and if you haven't subscribed already, be sure to do so and I'll see you in the next video. Buh-bye!

    "transcript": "- Good morning. We're so glad you could join us. - [Man] Let's get started by talking about Apple Watch. This is the new Apple Watch Series 8. It features a big brilliant always-on display with narrow borders that push the screen right to the edge. Detailed watch faces like the new lunar, astronomy, metropolitan, and modular, look stunning. And it's so bright that texting complications are easy to read, even when your wrist is down. - And Series 8 is durable. It's swim proof, dustproof and crack resistant. - Series 8 helps keep you safe with fall detection, emergency SOS, and medical ID. It has sleep tracking, cycle tracking, and mindfulness, and now Series 8 brings even more features for health, safety, and connectivity. - This year we're introducing a suite of advanced cycle tracking features. Utilizing the new temperature sensor in Apple Watch Series 8, you can now receive a retrospective estimate of when you ovulated. Series 8 has a unique two sensor design. There's one temperature sensor on the back crystal near your skin and another just under the display. Overnight, Series 8 samples your wrist temperature every five seconds, and it can detect changes as small as 0.1 degree Celsius. In the health app, you'll be able to see nightly shifts from your baseline temperature, which can be caused by things like exercise, jet lag, alcohol or illness. - Introducing crash detection. Apple Watch Series 8 can detect if you were in a severe car crash. When a crash is detected, it will automatically connect you with emergency services, provide your location and notify your emergency contacts. - In order to detect the unique forces of a car crash, we developed two new motion sensors for Series 8. An improved three axis gyroscope and high g-force accelerometer. The new accelerometer is capable of measuring up to 256 gs, allowing it to detect the extreme impacts of a crash. And it samples motion four times faster at over 3000 times a second, so it can sense the precise moment of impact. Crash detection runs only when you're driving and processes data only around the time of a possible crash entirely on your device. - Apple watch Series 8 still has all day 18 hour battery life. We're introducing low power mode, which can give you up to 36 hours of battery life on a full charge. Low power mode maintains many of the core features of Apple Watch like activity tracking and fall detection while temporarily disabling other features like always-on display and auto workout detection. Low power mode is available on Series 4 and later, running watchOS 9. Cellular models of Series 8 will also support international roaming. Apple Watch will now be able to stay connected to your cellular network while you're traveling abroad. It will be supported on all cellular models of Apple Watch from Series 5 onward running watchOS 9. Apple Watch Series 8 will be available in four colors of 100% recycled aluminum, midnight, starlight, silver and product red. And in three stainless steel finishes, silver, gold and graphite. There are also great new colors across our most popular band styles. That's the incredible new apple watch Series 8, with temperature sensing, retrospective ovulation estimates, crash detection, and international roaming. Apple Watch Series 8 will start at $399 for GPS and $499 for cellular. And with the purchase of any new Apple Watch, you'll also get three months of Fitness Plus free. You can order today and it will be available September 16th. - Let's talk about Apple Watch SE, the new SE will be available in silver, midnight, and starlight, all in 100% recycled aluminum, and we've completely redesigned the back case. It's now made of nylon composite materials that match perfectly with the three case finishes. - The second generation SE continues to deliver the core benefits of Apple Watch that users love, like workout and activity tracking, it's swim proof, it has high and low heart rate notifications, emergency SOS, and fall detection. SE also includes the same motion sensors as Series 8 to support crash detection. The SE display is 30% larger than that of Series 3 and SE features the same S8 system in package that's in Series 8, making it up to 20% faster than before, and now includes the faster S8 sip, crash detection, new case colors with matching back cases and all the new capabilities of WatchOS 9, all at a more affordable price starting at $249 for GPS and $299 for cellular. You can order it today and it will be available on September 16th. - This is Apple Watch Ultra. A completely new design, re-imagined with extraordinary new capabilities that expand the ways you can use Apple Watch. It starts with a case made from aerospace grade titanium that strikes the perfect balance of weight, durability and corrosion resistance. The titanium case extends up to surround the flat sapphire front crystal, protecting it from edge impacts that can occur during extreme activities. And at the center of the 49 millimeter case is our biggest brightest display ever in Apple Watch. We also added a new button, the action button in high contrast international orange. It's customizable and gives users quick physical control for a range of functions. The digital crown has a larger diameter and courser grooves and the side button stands proud of the case, both designed to be used while wearing gloves, and the audio system excels when you're out in the elements. We added a second speaker for increased volume. Three strategically placed microphones in advanced software help ensure voice clarity on calls even in windy conditions. - So beautiful. - And for maximum connectivity and communication, cellular is built into every Apple Watch Ultra. Ultra has the biggest battery of any Apple Watch yet. It gets up to 36 hours of battery life on a single charge. And Apple Watch Ultra can even get up to 60 hours of battery life for a multi-day adventure using a new battery optimization setting coming later this fall, and to compliment the rugged utility of the hardware, we created our most technical face yet, Wayfinder. With a host of critical information, it includes a compass in the dial and can be customized for the mountain, ocean or trail and to optimize for evening conditions, there's night mode. Just rotate the crown and the UI turns red for better visibility in the dark. With explorers in mind, we developed the Alpine loop. The titanium G hook securely fastens through the reinforced top loops. The band is woven using an innovative process that integrates the two layers without any stitching. The ocean band is molded in a high performance elastamer with a tubular geometry, allowing it to stretch for a perfect fit, even over a wet suit. The titanium buckle and adjustable loops secure the band during high speed water sports. For endurance athletes, we created the trail loop. The lightweight textile has increased elasticity for a comfortable snug fit. It's our thinnest band yet with a convenient tab for making quick adjustments. - GPS performance is critical for serious runners and athletes who want the most accurate metrics. So we designed a new precision dual frequency GPS solution that in addition to L1 also includes the latest frequency, L5, plus new custom positioning algorithms with new metrics, views, and experiences like vertical oscillation, heart rate zones, and custom workouts. Press the action button for the most accurate start to your workout. For triathletes and duathletes, the action button lets you instantly transition from one leg of the race to the next. And later this year, we're enabling a new feature that automatically detects when you arrive at a running track, ensuring the most accurate pace and distance. Using the new low power workout setting, most athletes can do a 2.4 mile swim plus a 112 mile bike ride and then run a marathon to complete a long distance triathlon with full precision GPS and heart rate. When navigating in the back country, a compass is an essential tool. So we completely designed the compass app with new precision views and added capabilities. The orienteering view includes compass way points to mark a position, like the location of the trailhead or your tent, and they could be quickly added using the action button. And if you get lost or disoriented, backtrack uses GPS data to create a path of where you've been so you can easily retrace your steps. And it turns on automatically in the background when you go off the grid, just in case. Getting help when you need it is critical, especially in the back country. That's why Apple Watch Ultra has a built in 86 decibel siren that you can activate using the action button. It has a unique sound pattern that alerts others to your location up to 600 feet or 180 meters away. Finally, Apple Watch Ultra has been designed for water sports. It can withstand the intense dynamic forces of activities like kite surfing and wakeboarding, and it can go deep below the waves because we engineered it to twice the water resistance, WR100. Using its new built-in depth gauge ultra automatically launches a new depth app when submerged to show current depth, underwater time and water temperature. We also want ultra to be a great tool for recreational scuba divers. So it's been certified to EN13319, the internationally recognized standard for dive computers and gauges, and we're partnering with Huish Outdoors to create an exclusive app that turns Apple Watch Ultra into a capable dive computer for recreational scuba diving to the depth of 40 meters or 130 feet. - With a 49 millimeter titanium case, precision dual frequency GPS, a customizable action button, long battery life, a built-in depth gauge, the biggest and brightest display up to 2000 nits and all the other great features of Series 8. All models of Apple Watch Ultra will be $799. You can order it today and it will be available starting on September 23rd. - [Man] Now let's turn to AirPods. - At the heart of AirPods Pro is our brand new H2 chip providing an incredible upgrade to performance from H1. The exceptional sound quality of AirPods Pro is also now transformed with the new low distortion audio driver and a custom amplifier to power it. These advances come together in a magical way with spatial audio, which takes the listening experience to the next level. With iOS 16, you can use the true depth camera on iPhone to create a personal profile for spatial audio. Personalized spatial audio will deliver the most immersive listening experience by precisely placing sounds in space that are tuned just for you. Another feature our users love is active noise cancellation. H2 delivers advanced computational audio, previously unable to run on a device of this size. This combined with optimizing the placement of the acoustic back and microphones now enables up to double the amount of noise canceled over the original AirPods Pro, delivering even greater focus when you want to be immersed in the moment. A great in-ear fit also helps to provide passive noise reduction. With a new, extra small ear tip, when you want to be connected to the world around you, there's transparency mode. With the power of H2, we're taking this experience to the next level with adaptive transparency, which dynamically reduces the volume of harsh environmental noise like heavy construction. This is made possible because it processes at 48,000 times per second, to react instantaneously to any high decibel noise you are exposed to. The four sensor on AirPods Pro brought the capability to play or pause media and answer calls to keep you in the moment. Today, we're taking that convenience even further by introducing touch control, which adds a capacitive sensing layer so you can adjust volume with a light swipe up or down. Now you will have up to six hours of listening time from a single charge. And with the charging case, you will have up to 30 hours of total listening time. With the new AirPods Pro, if you happen to misplace the charging case, precision finding will help you navigate directly to it with U1 technology. We have also added a speaker to the bottom of the case to help you find it by playing louder tones. And the speaker will indicate pairing, low battery, and when charging has started. To make charging easier, in addition to the lightning cable, you can now use your Apple Watch charger as well as MagSafe for other chief compatible chargers. And with the addition of a lanyard loop to the side of the case, your AirPods Pro will always be within reach. These are the breakthrough second generation AirPods Pro powered by H2. The new AirPods Pro are available for $249, and you can order on September 9th. They're available on September 23rd with free engraving, including Memoji. - So let's take a look at the new iPhone. - The popular 6.1 inch size of iPhone 14 is joined by the new larger 6.7 inch size of iPhone 14 Plus. iPhone 14 also has an updated internal design that improves thermal performance, which is great for staying in the action longer. Both models have the gorgeous super retina XDR display with OLED technology that supports 1200 nits peak HDR brightness, 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio and Dolby vision. Both models have ceramic shield, tougher than any smartphone glass, aerospace grade aluminum and water and dust resistance. They come in five gorgeous colors, midnight, starlight, a great new shade of blue, a strikingly elegant purple, and a truly eye-catching product red. iPhone 14 Plus lasts even longer throughout your day with the best battery life ever in an iPhone. Now we are bringing this proven pro level performance to iPhone 14, the A15 bionic with a five core GPU. The five core GPU is 18% faster, enabling even smoother graphics in computationally heavy workloads like complex gaming. It has a powerful six core CPU with two high performance and four efficiency cores and a 16 core neural engine that pushes the limits of machine learning. And with the custom image signal processor, A15 also powers innovative features in the amazing new camera system. - It has a new 12 megapixel main camera with a larger sensor and larger pixels at 1.9 microns. It has a faster f1.5 aperture and sensor shift OIS for a powerful main camera upgrade and takes stunning shots everywhere. It delivers a 49% improvement in low light capture for more vibrant color and better results in challenging lighting environments. While making night mode exposure twice as fast, iPhone 14 has a new, true depth camera. It has a faster f1.9 aperture for a 38% improvement in low light capture for photos and video. The new front camera has auto focus for the first time, so it can focus clearly at multiple distances. Deep Fusion is a great example. It's a huge achievement in computational photography and uses the powerful neural engine to combine multiple frames into a single image. Now we are taking our image pipeline further by applying Deep Fusion much earlier in the process on uncompressed images. This retains much more information in detail and enables rendering of more colors and brighter colors. We call it Photonic Engine. When compared to iPhone 13, it enables photo lowlight improvement up to two times on the front camera, two times on the ultra wide camera, and two and a half times on the new main camera. You'll get photos with much better detail in color, helping you remember the moment, the way you lived it. There's also a big improvement to video this year. This is action mode. It uses the full sensor with more over scan and advanced roll correction to make video look incredibly stable when you're in the middle of the action. - Now let's talk about connectivity. and eSIM is a digital SIM that eliminates the need for physical SIM card. Now for the first time, all US models no longer have the SIM tray. So you don't have to deal with the physical SIM card anymore. With iPhone 14, we have two critical new safety features. It has crash detection, the same feature you just heard about on new Apple Watch models. iPhone 14 has a new high dynamic range gyroscope and a new dual core accelerometer that is able to detect up to 256 gs. And it can automatically notify emergency services and emergency contacts if you are in a severe car crash. - Now your iPhone can connect you with the help you need when you're off the grid, emergency SOS via satellite. There are some places like winding back roads and mountain ridges that cell towers don't reach. We designed and built custom components and specific software so that iPhone 14 antennas can connect to satellite's unique frequencies. So we created a unique user experience that shows you where to point your phone, to establish a connection and stay connected as the satellite moves. This way, no bulky antenna is needed. Once connected, you need to send and receive enough information to get emergency help. Standard messaging protocols are not designed for satellite's limited bandwidth. So we created a custom short text compression algorithm to reduce the average size of messages by a factor of three. Thanks to this algorithm, it can take less than 15 seconds to send a message if you have a clear view of the sky. In other conditions, such as light foliage, it may take a few minutes. We worked with emergency experts to surface the questions that are most likely to ask. And we provided the most common responses for you to choose from with just a few taps. After your message is relayed to a ground station, it needs to reach the right emergency service provider. If that emergency service provider accepts text messages, we will connect you to them directly. If they only accept voice calls, we have set up relay centers staffed with highly trained emergency specialists, ready to get your text and call an emergency service provider on your behalf. So if you're out on a long hike, you can use the Find My app to share your location manually via satellite. - We believe that this service is such an essential part of the iPhone experience that we'll include it free for two years with iPhone 14. It launches in November and we're starting with the US and Canada, and that's iPhone 14 with powerful new cameras, Photonic Engine, action mode, A15 bionic with a five core GPU, emergency SOS via satellite, crash detection, and the larger 6.7 inch display size with the best battery life in an iPhone and so much more. And later this fall, Apple Fitness Plus will be available to all iPhone users, even if they don't yet have an Apple Watch. iPhone 14 will start at just 799. This is the same starting price as last year's iPhone 13, but with so much more capability that sets a new standard for iPhone. An iPhone 14 Plus starts at just 899, bringing the larger 6.7 inch display and the best battery life to more people than ever. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available for pre-order starting on September 9th. iPhone 14 will be available on September 16th and iPhone 14 Plus will be available on October 7th. - I'm excited to share our most innovative pro lineup yet. - Our pro models feature beautiful and strong surgical grade stainless steel. Together with our industry leading durability features, including ceramic shield and water resistance. They come in four gorgeous colors, a new space black, silver, gold, and this all new deep purple. iPhone 14 pro introduces a new front design that is sure to become iconic. It starts with the new, true depth camera. We redesigned all components to fit into a smaller size using 30% less area. We put the proximity sensor behind the display for the first time. With this change, we reconsidered how you interact with your iPhone. Throughout the day, you experience different types of alerts and notifications. And these are often happening while you're doing other things on your iPhone. So we developed a new experience that's even better. - We're calling it the dynamic island. So now when you receive an alert, the dynamic island expands to notify you. This works across the entire system for things like confirming your AirPods are connected, muting, or starting a charge. The dynamic island also displays ongoing background activity. Like when you're playing music, when you swipe to go home, the music app gracefully morphs into the dynamic island, always staying active and visible, and we've even designed it to show the current album art. It's also completely interactive. You can tap and hold to expose more options or tap to go back to the app. So now when you're on a call, you have easy access to controls without leaving the app you're using. We've designed live activities, a new feature on the iOS 16 lock stream to work seamlessly with the dynamic island, including support for third party apps. So you can keep track of what's happening from anywhere on iPhone, like following a baseball game without needing to leave the app you're in, or not missing the Lyft ride while texting friends. And when you have more than one background activity, the dynamic island playfully adapts, bubbling out into two elements. - IPhone 14 Pro has a stunning new display with pro features. iPhone 14 pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max come in two great sizes. Now with even thinner borders, more active area, and the dynamic island, it is also brighter. The new display provides peak HCR brightness of 1600 nits bringing iPhone to the same level as the pro display XDR. And for those bright sunny days, iPhone can now push brightness even higher for a peak of 2000 nits. So this is the perfect time to introduce always-on display. It's easy to see the time and other important information without raising your iPhone or tapping the display. This display can operate at a refresh rate as low as one hertz with a new low power mode. And we further improved our LTPO technology, allowing the display to intelligently dim the entire lock screen. We also take advantage of multiple co-processors in our chip to refresh the display using minimal power. With all these incredible features, the new super retina XDR is the most advanced display ever in a smartphone. iPhone 14 Pro is powered by our new A16 bionic chip. Our newest generation of Apple silicon powers, every experience on iPhone. With A16 we focused on three important areas. Power efficiency, display, and camera. A16 has nearly 16 billion transistors. This is our first chip built on a state-of-the-art four nanometer process, enabling greater efficiency while delivering even more performance. The CPU uses our best in class fusion architecture, which delivers both leading performance and leading efficiency. Our two high performance scores are faster and used 20% lower power compared to the A15 bionic, and most daily tasks could be handled by our high efficiency cores. At the same performance level, these new efficiency cores use one third the power of even the best efficiency cores from the competition. The new 16 core neural engine is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second. And the five core GPU has 50% more memory bandwidth, great for graphic intensive games. There's also an entirely new display engine in A16. This engine enables the one hertz refresh rate, always-on capability, higher peak brightness, and the advanced anti-aliasing that makes dynamic island animations so incredibly smooth. A16 also flexes every muscle for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system. It uses a CPU, GPU, neural engine, and ISP to perform up to 4 trillion operations per photo. - IPhone 14 Pro introduces a brand new class of camera to iPhone, a 48 megapixel camera with a quad-pixel sensor. Features our second generation sensor shift OIS, and 100% focus pixels. It also features a new 24 millimeter focal length. The quad-pixel sensor enables a new flexible approach, which adapts the photo you're shooting. For most photos, we want to optimize for light capture. So the new sensor groups every four pixels into one large quad pixel with four times more light, we can go beyond the three fixed lenses of the pro camera system adding a new 2x telephoto option for our users. We use the middle 12 megapixels of the new sensor to deliver a full resolution photo in 4k video with optical quality. This telephoto has larger pixels in a faster aperture than any previous 2x telephoto camera on iPhone. We're also using the new sensor to optimize for detail in ProRAW. ProRAW merges the best of our intelligent computation photography with the benefits of the raw format. You can now shoot ProRAW at 48 megapixel resolution. iPhone 14 Pro also has a new ultra wide camera with a larger sensor, more focus pixels and together with the photonic engine delivers a massive up to three times improvement in light capture for photos. The flash was completely redesigned for a new adapted behavior based on the focal length of the photo. With a new array of nine LEDs, we control the pattern and intensity. So it's up to twice as bright with up to three times better uniformity compared to our previous generation. - iPhone 14 Pro also has our new action mode for shooting videos with our best stabilization. And cinematic mode gets a great update. Now supporting up to 4k resolution in 30 frames per second for even more detail. Profilm makers can also choose record in 4K at 24 frames per second, the cinematic standard. iPhone 14 pro delivers all day battery life. So that's iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, the dynamic island, and always-on display introduce new ways to experience iPhone. Powered by the A16 chip with the new 48 megapixel main camera, beautiful new finishes, crash detection, and emergency SOS via satellite. Even with these groundbreaking features, iPhone 14 Pro still starts at $999, and iPhone 14 Pro Max at $1099 with storage options up to one terabyte. You can pre-order both models on September 9th and they'll be available on September 16th. This is our most incredible iPhone lineup ever, including iPhone 13, iPhone 12 and iPhone SE starting at just $429. - Thank you for joining us. Have a great day.",

    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin'? Just wanted to take a minute to talk about a cool accessory sent my way by Retro Modding. It's these neoprene sleeves for classic Nintendo handhelds. They come in a few versions to fit the DMG, Pocket, Color, and Game Boy Advance, and some of them will also fit the DS Lite, 3DS, and 3DS XL. They come in five different colors and they fit the consoles pretty snugly; they don't take up a lot of space and they do a good job at protecting 'em. Normally, they go for $10 US, but if you check the description there's a coupon code for $2 off. So if you're looking for cases for your handhelds, I think they're definitely worth checking out, and big thank you to Retro Modding for sending 'em my way. If you like the video, thumbs-up. Be sure to subscribe. You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram at thisdoesnotcomp, and as always, thanks for watching.",

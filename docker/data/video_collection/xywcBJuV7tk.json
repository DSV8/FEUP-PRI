    "description": "The father of the Android platform just announced a smartphone, which is kind of a big deal. It's called the Essential Phone  not just because Andy Rubin wants you to think it's indispensable, but because it represents the essence of what Rubin believes a smartphone should be: personal, open, premium, helpful and simple. The Essential Phone PH-1 was built to correct some of the problems Rubin says Android created, with an open ecosystem and intuitive software wrapped in a drop-resistant ceramic/titanium body bearing a magnetic attachment port for accessories. Also, no Essential Phone would be complete without an Essential Home to go along with it; in addition to its smartphone showdown, Essential will be going head-to-head with the Google Homes and Amazon Echoes of the world. But such lofty ambitions sometimes bamboozle those who should remain skeptical  especially given the crowded graveyard of tech companies who's walked this path before. So how excited should you be for the Essential Phone? MrMobile won't know for sure until he gets a device in his hands; until then, join him for some early impressions from afar!

    "transcript": "(upbeat electronic music) - [Announcer] If I had a nickel every time someone promised to reinvent the smartphone, I'd have like 85 cents by now. Granted, Essential isn't just another anonymous startup. The man in the captain's chair is Andy Rubin. He's one of the creators of the Sidekick, basically a BlacBberry for young people that became an underground hit in the mid aughts. Oh, and he co-founded a company called Android Incorporated, which wanted to write software for digital cameras but instead ended up being bought by Google and then blowing up the smartphone world. Today, about four out of five smartphones run Android and the operating system is on over two billion devices worldwide. Meanwhile, BlackBerry, Nokia and Microsoft, the dominant forces in mobile when Android launched are now not that, at all. So it makes sense that we're all excited by the launch of the Essential phone. A new handheld that promises a blend of thoughtful craftsmanship and mindful software. Instead of glass and aluminum, the Essential phone will be made of ceramic and a new injection molded titanium that should make it more resistant to drops. It'll feature a near bezelless design that maximizes screen real estate in a small chassis. The published dimensions put it somewhere between the HTC 10 and Galaxy S7, each of which is quite easy to handle one-handed. It'll come compatible with snap-on magnetic accessories too. To start with, a power dock and a 360 camera that looks positively tiny compared to what's out there right now. When you don't need a fishbowl photograph, the onboard cameras seem plenty capable, judging by the spec sheet. And that same sheet also bears most of the touchstones of a terrific 2017 smartphone. To flush out the Essential ecosystem, alongside the phone launch comes a new virtual assistant for the living room. It's trying to come across as less invasive than Alexa and Google Home by keeping more of its data local and sending less of it to the Cloud. But as I read through all the breathless praise surrounding the announcement, it strikes me that not only have we heard a lot of these promises before, but we've seen a lot of these features before too. Xiaomi brought us both minimal bezels and a ceramic body in the mean mix without the weird widow's peak cutout that the Essential phone needs for its front-facing camera. Motorola's Moto Z let's you snap on everything from battery packs to speaker docks to crazy cameras using a similar magnetic system. Google's Pixel phones bring streamlined and super responsive Android builds without bloat wear or exaggerated branding. And speaking of the Pixel, remember how I was put off by its lack of water resistance given its high price point? Well, Essential doesn't get a pass here either. It's expensive and it's not water resistant. And while the lack of a headphone jack doesn't bother me much, I'm a Bluetooth guy, it does seem an odd compromise on a device plainly big enough to include one. See, also, HTCU. Look, this is in no way a review. I haven't even touched the product yet. In fact, I really want Essential to succeed. That'll be obvious to ya if you watch me for a while. You know how much I appreciate both novelty and meaningful innovation both of which are sorely needed in today's mobile space. Rubin's mission statement seems to acknowledge that in a way that almost reads like he's seeking absolution. He wants to use Essential to cure the headaches, he says platforms like Android have caused. The built-in obsolescence of phones, the UI problems, the closed ecosystems. But I'm not convinced most people want to be cured of their consumerism, their annual trips to the phone store for the shiny new thing. I know I don't. And while the talent in Essential's roster is enormous, I think we all need to take a cue from that famous financial aphorism: \"past performance is not indicative of future results.\" so, while we should all be eager to see what it can do, there's a ways to go before we'll know whether it lives up to its aspirational name. To see the Essential phone review when it does come out, make sure you're subscribed to the MrMobile on YouTube and let me know what you think about Essential in the comments below. Til next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends.",

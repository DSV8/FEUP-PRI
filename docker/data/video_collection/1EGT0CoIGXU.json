    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today is going to be a very fun video. I'm currently in Hawaii right now with my sister, Jenna, with a brand new camera. This is the Sony A74. and not only am I here with this camera, but we shot an incredible campaign. And I'm so excited to show it to you guys. I'll put a link in the description where you guys can check it out. But now my friends let's go off on the adventure. (intense jazz music) I've almost fallen 14 times and we've only gone 1.43 miles. - You good? - Yeah. (high intensity techno music) - Which got, look at that. - With that I have 400 million, not right now. - It catches a stable environment. - Yeah. - [Cameraman] It's actually very light. - Good thing I've been working out, so (high intensity techno music) So, right out, right out, we just watched the sunrise here at Kuala Ranch. I'm so excited, Jen and I are in Hawaii. We're on the island of O'ahu. It is one of our favorite places. And for whatever reason, I don't even know how to explain it, but like this place just makes us feel, I don't know, energized, renewed, everything is beautiful. And we've been coming here for so long. There's so many places that we come that are kind of like home at this point. So we're here with Sony and we're shooting a really fun campaign for the Sony A74. That's coming out, depending on when you're watching this, it may have already been announced or released, but we're so excited. Cause this has been our dream to come here to Kuala Ranch and film something. We've been here filming before, but we wanted to actually film something super cool for the crew. And we have an amazing team, helping us build all of this fun stuff. And I can't wait for you guys to see it. It's so bright. The light right now is not the best, but the sunrise this morning was so beautiful. Okay. We're moving on to our next destination. Also, I just want to note that we've been shooting us over the course of like five days and we've had to wear the same outfit. How are you enjoying wearing the same outfit? Jenna, - This year, it will be retired after the shoot and I will never ever, ever wear this color ever again. - Do you think we'll burn it? - No, I'll just donate it. - [Justine] That's good. Look at this. I love this place. (playful jazz music) - We're up here a little behind the scenes setting up for the big camping shot. Got a great view, but the problem is we have some rain coming in, so we're going to have to figure that out. (upbeat music) - We didn't start the fire. - We didn't - No, like we didn't. You guys did it. - Well, you're supposed to say that we're starting a fire. This is behind the scene. - Oh, behind the scenes. So we're starting a fire here. (slow guitar music) (cloud raining) - Yup. Super cozy in the tent. (calm jazz music) - Oh, oh, action rolling. And you put on two inputs. - Yes, yes, yes, Yep. - So what was your favorite thing that we did here? - That's a really difficult question. - It is. - I mean, I really enjoyed the dolphins only because that's something I've never really done or experienced before. I love hiking. So obviously enjoyed the hiking. - I think, my favorite part, which I don't even know if we have any footage of this is us trying to put up the tent. Now in the edit, it's going to look like we knew (laughs) what we're doing, but this was actually the first time I've ever put up a tent. I just realized it. Have you ever put up a tent before? - Like full, from start of it? Okay - No, Not really. Okay. - No. - Okay. - Well we got some really cool shots there. I think also my favorite part from that night was the sporadic rain, the entire crew, everybody, like we all ended up just jumping into the tent. (cloud raining) - [Cameraman] Smile now. - Sub 24 ,we'll get news We're waking up at like 3:00 AM to get like sunrise shoots and dolphins though that was also really awesome. - That was incredible. Like the sunrise over the mountain, the clear water, the dolphin, the baby though, there was a baby dolphin. It was like this big, it was just the cutest little thing. So it was with his mom and his little family, I guess in the pond. - Also we were filming with this new camera and we had access to a tonne of lenses. Normally when we go out, like we've got a bunch of lenses, but since this was a shoot for Sony, like we had every single D master lens. - I think you get to test out the 400 millimeter on a boat. - That was an experience. Like the lens is not actually that heavy for what it is, but on a boat, trying to get dolphins from close-up. I thought they were going to be far away. So we popped it 400 on. And then the dolphins really right there in front of us and Jenna has the, was that the 16 or 35 on? - Yeah, 16 35 So that was, that was really cool. But yeah, watching you with this lens, like the boat going very fast and you try to capture the content. I was just like, hey, if you go overboard, I'm gonna, I'm ready to grab that fully. - So the A74 was so much fun to shoot with and obviously we're huge Sony fans. So I wanted to get a chance to come here and capture some incredible footage. It was like a dream come true. - It really was. - It's honestly everything that we've always wanted. And we got to do it. - Thank you guys so much for watching. Again. I will put those links in the description to check out the amazing videos that Sony created with us. And I cannot wait for you guys to see them. We had so much fun here, so thank you again, Sony for this awesome opportunity. Go check out Jenna's video. Again, links to the description. Don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell and I will see you guys in the next video. Bye. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "- This is the Insta360 X3. And this is the best camera for action sports. And I've been reviewing Insta360 cameras for a very, very long time. And do you know what I've never done with an Insta360 camera? Action sports. I mean, this was kind of an action sport, right? (upbeat music) But that my friends is all about to change because I am going snowboarding. And you're probably like, that's great. We're so happy for you. I don't know how to snowboard. I've never skied, never been on a snowboard. I've done nothing in that realm of sport. I know nothing, I have no gear. I have absolute zero knowledge. So I'm hoping in this video, you guys can come with me on a journey to go from zero to hero, maybe not even superhero, just like way below superhero. I just wanna be able to get out there and not fall too much. Oh, that one was, that one hurt. So in two weeks we are gonna be heading off to Mammoth to take my first ever snowboarding lesson. I have a lot of work to do in that timeframe. Thank you so much to Insta360 for partnering with me on this video. (upbeat music) Since we're going to the mountains we even have a snow bundle. Every possible mount that you could ever imagine that you would ever need, the snow bundle is sick. So the thing that I love so much about Insta360 and why this is such an incredible camera for action sports is it has some features that traditional action cameras don't have. Even though it has the two lenses you can shoot in a 4K single lens mode. So you can just film with one of the lenses. So as you can see, there are two lenses here that gives you the 360 effect. So you can do all kinds of cool things. You can also shoot 60 frames per second knee mode. And in this mode you hold the selfie sticks out, and it keeps you in frame. But the selfie stick is automatically removed. It has active HDR, stabilization, and 360 horizon lock. It's also waterproof so it's perfect for those winter sports. The best part is editing with instant 360 footage. Whatever you shoot you can basically go in using Insta360 Studio app and be able to reframe that footage. I can go in and move it frame by frame, and kind of re-shoot all of the stuff that I filmed. You can also do this in the iPhone app which is really fun and easy to use when you're on the go. But in the iPhone app you have something called Shot Lab where they give you all of these really cool shots and they give you this template that you can follow. And using AI it's able to edit these together for you automatically, it's so cool. So the one thing that I don't need is a new hobby. So I'm going to Mammoth, and I'm gonna try snowboarding, but I don't know anything about snowboarding. I don't know anything about skiing. I don't really like the cold, and I don't know what's gonna happen. So this place, virtual Snow LA, apparently has been here for 20 years, but it popped up on TikTok because my algorithm was me looking for snowboarding stuff. So here we are. I thought I should probably do this before I go out onto an actual mountain. (light hearted music) Do we have this outside in this in the real life, in the snow? I'm in trouble. So like technically I should be able to stand up on this without any help. Without holding on? - [Instructor] No, I mean, yeah. - I keep going that way for some reason. - [Instructor] This is your toe edge? Just holding it with the carpet off for a few seconds, we're then gonna put the carpet on, and we're just gonna try and do this like to side to side. - Okay. - There we go. - Well that's, I didn't try to do that. That was unintentional. - So when you release the- - Oh, that feels good. I can fall over. (upbeat music) (man mumbles indistinctly) Okay, so my first lesson, I learned a lot. I now know I could wrap my board and all my gear from here. So I feel like progress has been made. Oh, I gotta push the button. I'll pull it up, there we go. Okay, I think I might need an eight and a half. One of the main parts missing in my snowboard escapades is what am I going to wear? So am at this place in Los Angeles it's called Wave Rave. And this was kind of like the place to go to get your stuff. And 686 has this incredible NASA suit. Here's the unfortunate reality, it's for boys. So let's see, there's a large is that like an extra extra large boys? Like I should probably try, I should probably try that. Like I'm tempted to get it but like I don't want to be like first time and this is what I, well actually I would want to be, that would be what I would wanna do. I wanna need to think about it. The only thing is like little boys don't have hips. It's a little tight right here. Maybe I should do the extra large. Like I'm definitely contemplating this. Oh my god, I literally was in that shop for it feels like actually I might have been in there for like five hours, no joke. Well, two. I didn't buy the astronaut outfit but I still have another week before I actually head out. So I'm probably gonna come back for it. I got all the things, all the things. I'm so excited, okay, time to go home, eat dinner and tomorrow I'm actually taking another virtual snow lesson so I can try out my new boots that I bought. Things have progressed, I've got boots now. Let's go. It's right here. So let's try to break these things in, and we'll see if I can remember how to do this. I got new socks. My problem with getting into hobbies is like I don't go lightly. Like I go all in. I'm really hoping I enjoy the sport, because I'm almost all in, except I don't have a board yet. I'm gonna hold off on that. (upbeat music) This is my first fall. Now what do I do? Where do I go? Thanks so much. All right, that was my second lesson. I'm feeling much more confident. I'm gonna be so ready for that hill. I've got a couple more lessons coming up, so stay tuned. Heading in for technically what is my fifth class. The last class I did was a two hour back-to-back session and they recommend not doing that because one hour on these machines is like a full day on the slopes. And let me tell you, the weirdest muscles, like in my ankles that I didn't even know that I had, were hurting. We have two more sessions, three more days before I head up to the mountain. I just made a last minute decision. I'm gonna go buy a board. I literally have everything else. I'm clearly into it. I'm gonna do this again. I'm going to buy a board right now. Back the Wave Rave we go. (upbeat music) Well, this is incredibly overwhelming. This one has pink on it, we like that. - [Attendant] So this is gonna be like your easiest, most forgiving ride, really hard to catch an edge. And then you get over here, you get into more like camber boards and we'll explain what that is. But these are gonna be like your more aggressive kind of catchier. (upbeat music) - So I'm just standing in it? - [Attendant] Okay when you put it on, are you like, ow. - I think so. - Because I think you look like this is like where you kind of like want to be here, you wanna be here. (upbeat music) - Here it is. I can't believe it. This was not in my plans today. Like I was gonna rent one and then here we are. Last minute decision, got all hooked up. (upbeat music) This is lesson number six, my friends. And then tomorrow I am off to the mountain. This is so exciting, I'm so tired right now. Barely functioning, but you know, the grind is real. The stoke never dies or something, I don't know. Hello. - Come on in. (light hearted music) So one of the things that I really need to practice is actually holding my Insta360 camera so I can get some great shots of hopefully not me falling, but I do feel like that first day, I'm gonna be learning a lot about myself, about the snow, about how bad my body might hurt. That's it, it's official six lesson down. I still feel like there's so much more that I need to know but I haven't even touched real snow yet. So now we are off to the mountain. (light hearted music) I've got so much gear, A huge thank you to 686 for hooking this up. I didn't even know what I needed. And they're like, we got you. These are all of the things you're gonna need. You're gonna be set for the mountain, so let's try it on. So some of these things I bought some of these things that they sent. I'm so overwhelmed because there's so many goodies. I don't even know where to start. We've got some base layers. I'll probably be wearing long sleeves. This is the Athena Insulated Jacket. It is everything. I'm already sweating. The thing that I'm most concerned with is where am I gonna put my items? So the good thing is it seems like there's lots of pockets in here. They also sent a selection of hats. Love, nice basic black, this NASA hat. I also bought some gloves that have built in risk guards because I'm concerned about my body. Oh wow, I'm gonna go do some crime. Ow. So this next fit, I bought this one at Wave Rave. I was in love with it because it's like a nice little pale purple, something to the pants. I feel like my next outfit when I graduate from falling on my butt all the time. You've also got a little matching little jacket. This is nice. This also matches my phone, you'd love to see it. Like I'm only gonna be there for two days but I have outfits probably for the eternity of my snowboarding career. Who knows? Maybe I'm gonna be a prodigy. Maybe I'm gonna get out there and just be like (upbeat music) Obsessed with this base layer. It's like a purple leopard. We love that. And now the most prized possession the board. Does anybody remember when I first started this entire adventure, I said I now know I could rent my board, and all my gear from here. Gonna rent all my gear. I'm gonna rent my boots, I'm gonna rent my board. And as the day has progressed it just made sense to get a board. If I'm gonna start learning and I want to do this sport like I should be learning on my own gear. So that's what we did. Got our helmet. I wanted an all white one, but they didn't have it in stock. So I went with this like light gray. Oh my gosh, and my goggles, I forgot about those. The plastic's still on these, what a loser. I think now that I've done my entire hall, I can officially pack it all up. (upbeat music) (tense music) So the big days here, I've got all my gear. Now I'm having a problem because I've got a lot of things and I'm gonna be so way down. Like I feel like a hamster who is getting ready to hibernate for the winter. Like this can't be safe. Like having these sticks in my pocket. I'm gonna get impaled. Other pocket, gonna put Insta360 camera. I've got a little baggie for some accessories. (upbeat music) Okay, here we are. This is gonna be the start. Do you wanna introduce yourself? - Howdy, I'm Xander. - You are my instructor today and I'm so excited. I love your outfit too, by the way. - Thank you. - Yeah, I'm a huge camo fan. I should have wore mine. I had a white camo on, we could have matched, tomorrow. Everything is happening now. I'm gonna put you guys on my helmet, and you're gonna witness the first beginnings of me snowboarding. (upbeat music) Sorry, sorry, sorry. Shit. ' I mean, I don't know. - You hurt? - No, I'm okay then. Mentally, no, I mean I ate it. Oh no, sorry. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) No. About how long would you say it took me to get down that mountain? - 10 minutes. - 10, yeah, yeah. It felt like five hours. If my brain feels a little scrambled from falling. I haven't hit my head yet, but like the rest of my body, it's just all, it's happening now. Progress is being made. (upbeat music) I am quite unique (upbeat music) (happy music) (instructor speaking indistinctly) Here we go. No. (light hearted music) So day one, I've ended up on my butt a lot and I brought some impact shorts but they really are terrible. I bought them on Amazon and they don't fit very well. They only have extra larges here but they also have some kids ones. So I'm gonna try out the kids large. This is, yeah, got some shorts for tomorrow. (emotional opera music) Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it. (instructor cheers) (emotional opera music) We're still up. We're still up. We're still up. That one was, that one hurt. (emotional opera music) So what have we got here? This is so cool. - So this is an elevated surf craft. It's a snowboard for surfers. - Yeah. - It looks awesome. - My name's Aaron, I'm filming on Insta360. - We had so much fun oh my gosh, thank you so much for your help. - My pleasure. - Thank you. - Day three, day two, as you saw, I bought some padded shorts and I bought these on Amazon and I thought they were a little too aggressive. No, they're absolutely not too aggressive. And I will be putting them on today because I took some falls yesterday and my butt hurts so bad. My arm just even touch, it's so painful. But morale is high. Everyone back out and I think these shorts hopefully will protect my body. And I definitely should have worn these day one. Now I know, now you know (upbeat music) Its day three, and we're gonna do a little adjustment here to see if maybe this might help me out a little bit to see. What did you just do? - [Instructor] I pushed the heel cup forward, and preset to a two, which is pulled up most of the way. I pushed it forward just by loosening this two screws. - Nice. So I am now holding the stick for the first time. Probably gonna have to pass it off to Xander at some point because, I don't know what's gonna happen. But we're gonna try our best. It feels like I'm going so fast. I'm gonna give you this back. - Come through, come through. - I'm trying. (light hearted music) Oh man, I'm having so much fun. But fatigue is starting to play a part. The first two days were pretty intensive, especially for my body, it falls literally feels like I have been in a car accident. At this point, it's the fear that's holding me back because I'm afraid of falling because I'm in so much pain. (upbeat music) - [Xander] Love to see it. (upbeat music) - I just needed it, before I got too full of myself. (pop music) So thank you all for coming along on this journey. This was so much fun and I can't wait for the next time. I feel like this third day was really tough for me because my body is so fatigued, and I'm in so much pain. Doing these last few runs I knew I had to call it because I didn't wanna get hurt, and just everything just feels so exhausted. Like even trying to do turns. I'm just starting to get frustrated. So I am going to call it, I'm quitting while I'm ahead. I'm not actually quitting, just for this session. So I will see you guys on the slopes again. I even downloaded the Slopes app, like I've learned so much in the past three weeks about snowboarding. I am very excited for my new hobby and can't wait for the next one, see you there.

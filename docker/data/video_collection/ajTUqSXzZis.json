    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here? so I've been using the same few MacBook accessories of the past little while for the past like year, year and a half and I wanted to see if we could do a little better I wanted to see if there were like better versions of the ones I've been using or just like better products that kind of did the same kind of thing So I went to Amazon checked out the ratings and just like bought a bunch of stuff and here are five MacBook upgrades that I was able to come across the first one I know this sounds a little silly, but this is important to me It's the case and think this is something that a lot of people kind of overlook when it comes to laptops I use a skin on it which is great I mean it looks cool But it doesn't give a ton of protection the case that I'm using in the past is this it's made by initech It's a great case the one thing. I don't like about it. Though. Is that after a while it starts to pill This is actually the third one that I've purchased from them Just the material. It's felt. It's nice, but it actually starts to get fuzzy and just kind of gross looking so I replace it I wanted to find something little bit different. I found this this thing's rated 4.5 star in Amazon and There's two things that I really like about it the first one is the inner lining it's got this like flap on the inside that Protects the edge of your laptop so oftentimes if you have a zippered case you'll put your laptop in and the zipper will just rub Against the case because it's just it's literally right against the metal or plastic zipper And it'll just rub and rub and eventually it can wear down the side of your laptop This one has a flap in it the MacBook tucks underneath And it just protects it from that zippered edge the other thing. I like about it is the actual zipper itself It's made by a good company, so Zippers are often overlooked when it comes to just cases because you can stick some really cheap zippers on these things and get away with It this is a YKK zipper It's like that japanese brand super popular brand, but it's just like a very durable well-built case I highly recommend this. okay, Next item is something that I had high hopes for so if you'll remember the old MacBooks had magSafe It's something that I think a lot of people enjoyed and something that kind of made MacBooks what they were There have been a lot of products that have kind of tried to emulate that or replicate that experience with some kind of magnetic connection On the USB-C thing this was one of them And I had really high hopes for this that this video was actually gonna be about how this was an awesome upgrade I've had this for three weeks now, and it died literally like 12 hours ago this thing died just before I made this video So I no longer recommend any of these, this is actually the fourth or fifth version like some kind of USB-C magnetic thing that I've tried on the MacBook they all seem to fail over time I've tried the Griffin one which was bulky and expensive I've tried some cheaper ones some moderately priced ones and finally I tried this one was made by bassies or something like that and like come on man I don't know why they can't make these things properly, but the idea of it seems simple right it just seems like it'll work, but I've tried so many they all don't seem to work I don't recommend any of them unfortunately okay moving along we have This thing is something you've seen in a lot of my videos. There's various companies that make this the more popular one is Satechi I've used that one this one's made by QacQoc or something like that They're all weird names But they all do the same kind of thing it's a USB-C hub that plugs into your computer and for the most part They're pretty good. There's one issue that occurs with them Though is that if you use the hub heavily like if you have a media drive connected to this for a video edit it can Get quite hot so I found something that was significantly better, so this is made by its a brand name one, Kingston It's like a fancy brand It's 80 bucks. So these are normally like 60 bucks It's a little bit more and it's quite a bit larger But the thermal performance on this thing is significantly better this thing barely gets warm So if you use a hub heavily and you kind of need to have your files transferring through these things like non-stop I highly recommend picking up one of these because relying on this like I've had edits to just stop in the middle of it because this thing gets too warm so Kingston nucleum That's not bad name. Okay moving along, this thing, We've seen this a lot of my videos I really like this batteries made by Anker. It's got power deliveries. You can charge laptops and stuff like that It's a good battery pack, but I found something that's a little bit better This is made by a company called Jackery And what makes this thing kind of special is that it's got a power outlet built into it So it's got your standard stuff like USB-A , USB-C , and it charges via USB-C It's got like an indicator, whatever But the power outlet allows you to connect your AC adapter to charge this thing Significantly faster than it would be if you're just using power delivery through the USB-C So a regular battery pack will charge MacBooks reasonably fast But when you have a power outlet like this, it actually charges it as if it's plugged into the wall. It's awesome So it's a little bit bigger I actually think it's like the same kind of weight this thing holds 20,000 mAh and change This is like 26 both are good but if you need a battery pack that can power your laptop while it's running full tilt like if you're doing 3d stuff or video editing on the Go and you want to be able to just give it extra juice without an outlet. This is your choice Okay, moving along we have the cheapest item in this whole video It's the 9$ USB adapters made by a company called Nonda or Nunda I think it's Nonda the one I've used before is this regular standard USB dongle which is fine This one is a lot smaller and when it's plugged up to your laptop. It's just a cleaner look I'd much prefer this aesthetic over the whole dongle life thing It doesn't have a perfect review like it's a 4 star review on Amazon I think a lot of that comes from the older model like there was a 2016 version of this that was not very reliable and a little bit bigger, but the new ones two thumbs up okay, I looked for an upgrade for the mouse and There really isn't any you've seen this a lot in my videos like the MX Anywhere 2s. It's a great Mouse They have them for like 50 55 bucks now, but you can't get anything better at least in my opinion This is seriously a great Mouse. Okay, that about wraps it up these are all like little upgrades that I was trying to bring my MacBook experience little bit better and There you have it some of them most of them are good This one or any of these magnetic cables are terrible. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it Subs if you loved it. See you guys next time",

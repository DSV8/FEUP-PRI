    "transcript": "- You know what's great? - What's great, Matt? - Technology. - Nah, it's terrible. - Terrible, but I mean, that's kinda how you built your entire career. - Stone Ages is where it's at. Polio, man, big fan. - Speaking of the Stone Ages, did you know that a lot of the technology that you are using is actually way older than you think? - No, I didn't know that. So, what exactly is the plan today? You said that there's a game of some variety. - Yes, I'm gonna give you some pieces of technology that are super common today that you probably think are maybe 10 years old. - But I'm going to be mistaken, is my guess. - And, for every time you are mistaken, Ken gets an additional $500. - 500, wait, no no. - For the Mystery Tech budget. - Why 500? How many questions are there? - There are three. - $500? - Yes. - But you're just gonna throw trick questions at me 'cause you just want a better Mystery Tech budget. - [Ken] I mean, thank you? (Matt and Austin laughing) - All right, so the way I have it laid out, I'm gonna give you three pieces of technology and you'll have multiple choice. You have to pick the decade that this piece of technology was invented. - So, do I get a shenanigans vote if you try to say that something is wildly off or I don't agree with it? Is there some-- - No, because I, no. No, because I'm the mediator, I'm the one who's done the research. - Well what if you're wrong, Matt? You're just trying to say, \"Oh, I'm the mediator, I'm the boss, I'm the judge, \"I'm the jury, and I'm the executioner.\" - [Matt] Yeah, that's pretty much exactly what I'm saying. - But I'm the one who has to pay for the Mystery Tech budget. - Yeah, that's why it's fun for us and not for you. And so, I've, like a good host, set Austin up to fail. - All right, so let's play whatever this game is called, starting with question number one. - When do you think in-car navigation first was a thing? - Can I get some more specificity on the question? Are we saying GPS navigation? Are we saying grandma with a map in the back seat navigation? What do you mean by that? - Something that's built into your vehicle. Is it A, the 1990s, B, the 1930s, C, the 1910s, or D, the 19... - (laughs) You don't even have it memorized. - [Matt] '60s? (bell dings) - Okay, well I'm gonna guess it's not the '60s since you forgot that one. Or no, maybe it is the 1960s. I'm just trying to play mind games right now. - I just couldn't remember which one I actually already said. - Oh, okay. I'm gonna say the '10s are probably out because basically, no one had cars back then. My inclination is to say the 1960s because that was an era in which there was a lot of really weird mechanical stuff, like all kinds of things in cars where we have a lot of the modern conveniences, but it was done in a very old school way of ratchets, and clanks, and I actually don't know what I'm talking about, but there's a lot of weird stuff there. However, I think that you're about to pull out something really weird. I'm gonna guess the 1930s, final answer. - Final answer is 1930s? - Yeah. - You are actually correct. - Yes! - I am really upset by this. 1930s is the one I thought you might get because you're a car guy. So, these numbers were not just random numbers I threw at a dart board. In 1910, they did actually have an integrated system. The Baldwin Auto Guide, which was based off of Kodak film, and it attached to the steering column, and it was a map inside with directions to different things. - Whoa! - So, you turned left, you had to turn the directions then. So, the 1930s was from an Italian company. - Oh, that looks real. - It is real. (Austin laughs) It was the Iter Avto. And so, it would have - What? - the map here, and as you're going, it included some gas stations, some restaurants, some hotels. You got Ken's Hotel, you got Austin's Barbecue, Jimmy's Gas. You loaded these guys up in this cartridge, but it connected to the speedometer, and it would scroll proportionately as you're driving. - What I love about this era is that before there was digital anything, you had to be so old school mechanical, and there was so many weird, so many interesting, so many ingenious approaches to delivering this kind of tech, because you couldn't just throw in a screen and a chip or whatever, you had to actually develop the pieces of paper, and the winding mechanism, and the cartridges. It is so cool, but the most important thing is, I was right. - I'm impressed that you got the first one. - I'm not gonna get cocky here, but I'm feeling good. - You do, generally, get really cocky. - I do. You know that about me, which is, I think, part of the reason why you're gonna try to trick me with these things. You're gonna make something really obvious, and I'm gonna be glued to it. See, I remember when we did the hidden camera thing, and you tricked me like that. I can learn. - So, Spotify, you'd say is, oh, 2011 is when it started, but when do you think streaming music actually became a thing? - Okay, I'm gonna need way more specificity on this one. When you say streaming music, we're not talking a radio. - No, well, I'm gonna say music that you don't own, that you don't have physically, that you hear on demand. - So, if I wanna listen to my Justin Bieber song, I can use this service, in whatever decade it is, to listen to that song pretty much instantly. - Not quite that cut and dry, but yes. - There's no physical media involved though, right? It's not a mail service where they're sending me records or something. - Correct, it's not a mail service. So is it A, 1900s, B, 1980s, C, 1880s, or D, 1920s? - Okay, it's not the 1980s because knowing the way that you're doing research on this, it's not gonna be something normal. It's gonna be something weird. It's gonna be like you get it through the telegraph or something. You hook up your telegraph machine and it goes like, Click, click, click, click, click Click, click, click, click, click Click, click, click, click - Are you saying they streamed Morse code to you in music? - Yes, I wouldn't put it past you to pull something like that, so I'm gonna throw 1980s out. - Okay. The 1880s feels too old, because the fact that you could even record music was something that if I recall right, only really became particularly popular and relevant in that sort of decade. Well, I guess the mid 1880s or so, something like that. It wasn't very common to record music. It's possible, but recording and streaming feels like a little bit much. So, through my powers of deduction, I'm going to guess either the 1900s or the 1920s. I'm going to guess the 1900s, final answer. - No! - Did I get it right? - No! - Yes, I got it right? - Yes. - Yes! - [Matt] You're two for two, I'm disappointed. - Wait, can you explain to me, what exactly could you do in the 19 whatevers. - So, you were wrong about the 1880s. So, the device that this guy built, he started designing it in the 1880s and started building it in the late 1890s, and then finished in, I think, 1902, sorry, 1901. - Okay, just in sight. - And it was Thaddeus Cahill - That's a great name - who built the, I can't even pronounce it, it's just one of these old-timey words, the telharmonium. - The telharmonium? - T-E-L harmonium. - Thanks for spelling it for me. - Yeah. - What exactly did this thing do? - So, the telharmonium was an organ that converted the music into electrical signals, and then those electrical signals go through wires and everything into a paper cone, so one of the first loudspeakers. And then that loudspeaker, basically, was playing into a telephone, and that was being broadcasted, technically, even though it's all just one big telephone system, to restaurants, and hotels, and even homes around Manhattan. The organ itself was in the main area of a concert hall, and then the actual device itself, and there's the organ right there. So it was a 150 key organ. Now, you could actually call in and request songs to be played. The reason this didn't take off. - (laughs) Oh, okay, go ahead. - Again, this is super groundbreaking. - Groundbreaking 'cause it weighs 800 tons. - It literally was groundbreaking. It took up the entire basement of this, - (laughs) Yeah. - of this concert hall. And this was before electrical vacuum tubes were invented, so they used these massive electrical dynamos, which required about the equivalent power of an entire home to run per hour. - All right. - Next item. - I'm hoping to stump you with this one. - This is the third and final question. What's your confidence level right now, Matt? Do you think you're gonna stump me, or am I gonna go three for three? - I think I am gonna stump you. - Shoot your shot, my friend. I'm feeling pretty confident right now. - When do you think downloading games? - Oh, Matthew Ansini, this is a topic I know a thing or two about, go ahead. - [Matt] When do you think downloading games was first invented? Was it A, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or the 1990s. - Okay, so I know that both the Genesis, as well as, I believe, the Super Nintendo had a modem component where you actually, specifically in Japan, you could download games to them, and I believe that was either late '80s or early '90s, but I'm assuming we're talking older than that. I'm throwing out 1990s for sure, and I'm still gonna throw out 1960s. You might throw me a curveball with some weird, old military program that they downloaded or something. I don't think so. - WarGames, it's a great movie. - I feel pretty confident that there was some weird thing in the '80s that you could stream games from. I'm gonna say the 1970s. Ah, oh! - You're wrong! - [Ken] Yes. - When was it? - You talked yourself out of it. It was in the 1980s. - Really? (Austin groans) But I thought that the... - 1981, the Mattel Intellivision. - [Austin] It was the Intellivision, it was '81? - '81. - I thought the Intellivision was like '79. - [Matt] Maybe in development. - No, man I was so close! (Matt laughs) It was the one I should have known! Wait, so it was, yeah, it was some attachment for the Intellivision, right? - It was the PlayCable, and it wasn't a modem, it was a cartridge that you rented from Mattel. It was $12 a month, so half the cost of a regular game, and it plugged in via coax cable. - Oh, okay. - Not a modem. - Yup, yup. - And you could, in theory, download any of their games to the cartridge. Now, it was a super cool concept, because you had access to their major titles, like Frogger, and Pitfall, and I can't believe that those are, I'm saying those are A-list titles. It was significantly cheaper, and basically you just rewrote over the cartridge every time you download the game. They even got Mickey Mantle to come on and do a whole series of commercials. - The Intellivision was big. - Yeah, it was huge. - This is a really well thought-out game. I'm still happy with two out of three, especially considering that two out of three were definitely guesses, and only one of them I felt confident in, and I was wrong about that one, so congratulations. - So, what I figured out for next time is I need to make these way harder, - No, no, no, no, it's fine. - and pinpoint the year - No, how dare you? - instead of the decade. How dare you? I'm never gonna get the, it's just gonna be a one out of four chance, 'cause I'm just gonna guess. The decade is the way we should this. - Okay, so if you have a challenge you think I should issue Austin, let me know in the comments. And I'm gonna say well done. - Thank you. - And I'm looking forward to this extra $500 for Mystery Tech. - Look, it could have been a whole lot worse, a whole lot worse. - It will be next time.",

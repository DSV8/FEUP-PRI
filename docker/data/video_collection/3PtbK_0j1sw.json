    "description": "Razer Blade Stealth with the MX150 is a crazy expensive \"gaming laptop\" Alternatives: 3x Better -  Zenbook -   With the i7-8565 and the Nvidia MX150 the Razer blade stealth is capable of playing games at reasonable frame rates but at the price point, there are way better alternatives like the MSI GS65, Aero 15, even the regular Razer Blade 15. This notebook has great build quality but can't compete at the price point.

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here? I've always been a fan of razer's stealth laptop. It's their thin and light not gaming laptop it's kind of like their ultrabook line and it's a device that Every year they kind of tweak it a little bit and they've always had a product that looked good Performed pretty well, and I was also reasonably priced this is the 2019 model and this is the first year that I feel like razer made a mistake with this product because the price point Is Wrong. Now let me explain, the hardware is good. The device is built really Well, it has this design aesthetic that's similar to the 15-inch razer blade from this year. It's got this boxier cleaner aesthetic to it I like the shape of it. The logo, the triple headed snake, does not light up this year They call it a two-tone finish But it's basically a matte finish on the surface of the laptop with a polished snake logo And I think it's a more mature looking device I feel like some people really hated that green light up logo, and this just looks a lot cleaner So the ports on this device are a little bit different this year. There's two USB-A and two USB-C So instead of the HDMI port they've replaced it with a second USB-C If you do need an HDMI, you can get an adaptor or whatever. There's also a single headphone jack on the left Okay, opening up this device. We have view of the wonderful new screen. So this is a device that's rocking some very thin bezels They're 4.9 millimeters. The top bezel isn't as thin as the sides, but it has the windows Hello camera up top, which isn't great in terms of image quality, but it gets the job done It comes in either a 1080p or a 4k option. The one I have is a 4k panel, but I got to be honest I've always found that on 13-inch devices 4k panels were a little bit unnecessary because the difference in resolution is not that easy to spot at like a regular laptop viewing distance, but the 4k panel does look quite nice. It's color accurate. It's bright. It's a good panel Ok, the speakers. There's two on each side. They sound good They sound better than the previous generation like these speakers if I had to rank them I'd give these like a six and a half maybe a seven. No, six-and-a-half. These are probably seven and a half maybe an eight They're not as good as like MacBook Pro speakers or MacBook Air speakers, but they're definitely better than the previous generation The keyboard also feels quite similar to last year's model as well. I don't like the new layout though So the old layout felt more traditional to me particularly the right shift key now This is that I've mentioned in previous videos as well. I think it's something that affects a very few people I'm one of those people but I use the right shift quite regularly and It's just in a weird spot on the new stealth if you use the right shift a lot Then you're gonna take some time to get used to it keyboard on the whole though is a nice keyboard trackpad This doesn't feel that different from last year's model either. It's still windows precision still a glass surface It's bigger, but the experience is pretty similar to last year's model. It's a good trackpad Now the lighting on the keyboard is a little bit different this year They're running a single color RGB so you can't do individually customized keys But depending on what you want out of your keyboard that may or may not make you sad The keys on the top actually have lighting on them So the previous generation you couldn't see the function controls on each of the function keys, but those light up as well now which is nice now the advantage of having a single color across the whole layout is Power consumption and the battery life on this device is good I got a little bit over 6 hours with the screen at 250 nits. And this is with the 4k panel It's not a huge battery. It's been bumped up to 53 watt hours, but it's more energy efficient system So you get slightly better battery life this year then last year. The AC adapter is still small 65 watts So if you want to charge it on a plane you're good to go The RAM is soldered on the drive is replaceable, and it's running a pair of fans this year Which actually get louder than I expect for an ultrabook the temperatures are good, but the fans do run loud. Ok I want to spend some time talking about performance on this laptop So you can equip this thing with an MX 150 from Nvidia. This is a GPU that comes in two variants They have a weaker 10 watt version that is on some laptops and they have a stronger more powerful 25 watt version which they have in this particular laptop same with some other laptops out there. The 25 watt version is Not that much better than the 10 watt version. It's better. It's noticeable, but it's not like a huge difference The thing is razer is kind of like marketing this thing as if it were a gaming laptop I don't think they ever call it a gaming laptop per se its gaming capable It can run games But it's not a great GPU and it's significantly weaker than even a laptop gtx 1050 no matter how you spin it This is not a gaming laptop and same with video editing the MX 150 is better than nothing right It's got some CUDA cores in it But editing and rendering are still very underwhelming on this machine even with that 25 watt MX 150 games Just don't run very smoothly at 1080p you got to drop it down to like 720p to be able to play at 60 frames per second for a lot of games which honestly Isn't that big of a deal but the problem is that this thing costs Sixteen hundred dollars to get a configuration with the MX 150 and quite frankly. That's the device That's most interesting right to have that kind of GPU power in something this small That's why people are eyeballing this thing. But here's here's my take on it, okay If you are actually someone who is considering spending sixteen hundred dollars on a device that has a GPU in it like this That's not super powerful Chances, are you are a gaming enthusiast You may not be super hardcore, but you're gonna be someone that enjoys playing games You want to have a decent gaming experience so if you're gonna spend sixteen hundred dollars on this why not take that money and spend it on a device that is significantly better at playing games like there are devices out there like the GS 65 from MSI or the aero 15 or even Razer's own entry level of razor blade those are devices. I'm pointing over there because they're over here. I'll pull em in These are devices that bring A significantly better gaming experience than the thing that they're squashing They're just so much better. It makes no sense that this thing costs sixteen hundred dollars now I get it There are some people that just don't want a 15 inch device because these are bigger they're thicker. They're heavier I get it some people want something smaller. So get something else that's small with an MX 150 There are a lot of devices some of them start at like 900 bucks going up to 1200 dollars that have MX 150's in them now Some of them will be running 10 watt chips and some of you need 25 watt chips but they're just so much cheaper than the new Razer Blade stealth and I know some people gonna watch this video and they'll be like Who cares Dave why you talk about value like this doesn't matter It's a razer product. Take my money but the thing is I Have supported razer's pricing on their razer blade stealth ever since they launched this product like it's always been a little bit more expensive than other competitors in The market but I always felt like it was worth that extra value like you're getting the razer experience. They're well-made products They look good. But this year I feel like they just They push that envelope of what they think they can charge a little too far So if you're someone that's on the market for something that looks just like this like you want that 13 inch device and you have a huge budget I mean, this is one of very few devices that fits that ticket But for most people I just I don't think it's a good fit. You should either get something that's equivalently priced that's way better at gaming or something that's a lot cheaper and Provides very similar performance. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time",

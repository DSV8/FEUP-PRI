    "transcript": "recently I bought my first racing Sim setup which went very well I was like trying to like oh you can actually dve but it did get me very interested in the hobby so I decided to head on to the used market and see if I could scr up something a bit [Music] better now before we have a look at the used racing Sim Market I want to briefly walk you through Sim racing wheel-based technology which sounds really boring but it actually isn't and according to a bunch of Gary's online makes a really big difference there are three ways in which racing Sim wheelbases connect the steering wheel to the motor that drives the feedback and as far as I can tell these three methods exist in a distinct hierarchy of goodness at the bottom of this hierarchy we have gear based systems which as the name suggests connects the steering wheel to the motor using gears now according to enthusiasts the problem with this method is that it's very bad at reproducing smooth steering action you can really feel the naess in the gears which means it can't reproduce detailed feedback making it the loser tier dri Tech now as far as I can tell most budget Wheels use this technology including the Amazon one we tried before and most of the very common log litech racing wheels and people seem to like that Logitech wheel quite a lot so maybe the technology isn't that bad I guess we'll find out now in the middle of the hierarchy we've got belt drive bases which as the name suggests connects the steering wheel to the motor using belts as opposed to gears now again according to enthusiasts these can go a long way to alleviating the vague naess of a geared base so it feels a lot smoother but you can still feel the changes in tension in the belts which can give you kind of weird feedback and those belts can wear down over time potentially impacting long-term reliability but apparently it's quite a step up from geared bases and then finally we've got the god king tier at the top direct drive bases which according to people who have used them is the greatest thing since Michael fast Bender's package direct drive bases typically have a Servo motor in them and then the steering wheels connected directly to like the spinny bit in the middle of the motor because you have a much smoother Direct connection between the wheel and the motor you don't really feel the base as much apparently giving you much more accurate feedback and they tend to be way more powerful you get wildly powerful bases that can easily snap both your arms like they're made of wipi the main problem with this technology is just that it's more expensive even though they have been coming down in price quite a lot over the last couple of years this fitech direct drive kit for example only costs a bit more than the current generation Logitech loser drive one and it's way more upgradeable now one of the companies that make these direct drive bases mosa did reach out to send a base and wheels setup over for me to try which I was very tempted to accept but I don't want to include it in this video because we're looking at like used cheaper entries into the market but let me know in the comment section down below if I should check that out for a video cuz I'm really interested to see how it would compare to these other bases and with arguably too much context let's have a quick look at the used Market before checking out the couple of setups I bought starting with eBay where the higher end direct drive and belt driven stuff seems to hold on to their value very well almost to the point of delusion on the sell's part why would I buy a used one for more than I can buy a new one for and even the ones that are priced anywhere close to sanley have very high shipping and import duties basically erasing any savings to be had and the whole shipping issue is exacerbated by the fact that I live in Canada and most Sim racing enthusiasts seem to be br British for some reason shipping is also an issue for the more budget Logitech Wheels which I really wanted to try one out because they're so popular and I think it's a great point of reference so I headed over to Craigslist for some local back alley used knife battling which had its own problems the first of which was very limited selection and then the couple of options that there were had a very common Vancouver used Market problem where there were just a bunch of new ones that people bought on sale and are now trying to scalp for MSRP however if you very closely monitor the Market deals do pop up one of which I snagged now unfortunately this is a new one due to Market reasons but I really wanted to check out one of these Logitech sets because they're by far the most popular a couple of good used deals did pop up locally but they sold so quickly that I just missed them every time and I wasn't going to buy a sculpt one so I just bought the sale new one but don't worry we've got a very exciting used setup to look at a bit later it comes with a 42 W power brick to power all of that driving force there's some advertising for you to buy more stuff starting off with the pedal box which is already like four times the size of the one that came with the Amazon one we've got metal pedals ooh there's some resistance to the brake pedal the rest of it very plasticky but it's a huge improvement over that Amazon one it actually sits in place as well ooh and it connects to the steering wheel with this Mesozoic period Port looking thing that's nice in retro oh on the base you've got this carpet catcher oh like that that is very useful for carpet ooh the steering wheel is wrapped in real leather which feels quite nice the wheels kind of small compared to a real steering wheel which despite the nicer materials still makes it feel like a toy on the note of toy the button placement on the inside of the wheel is nice and ergonomic we've got some nice if sharp feeling metal paddle shifters but unfortunately this Logitech one doesn't have that awesome included sequential gear changer which is a real shame I need to be more aggressive with the shifts to really get the speed up but you can get a shifter add-on for this one which I'm not entirely sure if it works as a sequential gear lever all in all with this Logitech set all of the touch points have really high quality materials on them and then everything that you don't normally T is super plasticky but it does feel like something that should hold up well used and from what I've read online these Logitech wheels are more reliable than a wood burning stove and it even comes with table clamps not suckers like the Amazon one so we may be able to use it without having to duct tape it to the [Music] table oh wait I just realized I still need to plug all the other cables in and with it mounted on the desk like this you you can't really access it so I'm going to have to take it off and redo that and after plugging in the cables and setting it up again I was ready for some framework of reference the moment I sit down I can kind of tell why a frame would make a big difference because with this kind of setup you can't really adjust your driving position much and now I just I'm in full granny mode but with some shifting around I got it to a point where I felt a bit less like a 90-year-old behind the wheel that feels a bit better oh VR mode I do really think this is the best use case for VR like actual driving Sim racing I was talking to one of my friends about it the other day and it it really seems like the best application for it because it oh that's so notchy feeling it's like but before I could crush some sick gravel or whatever I had to download some drivers and calibrate the wheel oh oh wo this there's so o oh drift oh there's so little feedback what that is that feels so different to what I was expecting it to feel like so I've been using my used wheel for the last 2 weeks and it does not feel at all like this one I I wonder to what extent the game has to do with it I then spent ages playing around with settings to get the driving feel to make sense to me and maybe also make it feel a bit less like the world's limp handshake but if anything I just kept making it worse like it's not turning and once I got dir two completely unplayable I decided to just abandon it for Forza for now okay let's let's give it a try cuz with the other wheel which we're going to look at in a little bit Forza worked perfectly pretty much straight out of the box and then as some kind of karma I guess forza's screen capture just stopped working the moment I started driving so with my iies please imagine some amazing gameplay over the next little bit oh yeah okay there we go this feels way way better but then the force feedback kicked in whoa that's such weird force feedback you can really feel the gears clacking away inside I I'm I'm not a fan of that because it feels so simulated even on its lowest setting the force feedback on this wheel in Forza feels really unnatural because you have similar limp steering feel as in dirt rally 2 underneath and then the intense Rumble feels like a separate thing just thrown over top to feel cool or whatever but if anything it just distracts from the little bit of usable feedback the steering wheel gives you but it's still so much better than using a controller is like one of the most fun things you can do on a computer and on that note let's have a look at the very exciting used setup I [Music] bought I managed to knife battle this reasonably heavily used belt driven thrust Master set off of Craigslist for $460 Canadian dollar that includes the frame and a Formula 1 style wheel so you can be real sweaty or cosplay as a Tesla owner now I'm actually not a huge fan of the Formula 1 style wheel like I said rally is the best racing Sim genre and that's very much not a racing wheel I prefer like a round one anyway to put the price into perspective that Logitech one we were looking at earlier new not on sale sells for $400 Canadian doar with tax and stuff that's a very similar amount to this one and again it even comes with the frame now to set it up you just kind of pull that out and then there you go starting off with the wheel it's made of of metal over here and then we've got alcanta on the grips which is the racest material but I think it's a really stupid material to have on touch points because it becomes disgusting the moment you look at it funny and you can see that these are quite heavily worn but they still feel decent the paddle shifters on the other hand listen to that now the base is a thrustmaster TX Servo base which supports Xbox and PC and like I said it's a Bel driven base with pretty brutal build quality but you don't really interact with that bit so I I guess that's fine the pedals are a decent improvement over the Logitech ones you've got much better pedal feel and actual resistance in the throttle pedal and you still get metal caps but the rest of it is quite plasticky oh my God it's so heavy and with no calibration and setting changes I jumped straight back into Forza where I still didn't realize that the screen capture wasn't working oh just the difference between the pedals and the shifters because the the like the belt system does both this the steering and the feedback you can tell what the car's front wheels are doing a lot more than with the Logitech one like the feedback is way more subtle than the Logitech but it's so much more realistic oh this is so much better see cuz you can control your power slides way better because you can feel what the car is doing as opposed to kind of having to guess I then tried some more dirt rally which without any calibration or setup worked great it's so much better now it just needed to learn how to do rally cuz I don't know the track at all and I don't know how to follow Pace notes now that I knew what to look for I went back to the Logitech base and set up some Logitech profiles with it and reduced the throttle sensitivity which made it a lot more usable dirt rally 2 is a lot less gratuitous with how it used the rumble than Forza was which meant it translated the feeling of the car through the Logitech steering wheel way better than Forza did although even in dirt rally when compared to the thrust Master wheel the Logitech set feels a lot more numb and less detailed also the Logitech pedals are quite a big step down from the thrust Master ones in terms of break feel and throttle resistance helping you control the car more subconsciously all in all the thrust Master base just feels that much more realistic and this comparison's gotten me real curious about direct drive to see how much better this experience can get and maybe some VR either way keeping your eyes peeled on the used Market can get you a great entry into trying out this very fun hobby just do your research be patient and until the next video thank you for watching [Music] bye-bye",

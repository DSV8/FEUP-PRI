    "transcript": "(alarm clock beeping) - It's March 20th, 2020, I'm Justine. This is my eighth day of quarantine. Rhyming was unintentional. This is my dog Matty. And it's also the first official day that Los Angeles has shut down, and it's my birthday. We're shut down, but walks outside and exercise is allowed, as long as you're staying six feet away from others. Social distancing. Respectable ratio. (somber electronic music) So, I'm being a little dramatic with the music and the voiceover, because right now this is what I'd normally be doing. It's 5:30 AM, I'm making some coffee, and one of the things that we have to celebrate today, other than my birthday, is the fact that Animal Crossing is out. I got up super early today, because there is a video that is due to post around 5:30 AM, and I haven't finished editing it yet. You guys can't see it because it is behind the scenes, but right now, I'm shooting this on my iPhone. I'm doing a fun little test to see if I can shoot, edit, do all of the voiceovers and everything on IOS. And of course, stay tuned for a video of that later on. But for now enjoy my super dramatic, moody vlog. Don't worry, the whole video isn't gonna be like this, but I guess I'm trying to give you a sense of how I'm feeling. I'm feeling strange, I'm feeling weird, I'm feeling off, and I think however you guys are feeling right now, it's completely valid. I do work with my friend Tyler who shoots a lot of my videos for me and edits. So he got a jumpstart on this edit last night, and while he was doing that I started playing Animal Crossing because it officially came out last night March 19th. Today is March 20th. So he just sent me the XML file of the footage that he was editing, sent me that. I just imported it on to my computer and now I'm gonna finish the edit, adding some music, doing some color correction. Probably edit for a few hours, until the dog decides that he's ready for a walk. The weirdest thing, is the feeling of going outside, is wrong. (somber music) (whimsical music) Do you want to go for a walk? (whimsical music) (water running) (lid clanks) Matty. Hey, who's a good boy? Is it you? Hey, did you know Matty, that this leash is about six feet? And that's how far away we have to be for social distancing. Are you listening to me? Do you care? (whimsical music) (egg cracks) (oven door clicks) (beep) (Matty chews food quietly) (seasoing grinder cracks) And breakfast is made. I'm such a huge fan of that Brava oven, I'm gonna be doing a video with them. It's gonna be a \"what I wat in a day\", so it's basically everything that I cook in there. It's really been amazing because before I got this oven, I never cooked anything, and you guys know this. I've been wanting to do a video on that for awhile, so now I'm gonna eat and play Animal Crossing. Are you a good boy? Yes, you are. Matty already had his breakfast. He want's eggs but he can't because has an allergy. You already had your breakfast. Keeping consistent and keeping active something that I'm that I'm really trying to do. One of my suggestions for you guys is to download the Peloton app. I'm sure you guys are very familiar with Peloton, with the bike, and the treadmill, but Peloton actually has this entirely incredible digital app. This is not sponsored at all. I've been such a huge fan of them. Check out the app, they have all kinds of really great yoga classes, strength classes, meditation. It's really really awesome. So, especially for a time like this, in the fact it's free 90 days. The perfect time to check it out. How are you doing bud? I went to buy some more of these gym mats, 'cause I wanted to extend it a little bit more, and they're all sold out. Do you know why? Because everybody is trying to work out from home now. (upbeat music) - [Instructor On Treadmill] Press music. So, let's make this special. - I'm strugglin'. (grunts) [Instructor On Treadmill] Ready? Give me a little speed, go. (upbeat music) - [Workout Video Instructor] 30 minute intermediate Yoga Flow class. If you're in plank lower to chair lower or the floor. And the come to your backbend, whether its an Updog or Cobra. Press to Down Dog. Right foot lunges to the hands. Outer left heel drops. (calming music) - Not gonna lie, I barely made it through this today. I'm very tired. I only slept for three hours last night because I got up so early to start editing. But I cannot stress how incredible the Peloton app is. I've been using it for the past year, and I'm definitely lucky enough to have one of the treadmills, but I travel so much that I probably use the digital app more than the actual treadmill in my house. It's really great because you can also do outside runs, and a lot of times you just need body weight for some of the strength classes. Dun dun dun dun dun. Dun dun. Hi Matty. Wanna go for a walk? (calming music) I'm actually having, probably, I wouldn't say it's like the best birthday ever, but I'm having a pretty great one. I've had so many incredible birthday wishes, and I even got a few flower deliveries, and I got a cake delivered today. So, all things considered, it's been really fun so far, and it's been really nice going out for some walks with Matty. It's also really cool seeing everybody else out walking their dogs. One of my neighbors was like, \"Man, It's crazy\" \"Some of these dogs I bet are so excited to have all of there owners home for so long\". Definitely true. Oh my gosh, he's so excited. He's so excited to be outside. Talk about a no contact delivery. I walked outside to take the dog for a walk, and this cake was sitting on my doorstep with some flowers from my family. Some of you might recognize this cake. It's the birthday cake that is in the the Animal Crossing game. This is so freaking cool. It looks exactly like it. Happy Birthday, Justine. Here's the thing, I could eat this whole cake myself. (game beeps) I don't have any medicine. Whatever will I do? The hospitals are overloaded. (game beeps) Yeah, Rocket. (game chatters) Wish me that happy birthday, don't ask my age. You're a true friend. (calming music) Jenna, hi. - Hi. - So, this is day two of the lockdown. This is actually the first time that I've really been outside outside. So, what this really means, especially for us is, they said that you can go outside, you can hike, and do exercises but you have to stay at least six feet away from people. - I feel like I should have one of these big hula hoops around me, so nobody gets in my way. - There was another hike that we wanted to do, but it's way-- - It's narrow. - I's very narrow. So, this one Jenna suggested because there's a lot of wide open spaces. - [Jenna] Like look how far away from me. - You're so far away. - [Jenna] Can you measure? - [Justine] I can use the Measure app. This is about six feet. - Okay. - [Justine] Here. We gotta keep goin', we gotta keep goin'. (rocks crunching) - [Jenna] I'm doing that. - [Justine] Peloton. I've been doing those hill runs. - [Jenna] Aw, man. - On Peloton, it sucks. Wow, it's so nice out. Definitely something I would have take for granted. (calming music) The people in front of us are practicing perfect social distancing. - [Jenna] They are. - [Justine] They are like exactly six feet apart. It's impressive. - And like you could tell that they're like family so they've probably been around each other, but they're still doing it. - Yeah, practicing. Okay, let's practice. I'm a little further but it's-- - No, this is good. - Okay. (rocks crunching) Jenna just said she wants to pick this weed, so that she could sell it. (chuckles) Hey, Jenna shake this tree for me. Jenna is on her way to my island. It's giving me her flight information. - [Jenna] It didn't even give me my flight information. Oh my god, look at all your weeds. - [Justine] It says starting decent. Are you flying in? Show me. Yeah, there you are. Oh my gosh, I'm having the best time. I mean we could be doing the same thing if we weren't next to each other but. Do you like me hat? It's really fun. - [Jenna] It's raining here. - I know, I'm sorry. I should've came to yours but I have a pole vault for you and I also have a shovel. - [Jenna] I watched a bird. - I keep talking to him. - [Jenna] Is he drunk? Is he like the drunken-- - I think that's Gulliver. - [Jenna] He said, \"Nope, let me sleep\". - [Justine] He doesn't wanna wake up. - [Jenna] He's hammered. (chuckles) - [Justine] Jenna's giving me cherries and I'm gonna give her a shovel and a stick. Okay. Did you get the goods? (gasps) - [Justine] Yeah, you're gonna be hyped about that. (upbeat music) We're doing a sanitize. Jenna's placing a Postmates order for our dinner. Our birthday dinner celebration. - I was like, who are you talking to? - The phone. - Yeah. I'm cleaning this kitchen. It needs a scrub. Okay, gotta find all the Animal Crossing Amiibo, to come to my birthday party. Or maybe should I have just all of the Amiibo at my party? What do you think? - Um, I mean all are welcome. - [Justine] Okay. (piano music) - [Jenna] Hey Justine, how's your birthday party going? - It's going really well (chuckles). - [Jenna] Yeah? - [Justine] Yeah all my friends are here. - [Jenna] Oh my gosh, this is way over the 10 people limit. - Did you guys wash your hands? - [Jenna] Don't worry, we have a doctor. - I'm making some eyebrows. Some K.K. Slider eyebrows to put on Matty. - [Jenna] Those are big. - Look how big they are. - [Jenna] Yeah, I guess that is in style now. I just want to eat the cake. So, this is Matty before K.K. Slider. - [Justine] You don't look very good. (chuckles) What has happened? And this is our after. (upbeat electronic music) - [Jenna] Great performance tonight, bud. Give me paw. Give me paw. Yeah, good boy. - Incredibly professional. (claps) But from like this angle he actually looks like him. He doesn't seem to mind it. - [Jenna] He doesn't even know it's on him. - [Justine] How we get the shot. - [Jenna] Do you wanna see what's happening outside? Hah what do want, the treats? That's a good picture of him. - [Justine] Look at K.K. Slider. Gettin' a drink. You're thirsty after a performance. (Matty slurps water) - [Jenna] He had like 20 treats. - [Justine] Time for dinner. Jenna, thank you so much. - [Jenna] Happy Birthday. - [Justine] Wow. They even put like little strawberries on. Those look great. I'm gonna-- (mumbles) So, now I gotta wash my hands again. - [Jenna] So, it's a white vanilla cake with strawberry icing. - [Justine] It's a perfect piece. - [Jenna] It's a very big piece. That's a huge piece. (gasps) oh my god. - [Justine] That looks beautiful. That looks absolutely incredible. - [Jenna] But what am I supposed to do with that? Oh my god. - [Justine] Oh my gosh. I'm so happy. Whoa. I was editing and I just realized I didn't shoot an end to this video because I basically ate the cake, and then played Animal Crossing for the rest of the night. So, that's what I did. I had a really great birthday. So, thank you to Jenna, thank you to Nintendo for getting me a cake, and thank you to all of you guys for sending me so many incredible well-wishes. It was actually a very strange time to be sort of celebrating, but I did have a really great time all things considered. Hope you guys are staying safe inside and I will see you in my next video. Bye. (upbeat music)",

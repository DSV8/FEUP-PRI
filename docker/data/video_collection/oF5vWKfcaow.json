    "transcript": "(electronic music) - Your guys Jonathon here quick impressions on the OnePlus 6T. It is a beautiful, beautiful phone. I think that water drop notch something we all have been looking forward to. The display is really good and the price is kinda crazy when you compare it to other phones out there, and that in display fingerprint reader. It's not like amazing, but it's really good to the point that I have no problem using that as my main source of unlocking the phone. That's not why we're here though, today we're revealing the results of that blind test stacking up the OnePlus 6T, against the Google Pixel 3, the Galaxy Note 9, and the iPhone XS Max. Now before I reveal those results, I don't think OnePlus expected to be the best in these tests, It was more so like hey our phone is cheaper, but you'd be surprised at how well we can hang with the big boys, and I don't think they're wrong. They didn't ask to see the photos or approve them, they kinda just said take the phone, do whatcha do, take some pictures and then let the internet decide. With that said though, here are the results drum roll A is the Google Pixel 3, B is the I'm kidding it is the OnePlus 6T, C is the Galaxy Note 9 and D is the iPhone XS Max. So this first shot here I really think really when it comes down to it you are picking hairs all of them did a really, really good job. Maybe the Galaxy Note 9 with those Samsung saturated colors makes a little more appealing, but really all three of them outside of the Google Pixel 3 I think expose these properly. This next shot here the Red Hydrogen Media Machine Medallion or whatever you want to call this, and that's a different phone and a different conversation, for a different day, but as far as this one again I think you are splitting hairs. The only one that really stands out to me is the Galaxy Note 9 I think kinda over exposes this shot because if you look at the others, especially on the iPhone, and both the OnePlus 6T, you can see the detail of the actual table itself is lost with the Note 9. So this next shot here with that plant, if we're looking just at the leaves, I think the Galaxy Note 9 looks best. But if we're talking like both the plant and the exposure of the window, I think the Google Pixel 3 does the better job. This next shot of me here I think I prefer the iPhone most, the HDR here is really kicking in with the sky the exposure, the overall balance, the Pixel 3 to me here is a little under exposed, the OnePlus 6T looks great as well as the Note 9. In a situation working where I had any of these of these pictures I would not be disappointed. So for this building shot I would definitely say the iPhone is the warmest of out of the bunch, with the Pixel hands down taking the sharpness. I think the Note 9 is probably the most balanced in terms of what that actually look like in real life, but again it kinda showcases that OnePlus 6T is hanging in there really well. Next we got that classic flower shot. And for this I'm going to roll with the iPhone as my favorite here. The Pixel does a really good job, but if you look at the background, it's a little overexposed. The Oneplus 6T here is actually not that bad, and while it's not the best, I do think it is actually better than the Pixel 3 on this shot. Next for the shot of my boy Ken, I think the iPhone does the better background blur here, but that Pixel 3 it's just like that classic Pixel portrait shot. I think the overall separation from the foreground to the background is the best. Next from there the double selfie. Once again with Ken I actually think I prefer the Note 9 here in this case. The Pixel 3 is sharp, but it's a little under exposed the iPhone kinda came out a little bit grainy. And while I think OnePlus 6T did a really good job, it's just a little over exposed. Next from there with that front facing portrait selfie, I think by default people a lot of people are going to like the sharpness of the Pixel 3. If you look closely, though I don't think it does a perfect job with the edges of my hair. And if we're talking like actual true colors, I like the iPhone better. Next for this landscape shot I think it's pretty much a toss up between the Pixel 3 and the iphone XS Max. The Oneplus 6T is solid, just a little under exposed but once again it kinda showcases that hey even though this phone is way cheaper, it is not that far behind. Next for this front facing portrait selfie off the rooftop I think I prefer the Google Pixel 3, followed by the OnePlus 6T, and then from there both the Note 9 and the iPhone XS Max in here are kinda eh. Next from there with this night time shot, I think the Google Pixel 3 did the best job, but I was really surprised with the OnePlus 6T like I didn't think it would be this close at all. Next for this pumpkin kisses & harvest wishes honestly man it is really close. I will say the Pixel 3 and OnePlus 6T are close in their terms of color, whereas the Note 9 and iPhone are definitely the warmer out of the bunch. For this next shot here I definitely prefer the iPhone XS Max if you look at the sky with the shadows and the detail overall it is the best balanced image. Next from there with Mr. Pumpkin it is kinda scary how close the Pixel 3 and OnePlus 6T are. The Note 9 is definitely a little over exposed out of the bunch with the iPhone definitely have the warmest image out of all four. Next from there hopping over to Mr. Pumpkin Spider. That is one unique looking thing. I think the Pixel 3 and Note 9 did the best job but again, I think we're all going to be surprised how well the OnePlus 6T kept up. For the stary, purply, mesmerizing look shot honestly I think I prefer the OnePlus 6T out of all these images. The Note 9 is definitely over exposed, where as the OnePlus 6T really kind of nailed it here. Next from there we got that night time portrait selfie. I think if the iPhone didn't have that noise reduction skin smoothing effect look I would prefer this the best. Those Boca balls are beautiful, but because it does have that noise reduction, it looks a little unnatural here so I'm going to go with the Pixel 3 and then that's going to be followed by the OnePlus 6T, with the Note 9 coming in last. Like that's a mess. So that is the blind test hopefully you guys had some fun and again I don't think OnePlus and 10 or were expected to be the best. I think they just wanted to showcase that hey our phone is a lot cheaper, but we can definitely hang with all the flagships out there. With that said though, drop a like if you agree we are in an amazing times in terms of smart phone tech right now where it pretty much doesn't matter which phone you have, you're going to get a really solid camera unless you bought the Razer Phone 2. The full detailed in depth OnePlus 6T review is coming very soon so definitely subscribe if you haven't yet. And again I'm giving away 2 brand new iPhone 10 R's link up here, or down below this is Jonathon and I will catch you guys later.",

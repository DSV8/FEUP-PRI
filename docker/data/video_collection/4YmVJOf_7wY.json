There's a ton of models like the Razer Blade Pro 2019, Legion Y540 and more that will have these new CPUs along with RTX 2080, 2070 and 2060 GPUs.  But will this be enough to compete against what AMD will be offering with Ryzen in 2019?

    "transcript": "well hello good people I'm Dimitri and the new 9 gen CPUs from Intel the coffee like refresh is finally here for the mobile so all the notebooks are going to be getting a nice little speed bump in terms of frequency and so if you've been wanting to pick up a notebook right now should you wait potentially for the 9th gen rollout I would suggest yes but in this video we'll be discussing all the things that they're new in terms of clocks and some some features stuff that are pretty exciting and also a little bit underwhelming so stick around let's talk about all that right after this for our Canadian audience memory Express is your place for all types of electronics and hardware goodies with fantastic prices great customer service and uber price guaranteed with stores in BC Alberta Manitoba and the new Saskatoon location everything is linked below thank you very much so understanding what this 9 generation calculate refresh processor lineup for the notebook space means we first have to rewind so the first generation of coffee like mobile processors carry the 8000 series name or based on the 14 nm manufacturing process and were released last year and don't confuse those with whiskey Lake or amber Lake which are also based on the coffee lake architecture but are a lot more power efficient and really targeted towards the lower more power efficient ultrabooks and such and then there was the second generation of coffee Lake CPUs for the desktop first under the 9000 series name like the 9900k and so that is the product that is being moved into the mobile space for mainstream and gaming notebooks now don't confuse this with Intel's ice Lake which has been rumored and stuff so that's coming out in sometime in q4 and that is based on the 10 nanometer manufacturing process instead of the 14 and so the ice Lake is going to be Intel's 10th generation you know architecture and processor lineup but until then we're stuck with the 9 generation on the mobile side and so with this 9 Gen rival to the notebook space there are a few interesting new things like the Wi-Fi 6 module so not necessarily for faster speeds because right now the speeds are fantastic but for reduced latency and like allowing for simultaneous connections to the machine the new Intel Optane h10 support so make sure to check out that video right over here and also this is an interesting one 128 gigabytes of ddr4 support on the notebook side of things which is kind of interesting and kind of insane at the same time and now let's get into the processors and this is something that until obviously wants to really put out there as the most extreme and powerful normal processor the I9 9980HK so eight cores 16 threads 5 G's for tubero boost clocks and it's also unlocked so you can go in and overclock that thing obviously it's for really thick notebooks I guess a particular niche that wants something that powerful that is still somewhat mobile but obviously is like a desktop replacement machine then there's also the I9 9980H so it is locked but they're almost saying it's for thin and like notebooks but as we've seen in the past for I9 machines that cooling is normally not sufficient and you have throttling and therefore more performance than what you should expect from the part now of course these percentage and improvements and performance are all attractive until you look at the footnotes to discover what they're comparing this unlocked 9980HK processor to so they are comparing it to the I9 8950HK it's also unlocked but there's only a 6 score 12 thread part instead of the 8 core 16 thread part so obviously you know the much faster performance and all that comes with additional course on the 9980HK and so here's the full stack for the 9 gen mobile side of things the i5 9 300h all the way up to the i9 9900HK so for core 8 threads all the way up to 8 core 16 threads they all support the Intel Optane H10 modules which is nice they all still have the same integrated graphics the UHD 630 we're kind of hoping for a little bit of an upgrade there but I'm guessing the desktop side thing still has the HD 630 so why would the upgrade dad for the mobile side of things as you can see the i7 9850H is partially unlocked which means you can overclock the memory and I think you have like some Headroom for overclocking the CPU frequency but like it's locked at some point but I'm really excited to see the performance of the 9750H because the 8750H the previous generation is found in so many notebooks it's almost seems like it's like the mainstream gaming processor and that is a two point two to four point one gigahertz part whereas the the new 9750h is a two point six to four point five gigahertz so much higher base clock and nice boost in performance too for that tuber frequency to four point five which is fantastic and it's still a forty five to DP part but my concern is that noble manufacturers right now are not able to cool the CPUs efficiently to maintain that consistent clock speeds for the boost like this razer blade 15 and super thin and the 8750H here boosts to two point nine gigahertz while in the gaming load and so I mean imagine having 9750H here which is supposed to boost up to four point five there is no way as for the availability of notebooks with 9th Gen cpu's we're told it's right after launch which is a good thing and from what we understand it's a simple drop an upgrade from a gen to get your new CPUs rolling and like the gigabyte Aero 15X will have the same chassis everything identical but and UCP and also as a filler Intel's announcing new desktop 9th gen CPUs most of which are locked so better for system integrators who are not allowing that overclock to happen but there is one interesting CPU in here the i3 ninety three fifty K so it is unlocked for core for thread four gigahertz to four point five gigahertz and that sounds like a really nice little gaming package for under $200 of course when compared to value wise against the aim these side of things it doesn't really pop but against Intel's own stack in the i3 department it doesn't look that bad and so this roll out of nine gen into the mobile space is definitely welcome you get a nice frequency boost across the entire SKU versus the agent and now we have the i9 craziness that is happening the ninety nine eighty HK and the H CPUs which I would say like they're not fourth in the light stuff obviously they're for the muscle books to really thick things that stay in your desk and replace your desktop but kinda cool to have that as on the unlocked front because most likely it will be crazy expensive but I mean it still asked for a little bit of experimentation I'm really excited about the 9850H and the 9750H because the clocks on that 24.5 and 4.6 sound pretty fantastic on a 6-quart 12 third CPU and in a thin unlike notebook I mean if all goes well if cooling is sufficient then we're gonna have ourselves a nice low power house in our backpack and if you're on the fence of getting in your notebook definitely be slightly more patient just to see what the prices are like for the ninth gen SKUs and as with new product launch of course the discounts will happen for the 8th gen side which might be a good time to pick up us like the older but still very capable notebook then I know Ebers getting the Aero 15X 9 gen version so definitely stick around to see what the performance difference is like and if we actually hit those turbo boost clocks I'm Dimitri thank so much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content and yeah I'll see you guys in next",

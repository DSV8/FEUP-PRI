    "transcript": "- Hello! Can you see me? Can you hear me over this massive cardboard box? So, this is super exciting. As you guys know, I love video games and Halo Infinite has officially launched, and we've got a couple little care packages here. So, on my Amazon Alexa, it tells me whenever I have a shipment. And I got this little notification, it popped up, it said, \"Your paper towel has been delivered.\" I opened this up and I see this, \"Classified\". And I realize, oh no, no, we need to take this and immediately do an unboxing. So, we're gonna do just that. Gosh, I'm so excited, this is also a super exciting box. What else do we have in here? Does this all come out? Yes, it does. Gosh, this is a cool box, oh, this is so cool. Okay, before I open this I need to undo this, the classified documents. Oh my gosh, look at this, this is so cool, it's a little lanyard with my name on it. Dude, oh, that's me and my little gamer tag. Oh shoot. Oh freaking wow. Oh my gosh. Ah! I haven't even opened the box yet and this is, (Justine gasps) a battle pass seat of the enemy (Justine mumbles) United Nation Space Command officials has satisfactorily confirmed your security clearance and identity. Please examine and secure your personalized UNSC mission equipment. You have a high clearance ID badge. Oh my gosh, I do. What's in here? Oh, the keys. Hm, okay, so I guess it wasn't actually locked. So the security clearance has been breached. Know your weapon. Dude, this is a really cool little kit. I hope I have a little lanyard for this. I'm gonna wear this around the house and just be like security clearance level high. High clearance. So you guys may have seen the video. I did an unboxing of the Halo Infinite Special Edition Xbox. I did end up buying that off of a friend. So no, I didn't buy that off of a stranger in the street, out of a truck of a car. I mean, technically was in the trunk of his car, but it wasn't as shady of a dealing as it may have looked on Tik Tok. Clearly I have hacked the system since this is already unlocked. Celebrating 20 years. It's so crazy thinking that Halo is 20, because I actually remember in college the first time seeing people play Halo and I was like, what are you guys playing? Can I please play? And they let me, and at this time, during early college times, I was kind of back into PC gaming. I had made my own PC. We would have LAN parties and I was playing Unreal Tournament and Quake III, that was like my go-to. We also did play a little bit of Counter-Strike, but, yeah, once I kind of like played Halo on console, I was like, she's back. We're back to console again. Wait, should I open this in the order of the numbers? Okay. We're going to do that. Number one, first, Oh! Oh my gosh. It's a little jacket. Oh, this is nice. Wow. Number two, Oh my gosh. No freaking way. I was just about to spend a lot of money on eBay to get this controller. This is the Elite Halo Infinite Edition Controller. This thing looks so beautiful. And I was kicking myself for not pre-ordering it. But look, (Justine gasps) Oh my God, it's so beautiful. Holy moly. Look at this beautiful braided cable. Wow. The attention to detail. The check, Oh my God, this is beautiful. Once you've played with an elite controller, it is so hard to go back to a regular one. The detail is what really, really gets me. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I cannot wait to play Halo. I'm so hyped because obviously like I love the holidays, I get to spend time with my family, but there's also a lot of downtime. Like people actually do take vacations during the holidays. So my holiday vacations are normally playing video games, so I can not wait to catch up. What are you? Is there something else in here? Oh, the freaking game! I've been playing a lot of the multiplayer. I was at my sister's house and we stayed up so late playing Halo and it actually felt like college again. So my sister had one, her husband had one, My sister Jenna that is. And we were playing with some of our friends online and it actually felt like college house. What else we got? We've got, Number three. Oh my God. It's a freaking Master Chief helmet. Get out of here! Oh my God, it's playing music. What? Oh God! Can I put this on my head? I think I can put this on my head. (Justine whispers unintelligibly) So I'm inside the helmet now. I can't really see very well. I'm pretty sure that if I got caught in combat with this helmet on, I probably would not, It would not survive. It's just like a little stand for it. Dude, this is really cool. You have found a home here. Okay. We've got helmet. We've got controller. We've got the keys to the Jeep. We've got our high clearance security badge. What could possibly be next? Moving on to this box. (Justine groans) So I had no idea what was in this one, but I do know what is in this. I'm just going to open it up 'cause I'm so excited. There clearly is some labels on here that says handle with care because careful handling needs to be in place for what is inside this. For me. Oh my gosh. I can't, I actually can't believe this. This is gonna be so great. As a Halo fan and also a fan of shiny things. Oh my gosh, there's so much packaging in here. (Justine gasps) Oh, it's beautiful. I just want to say I've run out of floor space. I've done several unboxings today and I no longer have a floor. So this is a Swarovski and Halo collaboration. And in my note, it is saying that if I publicly speak about this product, \"I have not received any compensation, but they have sent me this to check out. They have provided me these products for review, but the opinions are my own.\" All I know is my opinion is I'm excited about this. Dude. I saw these online and I honestly, like I almost started crying because they're so beautiful. I love collectibles. And I especially loved collectibles when they are shiny and shimmering and splendid. And oh boy, check this out. (Justine gasps) Oh my God. Even a box is incredible. Like it's a nice green Halo Infinite theme. We're zooming in for this action. Sorry, controller, you need to exit frame. Oh my God, the suspense. (Justine gasps) Oh my, I actually am slightly getting a little bit teary-eyed, I'm not sure if you can see it, but these are so freaking beautiful. Oh my God. I love Swarovski. I think all of their stuff is so beautiful. And they've done some really cool collaborations lately. This is absolutely stunning. It has taken my breath away. Oh my God. This is number 12 of 117. I know I get a little dramatic sometime. This is no way, am I at all acting right now. Like this is seriously just an absolute beautiful piece of art. Like look at this. Oh my God, I'm so freaking excited. Oh, look at the energy sword. Oh my gosh. This is so perfect. Like I actually can't believe it. Is there a little stand? Oh my God, there's a stand for it. Oh, I can't believe it. Oh, can you guys believe this beauty? I need to find like a very special home for this in my house. Like this is seriously, This might be like one of my favorite things that I've ever received. I'm saving this box. This is beautiful. Like absolutely everything about this is so perfect. Like this is so beautiful. Okay, well that's really, that's sharp. I see why they put the little protection on there. This is amazing. These are so beautiful. And I'm going to put a link in the description, if you guys wanna get more information about how you can get these, there's actually a charity happening on StockX, so if you guys are interested, you guys can check that out. These are a limited edition item. There are only 117 of them, with the iconic Spartan number from Master Chief. And I'm so excited, I have actually downloaded the campaign and I will be playing this week and I cannot wait. And with that, I will see you guys in my next video. I hope you, I hope you have a good day. I've been trying to come up with a different way to end my videos and it's clearly, it's not going so well. (Upbeat music)",

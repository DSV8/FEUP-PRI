    "transcript": "I don't know how well the camera's gonna pick this up but this looks like ants there's one there and there's one up there and i also found some goodies that fell outside of the case when we were taking it apart i'll show you that now this right here looks like some kind of roach or fly of some sort you can see how uh how gross that looks and yeah this was definitely in the ps4 because it fell out with a lot of the dust initially so um yeah this thing's worse than i thought this here is a viewer's very dirty gaming console and depending on how well or how not well this video does this might turn into a full-fledged playlist who knows now for those who are wondering do not worry PCDC is not going anywhere for those who saw the last episode of season 2 season three is coming uh we're just gonna be working on trying to get ahead of a few things and also trying to streamline the process a bit and and change things up because it does become a bit mundane just repetitive seeing the same things being cleaned over and over that's kind of how this video uh started as well again whether or not it becomes a full-fledged playlist that is yet to be determined but i figured changing things up a bit cleaning different components or outright tech devices like consoles would be a breath of fresh air so for those who are new to these playlists the premise here is simple we don't charge a dime for any of the services in any of these so the fixer flaw playlist we don't charge anything neither do we for the PCDC series or what could be in this case the GCDDC series the gaming console deep cleaning series i am just asking that these folks be okay with me taking their systems for a few days in order to deep clean and film the process that's all i ask and in return for that i won't charge you anything i can monetize these videos and that allows me to put food on the table i don't like rolling over any of those costs to viewers who are already gracious enough to loan me their systems or in this case consoles for a few days this console here is a ps4 pro and i'm actually very familiar with these my wife and i have one we had one for several years actually it's in the living room and ours has also kind of been collecting dust maybe we'll clean that in a future episode uh if we continue this but this one is definitely in need of a deep cleaning there is dust caked up in all of the grills along the sides of the console there's dust caked up in the ports up front as well as the rear and there's even plenty of dust in the hard drive bay at the rear of the console so it's just um it's gross everywhere there's smudges on the front and on the bottom i'm not entirely sure we're gonna be able to get rid of a lot of these surface scratches without like completely reskinning this putting like a dbrand skin or something over it um we're just gonna have to deal with the scratches but in terms of cleaning it getting rid of all the dust all the grime all the goo that's the goal of this one and we're gonna pull it off just like we do in the PCDC series so without further ado let's get started the Anker nano pro is a must-have charging solution for the latest iPhones which if you recall don't ship with their own bricks in the box anymore and that's where anchor steps in because small this thing is but it packs one heck of a punch charge from zero to 50 percent in just 26 minutes with the nano pro that's three times faster than the original 5 watt charger you'll also have the active shield safety system working in the background for continuous protection while charging providing temperature monitoring and output control to protect your connected device pretty much as peace of mind as it gets you'll also notice the compact size of the nano pro 50 smaller than a standard 20 watt charger it's great to carry around while traveling and can quickly charge your phone if you forget to plug it in the night before which i seemingly do quite a bit anker is the number one charging brand in america and has earned over 65 million users around the world and for good reason so check out the anchor nano pro today by the link in this video's description charge it fast make it last now bit of housekeeping up front i will not be playing music in the backgrounds of these deep cleanings like we have in the pcdc series i want this to be a differentiating factor between the two if we do decide to carry on this playlist i'm going to be commentating talking about how i'm taking apart these consoles and putting them all back together because every console is a bit different and i think that could be another informative aspect of this series that sets it apart from the rest now when it comes to cleaning gear everything's pretty much the same as it was in the pc dc playlist if i'm watching that one this is nothing new at least it shouldn't be we've got plenty of isopropyl alcohol we'll need this we have some shop towels i like these are a bit a bit tougher than your standard paper towel nitrile gloves we've got an electric duster i love this thing anti-static nylon bristles here at the end for good scrubbing and then we've got a knock off ifixit tool kit because i'm a baller on a budget fine point q-tips will also come in handy and you may want something like this respirator if the job is especially dirty i think for this one it's not really necessary it's a bit overkill but oh my god this really comes at a cost it's a lot more difficult to breathe than this but you're probably going to want to do this outside i film indoors and i drive some people crazy but i film it strictly in my office which i deep clean after every single one of these episodes and the reason why i keep it in here is because it's easier to film in here with proper lighting outdoors if it gets cloudy or sunny or if it starts raining or if it's too windy it's just very difficult there's too many variables to keep up with as a videographer so keeping it in here where it's more controlled it just it works and i'd rather do that and clean after the fact for you guys so that the video looks better now the first thing we're going to want to do is connect this console to power and verify that it functions prior to us taking it apart and deep cleaning it you won't know if you were the one to blame when it's all said and done and put back together if it doesn't power on right because you didn't check beforehand so it's important especially if you're a business to verify this all up front and uh yeah it looks like we've got let's call it a post it's essentially what it is it is verifying the integrity of hardware loading up and we should get to the home screen here soon and once we see that yep looks good okay this system is ready for deconstruction so let's flip this thing around actually we've got the hard drive bay right here on the back and we're going to take this out first i noticed this one doesn't have the locking screw and there are no feet on the bottom of this console but it should still work at the end of the day next we need to remove these three screws i believe they are t9 torx screws and this is where our handy dandy tool kit comes into play one two and a three and now we can pull up this back cover there we go oh yeah oh yeah this is a this is pretty dusty i mean just look at the inside of this under tray it is really gross so this though we can clean up mostly with just soap and water because it's plastic so nothing super fancy there now we need to dive deeper there we go top cover finally came off and uh yeah this one is fairly dirty as well let me get that in the shot you can see a lot of dust kicked up on the top cover and i've got quite a lot of dust here in this fan which i suppose i shouldn't be surprised by this over time will affect thermals there is no doubt about it especially in such a small and close system like this so higher thermals means the fan has to spin faster to account for that loss and efficiency and you'll have a louder console overall interesting it kind of looks like this ps4 was opened at one point maybe serviced because this screw is not setting correctly i don't think that's from the factory it's definitely locked in at an angle not totally secured now underneath this portion here is the power supply which we'll remove next from the top portion of the console now this should come up there we go and the power supply should come up as just one solid unit i'm not mistaken oh yeah there we go and we can disconnect it from the main board a few moments later oh gosh okay all right we we have a problem i'm not sure how well this is going to show up on camera it's very small but this connector running to the power supply was definitely pulled out at one point and you can see it's all chewed up this isn't how it should look from the factory and as a result i was really struggling to get this thing out with my needle nose pliers so i yeah tried to wing it with my fingers and that didn't work and uh i ripped the whole connector out i actually pulled up the pads as well three of the four pads on the board so we're gonna have to do a bit of soldering which i did not expect we'd be doing in episode one gg i mean look at how chewed up this connector is there's nowhere to grip i i can't even get this connector out of the header because it is it's just grinded down you can see where they were chipping off bits of it trying to pull it up whatever tool they used it was a bit too abrasive so i'm gonna try to get this thing out without totally jacking up the connection but uh yeah this this is not good so to get further down into this thing and ultimately end up repairing what has been broken you have to disconnect these wires here we'll take care of these ribbon cables and things at the rear a lot of these just slide out this one has a pull tab lift that up this one slides out and then we'll start moving these wires out of the way so that we can get this metal cover off disconnect the fan although actually that's not really needed at this point but that might as well we'll be removing it anyway ah i'm still really frustrated about that power supply connector that's gonna be a pain to resolder because it is so small like basic you know large format soldering is a piece of cake but the small stuff especially without a microscope it's just gonna be uh very annoying all right let's see what else am i missing i'm sure there's something else i'm not seeing here nope is that it okay there we go so the underside of the ps4 is main board now we can remove the smaller shield here and this houses the apu as well as the memory so a few more phillips screws let's pull this up there we go and then this little uh bracket here is what holds the cooler to the top of the apu and now the motherboard should slide out with ease carefully pull it out from under there alrighty nice i'm trying very oh there we go i am trying very hard to get this connector out and i finally did so uh yeah there it is and i think you can see just how stripped away it is especially on the sides so i really want to take care of this wiring before we deep clean it i just uh yeah it's just driving me nuts so what i've done here because i'm not sure i'd rather solder from the other side of this board because we have test points on this side of the board i'll show you some b-roll shots of what this stuff looks like actually i've got tweets i was asking for help i ended up kind of solving it on my own but uh yeah it's out there in case you're interested so we're just doing a continuity test here and all i'm doing is lining up the pins on one side or that well i kind of scraped back some of the exposed copper near the pads on one side and i'm matching those with the test points on the other so you hear that there that means there's continuity which means that these two are directly connected this is a closed circuit now if i try the same pad on one side to a different test point you can see i'm touching them now there's no continuity there's no sound coming from the multimeter so we have continuity in one place and that tells me everything i need to know about how i need to rewire this the 5 volt i believe is this one up here and we can match that with the test point on this side there we go so we know which pads on one side of the board line up with the test points on the other we do have ground to worry about as well we don't have to connect it but i think i will just like solder it to one of these ground planes here um but yeah so i got that straightened out we know how we need to wire it i've got some spare insulated wiring and we're going to run it through one of these uh actually screw holes that mount the board so we're going to sacrifice one of these screw holes to run wire through it and then we'll connect whoops we'll connect the uh the connector that we ripped out the header to those new wires running through this hole and then we connect the power supply to this it'll just kind of be hanging here so it won't be mounted directly to the board but we'll still have contact with the correct pins on the board sorry for that very drawn out explanation but this took me a while to figure out and i was searching online on forums trying to find the pin out for this actually trying to find like an entire motherboard schematic this is an nva-01 model ps4 pro motherboard i couldn't find the schematic so i ended up just uh finding continuity on my own it's not very hard it's not rocket science so we've got that taken care of we'll get the soldering done next and again we're just gonna use some small insulated wire i'm actually gonna pull it from an old fan i'm not using anymore so this is um it's it's not my best solder job by a long shot i openly acknowledge that but it works it's functional and i've tested everything so we've actually got the connector on the other side here this is going to plug directly into the power supply side and i just soldered the wires from this cable to the underside of the board on these test points and we're using one of the cutouts for a screw to route these wires through so we're sacrificing one screw mount in order to get this clean well clean-ish cable routing from one side so now we can turn our attention back to the main assembly we're going to move this secondary shield first this is under the cold plate and then we should be able to shortly remove the fan assembly and now we're tackling the larger shield we've got a few phillips screws to take care of actually i think it was just those two yep that's all that was okay look at that wow so we actually have the the heatsink right there and that is dusty so we'll just take out these remaining two screws for the fan cover here actually the entire fan assembly comes out check that out that is extremely dusty as well and then the optical drive this is one of the last things to take care of am i missing what nope it's just a little latch okay so there's the optical drive assembly so now we have just the shell of the ps4 pro remaining we do have some antennae kind of sprouted around we also have a few ribbon cables we could take these out but at the end of the day if these get wet if we take these outside and hose these down it'd be the quickest way to get rid of a lot of this dust it's not going to be a big deal of course these aren't receiving power at the moment and so long as everything is sufficiently dry before reassembly and powering back on um yeah we're not going to cause any damage to any of these wires so i think i'm going to leave these in here the only other thing i want to take apart just a bit more is this power supply so it's actually kind of enclosed you can see the circuit uh is in there the the main board for the power supply but we're gonna take this uh apart ah-ha i think we got it we've got one connector up there to worry about but uh yeah this was just a bunch of stubborn clips that's all it took and the underside of this is what we're really going to want to focus on oh yeah there's some dust quite a bit of it i'm glad we took this apart a bit further just so we could see where we're cleaning also if you're not comfortable with this kind of stuff i mean the power supply is one of the things i really don't recommend you take apart to this extent if you are not familiar with electronics and you're not familiar with the the safety precautions regarding draining capacitors and things uh just standard stuff you should be doing before you take this apart so yeah do this at your own risk i don't recommend it again if you're kind of a novice at this stuff but you can see these loaded capacitors up top while they shouldn't be loaded now i've drained them correctly but these can these can actually kill you so be careful had to fit the wide angle lens for this shot so this is the entire ps4 pro fully disassembled give or take and a few exceptions but we can access every area of the device that has gotten dust and collected up grime that's the point what we're going to do is take water and soap to a lot of the plastic bits especially it's one of the best ways to clean plastic you could use compressed air but you're still not going to get as much of that stuff up especially if you've got grime caked up water tends to be a lot more abrasive it can get rid of that that grime a lot easier so that's why i like using water and then for the main board power supply for the hard drive things like that we're going to use the nylon brush with the electric duster that i have and then we'll also be using the isopropyl alcohol with some q-tips to clean up the more fine areas we'll of course re-paste his apu clean up the thermal pads i believe for the memory and reassemble all of it so we're at the halfway point thereabouts and it's been a journey especially with the resoldering process still not totally happy with this but it is at least working again and uh yeah we're gonna be we're gonna be getting deep into some dust here so let's get to it so we're going to start by hosing down the plastic bits outside it's also kind of windy so i apologize if you hear weird things here we go and of course if i miss anything while i'm out here we can always take the electro duster to it after the fact we need to let these dry so i will take a towel to them so that it won't get water marks and things because my water at least from the city tends to have a lot of calcium and stuff so when this dries it leaves behind a residue doesn't look very pretty just drying everything off we'll also be mixing in the electric duster where needed some things haven't totally been cleaned up yet you can see we've still got scuffs on the back of this i'm not sure if this will come up or not but we'll try soap and water and manually scrubbing once we get everything else dry and this enclosure definitely needs to be dry beforehand because this is for the power supply moving on to the metal enclosures then actually let's start from the other side i've got to get up this thermal paste there's a shop towel and some isopropyl for that there we go oh yeah this stuff is um it's a bit chalky so i'd say it's at least a year or two old probably older than that depends on if this was re-pasted when it was open because again it definitely was opened that was fairly evident from the power supply screws and header but uh we'll clean this up here and then i think we're going to whip out the electric duster take care of a lot of this loose dust here we go hold your breath and we're going to tackle the other side next this heatsink is freaking gross so we're going to blow in that direction so that it can leave okay looks like it's stuck so probably gonna need to do some scrubbing maybe uh run it through the sink to get a lot of this out because it's not wanting to come up trying to see if i can just pull it all back sometimes it'll just peel back like a piece of tape but it's not wanting to this is really gross yeah that was nasty i'm gonna give this one a bit of a scrub because it does need it i see some dust is sticking to the fins and we'll use an old toothbrush to scrape in there a bit all right and i think we're ready for drying we'll get it done and would you look at that this is looking pretty darn good nothing a bit of water and air can't fix it's not perfect obviously some scratches along the cold plate and things some blemishes on the steel that's not coming up i'm not sure if this is steel or not it feels like a thin steel but it is much better looking now i can see the fin stack looks so much cleaner so this ps4 pro is gonna have a lot more breathing room should keep temps down and should keep the console quieter overall we're gonna do the exact same thing to the other panel as well let's get it we'll give her a little scrub with isopropyl let's see will it come up oh yes it will look at that it just chips away i guess the ipa was helping it a bit i think we can also get this stuff up oh nice wow a little over half of it came up okay and we'll take the electric duster to it one more time definitely an improvement take care of this shield just some isopropyl should do and we'll give the secondary panel a cleaning there we go not looking too shabby next up we've the fan and of course this is a very important part of the cooling system this provides active cooling to both the apu as well as the memory and the vrm so we're going to want to make sure this is deep clean like especially clean since it's the only fan in the system you can see there's a lot of dust caked up on all of these fins it's going to be a bit difficult to get toward the inner parts of each of these fins because of the way that they're shaped and how close they are to each other in the center here but we're going to start first with the electric duster and then we'll work our way to q-tips and ipa this one i'm going to turn on the air purifier for because it's going to get real messy here goes nothing whew that was gross now we can take on some ipa and q-tips yeah these are not getting all the way in there we're going to clean them up as best we can there are a number of fins here so it's going to take a while it is nearly impossible to clean all the way in the inside of each of these fins so it won't be perfect unfortunately usually i can nail these fans but the way these are designed i just i can't get all the way in there but we've cleaned up the remainder of each fin and definitely looks much better now now with this panel here you're probably thinking well greg this um doesn't look too bad when you flip it over still doesn't look too bad right but you gotta you gotta look up close i don't know how well the camera's gonna pick this up but this looks like ants there's one there and there's one up there and i also found some goodies that fell outside of the case when we were taking it apart i'll show you that now this right here looks like some kind of roach or fly of some sort you can see how uh how gross that looks and yeah this was definitely in the ps4 because it fell out with a lot of the dust initially so um yeah this thing's worse than i thought much better now we can move on to the main board i want to start first by cleaning up this thermal paste because i don't want that getting smeared in my electric duster this won't be a perfect clean right away we'll take q-tips to it later we'll just get it off of the die there we go all right now electric duster time clean up a lot of the thermal compound around these small smds not that it's necessary but we want this to look as new as possible there we go and let's see if we can find any dust trapped anywhere else we'll use some q-tips for this as well i like to give the board a nice once-over before setting it aside a lot of dust sometimes gets trapped in the vrm mosfet area and we'll check our ports so type a ports here we'll clean these out especially the insides where dust likes to gather and around the housings looking like a much newer board all right and we'll give the other side a once over and then we'll move on to the optical drive and the hard disk drive these drives will be pretty straightforward i'll remove the hard disk from this little enclosure here and then we'll clean both separately we're sure we're getting dust that could be trapped in between the two and yep give each a proper dusting ipa should finish off the job too many stains on this side but there were a few on this side yep get these up and scrub a bit weird like dirt stains on this thing and that's a clean bill of health this optical drive will be fairly straightforward this by the way is not dust it's just a little cushion to protect the ribbon cable and last we've got the power supply now this i'm not going to clean with isopropyl for obvious reasons i'm just going to stick with air and the brush and there we are power supply is ready to go so i think that's it uh time to reassemble let's get everything together and here we are the entire ps4 pro disassembled yet fully clean with very minor exceptions the fan is really the only one that comes to mind just because we couldn't get all the way inside these fins but everything else is it looks pretty good if i do say so myself and we're going to start reassembling this should be fairly straightforward so let's start first by reinserting the optical drive by the way while i'm doing this your feedback in this episode is pretty much critical if you don't want to see more of these kinds of videos let me know i just figured you know wouldn't really know until i tried and uh i'm having a good time so far apart from almost totally trashing the console this is a learning experience and i expect i'll get better at this with time and the fact that every console is slightly different means that i'll be learning quite a bit so you have a chance of seeing more of these mistakes in the future so we've got the optical drive uh cover secured and now we need to uh lock it into the chassis with these larger phillips screws we can get the fan installed next that will just sit right here now we can get this metal plate back in with the heat sink should sit kind of like that there watch these ribbon cables i just realized i'm supposed to lock these two screws in after the fact i was wondering why this didn't make sense i'm trying to watch the tutorial backwards and uh it's difficult to see that part and we can get this back in there and try again this smaller plate is just going to sit like so now thermal pads are applied we can go ahead and add some thermal paste to the apu our wiring is routed through it doesn't look like it's going to compromise anything we've got the underside cover on we've got all of the ribbon cables connected the antenna connected wi-fi bluetooth and i'm not sure what the f actually i think this is bluetooth i'm not sure but uh yeah that's connected the fan is connected and that's it the front and back are the top and bottom uh sleeves and the system has you know would be fully done after that so i think we're yeah we're on the right track i'm hoping that this thing boots up without issue just to drop it on in and tighten it on down i think there's one yep one little area where i noticed some lingering dust and this is for uh where the fan pulls in air so i'm gonna tackle that real quick so all the dust from this viewer's room is being pulled in from this side this is why it's all gathering over here but okay i think uh this looks pretty good now yeah okay all right i'm gonna stop now and now for the moment of truth i am kind of nervous i shouldn't be nervous but i kind of am because of what happened that's a good sign it's a good start hard drive spoiling up i was i was more nervous about this than i was hoping to be least i now know moving forward if we ever work on another ps4 or ps4 pro that damn power supply cable that 5 volt cable is a major pain so yeah lesson learned at least we fixed it here and i still feel bad about how it happened i know my solder job was just absolute crap so what i'm going to do for this viewer is i'm going to get him a 100 best buy gift card and if he has any problems in the future with the ps4 pro if for instance that solder job goes to crap then i'll just outright buy them another ps4 pro they're not super expensive which is good uh but uh yeah just for the trouble and the fact that he knows it was kind of a jank solution i'm going to give him a 100 gift card for being a good sport and hopefully being okay with the fact that it is now deep cleaned and still working so mission accomplished at the end of the day yes we had a few growing pains yes the solder job was it's not my best i'll be completely honest with you and i'm sure anyone who's done soldering looked at that and said nope that's not no good at all um it's not very good i didn't have any flux and i ordered some flux that'll be here tomorrow but i'm going out of town tomorrow so it's kind of a yeah i wanted to get this back to him uh as soon as possible the console works it has been thoroughly deep cleaned we've re-pasted it we cleaned up the thermal pads for the VR and mosfets um yeah it works and that's that's great um the the takeaway from this be very careful i i know going forward working on ps4s and ps4 pros that those power supply cables are extremely stubborn i looked online and apparently that's a very common issue for people to just rip those out completely those headers and then tear up the pads and whatnot so soldering to the test points i think was the only viable solution apart from maybe scraping away from the sides of each node and trying to create new pads but it just all of that was very meticulous and i'm more comfortable just soldering new wires to test points elsewhere so i think we made it work considering yes it's a bit jank it's part of the reason why i want to give the guy 100 best buy gift card just to kind of make up for that fact but he knows and i tell us to everyone who sends in a system or console for me to work on if you ever have an issue down the line whether it be a week from now or a month from now i am more than happy to take a look at it again and of course i'm not going to charge you for taking a look i didn't charge you for taking a look at it the first time i'm not going to charge you the second time and heck we might even be able to make a follow-up video if anything happens to this but i think it's good enough for now um you know apart from the the cosmetic scuffs and things on the exterior which you can solve very easily with a wrap of some sort it's good to go and uh yeah i'm excited to reach out to the viewer again and let know that his ps4 pro at least on the inside looks virtually brand new now if you guys enjoyed this one maybe you learned a thing or two or at the very least thought it was entertaining i would appreciate that feedback by hitting the like button if you disliked it you can do that and let me know in the comment section below how you felt overall about this one if it's worth starting a full-on playlist and we just you know do the same thing over and over where we reach out to viewers in the area and offer to fix their systems for free you never know what console is going to walk in the door could be a very old like the original Nintendo could be a gamecube a wii could be an original xbox who knows like this was a more modern console but i imagine a lot of the inquiries we're going to get are going to be for older consoles because those tend to sit the most and collect the most dust so that could be interesting so all that feedback would be appreciated thank you so much for watching this far into the video and stay tuned for what we've got coming up here soon my name is greg thanks for deep cleaning a console with me",

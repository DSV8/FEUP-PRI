    "transcript": "now i have a look at a lot of best buy crap on this channel but best buy canada's marketplace has some real gems on it and this is another one of those ridiculous cronenberg gaming pcs that i could not buy but before we open up this just majestic tempered rgb box it's time for a word from today's video sponsor that helped pay for this abomination today's video is sponsored by deepcool and their new ak-400 cpu cooler which is the baby brother of the awesome ak-620 the ak-400 is a great-looking cpu cooler that's relatively easy to mount aside from that plate which requires medium shouting to get attached but other than that it's pretty straightforward the ak-400 is quiet and has decent cooling performance for a budget cpu cooler so if you're in the market to upgrade the terrible stock cooler in your system check out the deepcool ak-47 linked in the description below thank you deepcool for sponsoring today's video now you know that a gaming pc is not messing around when it's got an rgb power supply cover oh i can't wait to see this stylish tempered glass panel and apparently it's a high performance gaming pc which i feel like it kind of goes without saying right it's covered in rgb and tempered glass wow that is some nice turtle death in here and whoa there's actually a whole set of peripherals with it including oh this is like my favorite headset ever oh nice this is actually the second one of these headsets i've gotten with a gaming prebuilt and i really like it because its bass reproduction reminds me of a really exaggerated sound effect of someone punching custard we also got some wi-fi antenna the very important rgb remote and then a gaming mouse that looks suspiciously like a kirkland brand razer death adder and a power cable and then under there we have the keyboard and the gaming pc and the keyboard is also some rgb hajjan action wow that is a lot of soft foam i feel like even the most disgruntled dhl worker wouldn't be able to damage this pc in transit damn that is some sticky ass turtle death right there holy crap what the hell is this it's like they shrink wrapped it using that machine at airports that you like cover your luggage with now as you can see they've gone the age-old route of choking out the front fans on a bit of glass and then pretending to have ventilation on the side but i guess there's nothing quite as stylish as asphyxiation and then on the top we have the rich front io which would have been pretty exciting 10 years ago around the back we've got a very usable rear i o with a graphics card that has a dvi port on it which is always exciting and we've got some wi-fi and then finally we have a power supply that has an eco button on it that's real mushy to press that is one of the worst buttons i've pushed in a while and then on the side we've got a really interesting tempered glass side panel mount we've got this fisher-priced little switch here that opens it and then it's on a hinge can you lift it off yes nice now the inside is where things get really r-rated the first thing you'll notice is the lack of ram on this side but we'll discuss that later first i want to have a look at this just rgb power supply cover which i don't think i've seen anything that'll get you laid faster than that like that is amazing now moving up to the cpu cooler which actually looks pretty decent but i'm sure the main reason it's in here is for this sexy acrylic rgb plate on it that fan is definitely also rgb the only thing in here that doesn't have a ridiculous amount of rgb on it is the graphics card and the motherboard now when it comes to the non-rgb specs of this system this is where things get really weird because you can see on the motherboard here it says four channels of ddr4 and you can see that there's a little thingy there saying that this has an lga 2011 socket in it this 1200 ish dollar gaming pc apparently has an i7 5960x in it for some reason now the 5960x was a thousand dollar cpu when it was launched back in 2014 and as far as i understand it was actually intel's first eight core desktop cpu which is pretty cool and it supports quad channel memory which has led to it having one of the best memory configurations i've ever seen in a gaming prebuilt this best buy pc has a single stick of ram in a quad channel motherboard which considering how rare quad channel platforms are that's not something i thought i'd ever see in the wild i feel like there has to be a law against this kind of thing involving obscure corporal punishment and in terms of the graphics card they ended up pairing this 80 year old god tier cpu with a gtx 1650 i think it will be really interesting to see how these two respond to each other in the performance tests oh and the rams another thing without rgb on it but we'll we'll fix that later in the video now in terms of the motherboard that's harboring this abomination it looks like it's one of those x99 boards that you can quite easily buy off of aliexpress now aside from the weird spec the pc was clearly put together by somebody that hasn't recently suffered a head injury it's pretty nicely put together in here actually on that note let's check out the back now around the back aside from the fact that the cellar is clearly a hajjan chill uh the cable management is actually perfectly serviceable as you can see on that node i'm actually curious what this eco power supply is in here so let's have a closer look ooh it's got a game max in it as far as i understand these are like a legitimate fire hazard i'd say a general rule of thumb with power supplies is if you can't find warranty information for it online run for your life but you know i i don't even know why i'm commenting on it at this point invariably someone's gonna moan in the comment section about how it's actually really good and it was handmade by lord gaben himself you knew so let's see what the comment section pros have to say but at this point i can't wait anymore i have to see what this unicorn seizure bait system looks like when it's fired up so let's let's go see what happens oh wait what's this oh silly me i keep leaving my high quality thermos flask lying around with a very accurate descriptor of me on it damn although i feel like it's not quite as rgb as it could be we're definitely gonna have to fix that later in the video wow this is a surprisingly tetanus free windows 11 install all they did was add some geforce experience well we actually got a 5960x which is pretty cool wait that's a single 16 gig stick what the hell couldn't they at least have made a dual channel like come on but on that note let's see how the system performs and then we'll fix the ram configuration see what that does and add some more rgb and all that good stuff okay so this is running a 1080p high settings and uh it's a very respectable result you can see the the gpu utilization is not doing super well uh and interestingly the cpu is actually only running at 3.3 gigahertz which i think the combination of that quite low core clock and the just pretty ridiculous memory configuration in here is not going to lead to the greatest gaming experience on this rainbow vomit system but at least the temperatures are really good right that's that's that's always nice wait actually with these non-chemical furnace temperatures let's see what kind of overclocking options we have with this aliexpress motherboard oh interesting this motherboard has overclocking feature uh which we'll definitely play around with a bit later uh considering that this is an x-variant cpu in here okay so a weird development i enabled overclocking feature in the bios i didn't even change any settings i just enabled it and now the system is refusing to boot so let's reset the cmos and see if that fixes it hey there we go okay so last time just enabling overclocking feature broke it so let's enable it again and see if we can get it to boot it is in fact not booting so overclocking feature apparently is a no-go on this motherboard which is a real shame i was really really hoping that i could do some overclocking feature on this motherboard anyway on that disappointing note let's check out a more demanding game at 1080p medium settings we have a respectable battlefield 5 gaming experience with a frame rate solidly above 60 frames per second and the graphics cards not having to loiter around waiting for the cpu although before we see what adding more ram does let's see how cyberpunk runs this is way better than i was expecting i like it it's very playable and it looks pretty good as well good job little 1650 this is really not that bad no it doesn't feel that great but it is cyberpunk which handles like a drunk zoomer frame on the best of days wait what the hell this is half of a 32 gig ram kit now i'm going to replace that single stick that was abandoned by its partner for some reason uh with two 16 gig kits so we're gonna have 32 gigs in total with four sticks and this ram is rgb as opposed to the non-rgb gutter trash those in here before oh nice that looks way more badass so let's fire it up and see what that looks like oh yeah that looks way better and actually i just remembered i have a super rgb graphics card that we can throw in here as well which we'll do after we do the performance tests for this ram wow that made much less of a difference than i was expecting my guess here is that it's because of a combination of two things maybe because of the low core frequency of the cpu it's not running into memory bandwidth limitations yet while gaming it really is a shame that i can't get the overclocking running on this motherboard but i do want to do a follow-up video where i classy pimp up this system and i'll try and get another x99 motherboard for that that i can overclock with so subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss that and then i think the other thing is that the gtx 1650 is a bottleneck luckily there's something we can do about that in this video so let's drop a fancy graphics card in here and i think this is easily the most rgb puke graphics card i have ah yes i think this will work nicely this asus version of the gtx 1650 is actually been pretty good the temperatures have been great and it's been quite quiet and you can see here that it's actually the beefier gddr6 version of the car whoa this is definitely the wrong music for this pc maybe this is more appropriate no way going from a gtx 1650 to an rtx 2070 super made literally no difference to the performance and i guess it's because we can't overclock that cpu so we're definitely gonna have to wait for a follow-up video to see what we can get out of that 5960x but in the meantime let's see a more modern game at least cyberpunk benefits a lot from that rtx 2070 super and so did battlefield v but that makes complete sense the newer games are more able to use all of those cores on the 5960x which brings us to the end of another journey with an rgb space hippo prebuilt if you enjoyed the video consider watching another one a suggestion will pop up in a second and don't forget to subscribe to the channel on the way there and until the next video thank you for watching you",

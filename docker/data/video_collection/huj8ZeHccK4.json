    "transcript": "- Remember, you're never alone Even when you're in the TechLinked void that's not the main set. Tech News is always there. I don't know why that would make you feel better. Tech News is not a person, but... Sony has announced that close to 450 movies and TV shows, purchased by users through the PlayStation Store in Germany and Austria, will no longer be available to play. Station. The playing will cease. Sony says that they were forced to make the decision due to evolving licensing agreements with content providers, which, you know, is super understandable. Licenses are hard. Ever heard of the DMV? (producer chuckling) (host groans) Last year, Sony announced that they would be discontinuing PlayStation user's ability to buy and rent video content, but at that time it was understood that previously purchased content would still be available. The problem here is with that word, purchased. You see, services use words like that, which make it seem like you're actually buying digital content. But most of the time, you're actually just agreeing to lease it for as long as the service makes it available or as long as they want to make it available to you, which they could stop doing at any time. Like Ubisoft who also cut off access to some games' DLC this week. So most of the time you don't actually own the digital things you buy. And in fact, you may not own anything at all if we're living in a simulation. So think about that. The company formerly known as Facebook will finally allow users of its Meta Quest VR headsets to login without a Facebook account. So you can finally disconnect from probably the worst social media platform. But who's... it's not a competition. When the change rolls out in August, all you'll need to use your headset is a Meta account. - [Producer] Wow. - Wait. What? Meta says the new account's only purpose will be to store your Quest's profile information and connect with other Quest users and while that's marginally better than the Facebook account requirement, which led to intense user backlash, technical issues and bricked headsets, it's still a reminder that you are using a product made by the lizard people company TM. But hey, if you've accepted them as your new overlords, the Quest Pro is reportedly coming soon and could cost around a thousand bucks. That'll really show your dedication. And shed a tear for the poor hosers suffering up here in Canada because one of our big four ISPs, Rogers, has been experiencing a nationwide outage since early Friday morning and it's still happening. It's been a real gongshow. The cause of the outage has not yet been identified but with everything from landlines to mobile phones to debit machines being affected, I'd wager this is probably something more dire than some keener spilling his freezie on the cables, for sure. In all seriousness, this outage sucks more than the Habs' chances of winning the Stanley Cup, right? - [Producer] Oh yeah. - I'm trying. I don't watch hockey. So I don't know if that's accurate, but I think it is. And travelers crossing the Canadian border are being asked to submit extra forms since the ArriveCan app is down. Anyways, hopefully the folks at Rogers strap on their toob scraps and toofers, Timbits and double doubles and just give her till she starts ripping again. Now it's time for quick bits brought to you by Manscaped and their Ultra Premium collection. The all in one skin and hair care kit for the everyday man that covers every body part. Butt, balls and body that's them. That's right, the ultra premium kit has shampoo body wash, hydrating spray and deodorant to make man maintenance easier than ever. Plus these products are cruelty free, paraben free and vegan because depending on animals for your hygiene products is not manly at all. So go to manscaped.com and use promo code TECH for 20% off your order plus free international shipping. Quick bits. They're what happens when two longer news stories love each other very much. I like that one. In response to a possible antitrust lawsuit from the us justice department over Google's ad business, the tech giant has offered to spinoff, said business into its own company under Google's parent company, Alphabet. See then instead of reporting directly to Google, the ad business would report directly to Alphabet whose CEO Sundar Pichai is also the CEO of Google. It's not clear whether anything would actually change but these are federal bureaucrats we're dealing with. Google may be able to confuse them with a flashy show of paperwork. Oh, ah, oh, now I'm over here. What, where'd they go? Asus may soon launch a new phone that could appeal to Android fans looking longingly at owners of an iPhone 13 mini such as myself. That's me. A leaked promo video shows the 5.9 inch Zenfone 9 with 2022 flagships specs, a headphone jack, fancy modular accessories, and even a side-mounted fingerprint reader you can use to scroll with instead of swiping directly on the screen. Why would you want that? I don't know. Hopefully this thing launches soon because, what do I want a TV in my pocket? Phones should be cute damn it. The early performance numbers for Intel's art gaming GPUs hasn't been great, but maybe they'll stand a chance when they show up in Intel's upcoming NUC X15 Barebones Laptop Kits. Documents referencing the notebooks were leaked this week equipped with Corei7-12700H H CPUs and either an ArcA550M or A730M which will be Intel's mid and mid to upper tier models. I mean, Apple's chips do really well and they're Apple-made laptops so I can only assume that the same rule applies and these NUCs will fix everything. Chinese manufacturer, H3C has announced what is supposedly the world's first Wi-Fi 7 router. The problem is, Wi-Fi 7 has not yet been certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance. So it's not clear what exactly that means. To be fair, on paper, the magic BE18000 appears to be capable of almost double the top speeds of Wi-Fi 6-equipped routers. But that's like me saying my car is a Formula One because I strapped a rocket to the back. That doesn't really work, it's not quite like that. But the moral is, don't strap a rocket to your car. I say this from experience. And renewable energy is great but solar panels have not been so great to recycle. However, according to a new analysis from research firm Rystad Energy, growth in the solar industry could soon lead to billions of dollars worth of materials being mined from old panels, which would lead to less waste and better supply of new panels. So don't worry environment, see? We're saving you. We're doing it. And save your appetite for tech news because we'll be back on Monday with more. There's always more tech news. It's everywhere. It's like I can't breathe. (chuckles nervously)",

    "description": "ICYMI -   This video features the Audeze Sine lightning capable headphones. These are one of the first iPhone 7 ready headphones (assuming the iPhone 7 ditches the 3.5mm audio jack). The advantage of lightning is the ability to integrate a amp + dac directly into the headphones. This allows you to bypass your phone's built in amp.

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lou here back with another video, and today I've got some new age stuff. You may have heard the rumor that the next generation of iPhone, the iPhone 7 or beyond, may be ditching the traditional headphone jack. Now... Calm down. I know there's a lot of people with high-end audio gear that uses that jack, and... I feel your pain. There IS an upside, which is the fact that generally speaking, those little headphone amplifiers on your phones are not that great, and this company, Odyssey, has come out with what might be the first high-end pair of headphones to bypass the mini-jack connector. They have a lightning connector, so it goes straight into the lightning port. What can happen is the amp and dack can be in the actual headphone rather than the phone. A way to think about this is essentially, in bypassing that tiny little headphone jack, you can experience higher quality audio from the source. These are On-Ear Planar Magnetic Headphones This is what that dack/amp that I am talking about looks like. \"Our drivers are three times larger for better bass and wide frequency response\". Interesting. \"Handcrafted in Costa Mesa, California. Designed and built in the USA.\" You don't see that very often, Jack. OK. So the first thing you see, this connector, presented to you... That is interesting, the way they've designed these little guys, to fit into each earcup. Here's your in-line remote with microphone and all the advanced electronics... The dack, the amp, it's all right in there. Here are... Oooh! Whoooh... Wow...! Those feel incredible! That is some of the softest leather I have ever felt on a headphone in my entire life. Wow... Smooth mechanism, no clicks. What feels like a swayed carrying case Wow... hand-written certificate of authenticity, burned-in as well. Headphones generally get better as you listen to them longer. They've done that in advance for you, so they are good to go right out of the box. So, we've also got an adaptor, and look at this... Ok, so... You have the old fashioned mini-jack. Let's first test out... this cable. They connect, but then they kinda curve around to follow the design line of the actual headphone. Oooo... So the app is now open... Holy smokes! We got an equalizer straight away. If you don't like the signature of the headphones... So what? Simply go ahead and switch it up. Wohohoho... *Music playing* Sorry, I sometimes just... I'm enjoying--(Lou laughs)--I'm enjoying myself... I would say \"detailed\", what I want to use is detailed, I was trying to think up the word as I was listening there. What was the word? It's \"detailed\". Punch and detail. That's how I wanna describe them. You've still got the mini-jack, so here's what we do now... I need to blind test it. Ok, quickly, cha- change me to the other, the other connection. Ok. This... this is the uh, Lightning. Yeah... yeah. There's just a little more to it... I don't know, I don't know how to describe it. It's a... It's a little bit better. But that said, I mean, it sounds great on either connector, plus... The genuine materials, the build construction *Sniff* I'm in. *Music playing*",

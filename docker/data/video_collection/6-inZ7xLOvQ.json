    "transcript": "(phone chimes) I'm laid back but I dont front Dopamine up and the MagSafe Plugged Hit my line like you didn't just dub Pressing decline is a sugar rush - Yo, Jonathan here. And last last week the iPhone 12 lineup became officially official. This week though it is time to go hands on. So Apple actually split this launch in half. Right now in October, we get these 6.1 inch iPhone 12's, the non-pro and the Pro. And then in November, we get the adorable 5.4 inch iPhone 12 Mini, which I am super excited to check out and the biggest boy, the 6.7 inch iPhone 12 Pro Max. So I've been using the 12 Pro for about a week now. Spoiler alert, it's faster. That A14 Bionic flies. There are better cameras. We have that squared off iPhone 5S design which is beautiful, that Pacific blue. (smooches) But those are all things that we're used to seeing by now, right? It better be the best iPhone ever, or why launch one? Something that is completely new across the lineup though and something that I kind of love is MagSafe. So across the entire iPhone 12 lineup, the Mini, the 12, the 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max, packed inside are magnetic coils which you can actually see right here. That of course allows you to do things like this. (phone chimes) This is the new MagSafe charger that launched alongside the phones this year and what it does is allows you to magnetically, wirelessly charge the phones with up to 15 Watts of power. In classic Apple fashion, there's attention to detail with those little things. Everything from the animation that happens when you set it down, to the sound which is oddly satisfying. (magnet snaps) (phone chimes) - Oh. (imitates phone chiming) The MagSafe charger itself looks like what would happen if Rick Moranis has got a hold of it, half of watch charger but more importantly, the magnetic connection is Jesse Pinkman approved. For real though, once you snap that sucker on it is not going anywhere to the point where you could dangle it upside down, you could Miley Cyrus it In itself kind of leads me to my next point, after using this all weekend because of the magnetic functionality, more importantly, because of how secure it is, it almost feels like you're plugged in. If that makes sense right? So with a typical wireless charger you set it down flat and you can maybe use the phone if you're propped over it or you buy a vertical charger. But the problem is once you take it off, the charge has gone with mr. MagSafe here though. You're free to use the phone. And more importantly in this case, because Apple has not ripped off the port yet you have that lightning port open and free. So because of that, you're able to use a pair of lightning headphones EarPods, or a DAC shout out to AudioQuest or beyond that. Let's say you're using a Lightning to SD card adapter. You can now transfer photos and charge at the same time in terms of speed. Again, you're getting up to 15 Watts of wireless charging power, which is so much nicer than 7.5. I get it. We're not the crazy 600 Watts of wireless, fast charging Android OnePlus side of things, but it's solid. It's reliable, it's compact, it's slim and it stays cool. And it's not to the point where you're only going to do it overnight. And again, more importantly you still retain functionality with a phone while charging. So this connects through USB-C. And the one thing I'm not crazy about with this is the fact that the cable itself is tied in and attached to the puck it sizes and currently at one meter. So it could be too long or too short but at the very least, hopefully we'll see half meter and two meter variants in the near future. Now, while the magnetic functionality is limited to the iPhone 12 lineup, it'll actually work with older iPhones that support wireless charging and maybe more durably. It might be the perfect tiny wireless charging puck to pair with AirPods If you have a wireless charging case beyond the wireless charging though, MagSafe opens up an entirely new door to accessories, both from Apple and third parties. I got a chance to check out both the silicone case and the clear case, which is definitely a choice. If you don't mind Apple Park smacked directly on the back of your phone with the cases that actually does two things one those magnets attached to the phone to line things up perfectly but then you're also able to still charge wirelessly with that case and not lose any speed. As far as the leather wallet goes that also of course attaches with magnets but it does not allow you to charge at the same time. Not sure why you'd want to but just wanted to clear that up. It's shielded. So it's going to protect the cards that you have inside there. I would say you could comfortably fit three in there maybe four, if you really jam, pack it in. I don't know if personally I'm ready to go that minimal yet but if you're into that, this might be a perfect option. More importantly it also doubles as a great standalone minimal wallet just in case you don't want to attach it to the phone from there though. I think the more exciting thing is the possibility at what accessories are coming. Not just wallets or phone cases, but everything from car chargers or in my case, because I'm super into video tripod mounts the same thing applies to car mounts again it just opens up a whole door of accessories. Like could you imagine a little tiny wireless MagSafe puck with the battery inside. Compare that to even Apple's battery case it's just a completely different ball game from there. I would love to hear what your perfect dream MagSafe accessory would or could be like, just go wild. Aside from that though 12 and 12 pro coverage is coming at your faces very shortly. So stay tuned for that. And if you guys want to hear that track linked up here and down below this is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later. Black out drunk that boy is botched You cant let go of your grudges Blood in your gums quit acting tough No joystick no games here Im on guard when u came near Look at me like ill save ya Look at me like ill save ya I be in the cut You talk s*** i dont talk too much I really cant relate to that stuff Bet u wouldnt say it to my face cuz I'm laid back but I dont front Dopamine up and the MagSafe plugged Hit my line like you didnt just dub Pressing decline is a sugar rush",

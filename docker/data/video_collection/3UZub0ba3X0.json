    "description": "The Galaxy S7 Active has a 'shatter resistant' screen The top layer is plastic, as we found out in my last video:  Is this phone as durable as the Motorola Droid Turbo 2 with its shatterPROOF screen?  Lets take a hammer to this overly expensive smartphone, and find out.   Samsung does offer top plastic layer screen replacements.  I am not sure of the cost, but if your plastic layer gets scratched, contact them to get it swapped out.  Motorola's 'shattershield' replacement is $30 and you have to do it yourself.

    "transcript": "Here is the Galaxy S7 Active. The rugged water and dust resistant android phone from Samsung. We already found out in my last video that the top layer of the screen is made of plastic, and scratches at a level 3 on Mohs Scale of Hardness. But multiple web sites are reporting that the phone has Gorilla Glass on it as well... so me and my hammer are going to find out. Intro. There is one other phone on the market with a shatterPROOF screen. The Motorola Droid Turbo 2. The screen on that phone is entirely made of plastic, so it will literally never crack. Lets see what happens with the active. After a few hits with the hammer, the screen does shatter. So there IS real glass underneath the first plastic layer, the screen is only resistant to shattering, unlike the Motorola which is shatter proof. The terminology is important. I tried removing the top plastic layer, but it is fused with the glass, and will not come off easily. The glass layer underneath the thick plastic explains why the screen feels a bit higher quality than the Droid Turbo 2 does. when you touch them side by side. Well, its time to do my repair video! Make sure you are subscribed so you don't miss the teardown of the S7 Active. We are going to find out what makes it so rugged. Hit me up on twitter and Instagram for behind the scenes and other projects that I am working on. Thanks for watchin'! I hope to see you around.",

    "transcript": "with the launch of amd's FSR 3.1 everybody now has access to frame generation so you can have Fidelity FX rub two of your frames together and then like a little baby frame pops out pretty sure that's how that works which is very exciting for Budget Gamers but what if you have the potest potato [Music] now for today's video we want to see if FSR 3.1 can save the gaming experience of the slowest modern GPU and I say modern GPU because FSR 3.1 is only available on a couple of brand new games so the GPU likely needs modern driver support so we can't just drop like a gt210 in here and call it a day so we're going to have to first figure out what the the slowest GPU is with modern driver support that I have access to but luckily I've got a pretty good idea what it could be and I think the key word here is GPU because most dedicated graphics cards that companies still bother to keep updated with drivers aren't that terrible the same goes for AMD graphics cards even something like our reference glue sniffing Slowpoke the gt710 only gets security updates these days so I don't think we're going to be running around as aloy killing robot dinosaurs with this thing anytime soon although we will give it a try which means we're probably going to use an igpu but that igpu needs to be attached to a CPU that the game will run on so unfortunately no 5-year-old cerons luckily AMD did us a solid by attaching a truly Olympic tier garbage igpu to their latest 7,000 series ryzen CPS but is it really as terrible as I remember it well ah guess the best way to find out is just to compare it to an older Intel igpu now at 1080p low settings in Counter Strike 2 with the igpu in our little ryzen 7600 X we're getting about 20 frames per second which is by no means usable but it's quite a bit better than I was expecting I was expecting a complete meltdown but this is 1080P and it's kind of running in fact I've seen this game run a lot worse but that would be on like a geriatric Celeron so it's not the kind of thing that we're going to be able to run FSR 3.1 games on Dota 2 with 1080p low settings was also running terribly although maybe a bit better than expected but I'm sure when we start running those PS5 ports this will be exemplary performance in comparison now I decided to pit this igpu versus the UHD 630 an Intel I GPU which funnily enough is actually faster than a GT 710 but it's still pretty loser grade and will help to put the ryzen igpu performance into perspective wa this is kind of like having your granddad beat you at 100 met Sprint despite its 7-year-old age the UHD 630 is kind of putting that ryzen igpu in its place at least when it comes to Counter Strike 2 this humiliation is even more apparent in Dota 2 where the UHD 630 provides a significantly more playable result at 1080p low settings at which point I decided to drop the gt710 in the ryzen system just to see how that igpu compares to our reference Sad Sack GPU wa it's real close but the gt710 manages to Edge out the ryzen I GPU being worse than a gt710 is not a position you want to find yourself in quite frankly although they are functionally similarly terrible however with Dota 2 it didn't feel functionally similar the G t710 was a bit more playable but either way even if one of them was worse than our ryzen igpu Horizon nondescript sequel wouldn't launch on either of them so we're just kind of lucky that the ryzen I GPU turned out to be the worst one and with that it's finally time to see how much FSR 3 can save the performance of our lead poisoned igpu luckily Horizon was willing to play ball with our AMD GPU so I preemptively set all the graphic settings to 1080p load to see what kind of native gaming performance we'd get from the igpu wow three frames per second that's very promising W this cinematic looks kind of like one of those Tech demos they used to launch with graphics cards back in the day to like showcase the new technology and then the graphics cards could barely run them this weirdly nostalgic it likes that big open scene a lot granted at this point the little GPU is raw dogging 1080p just straight up uh but one frame per second really is not very impressive but my nostalgic Wonder quickly started fading when I realized that this game doesn't let you skip cut scenes you really can't skip this huh it's that's just they're they're not going to let us do that which meant I had to spend what felt like a lifetime watching a slideshow of horizon angsty Ginger oh please let it end 1 hour later oh it's been so long but we're finally at a point where we can try and game and it's it's running very well the input lag is so wild oh no okay that's not going great on the bright side to be positive to it here the temperatures are good I think we can see now that the game doesn't run very well so let's try how do I okay there we go that's no no it's but after a whole bunch of trial and error I managed to get into into the menu and turn on FSR and Ultra performance quality so we can test what that does to the performance before turning on frame generation so going with ultra performance FSR 3 has gotten us two frames per second wo that's so wild it looks so bad now as well I guess the input lag is slightly more bearable now at least we still have frame generation available FSR frame generation Okay so we've gone from six frames per second to 9 although that's happened oh no so I think the issue is we we've we've gained a couple of frames per second maybe kind of but I feel like the input lag is as bad as it was without any FSR the addition of frame generation made the game feel like I was communicating with my PC on the moon using dialog I guess that's why AMD recommends not using frame generation below 60 frames per second but I have a potential solution unfortunately FSR 3.1 couldn't save this gaming experience but we are starting off with 1080p so let's drop our starting resolution to 800x 600 but with FSR at Ultra quality oh yeah there we go that is now borderline playable in terms of input lag although that is just a straight up lie it still feels terrible but it's pretty close to almost being kind of usable if we if we cope hard enough and the visuals are still amazing okay so maybe this game is is a bit too much for this little igu even though it's rendering at like 3x4 pixels here uh so let's try one of the other FSR 3.1 games [Music] now with some Spider-Man action our starting point is a lot better than it was with the previous game it's still really terrible but it's a market Improvement so let's drop on some angry Fidelity effects before turning on frame genen no I don't know if you could tell visually but Fidelity FX is on this is actually kind of weird we're using basically half the render resolution but we're not getting that much more performance it does feel better though but I think we need a teeny bit more performance to match the PS five so let's turn on frame gen okay so we got a bit more frame rate but again like with the last game it introduces a bunch more input lag so clearly when the system's already running this terribly you don't have much input latency leeway so yeah the frame gen doesn't really doesn't really work for this and when dropping the starting resolution to 800x 600 we jump to over 20 frames per second at times although the image quality disintegrates to a point where the game's basically just throwing bees in our eyes W all of these games are equally destructive of this little igpu my word oh there we go that's made a huge difference to the performance and I get caught off guard every time by how how terrible FSR makes it look now granted this is wildly aggressive FSR so I guess it makes sense and when turning on frame genen it was again the same story a higher frame rate but with a lot more input lag which makes it feel so terrible at this low frame rate and with that what did we learn in today's video well I guess AMD was right you can have two potato a potato for frame genen to work and with that thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video subscribe to the channel and maybe watch another video suggestion will pop up in a second and until then bye-bye [Music] m",

    "transcript": "TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLE! Heroes in a half-shell, turtle power! Hey how's it going guys, this is Dave2D and this is a video on using external GPUs with the 2016 MacBook Pros. Now when these laptops first launched, I was pretty excited about this connection because these laptops have nothing but Thunderbolt 3 connections and these external GPUs have Thunderbolt 3 ports so they should just work, right? Well, they don't. The first issue is that Apple currently prevents Thunderbolt 3 enclosures from communicating with MacBook Pros. The second thing is that you need MacOS to recognize that there is an external GPU in there and by default, doesn't. And then if you wanna run this thing in Boot Camp, for Windows, the issue there is the allocation of PCIe breeze. All complicated stuff. But fortunately, some people have found some solutions to these issues. The thing is, before you kind of get into them, understand that there is an element of risk to this. I found that they were safe, I think that it's necessary to make this connection happen, so, I did them but, kind of do this stuff at your own discretion, do it at your own risk. So, first, you get to figure out which MacBook you're using and also whether not you want to use it for MacOS, or use it for Boot Camp Windows. You can make all of them work, it's just a matter of figuring which one you want to use it for. I've linked a general guide down below. But if you want to get into it and you're actually interested in doing this for your own MacBook, I suggest you read into it and kind of figure out exactly the steps because the biggest thing is that the process is gonna change over time as new devices come out, as software updates happen, the information that I would present in a video won't be accurate forever, so I've linked stuff below, kind of use that as a guide. Ok, so all the 2016 MacBooks can be connected to Thunderbolt 3 enclosures. The easiest one to connect up is the 13-inch MacBook Pro (without the touchbar). That one has the fewest number of tweaks to do. The 13-inch model (with the touchbar) needs a bit more work. And then, the 15-inch model can also work but they need some more tweaking because they have AMD cards in there. But they're all able to connect. In terms of enclosure options, we have a couple existing ones like the Razer Core, and we have a few that are coming up from AKiTiO, Bizon, and ASUS to name a few. Now before Thunderbolt 3 enclosures were all the rage, there were a handful of Thunderbolt 2 enclosures, and using the Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter, these still connect perfectly, and in fact right now the Thunderbolt 2 enclosures have better compatibility than any of the Thunderbolt 3 enclosures which is kind of weird. They need fewer steps to get them working in either MacOS or Windows. The downside to these Thunderbolt 2 enclosures is bandwidth. Thunderbolt 3 can handle 40 Gigabits per second. Thunderbolt 2 can only handle 20 Gigabits per second. So that's a pretty big difference in potential bandwidth. So I ran a bunch of benchmarks using different cards and different enclosures, and these are the results. The first thing to keep in mind, right off the rip, you are not going to get the same kind of performance as a desktop PCI slot That connection will always be fastest when you put a card into a Thunder bolt 3 enclosure you're getting a drop in performance at about ten percent maybe a bit in some cards kind of expected, we've seen this type of performance with Windows laptop and the Razer core and the surprising thing to me was the performance on the Thunder bolt 2 enclosure, it's a further drop in performance because of the even tighter band-width restriction but it's still pretty good you're gonna get around 80 to 85 percent of the maximum percent of the performance of the card and all the test was done with a monitor connected to an external GPU bandwidth if you pipe data to the external GPU and then back to the laptop screen you get a big performance drop and the same thing applies if you want to use the 5k Thunderbolt three display from LG coming back through the cable hurts performance so I really don't recommend it so the things that do work most things work when you're running bootcamp in Windows everything from using cuda cores for video editing too heavy gaming it's all good VR works nicely and every video card that I tried had no issues mac OS is a different story the GTX 10 series cards from video like the GTX 960 or 1080 those don't work there because there are no mac drivers for the 10 series cards right now you need to use the 900 series other things that don't work that well some benchmarks don't work properly a mac OS and when you're using extended displays it can be a little bit glitchy so I preferred using mirror displays but everything else basically works cuda cores work in premier and 3D games run nicely if you want to see particular frame it for a particular game using a particular video card or resolution you can have to look them up individually but in general you're getting around eighty percent of performance when you're using a Thunderbolt two enclosure and about 90 percent of preformance of the card when using Thunderbolt three enclosure my recommended card if you want something for both bootcamp windows and mac OS the 980 TI has come down a lot in price if you want something for just boot camp windows you can use the 10 series cards but on a 13-inch Macbook Pro because it only has two cores putting a high-end card in there like a GTX 1080 can be wasteful if he gains more cpu dependent I'd save the 1080 for a 15-inch Macbook Pro but basically choose your card depending on what you plan on doing with it one last thing you need an active Thunderbolt three cable to make the Thunderbolt three enclosures work properly they're often short but they can be up to two meters (metres) in length but just look for the Thunderbolt symbol if the cable doesn't have this symbol there's a very good chance it won't work even if it's a super short cable and that's basically it external GPUs are viable on Macbooks they work and for the most part they're pretty reliable now they're not going to have the same time performance as a regular desktop connection and not the easiest things to set up but if you're looking for a new video card for Macbook or just want to amp up your gaming experience now you can do, that's the end of this video this video hope you guys liked it thumbs if you did subs if you loved it it's been nice i'll see you guys next time *epic outro music*",

    "transcript": "If youre a human person, one of those things youre gonna wanna do with some regularity is boil water. We do it for lots of reasons, from cooking to cleaning and disinfecting to... other things probably. And one ofthose other things is preparing hot beverages such as tea. Maybe youd file thatunder cooking, I dunno, it doesnt matter, anyway this is such a common practice in the daily lives of humans across the planet that purpose-built water-boily-poury things, called kettles, are quite a common sight. But theyre a little less common here in the US than they are in many other parts of the world, particularly the electric variety. Actually, Ithink its fair to say theyre a lot less common. One often cited reason is that our 120V electrical supply just doesnt have the gusto to make electric kettles worth it. Look, here its cited three times! But by the end of this video, I hope youll learn, as I have, that this just isnt true. Electric kettles are, even though they are a lot slower on this side of the Atlantic, still significantly faster than their stovetop counterparts. At least, for now - spoiler alert, theres a twist. Ill begin with some testing and demonstration. As a note, the times Ill be referencing in this video came from off-camera tests. Ill replicatesome of the tests on-camera but the results will probably be slightly different. This is mystovetop kettle. Its red! And it has a wide, flat bottom which is helpful for doing tests because itll work great with any stove. Throughout this video, Ill be bringing thismuch water to a boil. Yes, this is a SodaStream bottle. It was convenient. Anyway, this is pretty close to one liter, but not exactly. The most importantthing is Im being consistent with each test. The water will come straight from the tap and will go into a cold kettle, and well time how long it takes to boil. For this kettle, I will consider it done when I hear the first peep from its whistle. On this gas stoves normal burner, it took a glacial 7m:40s to come toa boil. This stove does have a higher-power burner available, but well get back to it in a bit. Not everybody has a gas stove, though. And if youdont, you might wanna consider yourself lucky but thats a topic for another day. I brought thekettle and my measury bottle along with me for a visit with my parents. You see, they have a glass-ceramic electric cooktop. I dont know what the exact power output is of the burners but I do know that theentire thing is 8.8 kW all together, and with these burners being the average size of four I think 2 kWis probably pretty fair. This burner, from cold, brought the kettle to a boil in six minutes flat. Which actually surprised me. I figured it wouldnt be as fast as my gas stove but it actuallybeat it by nearly two minutes. Go figure. Now lets see how an electric kettle will do. Thisis the cheapest kettle you can buy at Walmart. And as you can see, it sports an exquisite design and is built of the highest quality materials. Like virtually all electric kettles this sports an automatic shutoff feature, however theres a substantial delay between when it begins to boil and when the shutoff is actually tripped. So, Ill be considering this kettle done the moment its at a roaring boil. How long does this fella take to boil that amount of water? Four minutes and thirty-threeseconds. I suspect some viewers are aghast at that performance, but thats more than threeminutes faster than the stovetop kettle on a gas stove, and about a minute-and-a-half faster than the same kettle on a glass-ceramic electric stove. Why might that be? Well the answer is prettysimple. But before we get into it with excruciating detail, let me reiterate that thecheapest electric kettle I could get my hands on is significantly faster at boiling water than this stovetop kettle, despite being limited by our 120V electrical system. Our weird systemputs a practical limit of 1,500 watts on most things which plug into ordinary outlets, although 1,800 watts is technically permissible and on a 20 amp circuit, which is fairly common especially in kitchens, 2,400 hundred watts is possible, but since its by no means universal (and requires a different plug to be compliant) most devices stick to a 12 amp limit, which nets 1,500 watts at a slightly optimistic 125 volts. Thats plenty of power for virtually anything, but many of you in 230 and 240 lands will find this kettle to be obnoxiously slow. Ive alsoseen a few people here who have installed a 240V receptacle in their kitchen specificallyto use with imported kettles, and I guess more power to em. (just a reminder weactually have 240V power here, but we do it... weird, I made a video about itif you wanna learn more). Now, hot take; all yall tea drinkers are frightfullyimpatient- [said slipping into a Southern drawl] Oops, did I say that out loud? Anyway, with the knowledge that even a cheap little kettle with our weak little plugs is still a lot faster at boiling water than a kettle on a stove, why arent they the household staple that they are in other parts of the world? What a perplexing mystery, I doubt well ever know the true ans - Its because we dont drink tea all that much, you guys. Thats it. Thats the answer. Its not like nobody here drinks tea, but I think its fair to say that for the majority of households tea is more of a Ooh Im feeling fancy today, lets whip out the Earl Grey! kind of a thing. It simply is not the cultural staple for us that it might be for you, especially in the context of, say, social gatherings. When friends comeround, putting a kettle on is not really in our cultural vernacular - but brewing a pot of coffeeabsolutely is. So, since most of us find ourselves boiling water for tea only occasionally (if ever), a faster, purpose-built water-boily-poury-thing is just not on the average American mind. Thatsall there is to it. Yes, our electric kettles are slower than they are on the other sideof the Atlantic, but! Theyre still the fastest way to boil water! The trouble is thatrelatively few people even know to want them. So, why is this $15 lump of plasticso much faster at this whole water boiling thing? Well, take a look inside of it. We can see the heating element. Thats it. Thats the thing what get hot. Andwhen you fill it up with water, the heating element becomes submersed in and surrounded onall sides by the stuff were aiming to heat. All of the energy that this thing can pull from the wall is getting dumped straight into the water, save for whatever tiny bit is lost in the powercord. Many electric kettles dont have an exposed heating element like you see here, but insteadbond the element to the bottom surface of the kettle which the water sits atop. Its a differentarrangement, but the effect is much the same. In comparison, a stovetop kettle canonly try its best at absorbing heatthats getting blasted at it from below and thentransfer that heat into the water it contains. Thats just much less effective than releasing heat directly into the water. How much less effective is it? Well, wecan find out pretty easily with some math! One fun thing about this universeis that Energy. Is. Energy. We have a lot of different names for it and measure in a bunch of different ways, but its all the same thing and we can convert between units easily. One of those units which is particularly useful for this discussion isthe calorie. Thats how much energy it takes to elevate the temperature of 1 cubic centimeter(or one milliliter) of water by 1 degree Celsius. lo-fi jazz plays If we presume that the water from the tap is at about 20 degrees Celsius, and we have 1,000 cubic centimeters of water to raise up by 80 degrees, then it will take 80,000 calories of energy to bring it to a boil. Now, we can ask a search engine to convert that into a different unit for us! Lets go with... joules. Agh, no, I didnt want the kilocalorie. Thats whatwe commonly use for food, I just want 80,000 calories - the regular kind. Fine, 80 kilocaloriesis 334,720 joules. Why have I chosen joules? Well, heres a fun thing; you know what the watt - the commonly-used unit of electrical power - actually is? Its one joule per second. And, since ourelectric kettles typically run at 1,500 watts, That means they can put 1,500 joules of energy into the water every second. So if we divide 334,720 (the number of joules we need) by 1,500 (the numberof joules we can add to the water every second), we will find out how much time it shouldtake for an electric kettle in the US to boil a liter of room temperaturewater in seconds. That answer? 223. In the real world, though, it took about 22% longer than that. Our theoretical speed is 223 seconds, but the observed time was 273 seconds. Whats the cause of the discrepancy? Well actually there are two causes. First, this thingdoesnt actually pull 1500 watts from the wall. Its a resistive electrical load - the heating element is just a giant resistor, after all, so the actual power it consumes will depend on the voltage at the receptacle. In my test it was drawing only 1,430 watts. Knowing that this was thereal power output, our theoretical time should be revised to 234 seconds. Our observed time, though, was still about 16% longer than that - why? Well, its not just the water that were heating. Thebody of the kettle itself gets warmed up through the water, and that thermal mass slows us downa bit. Plus, of course, some energy escapes into the room before the water boils - both through thesides getting warm and a bit escaping out the top. Still, though, only 16% more time compared to literal perfection aint bad. Lets switch things up a bit. Remember, Energy.Is. Energy. And we can convert the 80,000 calories it takes to lift a liter of water by 80 degreescelsius into watt-hours. Joules are fun and all, but since we tend to measure power output inwatts its usually easier to conceptualize energy in watt-hours. Plus you get much smaller numbers which is helpful. 80,000 calories is about 93 watt-hours according to Googles convertything. How many watt-hours did our kettle use? Well, 273 seconds divided by the 3600 seconds in an hour and then multiplied by the 1,430 watts the kettle was actually pulling tellsus that we consumed 108.4 watt-hours which is whaddya know, about 16% morethan 93. Aint this fun? Lets do a little more math! Throughthe Magic of Buying Two of Them, I have a second, slightly-fancier kettle! And this one sports RAPID-HEAT technology! Which is funny because its only rated 1,100watts. This one has the embedded heating element design - rather than a big curly thing gettinghot, the bottom surface is what gets hot. Given what weve learned, we should be able to predict how long this will take to boil a liter of water. Lets see, 334,720 joules divided by 1,100 watts is 304 seconds, or just over five minutes. Ill go ahead and presume the same 22% overall discrepancy from the cheap kettle (accounting for both a slightly lower-than-advertised power level and also the energy needed to heat the kettle itself) and predict it should take about 371 seconds, or six minutes and eleven seconds. Lets see how long does it actually take? Oh good, blueLEDs. My favorite. And it actually took; six minutes and thirteen seconds, proving onceagain that energy is energy and water is water. So now, lets take a look at the gas stove andstovetop kettle again. The burner which took 7 minutes and 40 seconds to bring this to a boil israted 9,500 BTUs/hour. Oh good, another unit! Now, in this context, as is often done with the BTU for whatever reason, the manufacturer is using a unit of energy to convey power which is a bit confusing but itis what it is. I dont have a way to verify its performance unfortunately, but if we assume theburner is performing to spec, the 9,500 BTUs/hour can be converted to instantaneous wattage and thusthis burner outputs 2,785 watts at full-power. You may already see the absurdity here but lets keep going and work it out. It should take only 93 watt-hours to bring a liter of water to boil. Thiselectric kettle, with a modest loss, took 108.4 watt-hours to do it. The second electrickettle with a lower power rating did take longer to do the job, but required a nearly identical amountof energy. This thing, sitting over 2,785 Watts of Fire manages to take more time to boil thaneither electric kettle; 7 minutes and 40 seconds. That works out to 356 watt-hours of energyconsumed. Thats astoundingly bad. Nearly quadruple whats theoretically required, andmore than triple what the electric kettles need. But its not really surprising, is it? I mean,this is just a cold object over an open flame. Of course the bulk of the energy being released as the fuel combusts is just going around the kettle. If youve ever used a gas stove youve undoubtedly felt how hot the air is above the pot orwhatever. Thats all the heat from the flame which isnt ending up in what youre trying to heat. Sure, some of its making it in there, but in the case of this kettle apparently not even a third. This stove also sports a quick boil mega-burner which outputs 17,000 BTUs/hour or 4,985 watts. This thing is so powerful flames lick up the sides of the kettle. On this mega-burner, the time-to-boil decreases to 4 minutes and 32 seconds which as it happens is exactly one second faster than the time recorded by this electric kettle. But, that time savings comes with even lessefficiency, as the total amount of energy needed to boil a liter of water on this burner climbsslightly from 356 to 376 watt-hours. Oh and by the way, 376 watt-hours isnt just a lot of energy to spend boiling a liter of water, itll also make your kitchen quite a bit warmerwhich is GREAT on summer days. Oh, also the heat from the flames licking up the sides makes the handle too hot totouch with bare hands so thats fun! Theres been a lot of talk lately about how gas stoves are just well kinda bad for lots of reasons and I gotta say this is revealing yet another reason. I mean, if it takes more than triple the energy output of a 1,500 watt electric kettle just tomatch its boiling time all I can say is yikes. Lets go back to the electric stove and see how well it did from an efficiency standpoint. If we assume that this burner was outputting 2000 watts, then the required time of exactly 6 minutes, which is exactly one tenth of an hour, meant 200 watt-hours were spent boiling the liter of water. Thats still much more thanthe electric kettles 108, but nowhere near as bad as the 356 required by the slower gas burner. Putting the kettle in physical contact with the thing that gets hot seems totransfer heat energy much more effectively. For grins and giggles I timed this little hotplate. It only outputs 900 watts so it took a while. 13 minutes and 8 seconds, in fact. Lets do the math, though. This thing reallyonly outputs about 870 watts according to the kill-a-watt. 13 minutes and 8 seconds atthat power level works out to 190 watt-hours. This was definitely slower than the 2 kW burner, but it was a tad more efficient. At least, I assume so. Probably because the glass-ceramic cooktop works almost like a heatlamp pointing up at the kettle - its blasting infrared light at it, and since the kettle is just a little bit smaller than the total area, some energy is making its way around the kettlessides. This burner, though, is simply gettin real hot thanks to a heating element inside of it, and with the kettle in physical contact a slight majority of that energy ends up getting absorbedby the kettle and into the water. Not bad. This probably means that the old fashionedcurly-q burners might actually be the best conventional electric burner design, at least when it comes to speed, since they have relatively little thermal mass and the element itself stays in contact with the cookware. With everything weve seen, I think its clearthat if you want to boil water conveniently and quickly, the electric kettle remains your best option despite our weedy little plugs. But this may be about to change. Thanks toinduction technology, the stovetop kettle can be even faster than an electric kettle - infact, potentially faster than a European one. Induction stoves are the new hotness, and they work by sending high-frequency alternating current through a coilof wire beneath the cooking surface. When a suitable cooking vessel is placed above it, electric currents are induced within the vesselsmetal base. Those currents will actually heat the bottom of the pot or what have you just like the current flowing through a heating element. Ineffect, it turns the pot itself into the heating element! Now, I dont have an induction stove, but I do have this plug-in induction cooktop! This thing is not shy of pulling the full 15Afrom an electrical circuit, and on full-power it consumes just about the 1,800W that it claims to. Now, theres some waste in this process - thats why this thing has a cooling fan in it - soI dont know exactly how much is actually getting transmitted into the kettle. But at fullpower, this brought a liter of water to boil in 4 minutes and 29 seconds. Thats the fastestresult weve seen, suggesting at least 1,500 watts is making it into the water. And keep in mind,this is limited to what comes from an ordinary electrical outlet. The hardwired induction cooktops youll find either on their own or attached to an oven often feature a burner... or I guess a betterword is emitter - that can pump out close to four kilowatts, sometimes more! With one of those, youcould boil a liter of water in 90 seconds flat. Still, speed isnt everything. One very handyfeature of nearly all electric kettles is that automatic shut-off. That does give them an element of safety which is missing from a stovetop kettle. I think theres a certain charm in household objects that scream at you when theyre ready, but Ill admit a more silent option is nice. Plus, unless and until I get a proper induction stove, this remains the fastest... OK, this was a little bit faster but the most convenient and efficient option for boiling water. Though I dont often drink tea, Ive kept a kettle around because itsjust too handy. Even if Im making pasta its faster to fill this up, bring it to a boil, and then pour the water from it into a pot on the stove than it is to use the stove to boil the water. Whichis nuts but its the truth! Plus the kitchen doesnt get nearly as hot when you do that, and I dont have to run the stove as long which is great for indoor air quality. I shouldmake a video about that, too, its astounding how bad these are. Its almost like combustingfossil fuels inside of a living space is a bad idea! Aside from that great benefit, there are also fancierkettles available which let you set them to a specific temperature. Great for certain typesof tea or really pedantic coffee sno - I mean enthusiasts. And if youre really bothered by waiting four minutes for boiled water, there are a few solutions that are much less involved than rewiring your kitchen. First, and heres a wild idea, just dontfill the kettle up all the way! It takes more time to boil more water, and if youre just making a cup for yourself, only fill the kettle to the minimum mark. On manykettles that can be as little as half a liter, which only takes a hair over 2 minutes toboil even with our pathetic little plugs. But watch out, as there are kettles out there which dont operate at 1500 watts. Like this one! It may look nicer than the cheap Walmart kettle but its definitely worse at beinga kettle. Oohh but it did come with this free loose leaf tea infuser so thats nice! Another option you might want to look into if youre particularly impatient is something like this. Youre right, this isnta kettle, but you could call it better than a kettle! These well I dont know what the proper name is but boiler, warmer, and dispenser all seem like common words so lets go with hot waterdispenser. These hot water dispensers feature an insulated tank which they will diligently keep atyour desired temperature. Many also feature timer functions to allow you to set when you wantthem ready so they dont waste much energy when you don't need them. Use one of these and you dont ever have to waitfor a kettle! And! They actually only need 700 watts. There might be some merit to keepingan insulated tank of water around rather than pumping 3 whole kilowatts of heat into cold water whenever you feel like it. Anyway, thats all Ive got for you withthis video. This whole kettle discourse is so wild to me - I get it, youve got three kilowattsof water boiling power at any outlet! Its gotta be kind of annoying when you make a visit to this continent - or worse move here - and suddenly it takes a whole two more minutes to boil a liter of water. I mean, you poor things. But like, I do want to point out that I think its kinda hilarious how, aside from electric vehicle charging, boiling water quickly isabout the only practical benefit to having that much power at any receptacle. This is theone thing that seems to get stuck in the craw of lots of folks regarding our electrical systemwhich is just well its kinda funny to me, thats all. Dont get me wrong, there are plenty of objectively terrible things about our electrical system! But even here, unless youve got an induction stove, thisis still the fastest way to get a cuppa. scaldingly smooth jazz Which actually huh! I brought the kettle andmy measury bottle with me for a no, that was correct! You I brought the kettle and my [weirdfoghorn noise] I brought the kettle and my measury bottle along with a *sigh* same thing. And we can convert between units easily. One yeah I'm gonna throw... I dont like how that went. How many watt-hours did it take this kettle to boil? But, since we tend to measure power output in watts its usually easue usually eazuier. Its justnot the average *sigh* poop. There's a good deal of stuff that got cut from this script because this felt like a very pointless video. But! I've actually recorded a follow-up video which I will be editing shortly! And it contains those deleted sections! And it will go up here on the main channel! Exclamation points!",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today we are checking out the brand new Poly Voyager Free 60 plus UC earbuds from HP. These come in two different colors. There's a carbon and a white sand and I'm not sure which color I have so we're gonna have to open it up and find out. A huge thank you to HP for partnering with me on this video. Let's unbox. Personalize my experience. Poly Lens. Yes, I will download it. All right, app is downloading. We haven't even unboxed them yet. Let's get to the earbuds. Quick start guide. We may need this information. Tells us all of the things we need to know. I like that they're giving step-by-step directions. Start here. Here's the case. You can see the little LCD on the top. We've got two cables. We have a USBC to a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack. A USBA to a USBC and extra ear tips. These will be great because this will allow you to get a nice sure fit. Depending upon your ear shape, you'll be able to find a size that's right for you. So this is kind of a thicker case, but it is pretty high tech because it does have this LCD on the top of it and you're actually able to control your music. Basically use this as a tiny little remote. So it looks like we have the carbon black. And I also like that this gives you a little USB Bluetooth transmitter. So if there is something that doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities, you're able to insert this and turn that into something that is Bluetooth enabled. (gasps) Wow, this has like a very premium feel. I don't know, it just feels like a more premium plastic that I'm used to for these types of earbuds. So there's a little button right here and this button allows you to pause, play, answer calls, and if you swipe this'll allow you to adjust the volume. You can also mute and unmute calls and you can also activate active noise cancellation and transparency mode. It's time to set them up. We have them popped up right here, the Voyeger Free 60 plus UC. Open the smart case, remove both earbuds. All right. Okay, press okay, we're doing that. Case is up to date. Oh my gosh, I think we're just about ready. And here they are. They are connected. So now I need to figure out which fit is good for me. They've got little L's and R's on them. So for those of you who may struggle with your left and right like me. So it seems like right now I have the medium ear tips in and those feel pretty good. So we'll try those out and see how they work out. Okay. Oh, there's an update available. Let's do our update. So now it's time to do our first listen just to see what they sound like. So here's what the case looks like while they're connected. I'm gonna close this. It's pretty cool because this is actually acting like a remote. I can control the music I can change how I want the transparency mode. So this is on the speech mode. Oh, I can hear the environment around me. All right, let's play some music for the first time. We're gonna listen to some Imagine Dragons. Okay, all right. All right so I tested out the music, everything seems to be working. My earbuds are updated. Now, let's go test these out a little bit more. (upbeat music) So this is a new lineup of wireless earbuds that's designed specifically for hybrid work with some really cool features to keep you productive and connected during video calls and entertained when you need to take a break. They have adaptive active noise canceling, transparency mode, a three mic array for next level voice quality, and this super handy touchscreen charging case. Now this case will let you remotely control your earbuds so you can adjust the volume, play, and pause media, mute audio, switch between Bluetooth devices, and check in on your battery life at a glance. And speaking of battery life, the case can charge the earbuds twice giving the earbuds a total talk time battery life of 16 and a half hours, which is so awesome. Plus they have fast charging, which will get you an hour of talk time after just 15 minutes of charging. The Voyager earbuds also come with a service called Poly Lens Cloud which lets users personalize their poly device settings and it lets teams manage and receive insights from anywhere in the world. So I've been testing these out for a few days now and the thing that I'm so obsessed with, other than of course the great sound quality and the ability to make really crisp, clear conference calls with these microphones, this case is so awesome. There's been times where I've been on runs, I've been just walking around and I'll have the case in my pocket and for whatever reason, I just feel so inclined to take this out and adjust the volume, switch the tracks that I'm listening to. It's like such a fun little novelty and I'm obsessed with it. I also do like of course that it does charge with USBC so I have had some really great battery life with these and it's been super fun testing these out over the past couple of days. I like that these will connect to the app and you can do all sorts of customizations. If I want to change the swipe, I can have that mute my calls if I'm on a call or if I'm streaming I can have that turn up the volume. I have been using this as I've been going into different types of environments adjusting the noise cancellation. So when I click it right now, it's actually off. Now you can also adjust the transparency. So you can turn it off, you can do the environment so you hear a little bit of everything around you like I just heard that car starting up. And you can change it to transparency for speech and you can turn it off. So you have all of those options right at the touch of your finger. And I'm gonna turn the noise cancellation on so that I don't have to hear that car. Now, a big part of what makes these earbuds really great is that they're really optimized for doing conference calls. Each bud has a three mic array that triangulates on your voice and minimizes surrounding noises so you're always loud and clear. As you guys might know, I do a ton of video calls for work. So specifically, if that is something that you are doing a lot of, being able to have that great sound quality not only from the person on the other end, but having these enhanced microphones especially having it triangulate on your voice is so key to make sure that everyone else on the other end of those calls is also getting a great experience. So overall, I'm really impressed with these earbuds. I think that if you work in an office or even if you're a traveling remote worker or sort of freelancing and on the go, these will be a really great option for you. The sound quality is really great and they're super comfortable. Plus, I love this touchscreen on the charging case and I really think that all earbuds should come with something like this. If you guys are interested in checking these out or getting more information or even to purchase, I will put a link in the description to check out the new Poly Voyager earbuds from HP. Thank you guys so much for watching. Don't forget to like this video and subscribe if you haven't already. And if you have any questions or wanna know anything else about these earbuds, let's chat in the comments. Until then, I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye. (upbeat music)",

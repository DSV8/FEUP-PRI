    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken and Apple recently released this insanely then iMac powered by their own M1 chip. And it's got me feeling nostalgic for the original iMac from 1998. So I thought it would be fun today to explore the origin story of the first iMac and then see the evolution of the iMac, throughout its 23 years. So, let's take a look. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, one of his goals was to eliminate 70% of the product line. The consumer desktop wound up being the iMac Apple's first iProduct. The initial plan was to build a networking computer, essentially a terminal that connects to a network and Oracle's Larry Ellison, who was on Apple's board, supported this idea. But Fred Anderson, Apple's Chief Financial Officer at the time, interjected saying the computer should feature a hard disk so it could actually function as a full featured desktop for the home. And Ken Segall from the TBWA\\Chiat\\Day team, the ad agency behind \"1984\" and \"Think Different,\" suggested the name iMac to Steve Jobs. Although Steve didn't like the name at first, it grew on him. And during the product reveal, Steve announced that the i primarily stood for internet because of how easily this computer would enable consumers to get online. And clearly it struck a chord with consumers because the \"i\" moniker is still something Apple uses today, 23 years later. Now, Steve Jobs was a genius guy. Like I'm not arguing with that, but not all of his ideas were bangers. One of his original ideas for the iMac was MacMan. Yeah, I'm glad that didn't work out. So the iMac was officially revealed at an Apple event on May 6th 1998, at the Flint Center, the same venue where the original Macintosh was revealed to shareholders. The iMac also had a striking new design that was different than pretty much every other computer, especially every other Macintosh at the time. So let's take a closer look at that. Lots of care went into crafting the curvy colorful case. In fact, apples manufacturer visited a jelly bean factory to study translucent colors. Now it was more expensive to manufacture a case like this. Keep in mind, computers at the time were mostly box-shaped, cheaper to manufacture the cases. This was curvy and colorful, more expensive. It was about $60 apiece to manufacture, which is about triple what a normal case would be. But even though it was more expensive, it paid off. Apple sold them for 1,299 each, and they sold 800,000 units by year end. So it was a great start. The bond-eye blue translucent color, stood out among the beige boxes at the time. Apple's Jony Ive compared the translucency of the iMac to a chameleon saying he wanted the computer to \"Have color,\" but also feel to use his word, \"Unstatic.\" Another notable design feature was the handle. Apple focused on handles in the products and this was nice because the iMac weighed about 40 pounds but it actually was more than just functional, it was part of the look. Jony wanted the computer to be more approachable and more friendly, more playful and it makes sense and to use his words, the handle says, \"It's okay to touch.\" The monitor is a 15 inch CRT with a 1024 by 768 resolution at 75 hertz, a higher refresh rate than any Mac you can buy in 2021. And if you switch to a 640 by 480 resolution, the refresh rate jumps to 117. And below the beautiful display are two built in speakers and two headphone jacks. And between the display and the speakers was this tray loading disk drive, which Steve Jobs originally didn't like. He wanted more of a slot loading design, like what you'd see in higher end cars and stereos and stuff like that. But don't worry Steve, the second generation will have a slot load, just for you. Another big feature of this iMac is USB, Universal Serial Bus, a ubiquitous standard we all use today without hardly thinking about it. And this version ran at 12 megabits per second. Now yes, this wasn't the first computer to hit the market with USB built-in, but considering that the iMac lines sold 5 million units in about two and a half years, I think it's fair to say that the iMac was a key player in making that standard more mainstream. Speaking of USB, this iMac also shipped with Apple's first ever USB keyboard and mouse with matching colors. And yeah, the mouse was questionable. Now let's take a look at the iMac specs. The original iMac was equipped with Apple's recently announced PowerPC G3 processor, clocked at 233 megahertz. There's also two 144-pin SO-DIMM slots, so even though the stock configuration came with 32 megabytes of memory I've seen some websites say you could actually cram in 768 megabytes of memory. So maybe that was a possibility. There's also four gigabytes of hard disk storage connected by an ATA3 interface and on the front are four megabit per second infrared sensor for beaming in files. And again a big focus for this computer was to get people on the internet easily. So the iMac shipped with Mac OS 8.1 and a built-in easy to use Internet Setup Assistant. On the hardware side, there's built-in 10/100 Ethernet, and a 56K modem which was originally a 33.6K when announced. What about expansion? (laughing) No, seriously. Compact all in ones from Apple, that's not their focus, especially today with the M1-based iMac, good luck upgrading that. But, there was a blank spot next to the IO, and it looked like it was screwed off with just two screws. What are you hiding Apple? Turns out there's a slot on the motherboard, an unoccupied slot, labeled Mezzanine. So third party developers could make expansion cards and hardware for the iMac, but this wasn't officially supported by Apple. But awesome people, we're just getting started. Because, if you ever hit on your hands, sometimes it's a good idea to make a sequel, sometimes. In this case, yes, it was. So let's take a look at how the iMac evolved throughout history. In January 1999, Apple introduced five color options for the iMac then in October the physical design was touched up with a more see through case, tweet handle design, slot loading optical drive and no fan. Oh yeah, this baby's air cooled. Also, there's a new panel on the bottom for easy memory upgrades and you can install an airport card for wireless internet access. And on the iMac DV models a VGA port for mirrored video out support was also included. Another feature with the iMac DV was a built-in DVD-ROM drive so you can watch movies, but also, a big push from Apple was being able to make movies on your iMac. Desktop publishing was big, desktop video was their next big focus and this is when they initially introduced iMovie as well. And a huge important feature that enabled this movie making capability was FireWire. The FireWire port has a whole big backstory in and of itself. But in short, it offers real time video capture support, so you can just import footage right off your camera in real time. But it was also up to 400 megabits per second in speed, so way faster than USB and it was great for hard disks and stuff like that. Apple also introduced new colors with the iMac DV line like Ruby, but my favorite was the special edition version which was in graphite. Oh my gosh, I wish I had one of those, they're really cool looking. In 2001, Apple also tried some crazy patterns such as Dalmatian. Yep, those were real things. And the last PowerPC G3 iMac was released in summer of 2001. It had a 700 megahertz processor and a cool indigo case. That indigo iMac was actually the first Mac in my collection. That's how my whole retro Apple collection started but I regrettably recycled it several years ago and I wish I had it back. But, that was the end of the G3 line for the iMac. But it's okay because Apple was gearing up to launch an all new iMac with an all new design with their next generation processor, the G4. The new iMac was released in January 2002. And although Apple doesn't officially call it iMac G4 anywhere on the product, unlike with other Mac's I'm not sure why, the retro Apple community usually refers to this model as iMac G4. Because as the name may suggest, it featured a PowerPC G4 processor clocked at 700 megahertz. Also Apple ditched the CRT for an all new 15 inch-flat panel running at 1024 by 768 resolution. But to keep the display that thin, the rest of the computer needed to sit in a separate housing. So Apple designed this dome-shaped base for the iMac and connected the display with a swivel arm which is also tilt and height adjustable. Apple also reverted to a tray loading design for this model hidden behind this little door flap. And alongside the iMac G4, Apple actually changed the letter from one of their other products from an i to an e, the eMac, focusing more toward education markets. This offered a PowerPC G4 Mac but with the CRT. So overall the computer cost was lower, but you didn't lose that G4 performance. Now there were other screen sizes available and other features and configurations but man, if we cover everything we're gonna be here forever. But basically this was the iMac G4. I love this design, it's so much fun. I think it's one of Apple's more iconic designs. But the weird thing there is, even though we liked it a lot, I don't know how much Apple really liked it because this was actually the shortest lived iMac design. It lasted only about two years. But I think that's okay because its successor, set the foundation for how the iMac's design would work all the way up until today, 17 years later, the iMac G5. This is the iMac G5 and it actually is officially called iMac G5 this time, and it was available in 17 and 20 inch configurations. Apple designed the iMac G5 with a similar design language to the iPod, which is what we see today with the iMac's new design language sprouting from the iPad. The whole computer is suspended above your desk with a metal L-shaped foot, which offers effortless tilt adjustment. And like the name suggests, this Mac boasts a PowerPC G5 processor with a baseline clock speed of 1.6 gigahertz. The ports were vertically aligned on the back and it even featured a vertical mount slot loading optical drive. And as you can probably tell, this iMac is where the whole chin trait started from. That's a feature we see on all the future iMacs'. Some people love it, some people hate it. And this chin had a grill built into the bottom and this is where the speakers were so the sound could come out. But three blowers also draw air in through this grill. And then the heat rises out of the top slit. And this is just me editorializing, but I think Apple wanted to make a design like the iMac G5 earlier, which they kind of tease in the iMac G4 keynote. - The new iMac ladies and gentlemen. (crowd cheering) But there are some problems with this, we have to turn the drives on the side. And in particular with the optical drives, they can't run at full speed on the side. - [Ken] Apparently Apple overcame those challenges quickly and was able to move on to the new design in only two years. But maybe that was the path they truly wanted to do with the iMac G4 from the beginning. Food for thought. And the G5 was really easy to open. Along that grill we were just talking about, you undo a few screws and boom, the whole back panel pops off. And it was easy until Apple updated the internals then it took a few more steps to open up. But at least you can get to the ram compartment easily through that bottom grill. Speaking of which, in October 2005, Apple updated the iMac G5 with a built-in iSight camera. This was the first Mac to feature a built-in camera. It also featured a slimmer case design and horizontal port arrangement. And it shipped with a remote so you could use the included front row software, turning the Mac into a media center. The remote you could use for the front row interface, just sticks right there on the side, magnets. And here's a little known fact about this computer. At one time, Apple was working on a version that had a card reader on it. It was a combo SD card compact flash reader. In fact, my buddy Mike from Mike's Mac Shack, he has one of these prototypes, and you can see the reader on the back there. This is a crazy rare piece of hardware. Then Apple made a big big move, kind of like what's happening today as we transition from Intel to Apple silicon. Well, this was the time that Apple transitioned from PowerPC to Intel processors, and it looked like this. Yeah, it looked exactly the same from the outside but on the inside, there was no more G5. It was now an Intel system. So that model lasted for a while. Now it's August 2007, it's time for a new design. The mid 2007 iMac featured an updated design with aluminum front and sides, a glass display and a black plastic back. And on the back of the iMac wordmark was removed and replaced with the Apple logo. This was also the first iMac to feature FireWire 800 built-in, which was twice as fast as FireWire 400. Now this newer aluminum iMac is a little bit thinner than the previous plastic one. But at one time, it appears Apple was experimenting with an aluminum version of the iMac but in that thicker model. This is an unreleased prototype version of the aluminum iMac. Note the lack of a black Apple logo, and here you can see the design is a little bit thicker. But in the end, Apple must have overcome whatever challenges they were having with thermals or whatever and in typical Apple fashion, they thinnovated. In 2009, the iMac's design was tweaked with an edge to edge glass display, full aluminum back and a more slanty foot. It was also available in two new sizes, 21 and a half inch and 27 inch. This was also the first iMac to include a built-in SD card slot and Intel Core i5 and i7 configuration options. And in 2011, Thunderbolt was added to the iMac for the first time, and it featured a 10 gigabit per second speed. And now we come to the iMac design that clearly was really good in Apple's eyes because they used it for eight years straight. In 2012, Apple unveiled an incredibly thin new iMac, five millimeters thin, on the edge. This was the first iMac to introduce the fusion drive which was a hybrid hard disk drive and solid state drive solution. And this is the same design Apple has stuck with throughout 2020. It was just replaced recently with the new M1-based iMac on April 2021. But honestly, I have no complaints. I still think the design is great. This is my daily driver, this computer kicks butt. But it is nice to see something new now. But this era of iMac had even more innovations to introduce. The late 2014 27-inch iMac, introduced a Retina 5K display, boasting a massive resolution of 5120 by 2880. And then Apple kind of surprised us. At WWDC 2017, Apple introduced the iMac pro in a space gray color. It featured up to 128 gigabytes of RAM officially but it was expandable to 512 up to a Vega 64 GPU and up to an 18-core Intel Xeon W clocked at 2.3 gigahertz. The entry level price was 4999 and maxed out configuration was around $14,000 something like that. But Apple killed it off. It was only a one generation thing and it was actually discontinued in March 2021. And now here we are today with the new colorful ultra thin iMac with Apple silicon. To me it feels like Apple brought a lot of fun back to the product. Not just with the Apple logo matching color theme, but with other little touches like the nostalgic hello screen cover, the new Setup Assistant and color matched wallpapers, stickers and UI accent colors, which are exclusive to the iMac you purchase. The 2021 iMac features aluminum sides and back and an all glass front. Yes, even the chin has a glass layer. It boasts a 24 inch 4.5K Retina display and the whole computer is 11.5 millimeters thin. And I love how the hinge pays homage to Apple's 2004 cinema display. New design aside, the biggest new feature is Apple silicon. Their custom SoC, system on a chip. So with all that, you have a smaller board, smaller and quieter cooling system and the whole computer weighs only 9.83 pounds. However, due to the thinness, a power supply can't reasonably fit inside this computer. So this is the first iMac with an external power supply. But it uses a new color matched woven cable which magnetically attaches to the iMac so I think that's pretty cool. And you can also add an optional gigabit Ethernet port to the power supply brick. And there's new color matched keyboard, mouse and trackpad accessories. And for the first time on a Mac desktop, touch ID is available. And thanks to Apple silicon, the webcam uses a similar image signal processor like what's in your iPhone to capture higher quality video. And for the first time in a Mac, Dolby Atmos is built-in for spatial audio. And I'm not gonna lie, when I first heard it, it surprised me. And this is just the start. Soon we'll see Apple launch an even bigger Apple silicon iMac with much faster processors, and I'm stoked to see where the future leads. Now I know I couldn't cover every single detail, but if there's a particular iMac you want me to spend more time on and dive more into, feel free to leave a comment, I'd love to do a future episode just about that one particular computer. And feel free to subscribe so you don't miss that future episode and all the other future tech episodes I release. And if you're a fan of Apple or Steve Jobs by the way, feel free to follow my new podcast. It's all about Steve Jobs at Apple keynote presentations and it's really fun and I think you'll love it. And hey, if you like this episode, you know what to do. Thanks for sticking with me. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat music)",

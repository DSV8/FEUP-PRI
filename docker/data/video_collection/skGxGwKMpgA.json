    "transcript": "This is a Flipper Zero let's see if we can use it to attack an Android 13 phone, Android 14. This is an iPhone 15 running iOS 17, this is an iPhone running iOS 16 and here we've got Windows 11 I'm going to go to Apps, Bluetooth, BLE spam shout out to these amazing people who discovered this vulnerability. Various options can be used here as an example Android device connect notice we've got that on the two Android phones what about Windows? Notice iOS 17 device found on the Apple devices so Apple device popup notice we got a popup over there let's do Apple Action notice there but the easiest option here is just to use the kitchen sink which basically just spams everyone can cause an iOS 17 phone to crash notice we're getting pop-ups all the time on these various phones as well as on Windows you probably want to disable Bluetooth if you're a bit more security conscious or you don't want to be spammed like this. What you might notice is this phone is actually crashed now and is rebooting because of Bluetooth messages sent from a Flipper Zero.",

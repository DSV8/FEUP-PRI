    "transcript": "hello good people Eber here with Hardware Canucks and this is the razer phone 2 now at first glance you're not going to notice a major difference between this and it's a previous or predecessor the razer phone because from a design standpoint it's pretty much the exact same thing except for a few minor increments in terms of features and let's talk about that right after message from our sponsor the new master keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a comfortable magnetic wrist rest beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter and perky lighting control with a variety of Cherry MX switches and the bottom type-c connection Coolermaster doing it right check it out below okay so what's really new with the razer phone - well let's start off with the design and to be honest it's not that different from the original razer phone I think we noticeable difference that you'll see compared to the original phone is that the rear side of the device has been replaced with Gorilla Glass 5 instead of the traditional matte black aluminum finish this adds support for wireless charging but given that this is a glass back you can definitely expect scratches and it being a slippery eventually over time because it's obviously a surface that picks up grease and fingerprints quicker than aluminium surfaces so that's again something to keep note of now given that it's 2018 we had to expect some sort of RGB lighting on a smart phone of this caliber and that's exactly what's going on here so the logo hidden underneath the Gorilla Glass 5 back is RGB LED and it's controlled through Racers chroma app pre-installed on the device there are three learning effects that you can play around with so there's spectrum cycling breathing and static effect and you can customize the colors - up to sixteen point seven million colors which is certainly a nice touch so if you're looking for a smart phone with RGB lighting this is certainly the one to get apart from the rate of part from the ROG phone then is that I still have no idea on availability or launch so yeah RGB where's our phone - they've also added ip67 water-resistant rating which is a welcoming update from the original RAZER phone it's certainly on IP 68 certified but you've got to front-facing speakers razer actually had to redesign the speaker the system to accommodate that certification so it's certainly and welcoming and refreshing update from the original RAZR phone but aside from that from a design standpoint it's again very much identical to the original RAZER phone all right so spec wise you're getting a snapdragon 845 processor a gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of storage and a four thousand milliamp hour battery again the only incremental upgrade internally is that processor bump you're still getting the same amount of RAM compared to the original RAZER phone you're also getting the same battery capacity so again not a significant upgrade on that department as well but what they have included is a new vapor cooling chamber design internally so it actually dissipates the heat a lot better so that's again something to be validated in the full review the next thing to talk about is the display and just as expected it's not a significant update from the original RAZER phone so you're getting the same 5.7 inch qHD plus display with the 120 Hertz refresh rate and my god it looks amazing in person if you're someone who's used to a traditional smartphone especially like myself who has never actually used the original RAZER phone I was certainly I just fell in love with this display right away because the fluidity and the experience that you get just browsing through the Android operating system and of course gaming for the most part is just fantastic I didn't get some hands-on time with that gaming as well and it's again a breathtaking experience you really have to feel it by yourself in person because the hundred twenty Hertz display is just quite amazing especially on a mobile device and it's really hard for me to go back to a smartphone that uses a traditional 60 Hertz display because the phone feels slower and it just doesn't complete that experience now razer did increase the brightness of this display by 50 percent so you're looking at 580 nits or just 318 it's on the original RAZER phone so that's certainly again a incremental upgrade but certainly refreshing to see on the second generation razer phone software wise this phone is rocking Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box which is kind of disappointing because I was expecting Android Pi and you know for phone that's launching at the end of 2018 it just doesn't make any sense for it to ship with 8.1 but Razer is promising Android Pi sooner than later not just for the razer phone too but also for the razer phone one so let's just hope that happens but other than that you are getting a pretty close to stock Android experience without any bloatware so that's awesome there are no third-party skins or anything like that in fact razer gives you full customization options so it is rockin nova launcher by default but most specifically you do have a theme store so if you want to play around with different themes that's there but there's also Razer cortex which is in a dedicated application that makes you switch between different modes particularly for you know it balanced a performance mode that lets you just conserve battery life for longer usage or if you want absolute best performance you can go for the max performance mode which will give you the highest frame rates but that's definitely gonna take a little bit of hit on battery life now one of the major drawbacks of the original razer phone was the camera performance because it just wasn't up to the standards especially when compared to the flagships from last year and razer is trying to address that with the razer phone too because they've implemented dual 12 megapixel cameras you've got a standard lens and a telephoto lens with a different aperture variants but they do come with optical image stabilization but most specifically you'd also get you know extra features like po'trait mode better low-light performance and there's also a beauty mode integrated on this device so again those are some of the things that I'll have to validate for the full review so definitely stay tuned for that but I'm gonna keep my expectations neutral because from my initial testing or with my initial hands-on with this device I just wasn't impressed with the camera performance so let's just wait and see I'm just gonna spend some time with the camera on the razer phone to to give my full thoughts on that and perhaps I'll be able to compare it to the note 9 and the pixel 2 so again definitely stay tuned for that so guys that's pretty much a story with the razer phone 2 and honestly it's an incremental upgrade over the original razer phone just to quickly run over the updates you're getting a new finish on the back its now Gorilla Glass 5 with the RGB lat logo and it supports wireless charging slightly improved cameras it also comes with eyepieces own water-resistant rating a private display slightly better sounding speakers and that's about it and of course it's gonna be priced a little bit higher so the original RAZER phone retailed for $6.99 for the base model the razer phone 2 is gonna be starting at $7.99 for the base model which is certainly an expensive investment but if you look at the smartphone market in general I think it's priced competitively especially when you compare to the pixel of 3 the galaxy note 9 p LG v 40 so again it's a smart phone specifically targeted towards a certain market if you're a gamer and if you're looking for an all-in-one entertainment device this is certainly something to look into because that one in 20 Hertz display is certainly something that I just can't I can't take my eyes off said I will be spending some time with this device just like my other devices especially like the note 9 just to see what the experience is like and if I really like it particularly the cameras those are some of the things that I really want to test to see if it's actually worth the $7.99 price tag so certainly stay tuned for the review on eBay with Hydra connects thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to a new boot sequence channel for the latest tech news and rumors I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one the phone just dropped this is the problem with having phones with glass backs

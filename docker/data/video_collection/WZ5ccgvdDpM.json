    "transcript": "Tom, you're in the, you're in the big leagues now! Brother! You're behind the lens. We got Big Tom on the camera today, alright. You gotta give this guy some love. Jacks gonna be so mad. SO WHAT DO WE HAVE TODAY!? I'm told it's a new, and special smartphone. From Huawei. But, beyond that I don't know why the box is so big.. I don't know what's so special. I know in the past we've done some pretty cool unboxing experiences. There was that briefcase they sent. It was like a secret agent style briefcase for the P9. Maybe they're trying to step it up a notch. I know that Tom knows what's going on here. But I was like DON'T SHOW ME! KEEP IT A SECRET! let's find out exactly whats happening on camera, with the audience. so lets crack this open and see what's happening here. Like I said a box this large for a smartphone you know something's up you know something's going on hohoho woohoohoohoo unbox therapy carved into a wooden crate *sniffs wooden crate* that smell is fresh REAL FRESH ! what is that cedar? I don't know I don't know much about wood but wood is good there is buttons on the front! golden buttons? oh man it's about to a Pulp Fiction moment right here that's the way I prefer it. I don't want to know give me the ... give me the splash 3 2 1 ooooh woah the way that thing jumped up I think I could do that all day Is that hydraulics? oooooh there's a brand new Huawei p10 in there. This is one of a kind, a one of a kind unboxing experience the Huawei p10 I don't know, am i like the first person in the world to have this right now quite possibly? and just like the p9, we've got the lite affiliation on the dual camera system as well Let's get this baby open This one is like... Ohohhoho Oh that's cool on its' own WITH MAGNETS oooh I get excited about the weirdest things, well you know that, that's why you're watching this. ooh! Ooooh. I got it in the blue again, You love the sound affect here *removing plastic wrap* Whoa, What is this finish on the back Can you tell? it's almost like that kinda holographic, Is that the right terminology? Holographic? That is cool. Now, the entire body feels metallic? to me. But it's like.. polished it almost feels like ceramic or something as you look around the device, you'll notice here you have a USB type-C connector, a traditional headphone jack Which some people are looking for.... Something I like that they've done here with the power switch, the lock switch, it's got a kinda.. texture to it. so you can tell the difference in your pocket between the volume rocker and that switch",

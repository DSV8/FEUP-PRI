    "transcript": "this is the current king of low profile graphics cards the RTX A2000 a magnificent stallion of a card but because it's got the word workstation in the description it costs 700 before tax which is quite a lot luckily there's a new contender in the form of a low profile RTX 4060 and in today's video I'm gonna put them head to head in the death match Arena of death and the Victor will be crowned king of low profile graphics cards thank you and here is the potential heir to the throne now it's been out for a while but I couldn't find them in stock anywhere but they're finally available so I bought this one and uh yeah I think it's going to be quite a bit faster but it may have a bit of a problem for what it is which we'll see in a second thank you wow that is quite a cooler we've got three of these cute tiny little fans which are undoubtedly real noisy once they get going but hopefully they don't need to work too hard because we've got a pretty substantial bit of finstack and we've even got some heat pipes under here so this is some beefy cooling for a low profile graphics card in terms of IO it's actually a lot more usable in my opinion than the A2000 because the A2000 has four mini display ports which kind of makes it like using an Apple product you almost always need an adapter whereas this has just like normal graphics card outputs very good I like that and this 4060 also comes with the low profile bracket in the box and just like with the A2000 we don't get a back plate which I guess means low profile graphics cards don't deserve them now the aforementioned problem is that this has an 8-pin power connector whereas the A2000 doesn't which not only means you'll need more power supply cables but with the 115 watt TDP of the 4060 it's also more power hungry which could potentially limit its use cases I don't know let me know in the comment section down below what you think but with that before we have a look at the performance let's do a quick tear down of the baby 4060. well it's the future now and you know what that means it's tear down time and I know how this little thing performs my favorite thing in the world me versus a tiny fan connector someone did break there but it's okay I guess oh it's so cute it's just like a thin slice of graphics card here is our 8 gigs of video memory down from the 12 gigs on the A2000 which is a bit of a bummer next to that we have our ad-107 die aka the RTX 4060 which is quite small compared to the ga-106 of the A2000 other than that I don't have a whole lot to say about it we've got some power delivery and yeah it's a low profile graphics card don't get that kind of insight anywhere else the cooler is pretty cool we've got two heat pipes that make direct contact with the die and spread Heat around the fin stack memories touched and we've got some contact with the power delivery as well but this is one of the beefier coolers I've seen for this form factor of GPU but with that let's refresh our memories on how the A2000 performs and then we'll try out the 4060. foreign Ty P this is where the A2000 is real happy with Battlefield 5 running at high settings you can see we're hovering around 120 frames per second which is very impressive for about 70 watts of power draw now in terms of the test system I've got a 3900 KS and a whole bunch of ram in here so that we don't have any CPU bottleneck during our testing but later in the video I will be torturing that little 40 60 in an old Optiplex to see how it handles that at 1080p high cyberpunk is giving us just over 50 frames per second I almost said 60 frames per second but I feel like that would be too charitable but still this is high settings and we're not drawing 800 watts it's pretty cool now with Starfield a 1080p medium settings it's running a bit worse than cyberpunk did and we're getting serious frame rate dips but it's still playable and I'm just using a settings preset here I'm sure with some settings optimization you can get it to run a decent bit better Resident Evil 4 but again a 1080p High ish I guess is again running around 60-ish frames per second so even with these more demanding games we're still getting a good frame rate without having to sacrifice heavily in terms of settings now finally The Last of Us is a game that may potentially favor the A2000 because the version of the A2000 that I have in here has 12 gigs of video memory whereas the RTX 4060 just has 8 gigs for some reason but then again the A2000 performs roughly similarly to an RTX 3050 so I think there's a good chance we have a bit of a blood bath on our hands but no point in speculating let's find out wait a minute why is this performing the same I mean in this map where there's less going on it's running a bit better but in the standardized benchmarks you've got the same result basically is the A2000 a lot faster than I remember or is the RTX 4060 really terrible um let's try another game ooh never mind I take it back in cyberpunk the 4060 spits in the face of the A2000 now it is with a decent bit higher power drill but we were kind of expecting that right and the performance differential means that the 4060 holds up way better at 1440p in fact this result is better than the A2000 1080p result yeah I don't know what was going on with that Battlefield 5 result but here with Starfield again the 4060 predictably is performing quite a lot better I think part of the reason we're getting almost double the performance here is because the A2000 doesn't have the same consumer drivers as the RTX 4060 and the 4060 recently got a driver update that helped performance in Starfield damn I'm starting to feel bad for the A2000 here this is quite the thrashing uh which is interesting considering that according to Resident Evil settings we don't quite have enough video memory for these settings and the A2000 did actually on that note um it looks like the 4060 is having a stroke let me quickly restart the game oh there we go we're back and it looks way better and it's running very well at 1080p High settings despite the fact that we just have eight gigs of video memory we're getting some solid performance here so clearly unless you're looking at Battlefield 5 the 4060 is performing way better and if you take into consideration the fact that it costs almost half as much that's that's pretty wild but with that I'm kind of sick of how smart the 46 is being let's put it in its place the final thing I want to try is drop the little 40 60 over here into the Amazon gaming system just to see how it fares in its natural environment I've run into a teeny bit of a problem here the power supply only has two SATA power connectors and we need one of them to power the SSD and they're definitely not Savage SATA to open power adapter I'm going to use needs an additional two so the savageness is gonna have to multiply a little there we go problem solved now I'm gonna be not I was about to say not stupid about this but I feel like that ship has sailed I'm gonna be less stupid about this and not use this adapter to entirely power the graphics card I'm gonna use the splitter between the SSD and one of the graphics card connectors so that the graphics card gets like one and a half I guess that yeah I don't know about you but this is clearly a great idea oh no I don't think this is its natural habitat terrible things are happening well I I have to turn it off and I think I think some cables are blocking fans or summon I thought it was gonna be fine but yeah those cables are clearly wedged in the fans let's see if we can fix it oh wow that's hot can I just yeah we can just pull it out oh and after my very manly sounds I unplugged some i o to make space for the fans to breathe a bit which made a big difference oh that's much better now we've been gaming for a while and nothing's exploded yet which is progress it is very stuttery though I think the i7 2600 in here isn't having a great time trying to keep up with the 40 60. so I guess this really isn't a very good use case for it although on a side note Starfield kind of runs which is pretty cool I wasn't expecting that with the the quad core we have in here it does do that but aside from the apocalyptic stutters it's kind of playable so with that we've got a new Champion low profile graphics card which also costs about half as much which is very nice I think once the current generation of low profile optiplexes show up on the used Market five years from now you're gonna be able to build one hell of a gaming system out of the pair maybe I should do a video on that let me know in the comment section down below and with that thank you for watching and until the next video bye oh",

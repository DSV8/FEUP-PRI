    "transcript": "- [Michael] For most of the past year, I've been editing YouTube videos with the help of the Sony XM3 headphones. Before that, I was plugging in the QC 35's, from Bose. And it all sounded just fine because as I reminded you time and again, I'm not really an audio file. My buddy CrackBerryKevin hates it when I sell myself short like that. But look, its true. I can't really tell much of a difference. Or at least I couldn't, until this day. When I found myself at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona working at this table with my mobile nation's family. And I had forgotten my headphones. So my other buddy, Derek Kessler, added me his BNO H9i's. I plugged them in, cued up Final Cut, and right away I recognized from the sound quality boost alone, I was about to be hundreds of dollars poorer. (cheerful music) Now I don't say that as an endorsement necessarily, see when these first broke cover in January 2018, they carried a sticker price of 500 bucks. Frankly, I don't think they're worth that, not today. Now unless you're looking for a status symbol, in which case the stitched cow high leather band, land scan ear pads, and distinctive color way of the pine pear here will get you noticed. But a few weeks back, something important happened. Amazon put the H9i on a lightning sale, at 50% off. Since then, I've been able to find them for 299 on Amazon. And so you see, things have gotten interesting. My appreciation for the H9i's began with that sound quality jump, where on the Sony's, my video's music and vocals were flat, subdued, coming through the wire. The H9i made them bright and dynamic. The same for music tracks and I don't own a Pono or anything but even through Spotify's compression, there was a spaciousness to the music with these headphones that I hadn't heard on my Bose or Sony's. The act of noise canceling that defeats background sound feels slightly less effective than those other headsets, but it's barely noticeable enough to mention. Now headphones like these are much more than the soundstage. Like the Sony's, these have a track pad on the right ear cup. To adjust the volume, you rotate your finger around the circular track pad as though you're turning a dial. At first, I found it needlessly skeuomorphic. But once you get the hang of it, it's a pretty fun way to turn up your tunes. Swiping down on the track pad turns the noise cancellation on or off, and swiping up toggles the audio transparency mode. So you can monitor your surroundings. - [airport Speaker] Per FA regulations, your carry-on bags are limited to one small bag or one personal item. If more than two pieces.. - [Michael] There's also a feature that's meant to automatically pause playback when you take the headphones off, but it had so many false triggers during my first few days that I disabled it. I don't miss it at all. You know its funny, the more I think about the H9i, the more I would change. I mean the Bose QC 35's are much more comfortable, I can wear them for hours. Where as these clamp my head more tightly, so I need to take breaks every hour or so. It's more cumbersome to use the H9i with multiple devices because there are no audio cues to tell you which one you're connected to. And the app helps you a little but, using it requires you to sign in, which really shouldn't be necessary. And that audio transparency mode is only available for listening to your surroundings alone. You can't enable it and play music at the same time. So why do I put up with those compromises? I like these headphones for the same reason I still carry a Blackberry. Each offers something no competitor does. In the case of a Blackberry, it's the keyboard. In the case of the H9i, it's the unique look and the gorgeous sound. Or, you know what? Maybe a better comparison is to my new road camera. The Fugi XT3. The casing has all the character of a classic, old camera, and some of the shooting modes I use replicate the look and feel of old film. But under that classic surface, it's packed with modern features like dual SD cards, USB-C. The H9i has that same potent contradiction. Old world design, and cutting edge tech. In which by the way, includes USB-C, and a first for me, a removable battery. Battery life is exactly what it should be, too. A five hour transcon flight burned through only 50% of my juice in bluetooth mode and I had no gripes with bluetooth reception across two laptops and four phones. It's a bad time to buy any headphone, with Bose's replacement to the QC 35's due this summer. But given those recent price cuts on the H9i, I will say this. Buy 'em. If you're looking for bluetooth headphones that blend old world style, modern features and a killer soundstage. But just be sure to use that returning period to your advantage, in case you find the compromises too much to handle.

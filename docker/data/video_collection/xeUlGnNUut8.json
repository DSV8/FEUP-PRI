    "description": "Review of the Acer Predator Helios 500. The most powerful gaming laptop from Acer. Helios 500 -   With an overclockable i9 - 8950HK, GTX 1070 and up to 64 gigs RAM, the Helios 500 delivers some crazy performance. This is one of the best performing laptops for the price. Excellent thermal performance with easily upgraded hardware. Acer did a fantastic job on this. It's not as durable as an Alienware device but it will be cheaper and lighter with awesome performance.

    "transcript": "This here is Acer's Helios 500 It's a kind of the bigger brother to the Helios 300 And it's a device that almost replaces the Predator 17 and the Predator 17x from last year So those were really popular gaming devices This is kind of like the successor to it It looks quite different though Instead of the black and red It's predominantly blue And I like the look of it The design is obviously very gamer-oriented It's got angular trim pieces And the whole design language does feel appropriate for the Predator name tag So the build quality feels good It is plastic, there's no aluminum at the top or the bottom or any where on exterior But it feels well-built In comparison to other gaming laptops of this caliber like 17-inch gaming laptops that often have aluminum around it The big advantage is price obviously by using polycarbonate Or just other plastic materials that be able to keep the cost down But also weight This is a lighter laptop to something like the Alienware device It's not as tanky as Alienware like if I throw both of them off the stairs This would probably crack before an Alienware did But it's still a really solid machine In terms of the ports, it's got plenty of i/o Display outputs on the back and USB ports on the sides There's three USB-As and two USB-Cs Both of them support Thunderbolt-3 Now to access the inside it's not super difficult There's actually hatch on the bottom, it's got two screws and that's it The rest of the back panel does come off but it's a little bit more work Now inside you get access to the WiFi card this one is the Killer 1550 It's an Intel-based card it's a fast one, I like it You also have four RAM slots, there's only two easily accessed You can remove everything to get to the other two But you have to easily access once You've got three drive base, two of them NVME, one of them SATA The battery in here isn't small but it's a pretty serious laptop I'm really getting around 3 hours of battery life that's with screen at 250nits And that's not playing games that's just like regular use If you're playing game, expect 45 minutes to an hour of battery life But that's just what it is, that's what gaming laptops are like Okay, the screen is really nice This is the 144hz panel made by AUO It honestly looks really similar in image quality to the 15inch 144hz screen that we've seen on a lot of high-end gaming laptops right now But this screen also has G-SYNC Not only it's bigger the 17.3inch screen but it also has G-SYNC and it looks really nice when you're playing games The unfortunate thing is that because of G-SYNC you don't have access to Nvidia Optimus so you don't have the power savings from that, you have a really short battery life The brightness is good and the color accuracy is respectable It's a very nice screen. The keyboard is pretty comfortable It's a big laptop so the whole typing surface is elevated a little bit But once you get used to it, it's a nice keyboard The layout is spacious, the key structures are nice And it also has programmable macro keys up top I like the track pad It's a glass surface, Windows precision drivers, blue lighting on the perimeter And hardware buttons below it These buttons have quite a bit of travel when you press it, but it's a good track pad Now the performance in this device is excellent We're talking just straight-up excellent Now this unit has an overclockable i9 and that's a chip that can get pretty high But the thermals on this device are really well-done Five heat pipes, big fans, big heat sinks and blue heat sinks for extra bonus points (chuckles) It's a great thermal design The fans are quite on idle but they can get loud especially if you spin them up fast You wanna use headphones when you're playing games The GPU is an overclockable GTX1070 and again, pushes out really good performance This is a GPU that I think will last several years in terms of gaming life at 1080p It's just a really good combination The speakers are located on the bottom but they sound really good despite that imperfect location They get loud but a still clean sound and there's a sub on the bottom It's nothing crazy, but it gives a little bass or just some body to the audio So my overall thoughts on this bad boy It is a powerful laptop. I think for the 6 core CPU and the GTX1070 are gonna last quite a while The components they have in here are smart It's overclockable, very well cooled, and upgradability is good It's easy to access, a little bulky and heavy I mean it's a 17inch gaming laptop right? So if frequent transportation is a thing for you, then I will consider something thinner and/or lighter But if you don't need crazy portability, this is a pretty cool pick up It's powerful, it's well-cooled, overclockable GPU, overclockable CPU They did a lot of stuff right on this thing Now there's another variance to this that is gonna come in AMD like Ryzen and Vega for the CPU and GPU and that's pretty promising, I'm excited for that I don't know if I'll do a full review on it because it's gonna be very similar to this But I'll probably post something on Twitter or maybe Instagram to kind of compare the two Uh, but that's basically it Okay, hope you guys enjoy this video. Thumbs if you've liked it, sub if you've loved it. I'll see you guys next time.",

    "transcript": "Hi there, my name is Greg and in this video i'll be answering your important twitter questions now if you're wondering what i'm talking about it's probably because you're not following me on twitter that tends to be where i'm the most active on social media we also have a public discord server though i'm not as active there because we do have a very actually very good community uh full of very knowledgeable people who can help you out if you have tech problems if you have issues with your computer maybe you want to ask questions about performance and the like that's where you go for those quick answers and then we also have facebook DMs open on our facebook page a couple i mean instagram you know things like that but i'm really the most active on twitter and that's why i decided to ask folks to send their questions there so if you're not following me go ahead and do that just a side note i am more or less a one-man operation so if you're wondering why i'm not as active on discord or why i don't respond to facebook DMs or whatever it's because i just don't have the time i manage filming editing scripting i do all of that by myself no one helps me my wife does handle some of the emails she handles user submissions for the pcbc and fix or flop playlists specifically and we also have a brand manager that handles the bigger brand negotiations and things but uh i'm in charge of pretty much everything else and i can yeah be spread thin but without further ado we're gonna jump into these questions they are juicy i hope you enjoy stay with me to get rid of that annoying activation watermark hop on over to vip std key and purchase a windows 10 pro oem key for fractions of the price of retail just use a secure payment method like paypal receive your key in seconds and activate your os here bye bye watermark and be sure to use our new offer code skgs for a sweet discount so we're gonna jump straight into the questions if you asked a question it will be featured on the channel that's my that's my goal i know that once we get to like two or three hundred questions submitted on twitter it's gonna be near impossible to condense all that into a single video but uh while we can i'm gonna try to show every single one of these on video uh so that you feel like i'm more or less talking to you face to face i don't really get much of that interaction anymore we were a lot smaller it was easier to do that but now it's becoming increasingly difficult so i'm just going to scroll through read the question aloud and then try to briefly answer it so starting first with the bs machine i'm looking for a hard to find be quite official dark base 700 in white specialty edition one of the best places to find this stuff is it just facebook marketplace on ebay the answer is more than likely yes they only made two or three thousand of these cases and they're not being sold by be quiet direct anymore i don't believe so you're gonna have to just find one second hand good luck with that there aren't uh aren't too many out there nick asked if a case can only support a single 120 ml radiator is building a custom loop with the time worth i think he meant worth the time and money even if it's a thick 45 mil or more radiator being used great question nick so i think the entire premise personally behind custom loops or the custom loop market for pcs that are in the mid tower format i think that it's purely an aesthetic player at least that's how it should be approached and the reason why is because you're not going to see a huge performance difference in terms of thermals between a 360mm AIO and a custom loop that only uses a single 360 ml radiator right and that's essentially the same cooling space from the radiator side of things and you've just got a stronger d5 pump or dvc pump whatever it might be over usually it's an ace attack pump in the AIO it's not until you throw in crazy radiator combinations like dual 480 mil and above right that's when you got enough fans working simultaneously to the point where they don't have to turn very fast and they don't turn very fast you get a quieter system under that load and you might have an additional you know two 300 megahertz worth of overclocking headroom there but if you're going for like extreme extreme overclocking custom loops aren't the way to go you want to go you know liquid nitrogen things like that things that are temporary but if that's what you want like a hall of fame attempt or something like that and 3d mark you don't want to go with a custom loop um the the major selling point i think is just the aesthetic play and that's coming from somebody who's built many of them i've worked with many custom loop companies i think they would even attest to that yes there are some minor cooling benefits if you're just sticking with a 360 mil or maybe a 360 mil plus a 240 something like that you're going to get an extra you know maybe three four degrees celsius out of it but it's not going to be anything super crazy unless you jack up all your fan curves to 100 at that point i think you've kind of defeated the purpose of the custom loop to begin with that's just my take on it next up we have drake i have an aorus x570 elite motherboard assistant can run the two sticks of 3600 megahertz ram but it won't allow me to enable xmp so i'm stuck running the ram at stock i've tried updating the motherboard and my research has shown me others have the same problem any ideas uh yeah if others are having the same problem then it's definitely a motherboard issue if you've seen this issue replicated by other users with different boards but same model right same sku uh it's gonna come down to probably a bios update and if it's not out yet it's something that i expect gigabyte is working on right now next up we've braylon black favorite piece of tech these questions are so vague and that's why they're so difficult to answer honestly it's it's probably going to be like one of my cameras i just use a a64 and a6600s i don't use the the larger uh full frame mirrorless cameras i'm a Sony fan but i don't like the the price of the a7 s3 at this point in time i'm more or less waiting for the a74 and whatever that brings to the table probably much of what's in the a7 s3 i just don't want to pay the price of a7 s3 um but my a6600 is really great excellent autofocus i've got three lenses that i pair uh with it to film the videos that you guys see on the channel and it's just lovely all of my filming gear for the most part is in my video descriptions by the way nanoflower asks why do we exist oof another tough question i'm gonna i'm gonna hit you back with another question how do you know we exist and that we're not in a simulation matt asks how long is your prep routine just for your hair when filming this is a good question it's literally this right here and usually it just kind of stays like that osama asked if you were to change three things about the usa what would they be and why oh my gosh with the tough questions off the top of my head i'll just answer one of those i think that healthcare in this country really needs to change we're in this weird middle ground between like being fully socialized and fully private like the government's kind of got to say in what happens but at the same time the the private institutions are still more or less in control of things so the rates are really high and they're just really high at this point i feel like it can't get much worse in either direction so we just need to pick one and stick with it um at this point i just yeah i'm paying as much for health care for my family of three my wife and my kid and myself i'm paying as much for that as i am for my mortgage and and this is a pretty decent sized house it's like a 3 000 square foot home it's it's kind of a cookie cutter cheaper style 3 000 square foot home but still so picture that a mortgage from that house that's about what i pay in health healthcare and it's insane okay mr pc deep cleaner no cheating show us right now how clean your daily use pc is got you matt i actually just built this system you probably have already seen the nzxt build that we published maybe a few days or weeks ago depending on when i published this one but uh yeah i just built it so it's fresh it's clean now my old build you could probably see in that video it's a little dusty not too bad though uh and it's just because my office gets so dirty from cleaning those other viewer systems that are really messy that uh yeah i mean i can only keep dust out for so long if not youtube which alternative career path would you have gone for good question so i actually have a petroleum engineering degree and that was something i expected i'd be using for the remainder of my life little did i know it would mean almost nothing i mean i i did learn quite a bit from it and i did learn some basic circuitry and things in the core engineering classes that i had to take but uh i'd be offshore probably drilling for oil right now and then there's a bunch of people think oh oil that's bad uh but look a lot of things still rely on petroleum uh a lot of plastics and uh other chemicals that we use in everyday things uh so it's not something that's disappearing actually we're finding more reserves than we're depleting every year at least that's been the track for a good while there's this notion that we're running out of oil but that's just simply not the case i don't know why the media says that most of them don't understand how reservoirs work how they're found or how they're maintained but anyway yeah that's what i'd be doing i'd probably be offshore right now because that's that tends to be where you can make the most money is working offshore and uh i don't know if i'd be on the drilling side of the production side or what but i'd like to be hands-on if possible next up we have colin says what are the mistakes that uh accessory manufacturer are making what are the mistakes that accessory what by that i mean should the industry focus on interoperability reducing the bloatware of rgb controls not adding diffusers to rgb not enough catering to the silent pc crowd um look i think that a lot of these companies just kind of follow the money and they should if they're if they're interested in making money again all companies for the most part are they're just going to be doing things that are widely accepted by the most number of people it's utilitarianism and most people like rgb that's just how it is uh the i mean rgb control is like rgb software yeah it's all pretty much finicky um there are some rgb suites that attempt to unify uh all the different sorts of brands because it can be annoying to have like three or four different rgb software suites on your desktop and have them all open and run in the background simultaneously we've we've run pre-rolls for signal rgb in the past they attempt to unify those but they don't they don't have support for everyone yet right they're having to add support as they go and i think until all support for all products is attained which i think is impossible we're just going to be dealing with that we're like every company attempts to make it work and there's always going to be issues and when you have multiple rgb software suites running in the background simultaneously you're going to have conflicts and some devices aren't going to be detected and it's just a cluster right on the software side it's just a cluster to maintain and then not enough catering to the silent pc crowd i certainly think there are products out there that already do that um just because some companies don't doesn't mean that no company does right if your favorite manufacturer is just not known for their silent pc components you know tough noodle that's just what they that's what they choose to do they choose to cater to a different crowd probably a crowd that's a little more you know a little more populous maybe a bit louder than the silent pc crowd no pun intended but you've got noctua you've got be quiet a lot of those companies that do specialize in silent pc products and these other companies know that they already exist and that they're already well established are they interested in competing with them probably not they're good at what they do let them continue doing it right so if you want quiet stuff it's already out there next one miguel says why do some people just trust the coveted vaccine that is scientifically proven to be effective and safe but happily take cattle medicine because it's cattle medicine because some youtubers said it works ah look i'm not gonna get into this because it's gonna get too i don't know i'm gonna piss somebody off no matter what i say somebody's gonna be upset by what i said uh i will just say that i'm i'm disappointed in how politicized the vaccine has become up next steve asks what are your early thoughts on intel adopting a big little design for their next desktop chips i don't see the advantage of it since power efficiency is such a low priority for desktop machines so what steve's referring to intel alder lake cpus are apparently going to have a big little design in the sense that they're going to have some powerful larger cpu cores in the package and then some smaller more efficient course and the bigger cores are the more powerful ones they they run at higher frequencies etc they consume more power and then the more efficient cores are the ones that are going to be yeah sipping on power more for background tasks and the like i haven't done a ton of research into this but i think it's it's really going to affect um only a certain group of people i think you got to know going into this that alder lake is going to benefit some folks a lot of gamers they're going to be happy with the purported lower temperatures lower power draw but then you know other workloads aren't going to favor that so if you're leveraging a program that has max core utilization we've got some cores they're going to be lagging behind because they're just not operating at a higher frequency they have much lower power threshold so there you go next up ghost why do you think microsoft chose now during a global chip shortage to release an operating system requiring the very hardware that is in short supply they must know people will wait and that only hurts microsoft's roi and market share you know i don't actually know it's a good point i didn't think about the timing there um i think it's ridiculous that there are hardware requirements first off if the point of an operating system is for it to be very fluid very steady and and universal or as universal as possible why would you alienate such a large number of people i think that windows 10 is already good enough i personally won't be upgrading to windows 11 anytime soon unless i absolutely must and even then it might just be for experimental purposes uh i i'm i'm fine with windows 10. right yeah it could be a lot better but it works for me and i'm not someone that just readily jumps onto the bandwagon of oh it's new so it must be better because we've all been through windows 8. next up here george would you mind if i interviewed for a video about your channel uh yeah sure i can do an interview it doesn't matter what size channel you have i don't know who this person is but uh i i'll do them i have no problem with that and it's kind of a quid pro quo it helps out your channel helps out my channel my exposure so i'm down for him i'm just i'm pretty busy at this point i think toward the end of the year it's going to get worse so we might need to move this to january february somewhere around then when it's a bit quieter in the tech space and we can work something out next up or zz if you had to choose between starting over on youtube but forgetting everything you knew about the internet or never going onto the internet ever again which would you choose what kind of what if question is this i don't really have a problem with starting over i mean that that part doesn't really scare me it's the forgetting everything part what i know now i know that if i wanted to do this again i probably could i could probably pull it off it probably wouldn't be as successful now because there are certainly more creators on the platform than there ever have been but i think that the idea that i have to forget everything in the process i don't like that i don't want to i don't want to give up what i've learned so i guess i'm never going on the internet again thanks or next one i see or however you say your name i apologize what's your last name history do you come from a latin family do you speak spanish a good question i get this a lot so salazar is a spanish name i think we've traced our family back to like northern spain like castile area somewhere around there but uh i don't speak spanish i wish i did my wife speaks like five languages and i speak 1.2 languages 1.1 like very very broken german very very broken spanish i wish i spoke more i just i just need to take the time to do it and i've been so slammed with work the past few years plus having a kid getting married all this is just happening very quickly and time just seems to elude me so maybe maybe at some point i will yeah try again to learn the language next one here from glaucoma is that new rgb service being promoted everywhere legit or is it actually a scam of some sort i have no idea what you're talking about i wish you'd specified the software if you're referring to software i don't know the one we advertised uh if that's what you're talking about signal rgb is a legit if it was a scam or we suspected it was a scam we would not be promoting it we've got kryptonic hd with the pc market being so rough would you recommend someone get something like an xbox series s over a low end pc that can't perform as well let's say 300 game pass makes a series that's an interesting deal a good question i would say yeah um if if you can't really swallow the pill of paying a bit more than normal for a graphics card and all you really want to do is game you're not worried about having like a unified gaming machine plus office work etc then yeah a console is certainly viable and there's a reason why they are so popular next up we've greg morgan if i buy a video card with displayport 1.4 or higher will my dp 1.2 cables work with it more than likely not i'm not sure what the limitations are with a display 1.2 cable but i know the bandwidth definitely changes between the two so depending on the display resolution refresh rate your dp 1.2 cable might not be enough it comes down to like the gauge of the wire that the cable uses how it's wound up things like that because again the bandwidth jump is just massive next up the bald guy what was your first job so kind of a two-parter here my first legit job as in like i worked a nine-to-five shift things like that it was very steady i worked in the summers at a local winn-dixie i was a meat and seafood associate so back there i was like cutting fish cutting meat for folks making all kinds of stuff back there and then cleaning it all up and i did that every single day over and over and over again and um i don't know it got kind of old now the second part of this question the first job i had where i was paid by somebody other than my parents i was a soccer referee i left uh kids games i was at the time like you know 15 16 17 and i was also reffing adult league games as well so people who are much older than me i think i was pretty fair next up we have james i would love to hear you reminisce on your first computer experience mine was the old apple 2e yeah i'm that old so my first modern build and i did take apart and rebuild a lot of computers my dad would bring home when i was much younger like 10 11 years old but my first personal gaming pc that i ever built i was in college and i built it with a core i3 4150 a gtx 750 ti and a z97 motherboard because i had big hopes and dreams and i thought that one day i was going to be upgrading that i 3 to something that i could actually overclock like a core i5 case cue or core i7 that really didn't happen i ended up selling that rig and made like 50 bucks i think it cost me like 500 to build and i sold it for 550. so then i took that money and bought a totally different platform different system and that's kind of how i got acquainted with different hardware i would try different combinations of hardware with different budgets and uh yeah that's how the pc channel was born next up what was the first breaking benjamin song you ever heard oh i love this so for those who don't know breaking benjamin's my favorite band the first song i ever heard from them i can't remember how old i was but it was right after the phobia album came out i think the first song i heard was evil angel i heard that little drum intro and then i just heard just the grungy you know electric guitar come in i was like oh yes this is it next up question from elias i think who is the driver nfl you like the most it has to be fernando alonso yes he's spanish so duh but he's also a very driven character no pun intended he's very talented he's a bit headstrong but i mean the dude is just super super talented i remember when he won his first championships 05 and 06 for renault dethroning michael schumacher finally someone was able to do it um yeah he had a few shoddy experiences with mclaren and ferrari the ferrari that was famous for understeering and over steering oh my gosh and he still managed to not crash as much as most people probably would have in that car he's um he's just one of the greats i think and despite only winning two world titles that's still two more than most people on the grid next up we've richard which math and or physics classes cost you the most sleepless nights this is an easy one gotta be differential equations and it's not necessarily because diff eq is difficult it is kind of difficult to wrap your head around diff eq it's not as straightforward i think as calculus one or calculus two um diff eq is just like it's an extra layer on top of so many numbers and letters that um yeah it was a bit overwhelming but i think what overwhelmed me the most was the professor the professor in my view wasn't very good point blank um it just it wasn't very good and so i resorted to youtube channels actually like patrickjmt i'm sure he's still around i haven't checked recently but patrick jmt was a lifesaver in diff eq if it was not for him i would have failed it hands down and yes in hindsight i probably would have blamed the professor but when you're a student it's it's really no excuse at this point there are so much knowledge at your disposal online that even if your professor is trash unless he's like intentionally screwing you over on tests which he can't really do if you're getting the questions correct and showing the correct work there's really no excuse to fail if you're driven enough you'll find a way to learn even if you have to do it on your own with a textbook or with online help from youtube or elsewhere you can pull it off if i can you can next up jay peterson when building or upgrading a pc what's the biggest mistake you think people often make and what are the alternative options solutions you would suggest uh this one's pretty straightforward i think that wiring especially like front i o wiring things like that the more precise details of pc building are probably what people misinterpret the most uh installing things like AIOs using the wrong screws you know the finer details those are often what are overlooked and unfortunately this can result in pretty catastrophic experiences cpu is overheating systems not powering on because things are mis-wired and the alternative options or solutions to those would be to do a bit more research watch youtube videos like ours we have plenty of those out there that should help you next up uh EVGA Geforce 210 this is the weird twitter name what are some of the oldest pc parts you have and what do you think is the best use for such parts that's kind of a tough one i like to just have them just to show them off at some point i'm sure my kids will get a kick out of the way graphics cards used to look in the good old days but i i just i don't know you could recycle them there are responsible ways to dispose of them if that's something you're into but i think that even the older components have some use case for certain individuals especially those who can't really afford much at all young kids who have never been exposed to super powerful systems i'm sure would be perfectly happy with those older components and i think that's what i'm starting my kid out with i'm going to give him a very bare-bones system and he's going to have to learn and work his way up to the more powerful stuff just because he's my son doesn't mean he's gonna get the biggest and the best right away and the goal is not to spoil your kids early next up uh okay more serious question from kirk if peter piper peeked at part picker to p ik i'm moving on uh stoop stubby is how you say your name why do fools fall in love good question uh and i don't have the answer for that unfortunately don t i have a good one in today's time using a ryzen 5800x is 3600 megahertz considered slow now for ram i've heard other youtubers stating 4000 megahertz is the new standard uh look i think that's opinionated um definitely i mean 4 000 megahertz ram that's still going to depend on timings and cast latency and things but assuming they scale equivalently yes there are benefits to having faster memory but around 3 600 megahertz is usually where you're gonna start to see the law of diminishing returns really start to take hold so unless you can find a four thousand megahertz kit for around the same price as a 3600 megahertz kit which in today's market is not really possible you'll be paying a pretty premium for a 4 000 megahertz kit in most cases um the 3600 megahertz is just fine and probably the better value option next up paddy's pcs how do you think microsoft have handled the release of windows 7 so far this kind of ties into the one we just answered i i just i i don't know i don't think they're gonna be able to break the cycle honestly i think windows 11 is gonna be pretty buggy for a pretty long time and you know it's bad when they're already starting to you know narrow down the kinds of hardware that uh will work with it i'm just not interested at this point in trying it out myself uh pulsiv what inspired you to learn how to build pcs was it hard to master this field uh not at all actually i mean i know it's easy for us on this side of the fence to say that it's easy because we've been doing it for so long but it really wasn't all that difficult i was a bit nervous yes but it was fairly straightforward the wiring for the most part is straightforward watch a youtube video or two that's what they're there for with this much information at our fingertips nowadays there's really no excuse for not building one if you have the time and answer the other part of your question i built my first pc because i had to my rendering times were way too long when i was in college uh making the early videos i was making on the youtube channel uh this next one i don't even get this reference i might be uncultured but i've never seen this before next one from extraordinary how much collateral would i have to let you hold to borrow a gpu for build my car my first board that's pretty good uh what do you have here all alpha alphareus however you say that have you tried extreme overclocking or would you consider it if you haven't before i wouldn't do it out of my own like i wouldn't take up my own time to do it it's just not something that i think is there's not really a point to it unless you're just trying to put your name on a scoreboard and i get that appeal right but uh yeah i know unless i'm in the right setting it's just not really worth it i i don't think that there's much you know point to it tom asks yes or no i'm gonna go with no kay asks when do you plan on adopting windows 11 for your builds the same question uh not anytime soon just yeah i'd prefer to stick with what works and i'll let everyone sort out through the beta phase or what should be called the beta base what do you think about rgb and what's the best way to control a whole setup with multiple periphery hardware again we've talked about this a bit signal rgb is one of those that's upcoming that they're adding support every day but they still haven't added a ton yet i would say uh so they're getting there but at this point there's really no solid solution there's a few options out there but uh nothing that's definitively the best or all-encompassing yet next up jared asked if you're able to strike a deal for that patch of lamb what will you do with it so this is a reference to a tweet that i made about making an offer on some land we're actually going to be trying to build a house on it so that's all it's for just our new home it's going to be custom built or we expect that it will be and it's going to have kind of a separate office area so that it can be a bit more secluded from the kids not to worry about asking them to be quiet when i click the record button coalition's got a totally not weird question would you rather fight one zaxtec turf sized duck or 100 duck sized zax probably 100 duck size zacks i feel like i feel like that's a lot less intimidating jace asks what do you think is the hardest troubleshooting process step i think when it gets down to the motherboard and cpu that's when it's the most annoying and probably the most i don't know there's nothing really difficult about troubleshooting hardware it's just the amount of time that you're willing to devote to it uh it's rather straightforward actually and a bit redundant in that regard but once you get down to the platform it just gets annoying you've got to remove everything else to take out the motherboard swap the motherboard out swap the cpu out by that point just like scorched earth mentality try everything because well you might as well you've already completely taken apart the system next up you brainiac ever thought of developing a pc hardware product or product line either on your own or as a collaboration with a company this is a really cool one uh kind of like my friend bower who teamed up with liam lee and made a case uh and has his his logo his name on that case that's really cool i mean him being able to stamp his approval on a case like that and have it perform so well in the market and be loved by so many and that's just that's a huge accomplishment for him i'm really happy for roman but i would like to do something similar to that at some point if possible i don't know if i'd wanted to be a pc case i mean maybe but some kind of product similar to how liam lee and der bauer have teamed up i think that would just be so cool next up terror tech why are you the way you are oh i don't know known by a few i have a pc with a ryzen 5 2600 and b450 motherboard and i have this issue and my screen randomly freezes and two seconds later it turns off and then the cpu debug led on the motherboard turns on i always have to hard restart it to make it work again what do i do uh well if your cpu debug led is on or turning on i'd say it's probably your cpu but look in all seriousness the debug leds are super helpful it'll kind of point you in the right directions to what is at fault it's kind of weird that your cpu would randomly do that i would revert back to stock settings if you have any overclocks running any xmp profiles run all that at stock at base frequencies and see if that issue persists if it doesn't then it was likely just your cpu struggling to keep up with the frequency at whatever set voltage you have nosi lists if you could get a remastered or remake of any game for pc what game do you choose and why i am so glad you asked this question because i have been dying for a remastered or modern version of sim golf okay i i grew up playing sim golf like a boss okay i had just the the most beautiful challenging courses out there my my golfers loved it okay and i was making bank i was making stacks but you know what that game is old and it doesn't even run on windows 10 probably does through some emulator i'm not aware of but i've tried to make it work on windows 10 and it just doesn't just doesn't happen so our remastered remake of that game would just be pinkie tech asks if you weren't doing youtube what would you be doing uh this is a question i already answered i'd probably just be using my bachelor's degree in engineering next question do you play any games competitively uh no i don't i'm not really like super good at any game pretty much it's just yeah how it is what's your favorite death grips album uh should i know who this band is yeah sorry i just looked them up i have no idea who they are next up adam have you or do you plan to upgrade your main pc to windows 11 i guess saying a lot of you are interested in windows 11 uh no not anytime soon i just don't really care it works fine the way it is uh how to make money it's the question we all want an easy answer to i love this question from dad will you ever get into the world of 3d printing also are you a european asian american car guy so i have actually 3d printed things on the channel before i'm not sure if many of you noticed but uh i'm just the printer i had was super cheap and it drove me crazy trying to get that thing leveled all the time so i didn't really um i didn't really continue it the way that i thought i was going to and then for the european asian american car guy thing um i think it's pretty self-explanatory and the next question coincidentally has to do with cars as well naturally aspirated or boosted and why so if you look at these previous cars here so the ferrari is a very high winding v8 engine very loud screams flat plane crank i love it revs to 8 500 rpm and that's where you get most of your power way up there in the rev range but uh the 911 here this is a 991.2 so it is a flat six twin turbocharged engine that sits right over the rear axle and it just gets grip for days right off the line i have tuned it um it's not stage two yet although there are a few things coming that will allow me to stage to it but uh it's i mean 0-60 in just over three seconds it would demolish the ferrari i'd say if i had a pick naturally aspirated it's even though you don't usually get the same kinds of just thrill that you get out of a tuned car that has a really really wide torque band or something like that there's just something special about high revving v8s i'm gonna miss these and last year it's kind of weird how all the car tweets are at the bottom but uh toronto asked we need a garage tour do you like driving the porsche ferrari more this kind of ties in what i just said um the ferrari is the more fun car to drive i would say just the the sound the fact that it's convertible and it's it's a ferrari right and it's cheap ferrari relatively speaking but it's still a ferrari it's not very fast but um you know everything about it i i love it drives like a go-kart it's got a very mechanical feeling steering wheel it it shifts really nice considering it's not a manual i wish it was but it still has a really nice satisfying shift with the paddles because it's essentially an auto manual so it's got a manual transmission with a mechanical arm that shifts for you so it behaves like a manual on the roads it'll roll backward if you're at a stop and you're in gear you know stuff like that um the porsche is just if you want to zoom down the freeway if you just want to go fast you take the porsche it's just the thing's a bullet so that is it for this video we have answered every single question i think there was like one exception it was like a five-parter and i just yeah it requires its own attention but i appreciate all those who submitted questions and if you're not following me and you want to be a part of these videos in the future be sure to follow me at greg salazar yt we'll have more of these in the future and yeah i'll do my best to go through all of them just like we have here if you're not subscribed i'd appreciate if you guys subscribe join the public discord server if you haven't already there's plenty of folks over there who are willing to help you out if you have an issue and uh yeah like the video leave a comment i'll catch you in the next one my name is greg

    "description": "This video is about which camera is best for youtube videos.   If you are a beginner who is just starting a YouTube channel -- use any camera, even the one on your smartphone.  If you are already doing YT for a while and looking for a better camera, then get an entry level DSLR.  And finally, once you are sure, you want to do YouTube professionally, get canon 70d or similar camera.  Now, if you want to go beyond this, look for canon mark series.  ----  I use Audio from YouTube audio library.  You can reach me here   Website -  YouTube -  Facebook - Twitter -  Instagram -",

    "transcript": "a few weeks ago I quickly covered two new AMD announcements the availability of b550 motherboards well sorta because those boards just seem to be selling up everywhere and then three new Ryzen CPUs well they're sort of new so there's a Ryzen 9 3900XT the Ryzen 7 3800XT and the Ryzen 5 5 3600XT when we publish that video a lot of you were expressing concerns about its pricing overall performance and most importantly what their launch would do to AMD's current lineup well we've got all three of them right over here and this review is going to follow our usual course so first I'll walk you through what has changed in terms of specs and then go over how the new XT series compared to what's already out there and then finally wrap up with a metric ton of benchmarks also do keep in mind that a lot of the numbers that you're going to be seeing in just a bit have been updated with new numbers and the reason for that is over the last few months there have been some major updates for Windows and some applications that we use and we're also going to be breaking this review into different segments just so if you want to get to a particular area you can just simply hover over the timeline now if your devices and support that feature will make sure you leave timestamps in the description down below so with that out of the way let's talk about these new XT CPUs right after this what does it take to experience a compact high performance gaming notebook you want specs that can meet the most demanding tasks like a fast CPU up to 32 gigabytes of RAM ultra-fast nvme SSD and r-tx graphics you also want something that's a lightweight and easy to carry around how about a robust optical mechanical keyboard with perky RGB lining and a fast 144 Hertz IPS display this is a new xbg senior gaming notebook check it out at the links below and game to the extreme ok so before I get into the juicy details I think it's important for me to set the stage a little bit today actually marks exactly one year since Zen 2 and Ryzen 3000 series CPU's were launched that's right exactly one year has just flown by so over the course of those 365 days AMD has proven that it can dominate Intel on almost every front that includes even after comet Lake s was announced if anything that CPU lineup showed how much ground Intel had to make up for but AMD still can sit on his heels either so that got me thinking with all these massive successes a firm lead over the competition and Xen 3 which is confirmed to be launched later this year why even bother with the XT series well I have an answer or more like I have an assumption it all starts with andis use of an enhanced seven animated architecture for these new processors basically over the course of last year they have been able to fine-tune transistor characteristics to get higher performance through better frequencies without increasing voltage power consumption or heat well those refinements will probably be carried over into z3 so this is a great opportunity for a production test run before the updated manufacturing process gets rolled into the next generation of CPUs technically this should mean less headaches down the road while we get some new tech to talk about but what kind of advancements are we actually gonna see right now well like a lot of you said it's pretty underwhelming at least on paper starting off with the Ryzen 5 3600 XT it gets a hundred megahertz boost to the single core boosts clonk versus the 3600X the Ryzen 7 3800XT meanwhile gets a bit more generous bump of two hundred megahertz to it's single thread clock and you'll notice the 3700XT isn't listed here that's probably because it's already so close to the 3800X's performance that adding an XT version would make a 3800X kind of pointless the big boy of this new lineup is the 3900XT and when lined up against the 3900X well yeah you only get a hundred megahertz here again now I really need to highlight one very important thing all of those are listed as up to and from our experience it does take a little bit of work to get those frequencies on a regular basis first of all you need to find the right mojo with your motherboard settings on our ass rock x5 Sony Taichi that meant leaving everything to auto while on the MSI x5 70 ace we needed these settings you'll also need to make sure that windows detects enough idle processor time that it parks course into a completely idle state in order for that to happen on a regular basis I found you need to disable always-on applications like Adobe Creative Cloud and Autodesk app we also found an issue with steam you play an origin requesting CPU cycles that directly impacted Cinebench single core results so once those hoops were jumped through this is what we actually saw while AMD claims the 3900 xt hits 4.7 gigahertz we saw an average sustained frequency of four point six two gigahertz that's still 50 megahertz higher than he 39 our next though so it's something I guess but when it comes to peak single thread speed the CPU did indeed hit four point seven five gigahertz every now and then switching to multi-threaded workloads AMD doesn't claim any improvements but when averaged out over the course of a 20-minute myrin there's a really really small 20 megahertz advantage let's see where that comes from since it impacts the behavior of all the xt cpus there were quite a few times throughout the all core test where the cores are consistently boosting fifteen to fifty megahertz higher this will probably cause a very very narrow advantage for the 3000xt cpus in some applications but not enough to make a visible difference this pattern repeated itself almost identically for the 3800XT though it has a slightly larger single core advantage over the 3800X since its weighted boost clock has been increased by 200 megahertz the 3600XT is a copy and paste of that too with higher Peaks but very similar averages compared to the 3600X so with all of that taken into mind there isn't gonna be a huge performance leap over the non xt cpus but there is a huge price gap between them like a lot of you brought up in the last video game DS retail partners have already started to lower prices on the 3900X 3800X and 3600X so let's check out how they all line up basically what you're gonna see is the XT variants hitting the same prices as their predecessors did a year ago the main problem is those reduced prices not with the 3900X at $420 the 3800X at 320 dollars and you 3600X at just 220 dollars meanwhile the 3700X will continue to be at $275 but when you start looking at things paying between 30 and 80 bucks for a few extra megahertz seems like a pretty raw deal I should also mention that the 3900XT and 380 XT don't have coolers while the 3600XT includes a rates fire in its box but before I jump into any conclusions let's head into the benchmarks you can pause here if you want to read through the complete system specs starting things off with single thread performance and yeah it looks like there is a small bump when moving from the X series to the new 3000XT's it isn't much at only around 5% but it's there in this one case things change when moving on to purely multi thread benchmarks and this is something we'll see pretty much throughout both synthetic and real-world tests basically the 3900XT the 3800XT and the 3600XT don't offer any tangible benefits in CPU intensive applications meanwhile in programs that are slightly less multi-threaded or used a GPU for secondary processing the benefits are a bit higher and I mean a bit this is a result of a higher sustained speeds over the course of each test but honestly this doesn't amount to much in real world in gaming pretty much all these mid-level and higher-end CPUs align with one another but if you dive down a bit into the results the differences in average frame rates between the X and the XT Series was literally nothing there was a slight bump in 1% lows for the faster CPUs it wouldn't make a visible impact in gameplay but after multiple runs it was there another thing that amy mentioned is the xt series should see more of an advantage in games that are sensitive to frequencies we didn't see any of that here but maybe it comes down to which titles were using and the fact that every one of them is set to the highest details power consumption showed really minor increases for all these processors except the 3900XT which was a bit high personally i think this is because the 3900X we have in the office tends to run really cool and seems to be an overall more efficient chip compared to some of the others that we've come across either way all these numbers are pretty much within the margin of error well guys a lot of you mentioned that these refresh processors from AMD seemed pretty underwhelming since they don't offer a huge leap in terms of performance but they also cost a lot more than the CPUs that are currently in the market right now and unfortunately that's the conclusion that we've come based on what AMD has been bringing to the table over the last year the 3000XT series just look like a poor value I mean look when you look at the current lineup the non-XT CPUs are at their lowest price point right now which is amazing it almost feels like AMD was expecting their existing refresh processors to be able to achieve higher sustained speeds but that just didn't happen so they were sort of forced to launch them anyway as for the competition against the comet Lake lineup well I'm just gonna voice in caution for AMD in general Ryzen 3000 processors offer a phenomenal value when compared to anything in team Blues lineup but these new CPUs almost wipe out any pricing advantage I mean sure the XT is still win by a longshot in many productivity applications and yet many Intel CPUs tend to be an overall better choice for gaming even if they are attached to an outdated platform a few price cuts for Intel could really ruin the XT series at least in gaming so here's the deal if you're in the market for a new AMD CPU skip the XT series because the small benefits which again in terms of performance doesn't seem to be justifiable considering how expensive they are compared to the current rise in lineup I would save that money and just invest that into a better GPU or storage so on that note thank you so much for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

    "transcript": "well hello to people gaming chairs are all news gaming battle station desks is where it's at and so this is the level 20 GT RGB battle station gaming desk for $1,100 are you want to go for motorized $1,100 RGB nests mouse mat built-in hyper desk let me know in the comments there's also a motorized less or manual version of the same battle station desk without the RGB all right so now let me give you a live demonstration of this entire ensemble of RGB sync goodness so we've got the electrical desk we have the keyboard we got the mouse we got the mouse mat we got the headset stand we had all the fans inside this in case we got the RGB memory the tforce memory that now works with thermal takes our RGB software and soon the zotac GPUs so right now a thing is synced up in blue and with a few clicks let's see yeah boom you change it into purple it's very interesting to do to have this sort of like massive synchronization happening across all these devices it's very good to see you know thermaltake working with many brands to just make sure that things like that are synced up so like the tforce memory we change the GPU separately but yeah everything everything is working fine it has only crashed on us once but that we're told is potentially due to Windows but see the keyboards synced up Mike how does it feel with all the with all the RGB stuff in your face it's intuitive but it hurts my eyes I don't like RGB are all that much give me a give me a good self desk and I'm good to go yeah it is very bright we actually have to turn it down because as you sit in front of the the screen this area here just blinds you your eyes a little bit alright so this is of course a motorized desk right now we have all the controls on the right side nice little profile controller box we have four memory profiles you just hold one to remember you're setting everything is visualized in numbers so you can kind of know exactly how far and how low you want to go so the gaming desk has this giant mouse mat spending the entire way so you kind of have to go with it you know you can't really remove it because there is a kind of like a midsection right here somewhere in the middle and this kind of this like plasticy material but the entire frame is contracted constructed out of steel it can hold up to 100 kilograms or 220 pounds so they shipped a bunch of really heavy systems on top of it it did not display any bowing or anything like that so uh a very powerful motorized desk now these RGB light tubes are slightly soft and squishy surrounding the desk so if you have our hand over here it's not an irritant you know it's not like a hard corner so that's nice this would not be a gaming desk without some chemo measurements we have three holes at the back one over here one somewhere in the middle and one on that corner so you can discreetly pass all your cables for peripherals down below where there is a cable catcher so you can you know just have some cable organization and yeah that is the panel station gaming desk and two-component the gaming desk we have a whole new lineup of level 20 RGB gaming peripherals so starting off with the level 20 RGB keyboard so this one's kind of based on the x1 from thermaltake it's got an aluminum faceplate with floating key cap design dedicated volume and mute and multimedia controls so that's always appreciated there is an audio and USB pass-through port at the back of the keyboards there is a dedicated iOS and Android app that you can use for AI voice control so you can say like you know okay Google or Amazon Alexa turn my keyboard red or whatever else color and it will do that so that's kind of unique for thermaltake but not really necessary it will be available in three switches type so Thermaltake is working with razer to deliver razer green switches for $129 there also be delivering cherry blue at 139 and cherry silver switches at 149 so plenty of variety for switches and price points and one really interesting element about the design is that sort of mid section so there's an LED strip there but also a little bit of cutout that follows up so it tries to kind of mimic the whole level twenty chassis design so that's a bit more consistent and cohesive on the entire level twenty series so let me know if you like this design next up is the Neptune Pro keyboard at $69 it follows the same look as the more premium x1 has multimedia controls you know very kind of like stealthy design nothing too outrageous definitely more traditional look versus the level 20 but still a nice new option next up is the level 20 RGB mouse so hopefully they'll have a nice quality optical sensor it does remind me a little bit of the SteelSeries rival 600 series it's got nice buttons RGB illumination of course and the mouse matt has the same type of rope light around it as the battle station gaming desk it's very large its RGB this is kind of the target for thermaltake and finally the ns1 RGB headphone stand so it has USB and audio pass-through on the side which is awesome it's got an all aluminum the actual holder because the base is plastic has got an RGB strip at the bottom of course and included detachable cable so you can remove that if you're traveling alright so those are the thermal take gaming goodies gaming battle station desk all the new peripherals good stuff thanks so much for watching make sure to subscribe we'll see you guys in the next CES video",

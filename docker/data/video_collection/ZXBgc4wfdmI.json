    "transcript": "- Yo guys, Jonathan here coming at you from London. Shout out to Nick Crompton. The reason I'm here, is I got a chance to check out the brand new Nokia, or should I say, Nah-kia 8. Huge shout out to Nokia Mobile for sponsoring my trip out here. It's been pretty incredible. Got a chance to check out the YouTube space here in London, which is amazing. Overall, it's just been a really cool experience. With that trip to London comes an unboxing of the brand new Nokia 8. This is polished copper. It's pretty, it's shiny, and apparently it was constructed from a single piece of aluminium. As far as what else comes in the box, we have the power brick this time of the UK flavor. Headphones, which does of course, mean there is a headphone jack. And last, but not least, the USBC charging cable. I don't know about you, but I love me some USBC. For those who are watching right now and thinking, \"Man, that looks pretty cool. \"I kind of want one.\" I've actually teamed up with Nokia Mobile to give one of these away to you. Details on how you can win are down below. Thumbs up are not required, but they are much appreciated. With Nokia 8, I wanted to break it down into five things that you should know before buying. It is available for pre-order now, but just in case you wanna learn a little more, sit back, relax, and we will talk it out. The first think I wanna talk about is that this phone is unassumingly powerful. On the outside, yeah, it is a pretty phone. But on the inside it's packing a Snapdragon 835 processor. Something unique with Nokia 8, is on the inside there is a copper heat pipe running through the phone. You'd probably never guess that just by looking at it, but they are paying homage to the PC Master Race, bringing more efficient cooling to a smartphone. That in turn should hopefully prevent bottle-necking and overall, give you that buttery smooth performance. You have a 5.3 QHD display, and in terms of resolution, that is 2560 by 1440 and that's nothing special, but what's kinda crazy is this is a ridiculously bright screen. I guarantee you, if you were inside, you will probably never need to have your screen that bright on the Nokia 8. If you go outside a lot, maybe you're in the sun and have a hard time seeing your screen, this might be a pretty cool option to pick up. Next up at number two, is there are 13 megapixel cameras everywhere. Everywhere. What I mean by that is you of course you have your dual 13 megapixel sensors on the back of the phone, but there's also a 13 megapixel camera on the front of the phone. The reason for that is Nokia's dual-sight technology, which essentially allows you to use both the front and rear-facing camera simultaneously. But because they both have that sweet megapixel 13 sensor, you are not sacrificing any quality. This will work whether you're taking a photo or a video. So, this is testing out the dual-sight camera. I just found a cat. Hey, little buddy. (whistles) Come here, cat. Hey! Come here! There he goes. The next thing I'm gonna talk about most likely will excite you. Not only is Nokia 8 running Android 7.1.1 Nougat, it is pretty much a pure stock Android experience. From what I've heard, Nokia is promising lightning fast updates and I might get in trouble for this 'cause I'm not sure if it's confirmed, but I'm pretty sure I heard this is one of the fastest ways you can get to Android O. Next up at number four, with the Nokia 8, you're gonna be able to capture some really, really good audio. Packed inside this guy is Nokia's Ozo audio technology, which is crazy expensive and probably way too complicated to explain thoroughly here. In a nutshell, there are three microphones that capture 360 degree audio. I'm gonna try to test out a couple of things. One, the Ozo 360 degree audio. Of course, you're not gonna be able to hear it back the same way I would through the phone itself, but to simulate that, I'm gonna walk around the phone. As of now, I am directly in front of the phone. I'm gonna circle back. I'm also curious to see how it does with the environment. There's a plane above me. The wind is pretty loud. You should here some footsteps. Let me know what you think of the video quality and audio quality with a comment down below. On top of the 360 degree audio, you're also of course getting high-quality capture. If you're someone who's taking your phone to a concert or to an event, you got home and realized, \"That sounds like either it was exploding \"or taken under water,\" this is a really cool option to check out. Last but not least, the Nokia 8 has pretty much every possible port you could ask for. You of course have USBC, which again I love. That in turn give you Quick Charge 3.0 For those curious, packed inside this is a 3090 million amp hour battery. From there, again, you have a headphone jack, so for those that hold their wired headphones near and dear, this has you covered. You have micro SD card expansion. Again, from the get-go, you have pretty solid storage capacities out of the box. If you need that extra storage, this has you covered as well. Overall, while Nokia 8 might not have the craziest in it's bezels or an extra tall display, there are a lot of things to like about this phone. It is a beautiful phone and one thing that I really appreciate is the lack of camera hump. Those dual cameras pretty much sit there flush and it is very, very pleasing to look at. Looking pretty is one thing, but inside those cameras there's Zeiss optics, and for those that know Zeiss as far as cameras go, you know that it's quality. Again, Nokia is not claiming to have the craziest or most futuristic design out there, but across the board, it is a damn solid phone. Aside from that, hopefully you guys enjoyed the video. If you did, I would love to hear what your favorite thing about the Nokia 8 is. Huge shout out to Nokia Mobile again for sponsoring my trip out here to London to check out the phone. It has been incredible. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later. (techno music)",

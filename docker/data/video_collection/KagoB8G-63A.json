    "description": "Razer's Project Valerie is a 3-screen laptop. Let me say that again: Project Valerie is a laptop computer with three displays. 4K, 17-inch displays. Displays which are designed to both deploy and collapse automatically. I'm not sure what more I need to say to get you on board with this, so hop on in to MrMobile's Project Valerie first look and start saving your pennies now, in case this beautiful monster ever makes it to market.   [SUBSCRIBE]     [MUSIC]  \"The Ballad of MrMobile.\" Mobile Nations, 2016  \"Fashionista\" by Olive Musique, available at Premium Beat:    [AUDIO NOTE]  MrMobile is often ... well, mobile. So he can't always record video voiceover with his studio setup (an AKG C414XLS in a sound booth, if you were wondering). On the road, I record with a Zoom H2n Handy Recorder in the most acoustically sound environment I can find  usually a hotel room.

    "transcript": "- [Michael] CES is great for an early look at all kinds of tech, but the things I tend to remember from these shows are the crazy concepts that may not ever make it into the real world. This is one of those. A Windows Notebook with not one, not two, but three 4K displays. It's Razer's Project Valerie, and it's Mr. Mobile's first look. (uptempo music) (techno music) Where do you even start with something as improbable, as extravagant as this? Well, I'll take a page from Windows Central's hands on and start with the foundation. The heart of the Project Valerie machine is Razer's Blade Pro Notebook, with the same mechanical keyboard and offset track pad, the same aluminium construction, the same high-end guts, powerful enough to run even a VR rig. There's also the same 17-inch 4K display as on the Blade Pro, of course multiplied three times. The panels feature LED underlighting that might seem a little excessive, until you remember that this entire thing is 100% pure excess. So, it should come as no surprise that you're not expected to manhandle the displays open and shut yourself. The machine is designed to deploy and retract the side panels all on its own. Now, I say designed to because the models I saw in Las Vegas were just prototypes. Only the one under protective glass out on the show floor was built with the auto-deploy mechanics in place. Also, a laptop this huge necessarily brings some compromises. It's 12 pounds all told, which is what my old HP Pavilion and Powerbrick weighed about a decade ago. Battery life is a concern, too, with all those pixels to push. And then, there's price. The Razer Blade Pro, that's the single-screen notebook available today, starts at $3,700. Can you imagine what a Project Valerie machine would cost if it ever made it to market? But, again, like all prestige plays, this thing isn't meant to be evaluated with a practical eye. While there are certainly functional uses for this much screen acreage on a laptop, the gaming applications are obvious, and I'd like to try editing video on it, this is a because we can exercise, a play for eyeballs. And, judging by all the love it's getting at the Razer booth here at CES, that play seems to be working out just fine. No word on whether it'll ever hit shelves anywhere, but if it does, I'll certainly be one of the first in line to try it out. Only the craziest of gadgets make it to the Mr. Mobile Youtube Channel, folks. To see every weird and wondrous thing I stumble across at CES, be sure to follow me on Snapchat, at mrmobilesnaps. Stay tuned for more from Vegas. Thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends. (uptempo music)",

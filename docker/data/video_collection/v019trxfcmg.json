Link to Part 1:   Also, since making this video, I've made a much more recent video on the Betamovie itself!  Check it out here:   The segment comparing the image quality between Beta and VHS was de-interlaced rather poorly by Premiere when rendering this video at 30p.  Therefore, both formats look worse than they do in real life.  The original footage is correctly interlaced at 60i, and in my upcoming video with simply that footage I will upload at 60p and hopefully it looks more like it does on my end.  Trust me, they look pretty darn similar.  Plus, that video contains more complex images to analyse the data a little more thoroughly, so stay tuned!

    "transcript": "This video is part two of an exploration on why Sonys Betamax video recording format lost to the more ubiquitous VHS. We were comparing these two machines, and we saw how Sony had introduced BetaScan, but they had overlooked something. Here comes a link to get to part one. We left off with me saying that this machine falls flat on its face. Whats most important to consumers is the machines flexibility at recording shows. And heres where the Sony machine falls flat on its face. See, thats where we left off. Now, In addition to spending time and resources making new features that the buyer didnt know they needed, Sony also seemed to just keep flailing their arms about and making stupid decisions about other basic necessities, and it shows in this model. Initially, they thought things like timers were silly features to include in their machines. As Marc Wielage and Rod Woodcock recall in their piece The Rise and Fall of Beta, one Sony executive, when asked why his machines didnt include a timer when the competition did, explained that Having separate timer allows the consumer to use it for other purposes. And not everyone needs timer. We do not force you to buy one. Yeah, no. While it sounds noble, the whole damn point of a VCR is to time-shift, recording things when youre gone. Thats not possible without a timer. So selling it as an add-on is only going to piss people off and look like a money-grab. Great job, guys. While they did come around and include a timer in most of the models, the timer wasnt nearly advanced as what the competition offered. The Sony unit has a 3 day, 1 event timer. Take a look, programming is pretty simple, you just hold down the program button and pick a time. Then you select what day, either today--tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow. And lastly you choose how long you want it to record for. Once youve punched that in, you select the channel you want it to record, hold down the record button, and move the power switch to timer. Not too difficult, but also not too impressive. Lets hope youre not gone longer than just a weekend. And lets hope theres only one program you want to record. The RCA model, meanwhile, has a 4 event, 7 day timer. And its actually less frustrating to program, as you dont have to hold a button down while making adjustments at the same time. Turn the selector from manual to program, then select which program, a, b, c, or d, you want to input. First, you pick the day. 0 is today, 1 tomorrow, 2 the day after tomorrow, etc. Ill admit, thats not as easy to work out as Sonys in-your-face wording. But its way more capable--Also, A means it will record every day. That means one program can actually create multiple daily recordings, which is pretty neat. This lever switches between the start time, and how long you want it to record. So, say I want to start at 4 PM, and record for an hour and a half. Set the time to 4, turn this to select the length, and then 1 hour thirty minutes. This is more versatile than the Sony, as you might want it to start recording a minute before your show starts and stop a minute afterwards to make sure nothing is missed. Youre not limited to thirty minute increments like here on the Sony. But the most important way this machine kicks the pants off the Sony is here. Notice how the channel is flashing. It wants you to select it. Thats right, the RCA machine will change channels for you. So, the Sony has BetaScan, but the RCA can record for 6 hours, on 4 different programs over a week, and even change channels for you. Which one would you buy? Sony just didnt seem to get it. They released this device with virtually no regard to how their buyers would actually use it. The reason people flocked to recording time wasnt simply that they wanted the machine to be able to record a very long program like a football game, it was also that they wanted it to be able to record a lot of different programs. A six hour recording time means 3 one hour shows and an entire weekday lineup of half-hour daily programming could be recorded on a single tape with room to spare. But to do that automatically, you need a timer that can start more than just one recording. So while Sony caved and produced the Beta 3 speed, it was rather obtuse to not also add a complicated timer that can manage more than one program. Now to be fair, this RCA machine was probably a little more expensive than the Sony. Poking around online shows that the Sony retailed for, are you sitting down? One thousand 2 hundred fifty dollars, eek, and although I dont have a firm price for the RCA model, this price chart from Popular Mechanics shows the Panasonic PV-1600, probably the exact same machine internally as this one given its features, at $1295. But, this is for the absolute whiz-bang most complicated VCR on the market. As their ads proclaimed, nobody gives you more VCR than RCA. But what about lesser-models? Remember, I said that jumbled mess of how this machine came to be made was important. Thats because JVC was super-OK with other companies paying them a licensing fee to make their own VHS machines, and tons of companies offered VCRs from the most basic machines with a mechanical clock-timer to the crazy advanced ones like these. This meant there was a lot of competition between manufacturers, and prices for VHS machines tended to stay lower than their Beta counterparts. A VHS model sporting a 3 day, one event timer like this Beta model may have cost a few hundred less, in fact this chart shows a Panasonic unit available for 995, although it cant record at the SLP speed (not that it mattered all that much as a T-160 at LP was still more recording time than an L-810 at Beta 3). Now, sony did eventually come around and produce Beta machines for others, for example Sony produced some machines under the Zenith name, and they didnt all out refuse to allow licensing--Sanyo and Toshiba both made Beta machines later on, as well as others. But the menagerie of VHS VCRs to choose from kept manufacturers in a price war with each other, and thus it was very common for a similarly-specced VHS machine to cost hundreds of dollars less than a Beta model. Was sony completely wrong to avoid licensing? Perhaps not. The price war amongst VHS manufacturers meant they had to cut costs to compete with each other, and thus the machines tended to be less well made than Beta machines, with some cut corners. But usually they were just as reliable as Sonys machines, and details like a dampened cassette drawer and soft-touch buttons dont mean much to the shopper if you can save a few hundred bucks by avoiding them. Plus, the intense competition between VHS manufacturers meant they had to compete with each other on features as well, so these companies were quickly learning what features mattered most to consumers, like decent timers, whereas Sony just kept chugging along doing their thing without stopping to ask what the consumer actually desired. So again, which one of these would you buy? This RCA unit, with its extremely versatile timer and 6 hour recording time, or this Sony, with its one event timer, 4.5 hours recording time, and nice eject mechanism? Oh, and dont forget BetaScan! But my favorite detail about this machine in particular is the recording speed selector. Notice how it chooses between Beta 2 and 3. Where's 1? Sony basically admitted, in 1979, mind you, they effed up by proclaiming, well we know beta 1 is useless, so lets just not let you use it anymore. This was only 4 years after the entire format was released! This model has a switch to let you use Beta 1, but its located on the back under this cover cause they really just dont want you to think about it anymore. This is particularly hilarious because the Beta 1 speed offered a slightly better picture quality than VHS SP, which led many people to sing praises about Betas better picture, but since Beta 2 became the standard it was essentially like recording on VHS LP all the time, so the quality became pretty similar, in fact you could say Beta 2 looks--and sounds, given the slower linear tape speed on non-hifi machines) slightly worse than VHS SP. We interrupt this program for a quick message: OK, you cant say things like that without some people losing their minds in the comments. Heres some footage recorded on a VHS VCR at the SP speed. OK, now heres the same footage on Beta at Beta 2. Now here they are side by side. I will admit that this is using a newer VHS machine than the Beta one, not that this is a huge surprise given VHS machines were made long after Beta machines and the Beta machine isnt in perfect shape. But it still looks pretty similar. Oh, and sound. Heres a clip from VHS SP. Now Beta 2. So, decide for yourself. Ill upload another video with all of this footage and details on my methodology. And a little card will be appear right about now if its ready. Personally I dont see a difference, and technical data is remarkably similar between the two. But Ill stay out of this, go ahead and argue amongst yourselves, if you please. So, in 1979, just 4 years after its release, Beta was struggling to justify its existence. Now you might think that Sony would try and find a way to differentiate beta from VHS to give a concrete reason to buy a beta machine. And try they did. But every time they offered a new feature, either they went about it in the complete wrong way and shot themselves in the foot, or VHS just copied it. For example: In 1983, Sony released Beta HiFi. Look at us!, they said, CD-quality sound on videotape! VHS will never match that. Guess what. They did. In 1984. Then, in 1985 Sony released SuperBeta, a slightly-better picture quality standard boosting image quality by shifting the Y carrier, whatever that means. VHS will never copy that! Guess what? They did, creating the VHS HQ standard. To be fair this wasnt nearly the improvement that SuperBeta was, particularly since many manufacturers resisted its implementation due to cost and JVC was forced to reduce the minumum specs for it, but still. Interestingly VHS actually far and away leapfrogged SuperBeta with the introduction of SuperVHS (I wonder where they got the idea for that name), or S-VHS in 1987. S-VHS was almost a 60% increase in resolution over standard VHS, much more than the 20% improvement achieved by SuperBeta. Sony wouldnt match that until the next year with Extended Definition-Beta, actually called ED-Beta, a fitting name given how difficult it seemed for Sony to produce a meaningful rise in sales. Really, though, both SuperVHS and ED-Beta werent ever all that relevant due to their high cost compared to their standard counterparts. But one of Sonys ultimate missteps was their idea of a camcorder--Betamovie. Sony figured that the smaller cassette of Beta would work to their advantage, allowing them to create a smaller all-in-one camera than the competition. Great. While their camera was pretty small for its time, they had to sacrifice a lot to make it work. Namely, the ability of the camera to play a tape back! They performed some weird technical magic to shrink the video transport down to where it would record onto the tape in a completely strange fashion that would work fine once removed from the camera and placed in a normal VCR, but which could not be played back by the very device that recorded it. Im sorry, but how stupid is that? Since there was no ability to review what you recorded in-camera, Sony also decided that an electronic viewfinder wasnt necessary, and instead just gave you an optical one. So, not only could you not be sure if the shot was in focus or if exposure was OK while recording, but you would have no way of reviewing your footage till you could get home and pop the tape in your VCR. As you can imagine, sales werent great. Meanwhile, JVC actually had a pretty clever idea and created the VHS-C format in 1982, which were small cassettes that only held a half hour of footage at SP speed (90 minutes, at SLP) but which contained honest-to-goodness VHS recordings on them. These cameras were smaller than Sonys incredibly dumb Betamovie, and the machines could play the tapes back! Best of all, they simply go into an adapter for playback in a normal VCR. Sony wishes they thought of that, for sure. Sony eventually released the Video8 and then Hi8 formats which were formidable competitors to VHS-C, but since no one in their right mind would purchase a dedicated Video8 VCR, youd have to watch your movies with the camcorder plugged into the TV or youd have to dub from the camcorder to a standard VCR, which reduced the quality of the second generation copies. Ill tell you my family was on team VHS-C, and we have the bins of tapes to prove it. Hi8 produced a much sharper picture than VHS, but again, unless you wanted to plug your camcorder into your TV every time you watch home movies, you have to dub it onto a normal tape anyway. In retrospect, it seems like Sony kept failing to put themselves in their customers shoes. Right from the start they were doomed because of their small cassette. If they had done research to determine how people would actually use a VCR, they probably would have found that recording time was more important, and they probably wouldve taken the effort to have a sophisticated timer. So if the Beta cassette had been made with VHS-like capacity, its likely Beta would have won the war. After all, they had a years head start. But people flocked to VHS because it was simply more flexible. Impressive trick features and niceties like the feather-lite buttons are of no use if the machine doesnt do what you need it to do. By the mid 1980s, sales between Beta and VHS were pretty lopsided. Far more people owned VHS machines than Beta. Naturally, when pre-recorded tapes with movies and what-not began to be sold under the brand new product called Home Video, sales of VHS copies were always stronger than Beta. This led economies of scale to rear its ugly head, and for movie studios, producing Beta copies of their latest home-release was more expensive than VHS. So, either movie studios had to charge more for Beta, which was unpopular and only further annoyed Beta loyalists, or they simply made less profit on each Beta sale, which annoyed shareholders. By the late 1980s, most movie studios had decided to altogether stop releasing their films on Beta. Not. Good. To many people, 1988 marked the end of Beta, as this was the year that Sony caved and started marketing their own VHS machines. (Gasp) The history of the videotape format war is interesting, but in my view hilariously one-sided. Sure, Sony was first to market, but they just kept screwing up! Its like watching a cartoon where the protagonist repeatedly slips on a banana peel. Is it fair to say it was all Sonys fault? Not really. After all, VHS kept copying their developments. But Sony trapped themselves with this cassette. 4.5 hours isnt enough. Even the name wasnt a good idea. Beta kind of implies second, as in the second best, the fallback, the reserve, number two, the alternative option. Alpha might have been better. Hell, even Epsilon. Anything but not quite first. And there were plenty of annoying little details that plagued Beta, like the one-sided cassette window, and their strange decision to label tapes based on actual physical length and not recording time. Sony famously did win their second big format war, back in 2006 when Blu-Ray was fighting HDDVD. So at least we can say with a fair bit of certainty that they did indeed learn from their mistakes. Oh, and their 1982 release of a new product co-developed with Philips went very well for them--that new product? The compact disc, or CD. I hope you enjoyed this video!

    "transcript": "do you know what I want more than anything in the world a gaming computer with a new Nvidia graphics card in it so maybe my friends on fortnite won't tease me about my dad leaving me anymore I know what I'll do I'll guilt my mom into buying me the cheapest one of those off Amazon I'm sure that won't end terribly [Music] foreign I saved to me from their terrible PC buying decisions which may or may not be the reason why their dad left by punching Timmy in their tummy and stealing it from them and in today's video I'm going to first laugh at it and then turn it into something actually not terrible oh that's not good potentially but first video sponsor tessellation monohedral tiling tetramino and pentamino I Now understand these very impressive words and many others thanks to today's video sponsor brilliant.org brilliant is the best way for you to learn intimidating topics like math and computer science interactively from the comfort of the least ergonomic

link brilliant.org forward slash David or click the link below and the first two 100 of you will get 20 off of brilliant's annual premium subscription [Music] this glorified Nas looking thing which funnily enough shipped with a driver disc it doesn't have a hole for apparently has an RTX 4070 in it paired with some internal Hardware that wasn't considered particularly powerful when it first launched several Generations ago so we should be getting about 30 utilization on our 4070 if we're lucky luckily for the aforementioned Timmy Market this freakishly endowed Nas does have some plastic RGB crap on the front which is good we also get buttons on the front and I guess usable front io on this side we've got this brushed metal finish with ventilation holes cut in it it doesn't look like there's much getting through there but in all fairness to shuttle I don't think they had a 4070 in mind when they designed this case around the back there's a lot more going on we've got a suspiciously small power supply next to that there's some fin stack peeking through I assume that's for the CPU Cooler and below that we've got very nas-esque IO we even have redundant ethernet very nice and then finally below are hilarious quality control past sticker we have the back of our 4070 looking a bit out of place back here oh the first thing you see is the little Zotac RTX 4070 and what's cool about this card is I think it's the smallest version available of the 4070 so it's great for stuffing and tight holes and then here we've got the passage where you normally install all of your hard drives with some cooling for those hard drives as well but because we've only got an SSD in the front here most of that airflow will be hitting the CPU Cooler which we have further back here now the CPU Cooler is fascinating because we have our actual fin stack back here and then our four heat pipes that lead to the CPU a bit further off on the motherboard which is quite a neat solution but it does present an immediate problem our motherboard is not standard ITX or matx it's some weird proprietary shape which is gonna make upgrading a bit more difficult aside from that our power supply is also a bit funky it's a 500 watt unit with three pretty puny 12 volt rails and it's not sfx so it may be a bit more difficult to swap this out even without the upgrade I'm curious to see how this 500 watt power supply holds up with the 4070. oh actually going back to the C CPU this system has an Intel i5 7400 in it a baby quad core back from the dark ages of gaming CPUs putting a 4070 in here is like putting a doberman heart in a Chihuahua those two things just anatomically aren't compatible and to top it all off they just put a single 8 gig stick of ram in here as per the law of physics that dictates this crap so not only do we have way too loseria CPU in here for the RTX 4070 they also kneecapped it what like what but on that note let's fire it up to see just how much they've kneecapped it [Music] whoa that's quite the authoritative startup right there oh that RGB is like being high beamed in the face wow that's quite the overclocking app we've got there let's see if it translates to Ram being at the correct speed no it it doesn't they brag about 3 200 megahertz RAM on the box but it's just Santa 2400 megahertz we don't have any bloatware on here because not even McAfee would pay to be put on this system which tells you a lot you see to me that's exactly why you gotta you gotta spec your system up properly because you may have a 600 GPU damn is that what those cost you may have a 600 brand new GPU in your system but if you pair it with a Nas CPU from 18 years ago you're gonna get 60 frames per second at 1080p High settings now to try and overcome the graphics card falling asleep while waiting for the CPU to catch up as you can see from the utilization crashing down to 20 I cranked up the resolution but the CPU was a bottleneck even at 4K I I guess we can try some newer games but this pretty much illustrates my point graphics card doesn't even really know that gaming is happening at least with a game like cyberpunk you can see that the CPU isn't a bottleneck at oh no it still is it still is a problem in this game too and then with the last of us we have a frame time graph that makes it look like we're mid generation defining earthquake that's less than ideal now after initially testing the Timmy baiter I did drop a proper kit of ram in there which was not as easy as you would imagine I had to try a couple of different Ram kits and it took the system a long time to figure out what to do with the new RAM and because of the useless bios I couldn't set the ram any higher than 2400 megahertz but once we actually got into a game the performance got a lot better but the RTX 4070 is still barely hitting 40 utilization so clearly this is just a terrible system but let's see if we can upgrade this system to unlock the full potential of the RTX 4070 inside [Music] the first thing I wanted to establish was if I could replace the archaic deformed motherboard in the system with a modern ITX one not only does the i o line up with the pcie slot for the graphics card but we at least have two holes that seems to line up so we just need to hope that there's at least one hole down here that lines up and then we should be good but let's tear it down and see foreign [Music] it seems like all of the front i o crap in the Tommy baiter is standard [Music] oh look at our cute little Zotac 4070 about to be liberated from its bottleneck hell hopefully it doesn't catch on fire now and now that we've got the graphics card out we get a better indication of the screw situation down here which is not looking very good for our ITX motherboard I'm pretty sure we're not going to have more than two screws holding that board in place that's fine you know it's as long as we're not going to go throwing this out of airplanes it shouldn't be a problem and then with the power supply it becomes an even weirder angle look at that [Music] but after having unplugged the hordes of cables I couldn't get the motherboard out I am at least 60 sure that the CPU Cooler is also a mounting point oh there we go oh that is some bone dry thermal paste okay never mind that was not what was keeping it in place but it's nothing a quick shimmy couldn't fix oh there we go such an unnecessarily long motherboard oh so they used a bunch of thermal pads between the motherboard and the case that's interesting one thing that is very promising is we do actually have standoff mounts in the bottom of this case for normal motherboard shapes so without amazing news I'm gonna go prep a new core system [Music] okay it's snuck under there so that's good so we can just kind of I'll even test footed and everything but because of this dude power supply placement I got the alignment wrong so it doesn't fit which means I need to use a much smaller CPU Cooler it's annoying well I guess my next option is this little cooler that be quiet sent over which is apparently good for a hundred Watts worth of TDP feels very very unbelievably tight I can't imagine combining this tiny cooler with a 12 600k and that case isn't going to end in a house fire but let's see what happens it fits but I immediately ran into another problem the standoff I used was a recovering victim of cross threading and all of the other ones I had lying around had a different issue so the problem with every other standoff I have is that they're taller than the stock ones so the motherboard is going to be at a little bit of an angle but I didn't have any other options so I just powered ahead okay there we go the standoff you mounted Tron works yes this is a bit of a high difference but it's not that bad let's see what happens when we drop a graphics card in [Music] oh that's not ideal but a bit of a panel gaps never hurt anyone comfortable with the knowledge I fixed all the problems I powered ahead reassembling the system now the next problem that I'm very excited about running into is that the connector for the power button doesn't reach the motherboard oh that came off real fast oh that may actually be really easy to fix so what they've done is routed the front panel connectors underneath this little daughter board thing so I undid all of the cable routing they did hoping I could just get a little bit more cable length to reach the motherboard oh it reaches yay oh okay very good after which I immediately ran into yet another problem oh no come on we're so close the CPU power doesn't reach luckily I have sleeved extension cables that we can use very convenient and with that I finished reassembling the significantly upgraded Timmy baiter 9000 and installed a fresh copy of windows so I could get to some gaming which went well oh no this has not gone well at all look at those CPU temperatures I mean it's still clocked okay but a hundred degrees Celsius is way too high now if you ignore the fact that the CPU is hovering around 100 degrees Celsius the performance is way better with Battlefield 5 at 1080p we're getting double the frame rate with the same graphics card which is also now running very hot but I think if we can reign in those CPU temperatures we can do even better which hopefully won't lead to spontaneous GPU combustion oh oh that is all concerningly hot in here and after burning my hand on the inside of the PC I had a genius idea I may not have official mounting for a 120mm AIO but what if I just kind of rest it on the inside no it's super not gonna work is it super not gonna work it's gonna be a lot of effort to see oh I after I have to try clearly Overjoyed at the prospect of tearing the system down again I powered ahead anyway so I could Mount the AIO to the CPU and see if I could finangle even more performance into the timovator this feels like there's no way it's gonna work why does it fit less than it did when I test fit it what in the world but despite my whinging the motherboard is in the more stuffing I did the more it looked like this was actually gonna work until I tried closing up the case I don't know if I consider that bulging fitting does that count I don't think that counts oh that is so close it's just bumping up against this damn power supply beam that's been in the way the whole time at this point I guess there's nothing left for it [Music] oh that was not the sound of a of a Dremel falling on the ground due to negligence so now after my very professional drilling job which definitely didn't break a drill bit uh I think I should just be able to yay satisfied with a job well done I reassembled the Tommy baiter with great excitement [Music] and we didn't even break this QC sticker which means the manufacturer will have no way of knowing we tampered with the system smart oh yes that's so much better we're hovering around 60 degrees Celsius on the CPU and we're close to a hundred percent utilization on our RTX 4070 and this is at 1080p we even got another healthy dose of more performance especially in the one percent lows so what I'm going to do now is game for a while so that we heat up all of the liquid in the AIO to see where the temperatures top out [Music] okay well it's been a while and while on the CPU we're getting close to 70 degrees Celsius it does sound like there's a jet turbine on the desk next to me but at least we're not sitting at 100 degrees Celsius on the CPU so I'd say yeah at the end of the day we didn't a pretty good job making the Tommy baiter an actual proper gaming system that is very noisy thank you for watching and until the next video bye-bye [Music]",

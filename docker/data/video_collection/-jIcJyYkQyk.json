    "transcript": "VLANs or Virtual Local Area Networks are often used as a security mechanism to stop users in one VLAN accessing PCs in another VLAN. So we can segment the network for security reasons. However if I send a specially crafted frame I can hop from one VLAN to another if security mechanisms haven't been implemented properly. In this topology I've got two Ethernet switches I've got switch 1 and switch 2, the Kali machine is connected to switch 1 in VLAN 1 the Windows computer is connected to switch 2 in VLAN 3 they shouldn't be able to talk to one another however if I run Wireshark on the Windows computer and filter for ICMP messages and run my Python script on the Kali machine traffic was received by the Windows computer. Even though these two devices are in separate VLANs I can hop from one VLAN to another by sending a specially crafted frame using Python I've tagged it once with VLAN 1 and tagged it twice with VLAN 3 so three tags on the frame and I can hop from one VLAN to another.",

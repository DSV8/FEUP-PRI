    "transcript": "Today I'm bringing the practicality to you I'm about to solve a huge problem in your life well not that huge, its not like you're dying or something but your controller is... See what I did there guys, see how I did that that's like a tag line and it's free and this company they can have it if they want And some dude is speeding outside Jack call the police Was he over his speed limit? He was you could tell from the sound It was a muffler situation? You let Ryan in the room and all of a sudden he's talking mufflers! Ryan come say hi Come say hi Bring the dance moves Bring the dance moves Uh Oh There he is There he is Ryan's in town Unbelievable if that doesn't deserve a thumbs up i don't know what does What am i bringing you today?! This my friends Is a battery attachment charger situation for you PlayStation controller Now this affects me personally It sounds like i'm doing a commercial for a pharmaceutical Okay so there's thees little things, they attach to your controller They enhance the battery life But more importantly than that, I'm hoping it's just a situation where you can drop the controller On there and you're charging Now i've tried different docks before where you're getting in there And you're trying to clip it in Of course i have tried cables and you know I hate cables Go ahead and look at your PlayStation controller You're going to see these little scratch marks Around the micro-usb port You know what thouse scratch marks are? Those are failed attempts That's you trying to find the hole ( ) Anyway listen you don't need to hear the whole rant on cables I'm just sayin' Standard controller 8 hours This baby clipped on and you get 16 hours of play time Alright party time Then you go to bed at some point, probably not But if you do go to bed then you just drop it on there And then you get 16 more hours the next day Now if you're gaming more than 16 hours per day Well you're probably doing something right 'Cuz I don't know how you have that much time on your hands to be quite honest Lets get inside and see what this thing does my main concern here is that it might make the situation a little bit more bulky you know heading over to do the body pump Like these guys over here Hey, you can't trust a guy who's doing a body pump Here we go Alright some paperwork Ac adapter Oh so here are the unis Look at that high calibre packaging right there And this is the unit, right here I like it it's slim like it isn't going to take up too much space Now the power adaptor just comes into the back here And this little guy is where the magic happens Now something they did that i like is that they used the same texture here As the back of the controller Now i'm not sure , they might make something like this for Xbox aswell They probably make something similar But anyhow Clip this baby on, there it is Alright so no it's on It doesn't interfere with anything, you would never notice that it was there I mean you can see that it's there Maybe the controller is a tad bit heavier I suppose when i was talking about bulk i didn't want it to add to the grip in any way But there is still plenty of room there for your hands What about the charging situation? Lets go ahead and see here, am i fiddling around? Am i the fiddler on the roof here? Or am i just... Dumbo drop Do you know why i said dumbo drop? because you brought up Vietnam movies Was dumbo drop a Vietnam movie? *Ryan* That's a term they used in the war, dumbo drop Which is what, what is it *Ryan again* I think i's when you drop the troops in, I dont know I think i had something to do with that Alright, captain Ryan over here Here we go! Three, two, one Yes that's easy! How are you gonna miss? How you gonna miss that? Remember I told you about those scratches Those failed attempts How many times you missed the hole? You aint missing that hole You remember that basketball player, D. Brown He had that dunk where he covered his.. I think it was D. Brown who covers the face like this And then he kinda, ooooh Boom! Did uncle Lou save the day? Now you got 16 hours Now you got the holidays coming up right? You got thanksgiving, you got Christmas You got the in-laws alright They're doing this, they're giving you an ear beating And what are you doing? SIXTEEN HOURS!",

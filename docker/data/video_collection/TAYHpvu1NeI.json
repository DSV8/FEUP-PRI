The G915 TKL fixes a lot of the issues & problems we found with the G915 but there's also the price.....and that's still really high.

    "transcript": "they finally did it people the G95 Tkl my prefer keyboard size from my play style and I feel like they should have launched this keyboard first because of the amazing wireless performance with Logitech Lightspeed and given the insanely low profile design that complements a small TKL footprint on your desk I'm happy to say there are several improvements on the keyboard frame the packaging is now more environmentally conscious with 88% reduction in plastic battery life is much better - but unfortunately my statement on keyboard pricing from nine months ago still stands true today I don't know is it just me or a gaming keyboards becoming way too expensive definitely not just me because the G915 TKL will make your wallet suffer it is only twenty dollars cheaper versus the original and it's almost like you're forced to buy the bigger one because it's kind of such a bad deal to be fair though the $20 difference between full-size and TKL keyboards is common there's currently no keyboard on the market that is competing with the 915 lineup that is both low-profile delivers amazing wireless performance gives you Bluetooth as well comes in TKL and full size options which is why this thing is so pricey so here's my full experience with a keyboard that I wanted nine months ago say hello to proper airflow would be quiet pure bass 500 DX a compact mid tower with a mesh front panel and three 140 moomin are pure wings two fans that are silent and capable enjoy tasteful a RGB illumination a Type C port and an easy case to work in check it out below alright so first I appreciate large tax commitment to play green with better packaging and I hope more brands follow and now the keyboard it's basically an identical frame to the original but in a TKL format without the G keys on the left no numpad and profile keys have moved into the F keys but the depth and height of the frame has stayed the same it is very low to the surface requiring no wrist pad but once you angle it it kind of reaches the same height as a standard keyboard and I don't find it particularly comfortable when it's totally flat it feels like I'm typing on my desk instead of a keyboard so the dual angle adjustment at the bottom is necessary for better ergonomics they have smooth out the edges on the corner so the aluminum is not so sharp that is improvement on the frame versus the original and they've also added a USB compartment at the bottom to store the receiver that is clearly labeled to avoid confusion and this USB pocket is appreciated given the travel friendly format the media keys are still rubber and round with a cool-looking volume wheel that absolutely has no tactility or resistance behind it this is the cheapest feeling element on this keyboard however they've removed the whole latency issue that I've experienced with the original so the volume adjustments in Windows are instantaneous it still charges only via micro USB so this is another disappointment and actually none of their gaming peripherals have embraced type-c and the power switch has shifted to the top right now I personally don't mind the slightly taller forehead to accommodate the wireless controls and the intent wasn't really to create the smallest dql keyboard either but the thin profile and no cable is an awesome desktop experience so if you're after that clean wireless look it is the keyboard I would get now both Mike and Eber have expressed how they don't really like this really tall forehead it's almost disproportional to what this whole keyboard that is low profile and compact trying to achieve I agree with them but I don't particularly mind it the low profile keel switches come in three flavors with tactile be my favorite but a word of caution on the keycaps because the legs could snap which is what happened on my original 915 if you take them off and you're not super careful but the bottom row isn't standard anyway even if you could find replacement key caps now these are regular abs another disappointment for the price point they're kind of shiny and stand out from the lighter aluminum frame underneath and the secondary characters are not lumen ated and pretty much all the larger keys have some form of rattle you can even hear it if I shake the keyboard yikes the RGB illumination here is absolutely gorgeous and always accurate what you selected a software I like the option to customize the media controls and the illumination toggle to something different even turn off the G for a subtle look but RGB eats away at your battery check out the difference between these three settings it is nice to see it improve over the original 240 hours of runtime at 100% brightness but I'd run this at 25 percent or 50 percent to get a nice battery boost and keep the inactivity lighting at default for battery savings I recharged from 30% to 100% and three hours not bad and lastly only the F keys are customizable through G hub either remapping creating macros or enabling G shift that adds a second layer of commands when the G shift key is pressed but that also can only be mapped to the F keys so it's very awkward to use but I love the option to disable any key you find annoying when game mode is enabled and the reason why I have one in this keyboard 9 months ago is because the low profile nature complements the compact footprint on your desk which is why TTL makes sense and the gigantic full size G 915 doesn't as far as the gaming experience goes I love this smaller footprint on my desk I like the low profile switches because the travel distance is much shorter versus your traditional full-size switch and my only complaint with regards to handling of the keyboard are the key caps because they're not exactly fully stable inside the switch and that's just the nature of the switch and the key cab design but they do have a bit more wiggle play and motion that I'm used to perhaps the wireless nature compensates for that and the next thing in that I would love to see from large tech would be the same frame but with full-size mechanical switches and potentially them being hot swappable that would make the killer wireless gaming keyboard on so that is the G 915 TKL minor improvements on the frame the the smoothing out of the edges the additional of a USB pocket however it's still not budget-friendly but I would say it is the best Wireless low-profile gaming mechanical keyboard that exists on the market many gamers have expressed how much they want in the TKL form factor and I'm happy that Logitech is delivering on that promise and yeah it's just it's just very expensive all right guys I'm Dimitri thanks so much for watching check out this other relevant content

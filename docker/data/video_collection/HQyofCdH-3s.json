    "transcript": "it's time delivery all right thanks whoo all right good people so it is time for the oneplus 6 hi I'm looking for a case well look no further I got this beauty the age 700 i buy NZXT with all steal premium frame with a side of tempered glass - beautifully showcase any cooling adventure you might pursue and came a management system that you wish you had earlier all this lit up with integrated RGB lighting and built-in fan control the age 700 I this one's for you I'll take it alright so the oneplus 6 for me has been sort of a mixed experience from the beginning this is my first notched phone I don't really like the glass back the included screen protector is super soft and I recommend removing it for a far superior touch interface and for the first week this thing was super buggy so the fingerprint scanner would just not work at all with me pressing it multiple times lots of app crashes the camera was super slow and it's very odd for a phone that's all about speed you know and while it is priced competitively yet still higher than the 5T when that was launched I was expecting a more polished delivery luckily an OTA update fixed pretty much everything because I was getting ready to go back to my 5T but then it clicked that oneplus 6 is there to give users that fresh perspective not just from the traditional Android customization but from the knotch perspective too by enabling it or disabling it plus having the option to enable gestures control and remove the on-screen buttons which are all great elements for that user customization and if you're like me and like to change up your wallpaper every once in a while you know all these additional customization controls are like that additional backup of Arsenal for you to play around with and you know make you feel like you have a fresh device in your hand now I've been using the 5 T ever since launch and there are a few build differences first one is the glass pack which looks fantastic on video those beautiful reflections really help to sell you this like gorgeous and premium device and it actually feels great in the hand - as long as you cover some of that glass back with finger oils and after a full day of use it is an unpleasant reminder to wash your hands as often as possible and this is where the previous aluminum body will actually looks better after a full day of use by the glass know is grippier it also scratches easier so only after three weeks of use the entire left side is somehow covered in these small visible scratches and the full bottom two so a skin or a case is definitely required just to avoid seeing the smudges on the glass and preserve the resell value in the six months time when the eventual 6t comes out seriously the six month cycle of new devices from oneplus is awesome but how would you feel if you you know picked up the 5T recently and the six comes out which is you know in all aspects better I do love the traditional sandstone cover it feels great with the cutouts around the buttons and the new nylon case is more of a bumper and provides a confident grip the alert slider is now above the power button I love this physical switch but they have replaced the do not disturb function with the vibration mode instead so all incoming notifications will vibrate instead of only the select favorites like we had on a 5t but the Do Not Disturb mode is still part of the quick settings instead all buttons have satisfying clicky registration but the vibration motor still sucks it's audible on a table but not in your pocket the fingerprint sensor is less tactile and easy to miss I like the harder edges on the aluminum frame and we still have the face unlock that super fast no doubt and you can either unlock directly into the home screen or allow you to view the notifications but it is not secure and will unlock with like a face print out it does not recognize me with a hat and it even unlocks at like extreme angles like this where I would not be looking at the camera and then would still unlock the phone the camera bump is now centered for that symmetry with sharper housing and you get some wobble in the surface but whatever and coal quality and speakerphone are totally fine no complaints here just don't cover the single speaker at the bottom the headphone jack is actually quite powerful really good to drive headphones and I don't mind the lack of wireless charging because that charging is the reason I actually disabled the battery percentage I never worried about this thing running out of juice because you know you can plug this thing for 20 minutes get like 40 percent additional battery life it's awesome I only plug it in occasionally when that was on really at the bottom and never have to worry battery life great the rest of the changes appear at the front with rounder screen edges very pixel 2 xl a slightly smaller bottom chambers of the 5T and that height extension around knotch so you get a taller 1080p display with 19 by 9 aspect ratio it's still a pentile matrix but I'm not complaining it's a good panel with D blacks and color calibration available I keep mine on the p3 profile for that slightly natural saturation boost the clock is now on the left side of the knotch and I've actually gone to like the black space despite how the proportions feel off like that slight angle on the sides that doesn't really match the curvature of the corners but hiding the notch is of course an option and one way to revive the freshness of the device the only complaint here though the top curvature does not match the bottom corners when the notch is hidden but I'm really happy that we have per app control of how the notch is used in full screen mode so for example I don't mind the not being there all the time except for video playback because you know the left side just looks terrible so I can disable the knotch for example just for YouTube and enjoy my full experience there without the knotch but exiting to any other app and the knotch returns the execution here with an arch is fantastic and takes into account user preference the rest of the software experience should be familiar and smooth you can change the system font color accent enable ambient wake to glance at incoming notifications assign all types of gestures like three-finger screenshot that would have to wake or lock and even enable navigation gestures that work really well but are slightly slower versus traditional buttons and for a large phone like it it may be uncomfortable to use i love the warmer tones for reading mode and per app activation or gaming mode that disables notifications and overall the touch interface feels great but there are slowdowns when launching the camera from the lockscreen it just takes a you know second too long to load for some reason and 4 out of the 5 times I hear the unlock sound effect before the screen wakes up giving me the perception of lag now I found that if I disable the face unlock I can get into the camera quicker and unlocks my phone faster - it's like almost instantaneous you don't have the lag in the sound effect you no delay so potentially disable the face unlock to get a smoother experience now me handling cameras all day I like with the Oneplus 6 captures it maintains the right amount of contrast and color with good dynamic range but keep away from harsh light because it flares easily and can ruin photos the portrait mode is fantastic subject isolation is excellent while keeping the same field of view and I use this all the time for that fancy camera look the selfie cam was decent but it's not good for group shots as it naturally blurs out the background so I'm the only one in focus all the time and we also now have this portrait mode for selfie cam that over sharpen the subject to emphasize what's in focus and you also get that bokeh shape customization with either larger circles hearts or stars and it actually remembers your settings so don't forget to disable it as for video modes 4k 60 is here with stabilization focus in detail that is awesome plus I love the slow-motion then you can record for full minutes and then cut out only what's needed the phone definitely gets soaked in the mist it is water-resistant just don't swim with it and so it's interesting how the oneplus 6 has turned around on me you know as with everything that's non satisfactory you kind of adapt and with this one I didn't really like it in the beginning but then I put the case over the glass I can figure the notch accordingly the same both face unlock and run it picks a launcher and you know it's not that different from the 5 or the 5t oneplus is moving along with the market trends with the notch in the glass back but if you're potentially thinking of upgrading from the 5 or the 5t potentially wait for the 6t because that may be a larger incremental differences versus what you received with the oneplus 6 this is a great phone I will be upgrading from a 5t I like oneplus's direction in terms of cleanliness of the software with their oxygen the West fast updates beautiful hardware and I'm actually super excited to see how they can improve on the next generation and like how can they step up their game with 60 but the guests will have to wait and see all right guys I'm Dmitry thank so much for watching make sure to subscribe and check out this other relevant content and we'll see you in the next video let me know what you think of the oneplus 6 too",

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video and today it is another collaboration with Massdrop. In front of me are some luxury headphones. They feature mahogany, FINE mahogany You guys know I like wood. Wood makes it good. These, my friends, are an exclusive headphone collaboration between Fostex and Massdrop. They're called the TX-X00. [sic] Step it up a notch. Step up their listening experience, maybe get some outboard gear. Maybe get a tube amp like I've got over here. People who-ho-ho they want the best. So these are three hundred and ninety-nine bucks. They're only available for two weeks. So, if you wanna jump in on this deal, the link will be in the description. The headphone they're based on pre-Massdrop collabration are like fifteen hundred dollars. Essentially what you're looking at here is a way to listen for extended sessions, have a lot of comfort, have premium materials and hopefully do justice to uncompressed audio, whether it's coming from a vinyl or it happens to be a high resolution digital file. Alright. What do we got spec wise? Fifteen millimeter drivers, with over one tesla of magnetic flux density. This sounds like Back to the Future, Jack! The bio-dina diaphragm is made of bio-cellulose material. Oh my goodness! But I just wanna listen to the damn things! I think I just pull the whole deal out. These guys have a long history in the game. What was how long they been at it? 1949 was it Jack? Oh...my! Fine...mahogany. That's a look right there. Oh my! Look how thick that cable is! Braided... this is-this is a little mini zone out factory here. Whether it's Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin... Carrying case, this is important. Oh my holy padding! Wow! [enjoying the adjustability of the headphones] That mechanical click... Super comfy. I have the Fugee's record over here. The world famous, the score. Now obviously due to copyright restrictions, you will not be hearing this. Instead, you'll be hearing me hearing this. Oh, the classic crackle... [enjoying the premium, crisp, punchy audio] [skipping to that good bit] [enjoying the music once again] Look at me! I'm sitting here, I've got mahogany headphones! I've got a tube amplifier! And I'm zoning out to the Fugees! Unbelievable! And the headphone-they sound great! What do you mean!? Of course they sound great! Y'know, I've been listening to a lot of open back headphones. And sometimes I forget... ...what can be achieved with a closed back design. From that thump perspective, that like, that BUMP that THUMP. Y'know what I mean? That BUMP! Okay, these are special, what can I say? I dunno. They're super premium. They're available for two weeks. If you're looking to step your game up, this is gonna be the way to do it. I'm going to go to my... ...mahogany fantasy land. Leave me alone. This is a nightmare. This is the worst thing I've ever featured on Unbox Therapy!",

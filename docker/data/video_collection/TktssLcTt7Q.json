    "transcript": "ok so I woke up this morning today is Amazon Prime Day where things are often on sale on Amazon now the truth is the sales that appear on Amazon Prime Day have gotten not as enticing over the years but this thing holy smokes this is like okay this is a thousand-dollar laptop they're selling for 999$ the original price is 1200 bucks and at that original price I did a review on this thing I was like this is at twelve hundred dollars one of the best values you can get probably the best gaming laptop you can get for 1200 dollars and then at 999 at its current price it is like you if you're interested in gaming at all desktop gaming laptop gaming, any kind of gaming and you have a thousand dollars like seriously consider this because so here's why on the market right now there are three or four brands that make laptops that are considered to be competitive in that twelve hundred dollar gaming laptop price point so we have stuff from Lenovo Asus Acer makes this one obviously there's stuff from Dell and HP they're all really good and they're all like competing with each other for price but even when this thing was at 1200 dollars this thing stood out as being slightly better than the rest it's got 144Hz it's screen it's got a GTX 1660Ti basically the components that they've used on this thing are matched really well with each other they performed like there's no bottle necking there's no compromises on this device to hit that 1200-dollar price point there are no name barebones laptops like Clevo and Tong Fang that are priced even more than this thing is so remember last year Walmart was selling this laptop called the OP gaming laptop which was 1400 dollars at launch but because everyone criticized its price they drop it down to 999 they sold out really quickly a lot of people missed out on that sale this is the same price but it's even better like this is a better sale or a better value than that Walmart device was and people were sad when that thing was sold out you can cash in on this there's three days on the sale and I can't recommend this thing enough at that price point so it's not a perfect laptop if you watch my review you'll get more details on it but there's things like dislike of it I don't love the logo on it like it's pretty it's not like super obnoxious but it's not like a simple muted design and the battery life is a little short it's like a four to maybe four-and-a-half-hour battery but at a thousand dollars I really don't think you're gonna get a better price for a gaming laptop for the rest of the year maybe on Black Friday you'll see some stuff that's like comparable to this but yeah highly recommend this thing right now other devices they have that I saw on amazon that were kind of neat the S10 and the S9 are on a pretty solid seal the S9 in particular this is a 350 dollars phone right now like if you think about how much these phones cost to produce these things at least 150 or 200 dollars to manufacture so for them to sell for 350 on Amazon is a killer price but I wouldn't really consider these phones unless you were planning on getting a phone anyways like this thing however the Helios 300 like even if you were not intent on getting a gaming laptop for the summer and you are planning on building a desktop like can you actually build a desktop with this kind of performance and 144Hz screen and windows license and all the peripherals to make it a fully functional computer for that much cheaper than 999 like I'm sure it can be done but it's certainly not easy and you won't have the portability of something like this so can't recommend this thing enough man Helios 300 if you're looking for a gaming laptop hop on this okay hope you guys enjoy this video thumbs if you liked it sub if you love it see you guys next time and i'll drop a link to the review video the original review video in the video description",

    "description": "The new Lenovo Yoga A940 has a hinge thats similar to Microsofts Surface Studio. The Yoga A940 is an all-in-one PC targeted towards content creators, and it includes a stylus and a precision dial to adjust content in apps like Adobe Photoshop. But it also has some neat advantages: the precision dial can be switched to the other side, while the base station includes a dock for your keyboard and mouse. Its also got a wireless charger built in, and on top of all that, the PCs storage and RAM are upgradable.

    "transcript": "- Hey, it's Nick Statt with The Verge and we're here checking out the Lenovo Yoga A940. (upbeat music) Now the A stands for all-in-one and as you might have guessed from just looking at the device, it's Lenovo's answer to the Microsoft Surface Studio. Two things that jump out at me right away from just playing around with this device for a few minutes, are that it's got a different sliding mechanism than the Surface Studio, so it has a place to put your mouse and keyboard uh, right under the monitor. It's also got all of its components here in this base station with two easy to remove screws. That way you can upgrade things like SSD and the RAM, which is something the Surface Studio doesn't let you do. So, that can be a big boon for creative professionals who are looking for a cheaper alternative. Like the Surface Studio, the A940 is designed for people who do a lot of photo editing, a lot of illustration, that kind of work. People who would need to kind of, take this monitor, pull it down, and get like, up and close and personal with the images that they're working on. So, with that you get a stylus, which sits over here in the wireless charging stand. And uh, you also get this nifty little knob on the side, similar to the Surface Style in that you can customize what it does. You can tap in for uh, Settings. And the Settings are app specific, they change depending on whether you press the button, whether you're rotating the first dial, or whether you're rotating the second dial. You can change those for Photoshop, for, you can customize them for Illustrator, for Lightroom, whatever you want. So with this dial, you can also, if you don't like it being on the left, you can just pull it out, and switch it to the other side. Uh, each of the two USB-A ports on each side, have magnetic covers and then you can just take them out and stick them to the back of the machine, if you don't like. So Lenovo is also bundling a stylus here, it's just a standard, standard stylus using Wacom technology. It's got 4,096 points of pressure. You also got two buttons on the side here, for customizable settings depending on what apps you're using. (upbeat music) So the most important component of the A940 is obviously the display, so it's a 27 inch, touchscreen, 4K display. What makes it different than the Surface Studio, is obviously how you're gonna be using it. So, you have an area to put your keyboard right here, and then you have an area to put your mouse. And then you just pull this down now that your desk in front of you is uncluttered. And from there, you can just get to work right on the screen. So this light isn't quite as high quality as the Surface Studio, which is more than $1000 more expensive. But it is still a 27 inch, 4K display. It looks great, it's very responsive. You use it really easily without a keyboard. It's, the whole point is that you would basically pull this down, keep the keyboard out of the way, and do all your work right here on the display, up close and personal with every image. So powering the A940 is a Intel HN Core i7. Um, you get AMD Radeon RX 560 graphics. Uh, that can't be upgraded. But you can upgrade the memory and the storage, so you uh, it starts with 8 gigabytes of RAM. And 128 gigabytes of storage on the solid-state drive. The RAM goes up to 32 gigabytes, and the solid-state drive can go up to 512. You also get a separate hard drive, that's just one terabyte or two terabytes. So there are two display configurations. You can get the 27 inch UHD model with the IPS touchscreen. You can also get the QHD model, which is a lower resolution. Uh, that also has the IPS touchscreen. So the big differentiating factor here with the A940 is obviously the price. It's more than $1000 cheaper than the Surface Studio 2. It starts at $2,349, that includes the dial, the keyboard, the mouse, the stylus, and the inductive charger, all-in-one package. The device is slated to ship in March 2019. And considering it's $1000 cheaper than the Surface Studio 2, the A940 could really give Microsoft's all-in-one desktop, a run for its money.

    "description": "Current pricing on the DJI Mavic 2 Pro is here:  Its time for another drone history, this time with a MASSIVE World War 2 bomber that crash landed in the middle of Idaho 70 years ago! I only learned about this piece of history a few days ago, its very well hidden in the middle of nowhere.   The crashed airplane is a World War 2 B-23 bomber, only about 38 of these planes were ever built.  Its crazy to see one up close and in person right where it crash landed 70 years ago.   Everything in this video was filmed using a DJI Mavic 2 Pro version with the 1 inch Hasselblad sensor in the front capable of filming in 10 bits of color. So much more color than most computer screens or phones can handle... BUT being on the bleeding edge of technology allows for better editing, and future proofing your creative work. So its a win/win.   Which drone do you prefer? The Mavic 2 Pro, or the Mavic 2 Zoom?

    "transcript": "[Drone sounds] [Music playing] I've successfully reached the other side of the lake. Oh, oh! Check this out! I see something big! Rumor has it, about 5 miles down this trail is a massive World War II bomber called a B23 Dragon Bomber, and it was wrecked here in the mountains of Idaho about 70 years ago. We're going to be taking this brand new DJI Mavic 2 Pro, the one with the massive 1 inch sensor in front, and see if we can find it...see what's left. Let's get started. [Intro] The Mavic 2 Pro has all of the same sensors that we saw on the Mavic Zoom that I reviewed a couple days ago. So whether you're flying forwards, backwards, left or right, you should be protected while you're flying making the drone harder to wreck. Remember, not impossible...just harder. Especially when you're doing the pre-program maneuvers inside of the drone, like the asteroid or the hyper-lapse. All of the autonomous flying is being protected with those sensors around the sides of the drone. The cool thing about the Mavic 2 Pro is that with that 1 inch sensor, it can display 10 bits worth of color, which is more color than most computer monitors can even handle right now. So if you're looking to be on the bleeding edge of technology, the 1 inch sensor with 10 bits of color is the way to go. More colors allow for more detail and just a better looking image. The good news is I've been out here in 'neature' for about 2 hours now with no internet connection, and I haven't had any withdrawals yet, so I should be alright. So the reason I like using drones is because it brings a whole new dynamic to storytelling. Like yeah, I could just film straight ahead and film the whole hike, but that wouldn't be interesting. You can't see anything around me and you can't get any perspective shots of what the area looks like. Plus, a normal hike is something that everybody's seen before. But a drone shot is usually from a perspective that no one has seen before adding a whole new level of storytelling to your story. Also, I brought enough water to start a farm, but I left all of my food in my truck. So hopefully it doesn't take us too long to find this plane. So I've been hiking for about 5 miles now, and if the rumors are true, the plane should be on the other side of this massive lake. And this isn't just any airplane, this isn't a small fighter like the one we saw at the bottom of the ocean in Hawaii. This one is a full-fledged bomber, a B23, with the wingspan of about 92 feet. Pretty massive. It's a little more nerve-wracking. 200 pounds of me on very dried out, wiggly logs. I've successfully reached the other side of the lake, but still no sign of the plane. I'm beginning to have doubts. Oh, nope! Check this out! Look at this! I see something big. So why is this massive bomber out here in the middle of nowhere next to a lake? Let me paint a picture for you. [Classical Music playing] It's the middle of winter in January 1943. Eight guys are in this plane running a normal supply mission when they encounter on a massive winter storm, effectively icing up their wings and not allowing them to fly, which is kind of important when you're in an airplane. Their fuel was running low and their radio had cut out, so they were narrowed down to a couple options. One is to jump out of the plane, that's inevitably going to crash, with a parachute. But there were 8 guys and they would have ended up scattered all over the countryside. So I think they made the correct decision in hindsight, to stay in the plane and try to land it as best as possible. Looking out the window of their plane, they saw what they thought was a massive field where they could land their plane safely. Turns out it was a lake. They ended up overshooting the field the first time because the flaps on their wings were iced up, effectively not allowing the plane to stop or slow down. So they banked up hard and turned around and tried it a second time, knowing that the plane wasn't going to slow down enough for them to land safely. They ended up overshooting what they thought was that field and crashed their plane through the trees effectively ripping off both wings. But, all 8 guys survived. One did break his leg though, so 3 or 4 days after they had crash-landed, 3 of the guys ended up hiking 40 miles to the nearest town. It took them 15 days to go get help. After that, another plane was able to come and pick up the remaining 5 guys who stayed behind with the guy who had broken his leg. [Music playing] One thing that is super interesting is that the Air Force was not super pleased with their high-tech piece of equipment getting crashed. Remember, this was 70 years ago. So the Air Force ended up coming out themselves and taking 1200 pounds of sensitive equipment and the instrument panels out of the wreck so people couldn't steal our technology. Of course this wreck has been here for more than 70 years now, and a lot of humans have come up to visit as well, taking the propellers. Scavenging humans are a problem when it comes to historical artifacts. But I think it's pretty cool. It's not every day that you get to come and see a piece of history where it happened. Everything in this video was filmed using the DJI Mavic 2 with this massive 1 inch camera sensor in the front of the drone. Just like with the Mavic Zoom, this drone does have the safety sensors in the front, the sides right here, and also in the back of the drone, which is pretty cool. And on the bottom we also have some more sensors. The build of the Mavic 2 Pro is basically the same as the Mavic Zoom, except for the gimbal and the camera in the center. So the controller of the Mavic 2 Pro is effectively the same as the Mavic Zoom that we tested a couple days ago. This circle over here on the left side controls the camera gimbal, which can also go up and down and point at the sky, which is kind of cool. And then the circle over here on the other side is actually used for the aperture. Aperture means you can kind of decide what is in focus and how much of the background is blurred when you're taking video of something with the drone. So I would say if you're into the super cinematic shots where the background needs to be blurred, lots of bokeh, there needs to be lots of color, the Mavic 2 Pro is probably the drone for you. Personally, I think I go more for the features of the drone, and having the capability to zoom in on something while not losing any quality is super important, especially for the drone history videos I do like these. So for me, I'm probably going to end up using the DJI Zoom a little more often than I will the Hasselblad 1 inch sensor Pro version of the Mavic 2. If you haven't seen any of my other drone history videos, I will go ahead and link them here for you. And let me know what drone you think is best. Which would you prefer: the Zoom, or the super colorful, 1 inch Hasselblad sensor Pro version of the Mavic 2? Either way, thanks a ton for watching and for coming out here with me to see this beautiful wreck of a plane and the history behind it. And I will see you around. [Music playing]",

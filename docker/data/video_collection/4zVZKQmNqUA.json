    "transcript": "that's the thing with aliexpress. every time i go onto this site i immediately see something i want to buy without fail. i keep hearing all over the internet that, after like a year and a half it is finally safe for us to crawl out of our gamer caves and bow at the knee to the gods of pc hardware consumerism and today uh we're gonna do just that we're gonna head on to the internet and we're gonna bow hard so let's get into it now in today's video i want to focus on the pre-built market because we know that graphics card prices are down you can actually go and buy a graphics card without mortgaging your children out so that's all good things but how does that impact the pre-built market so let's uh let's have a look starting with amazon i'll just search gaming pc and uh the first one that comes up is for 450 this is a sponsored one in a case that seems like it's got ventilation now it is a prebuilt so it may be debating us and that there's actually like a bit of perspex in front of the ventilation which some companies like to do for some reason uh but this has a 10 100 in it uhd 630 graphics 8 gigs of ram 430 i mean that's quite inexpensive for a pre-built but i i would not buy this for a gaming pc it doesn't even have a gt710 in it uh there's another one by the same company allied gaming it's the same pc just in a different case and other than that it's a little bit cheaper okay this option which for a thousand two hundred and this is us dollars uh you get an 11 400 f and a 6600 which is actually not a very good price for the hardware that we have in there because remember the other day i did a video on a micro center pre-built which had a 12 400 in it so that's a newer version of that intel cpu a 6600 and it cost about 900 although if you go up the price ladder a little bit you can get a skytech ryzen 5 3600 based system with a 360 ti in it for a thousand three hundred dollars and i mean it does look pretty basic and there's not much airflow going on there uh it does say that it's got no bloatware on it which i kind of would have to see to believe to be honest viper attack oh this is an interesting configuration because it gives you a gtx 750 ti and then it's got an i5 3570 in it so this seems a little bit like it's an old dell optiplex system that they dropped in a case and then called it a day they are very vague about the internals of the system because the picture is very dark and actually that skytech system that we looked at earlier looks like a great deal compared to the strix system which does have a better cpu in it but it's just the 30 60 16 gigs of ram and it's one of these asus cases that is not great for ventilation and stuff and it's more it says here here everything i'm assuming that's talking about fan noise there and back in the dark times uh someone asked does this have the capped gpu or does it mind full power so does it have an lhr gpu in it or not and batman responded saying it has full power so you know that answer is true because it's batman oh wow look at this system allied gaming moab behemoth pc first off amazing name the case looks spectacular it's at like a 45 degree angle and it looks all futuristic although i don't think the airflow situation is very promising there does seem to be some ventilation on the top of the system let's go over to newegg and see what they're doing we'll only look at new egg for a little bit because you know there is some drama around them i don't know i don't know if we still remember the drama but yeah we'll we'll just look at them quickly to see how it stacks up compared to uh to amazon oh they actually sell yestern waifu cards which is pretty cool you can get some uh graphics card waifu buba action on newegg now you don't have to go to aliexpress but we will look at aliexpress in a bit and here you're getting again a 10700 f which is a two generation old cpu at this point it's not a terrible cpu i mean you're getting eight cores and 16 threads but ah it is an older cpu and an rtx 3070 which is decent for about a thousand five hundred dollars which this these pcs seem like they're a better deal than the ones on amazon but i don't know if these prices are are really getting me too hot and bothered here oh you can get a terrible msi pre-built with a 30 60 in it and a 5600 x for about a thousand two hundred dollars it is on sale although you definitely shouldn't buy this system because it's immediately gonna start blue screening although actually it is weirdly positive reviews this is the most confused review ever they're saying good build but gpu was doa so the pc didn't work when it arrived uh but actually other than that it's pretty good i'm pretty happy with it the pros the components were very high quality and obviously built professionally massive hardware upgrade for my old rig cons there is no ssd so don't go looking for one upon inspection there's an integrated device that appears to act like an ssd but the system i i think they're confused about there being a partition that kind of splits the drive up i think that's what's going on here a computer is as advertised i've grown to love the operating system windows 10 but it's actually windows 11. and an os i distrust immensely i feel you on that austin let's go look at micro center actually micro center board of scandal site power spec oh these are all shippable items let's go to an actual shop here is a power spec system with a 12700 kf in it we've got an rtx 3070 ti 32 gigs of ram wow they give you a lot of ram with this system and a terabyte oh that case also looks pretty nice lots of airflow in the front and it'll look like that inside that is quite a dark picture micro center but i've had some experience with micro center pre-built and it was it was very well put together the reviews are also very positive so it is quite a lot of money but it is a very high-end system let's see what other options they have damn you can get an hp pavilion with the 3060 in it for 850 let's actually see what is an rtx 3060 going for on microcenter's side you can get them for about 430 dollars the thing is now that gpu prices are coming down these prebuilts are looking much less compelling uh because you know we don't need to desperately crawl to them begging for a gpu anymore uh so yeah i mean let's see best buy and then after best buy we'll look at some non-us sites oh there's a new version of the hp omen out hp uh what are you doing man like they've clearly heard complaints about temperatures and airflow and stuff and their solution was oh let's just put a bit of glass in the front so that you can see that there are fans being choked out behind it that's not gonna help why what is the point of changing the case design yeah what whatever that's that's very disappointing but we're getting a 12 400 f 16 gigs of ram and a 30 60 for about a thousand three hundred dollars ooh finally a system with an amd graphics card in it which these like 6600 and 6600 xt gpus are are really good options at the moment so it's nice to finally see a pre-built with one in them we've got a 5700 x okay with 16 gigs of ram and a 6600 xt for three for a thousand three hundred dollars and uh it looks like we've got airflow on the case it's not a very good looking case in my opinion but wow we've even got dual channel ram does it does it specify 16 gigs of memory it does not specify but we see it in the picture so we can complain about it officially if we don't get it this gaming pc is a good machine i play games like cod okay there you go people tell me about curries a lot in the uk okay with curries you can get an epic deal on a washing machine but we're looking for gaming gaming pc uh the first thing that shows up is a nitro 50 with a 1650 in it for about 680 pounds uh oh this is new i don't actually recognize that you've got a really pretty window that looks at your fans struggling just like the new hp system but for 2 000 pounds you are getting very restricted airflow an i7 oh it's a 12 700 okay that's good and a 3080 with a lot of ssd and 16 gigs of ram okay here's a very very expensive oem crap box it's the orion 7000 and it's got a 30 90 in it and a 12 900 k okay this this is looking better we've got a tornado r5 gaming pc uh a ryzen 5 we've got a 30 60 in it a bunch of storage this is a thousand two hundred and fifty pounds and this is including tax if i'm not mistaken the correct way to display prices then we've got some airflow okay i i can get behind this system okay let's move over to aliexpress the best pc shopping site on the internet human hair wigs um no i'm good i'm good i'm i'm fine i don't i don't want a wig oh no way i feel like i immediately have to buy this system it is a disney gaming pc from aliexpress we've got a 12 400 f in it which is a great cpu and then a 1050 ti which is a bit weird how much more is it for the 1660 oh yeah i would get the 1660 super version that's gonna be more performance for not very much more money look at the way that looks that is amazing that's the thing with aliexpress every time i go onto this site i immediately see something i want to buy without fail it's a picture of a lady that's unlocked the game that's very good for her i'm sure she's excited about it uh this is the ibsen team do they build it or is this like an esports team that they sponsor i really want to buy that uh but let's see oh here's another thing that looks amazing look at that look at this thing it's got the best looking power button i have ever seen on a gaming pc it looks like it's all power button it's got all copper thermal module aliexpress always delivers what five thousand eight hundred canadian dollars but that is dollars for a system that would have been exciting like five six years ago it's 7700k with a gtx 1080 in it it does look like a very impressive that says radian in it there's a bunch of pictures of monitors for some reason and then there's a there's that what what pc are you getting here this is like they it looks like they just googled pictures of gaming pcs and used all of them in their marketing material what is happening what is this one that one looks really cool it does look like it's gonna catch on fire but how do we know what we're getting now when it comes to ibsen gaming systems their price to performance has stayed surprisingly steady over the last year and a half because earlier in the year when i bought one of these ibsen systems for a video it was about the same price and instead of the 6600 xt you were getting a 30 60. so this should give you a bit more gaming performance actually and you know it's not too bad it looks quite plain on the inside and i immediately see a problem uh this may come only with a single stick of ram which oh no yeah that's not a great looking interior of the system oh this this picture has got two sticks in it can we get a better indication 16 gigs it doesn't specify the the the configuration though and i think on that roller coaster of emotions that is aliexpress pre-built shopping i think it's a good place to end the video so thank you very much for watching i will not be uploading for the next two weeks because anna's sister is getting married and i'm going to to uk town to go and be there for the wedding um i will also be buying a pc there and doing a video on a uk pc uh so subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss that if you want some more david content in your life over the next two weeks just watch the backlog there's so many videos to choose from and yeah thank you for watching and until two weeks from now bye",

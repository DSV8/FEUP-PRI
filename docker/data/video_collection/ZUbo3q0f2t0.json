    "transcript": "- Hey guys, Jonathan here in the tech insanity! The lack of sleep continues. Apple closed out October with a bang, droppin' new iPad Pros, new Mac Minis, which I am hyped for, and then what we're talking about right now, new MacBook Airs. Now I swear, I've really, really tried to avoid using truth in the title of my videos lately, a ton of people do it, I guess that's it's click-baity, but I also think people have the wrong idea with this new MacBook Air and I want to explain why. For starters, I see a ton of comments saying, \"Hey, Tim! Where is that rumored 7, 8, $900 mythical budget MacBook, this MacBook Air is $1200, what the heck is going on?\" This MacBook Air was not intended to be that budget MacBook, like, ever. I've said it all year long where I've felt the 13 inch MacBook Pro without touch bar, didn't really make sense in the lineup, it would've made more sense is if Apple updated 13 inch MacBook Air, or replaced that, which is pretty much exactly what they did. If you recall, the previous 13 inch MacBook Air was around that $1200 price point, but it came with a trash display, and no, I'm not just talking about resolution, I am talking the actual display. The panel, like, it was just pure hot garbage. So what we have now is a much, much better display with a higher resolution, retna 2560 by 1600 display. You have three color options now. Silver, space gray, and then finally gold, which actually is different than the MacBook Pro. Breaking news... Poppy Harlow just ruinin' my day. We can't go six minutes without an Apple controversy. Apparently, there's a report on Mac rumors that the new MacBook Air is only used at a five watt chip and people are freaking the (drum bang) out. All I'm going to say, is please, can we just get these devices in hand, use them, test them before we freak out. So yes, with those chips you have a dual core processor with a base clock speed of 1.6 GHZ with a turbo up to 3.6 Whether it hits those turbo speeds is a different conversation for a different day, but you gotta remember the 13 inch MacBook Pro without touch bar, was also a dual core machine. Now one advantage of that five watt chip is gonna be lower power consumption, lower heat, better battery life and that's something Apple actually bragged about with this MacBook Air. Honesty, I think someone who is picking up a MacBook Air wants great battery life, they don't want it running hot and burning the crap outta their thighs. You are not buying a MacBook Air to render 8K raw footage, and again, before you freak out and read the (spleck noise) let's just these things and remember that it comes down to optimization before anything else. Beyond the controversy though, you are getting two full fledged thunderbolt three ports, not USBC like on a 12 inch MacBook, so essentially, this MacBook Air is kinda like a MacBook Pro Jr. For real though, I know it sounds silly, but Apple went with the MacBook Air name, because people want a MacBook Air. Some people don't want the MacBook Pro, some people don't want the MacBook, even though the 12 inch model is super light weight and portable, it is that MacBook Air name that makes people feel warm and fuzzy inside. It's totally a subconscious thing, but hearing Air, kinda makes you assume that hey, my laptop is light weight, it's portable, it's lighter than air, and there's also a little bit of nostalgia going back to what Steve Jobs pulled out of that envelope many years ago. Now what's also new is touch ID. It's nowhere near as fancy looking as the touch bar models, but it's nice that it's here and it really rounds out these laptops. From there, storage wise, you can go up to a crazy 1.5 terabytes on a MacBook Air, which I don't think anybody should do. It's just like completely overkill. With that kind of money, bump yourself up to a MacBook Pro, get some better specs, some better performance, and use the MacBook Air like it should be used. Lastly, these new MacBook Airs go all the way up to 16 gigawatts and yes, there definitely is already some controversy with these five watt chips, but, that aside, I think they look very promising and I'm super excited to get em in hand, and test these guys out. With that said, definitely feel free to subscribe here at 54 Review and drop a like if you're enjoying this continued tech madness. More videos are yet to come, the new iPad Pros, the new Mac Mini, which I am hyped for! Like, Viper hyped! - Aww man! - Anyways, Jonathan here, and I will catch you guys later.",

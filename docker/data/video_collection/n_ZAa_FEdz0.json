    "transcript": "- What could you possibly upgrade for the kind of person who already has one of these, one of these, a setup like this, and even blows money on a, is this a BMW wheel for your racing sim? - [Jake] Yeah. - [Linus] That was almost certainly taken from work. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - It's time for Jake's Intel Extreme Tech upgrade and well, it looks like he came up with some stuff. Man, you have expensive taste. - [Jake] What do you mean? - [Linus] What do you mean? What do I mean? - I bought things used. - How much was this? The Fanatec ClubSport Shifter SQ. - It's probably like $300 US. - $300 Shifter! Doesn't even go in a real car. (Jake laughing) We're going to have some fun. (Jake laughing) (intro techno music) - You're not my real dad! - What's wrong with this one? - I don't know if I really have an answer. It's like, fine. - I think the answer is Intel sponsored this video and gave him a $5,000 budget. - Yeah. - Oh, it's fancy. Here's your steering wheel back. What are we doing here? - Well, I spent a lot of my money on audio. Oh, I'd love to do that. One of those things downstairs. Why don't we carry that upstairs, first. - Oh, good. Let's play my favorite game. Stolen. - [Jake] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Stolen. - Hey I get to recant, rebuttal, point at something from the office here, huh? - I like this game. I bought that from Luke. So maybe it is from the office. - No, it's not. This is almost certain. - No, I actually bought one. I swear to God, I bought one. I will show you the receipt. - Okay, nothing so far. I mean, other than what I found already. - What did you find already? - The giant one terabyte thumb drive. - I brought that just for this video. - And there's no way you bought those cable ties. - Which one? Oh yeah, definitely not. Well, don't go down there. - Well, I thought we're getting a subwoofer. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah sure. - Don't go down there. Oh, stay out of my house. - [Jake] All this down here is a litter box. - [Linus] What am I even looking at here? - It's a Litter-Robot. It just spins. - Wait, what? - And then there's a sieve there, you see? - Yeah. - So the litter goes into the sieve and then the poop stays on the other side. - Oh, yeah there. - And then it dumps it into the bottom. - What's one of these worth? - It's like 700 bucks. - What? A $700 motion sensor and motor. - Yeah, I think it's patented. He's like, what the hell's going on with my poop? - [Linus] Yep. - [Jake] Don't look at the auto feeder either. Don't look at that. Let's go back upstairs. - How much was the auto feeder? - I think it was only like a hundred bucks. To be fair, there was a reason for that. - Well, yeah, your cat was fat. - Yeah, that wasn't the reason, but. - That's a whole, that's the reason. - Well, he's lighter now. Pick him up. - Oh, I don't know if I would describe him as thin. I think he's still a pretty thin boy. Does he get hold on his back? Do you guys do that? (cat meowing) (Linus exclaiming) That's a big fat no. - I don't think he knows you that well yet. - Oh my God. - So this is the same. - Is this for your computer? - Yeah. - Why? - Why? Yes, what he said. Neighbors are going to hate you. (Jake laughing) - No, my office is like on the side that there's nobody. - Oh, buddy thought of that. (Jake laughing) I like the way he did. - The other sub is not. (Jake laughing) I'd be pretty stoked if you did the computer. - I like doing computer. - Look at it, it's so clean. - Where? Oh my, ew, oh, ew, ew, I thought that was grey. Oh! - Do you see how much came off when I pulled this off? - Yeah, I did, yeah, I did. Okay. - I swear I vacuum it regularly. - I swear you're full of. - Look at the art, isn't that pretty? - This is pretty. - My friend Douglas drew that. - Really? - Shout out the architects garage. - This is Jake's car. - You can't drive that. It's a painting. - Hey! I mean, he can drive a two dimensional car just fine, David. - Yes, exactly. - Hey, actually, speaking of which, one of these predators is definitely from work. - Yeah, I bought it from work. (Linus exclaiming) Actually, both of them are from work. - That is literally what they all say. All right, I'm going to build a computer. - I think you should do it downstairs. - I'm going to build a computer right here. - Well, 'cause I got to do stuff in here. - You got to do stuff in. What the hell are you doing in here? - Well, we got to hang up the speakers. I paid 200 bucks for them on Craigslist, and I think they usually sell for like 600. So I was pretty stoked about that. - Used speakers is the way to go. - Yes, used audio, everything, just by used. Headphones, I can understand. Oh my God, you're wrapped around the $2000 headphones. Oh God. How did that even happen? What? Oh, oh my God. That's under a lot of tension actually. God, leave your brother alone. Did I tell you how you have to water cool it? - I noticed. - And change the motherboard and CPU and RAM. - Okay. - This thing runs at like 90 degrees. - Yeah. - Sometimes I restart my computer and it says, like CPU overheat warning. - This is not going to improve the situation, but this is. - But that will, okay. Jake's upgrade is actually pretty straightforward then. He's already got an RTX 3080, so we're not going to be changing out his GPU. - Yeah. - Already got a great power supply, good quality case, that just needs a (Linus clearing throat) little cleaning. So we're going platform upgrade, from this 5900X. We're going to a 13900K, arguably the fastest gaming CPU on the planet. 32 gigs of DDR5 memory, and, wow! (Jake laughing) - Oh, I'm sorry. Did you just buy a motherboard that costs as much as your last CPU memory combo? - I think it costs more than the new CPU even. To be fair, I asked for like a Z790-E or F, and then they sent this. So thanks Asus, for the free upgrade, and Intel, for the free upgrade. - Yeah, does that count against your budget? How does that work? - I'm not asking questions. I think I will make your life a bit easier. You can use. - There's a first time for everything. Yay! - It's, I feel like it's usually the other way around. Anyways, you can use the stock fans that are in here. You think the K ones are better? - I have to have a look at them. You know what's really funny is I saw, I forget who it was, but someone just announced a fan, and they're like, yeah, it's really optimized for pressure on radiators, because there's no random gaps around the frame. So it like really pushes all the thing through. And it brought me back to, I swear to you, like 10 years ago, when Corsair released their first AIOs, and their fans had these gaps around the frame. And I did this masking tape mod, where you just like cover the gaps, and it lowered temps by like a degree or two. And I'm sitting here going, who is designing radiator fans that have gaps around the frames? And people have still been doing it for 10 years. - Yeah, yeah. - Drives me crazy. These do not have gaps around the frames though. These look like they will actually mate properly with the radiator. So I'm kind of tempted to put these in. - Okay. I mean, it's your wiring nightmare. - I know you feel like you're helping, but taking the box that contained all the water cooling parts. - No, I wanted to make a mess, yeah. - And blowing it up all over the counter, was not actually helpful. - Well, that was like the goal. (items thudding) - Thanks. - Got 'em. - This is no longer secure. (Linus laughing) And that is why. - Oh my God. - An LGA socket is not a bad thing to have. I mean, the good news is the dust filters are clearly working, look at this. This thing's clean. - I started putting the cooler brackets on, but then I remembered I have the, this thing. - Ooh, the contact frame. - The contact frame. I figure for 20 bucks, I might as well just throw it on there. - That's worth a couple degrees. By the time you're going custom water cooling, if you're not using the best thermal compound or picking up one of these contact frames, which the functions right in the name, it helps the cooler make better contact with the CPU. You're kind of not doing it right. - Mind you, you shouldn't have to buy these. - No! - But. - That's dumb! - We're doing it. - But here we are. - Oh, this replaces the top of the socket, which is, I don't know how much I like this contact framing that you have to take all this off, but don't over tighten it when you put it back on. - This is a really, really sensitive operation. You do not want to drop a screw or anything like that in this land grid array case. - Oh, you know what I should do is. - Yeah, put the CPU in there. So you have to be able to hold it down while also screwing it in. And as soon as you put down the one side, it kind of springs up the other side. This very much voids the warranty on your motherboard and CPU. If you tell them you used it though, just so you know. - Oh! Oh Jesus, that's tight. There we go. - Question for you, Jake. I'm about to mount the radiator. Yes, I know, I know you want it in the front, but do you want the fans in front of the rad or do you want the fans behind the rad? - I vote front, it's got a fan filter. - Okay. I might need a hand getting these in here then. - What are you, you? - So basically. - Oh, I see what you're doing. - Yeah, I got to hold them mushed. So if you can grab those cables, and then if we can pull this across. - Hold on, let me tuck the cables into that cable management. - I just want to get this first one. - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold, hold. - How you doing? How you doing? How you doing? - This is definitely not the absolute fastest RAM I could put on this board, but it is 6,000 CL32, so it's pretty quick. - Oh wow! - It was the same price as CL 46,000. It was on sale. So it was like 230 or 240 bucks US. - Wow. - So yeah, goodbye. - You want to throw me that board? - Are you ready for that? I think we should. - Actually, no. - We should put this in first. - No, I want to put the fans in the top and the back first. - No, I don't want to put tin fans on the top. - Why don't you want fans in the top? - Just the back is fine. - What? No, I don't want. - I don't want top fans. - Yeah, no, it'll look fine. - But they're like. - I know, but they'll be somewhere else. - I'd rather you put that black knock to a fan. Will it fit? - No. - Oh, it, that's a negatory. Wait, I have more EK fans, RGB fans. I have an AIO as well. - [Linus] Oh! - [Jake] Yeah. - [Linus] Sold. - Just go grab that, it's upstairs. - [Linus] All right. - [Jake] It's in the closet. Should I warm out the speakers? - Let's go have a look at it. - Okay. - So do, are they, is it like an angled mount? - Like yeah. I would probably go further over. - Oh, you want to go like to the corner corner? - Is that, how far they stick off the wall? They're huge. What about today's video? We got thick boys. - What about like just lay it sideways on the desk? You might have to bring the monitor up a bit, but. - I am not going to lie. I hate the aesthetic of a blind flat monitor. But if you're into it. And. - Fits perfect. - It kind of fits perfect. - And look, we have this cool thing. So this company's called Sonarworks and they make, what does that look like? - I don't know, like a fancy thermometer, some kind of probe. Oh, it's microphone. - Yeah, it's a correction microphone. So usually when you have computer speakers, you can't really room correct them, unless you buy like a home theater receiver and use that. But you don't want a home theater receiver. They're huge and they use a lot of power. So this company makes a piece of software. You hook up this mic, you measure your computer speakers, and it makes a correction profile for them. - Oh, that's cool. - Yeah, and they have headphone correction profiles too. - All right. Are we going to go, are we going to go this route then? - I think this is the way to go. Slight problem with that plan. I have a new monitor for the side and it's bigger. - You know what though? I already volunteered for downstairs work on the computer duty, so that sounds like a huge problem. (Jake sneezing) We moved the computer, so now there's so much dust in the room. Oh, hold on, hold on. - You're not allowed to go in there. - I'm not allowed in there, because, this is where you keep all the big stuff you took from the office. - You said I could borrow that. - Yeah, I said you could borrow it. That was like two years ago. - And look, you have one at your house too. - I steal more from the office than anyone. - Yes, oh, my God, it's here. (Linus laughing) - Hey Rippy. It's a thick boy. - It's going to do many webs though. It's nothing like a 12 inch high excursion driver as a footrest. (Linus laughing) That's ergonomic. - On the one hand, Kate, you can count on Jake, to put like tons of research into everything he buys. But on the other hand, it's like individual research into that individual item. The amount of thought into how it all goes together tends to be a little. - Look. - More scattered. - RCA Splitter. All right. This monitor's pretty sick. It's, DVI. - Woo! - But it does work. I have DVI to display port. - I think by sick you mean ill. - Yeah. - Oh, this is stolen from the office. - What? - Actually, no this isn't. - No, it's not. - Nope. - This is NH-D9L. It's almost certainly stolen from the office though. - Oh yeah, a hundred percent. - There's the asset tag. This is definitely stolen from the office. - Yeah. - I no longer care, because I don't want these things to appear on camera. - I think you told me to take that one home. - And a second I fix it kit. - That one is probably from the office. - Well, I don't think you're the worst. - You missed the NAS in the garage. - Oh my God. - It's the garage heater. - No, I do not like to be licked by dogs. - Ripley go. - No. - Go please, go. - Oh, don't get the camera lens. He's like. - Why do I always end up under people's desks? I couldn't help noticing that. You could use some of our upcoming magnetic cable management for your keyworrd. - Yeah. Keyword, keyword upcoming. - This monitor is a bit overkill as a side monitor. Hello Ripley. It's 165 Hertz IPS. I think it's displayed share 400. Yeah, totally is. And this is my side monitor. - What? This is for Twitch Chat. - But they have gotten so cheap. This is like a $400 monitor Canadian. - Yeah. - On sale. - That's like 300 real dollars. - Yeah. Hey, can you, can you help? - What? Oh, well I am helping. I'm jamming your sub under the couch. (item thudding) - Okay. Oh, mint. I like these mounts a lot. I think it's going to have to go up a bit. - Yeah. - I don't know if the other one can even, so, it's not enough. It's like all the way up, and it's still not. - It's good enough for the video. - Why did you pee in the house? No, that's bad. - Jake's dog had an accident. So I'm on my own in here right now. This surround sound set up has got to be for the sim chair. You're going to have two giant subwoofers in this room, Jake. What the hell, man? - You're not my real dad. - I didn't know Logitech even still makes these 5.1 gigs. - Guess how much I paid for this? It's used but brand new. It was a hundred bucks. - What? - Yeah! I think it's usually four or 500. - Yeah. - And they're not amazing. They're not going to sound anywhere as good as those calf speakers, but they're also pretty good, especially for a racing sim. - Yeah, if what you want is directional audio. - Yeah. Hey, look in this box. You're never going to guess where all these cables are from. - Wow. It's from infinite cables. - Yeah! Infinite cable. - What a surprise. Jake never shills for infinite cables. - Look, they make great products, okay. But this is pretty cool. Active optical display port to run to this monitor. I was using a long normal cable. - [Linus] Yeah. - [Jake] And it was not. - It's flaky. No, it wouldn't run. - It's flaky. - It couldn't run the full res. - Couldn't help noticing that this is a really long cable to go from there to there. - Yeah, I was, just trying to future proof it. - The thing about optical cables is that most of the cost is in the transceiver. - Yeah. - This is cheap. This is expensive. So the cost difference between a hundred foot one and a 25 foot one is actually pretty close. - It's like 20 bucks. - Yeah. - This is 50 foot. And the 25, I think was $10 less. - I'm sorry, Jake, you gave me two RCAs. Do you want the red one or the white one to plug in the sub? - Both of them. You're not using the LFE, you're using. - Oh, that's right. I always see that on subwoofers. I'm like, who would plug this into a subwoofer? You get the sub out. - It's when you have a two channel deck that doesn't have the sub-channel. So I'm using an RCA splitter. One channel will go in there, and the other one there. And then the other cable goes to the speaker amp and this goes to the sub. It's cheat-y, but it should still sound fine. Oh God, okay, everything's plugged in. You got to see the wiring behind. - [Linus] Oh! - [Jake] It's. - No! - It's a spicy salami, I will say. - Even with banana plugs, that looks like a disaster. - Well, it's 'cause of the splitter, right? To demo this audio, we need a computer. - Yeah. Oh, I guess we should work on the computer then. - Yeah. - Jake-y, I solved it. - I'm going to put those behind my desk. - Yeah! - I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't? I don't know. You have surround speaker stands and you're sitting here going, I don't know, I'm going to put my surround sound in. - Oh, on the racing sim? - Yeah! - That's actually moderately intelligent. - This was literally sitting on your porch. - Yeah and the fronts are easy, 'cause I can like three different mount for the monitor. This case is actually going to be like filled up. We'll have a reason to have bought the 5,000. - Ooh, we need to make sure there's clearance for the GPU. - Yeah. - We've definitely run into that before. You want to pull that going to go. - That's not a super long GPU. Oh, fudge. - Yeah, well, we're going to make sure. - Oh, wait. - Wow. - Brother. - Wow, how many- - Raise the, how many millimeters you got there? - I don't know, but I'm not buying a 4090, that's for sure. - No, you can't raise that bracket. It needs to go here or nowhere else, that's it. Yep, perfect. - What even is that power cable? It's, I just have a barrel jack just chilling here. I have no, oh, it's for my headphone amp. This is actually a new product from JDS Labs. The Element three boosted, so it has twice the power of the previous Element three. It's a Dak amp combo. So you plug your USB in, you plug your power in, and it's going to convert the digital signals to analog signals and then amplify them, so you can listen on fancy headphones that need lots of power. Fortunately it uses the same cables as my old amp and the same power supply, so I don't have to change any of that. Ooh, look at that. This thing is, this is a lot nicer than the one I had. Hold the knob, David. Experience the knob. Shift. It feels pretty nice. - That's pretty cool, yeah, that's pretty neat. Thanks. - The nice thing about this one too, is I don't have to have a separate USB cable. I can actually hook this right into the wheel base. - [Linus] Oh! - Which is kind of nice. Previously I had USB cable for this, USB cable for this, and USB cable for the pedals. And now I'll be down to two, which is nice. Hey, the holes do line up, sick. - Can I pass this to you? - Which one? - Through the back? - Oh yeah, probably. - And then I need it here, where my finger is. - Ooh! - Well it can be any one of the fans, 'cause they're just going to all daisy chain together and go onto one of these RGB headers. - Right. - So maybe this one would be easier. - Wait, you put. I swear to God, take them out. I don't want top fans. - I don't know what you're talking about. - God dude. Can't take you out. Okay, let me see at least, can't. - Okay, fine, whatever. (Linus laughing) I mean, okay, I guess it's technically a win. - Life is all about utterly meaningless victories, Jake. I'm just going to start making some executive decisions in terms of. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. Executive decisions. - Hold on, I think it's, I think it's good. - What in the. - Look, look, hold on, hold on. Just, just chill for a second. The problem is we got a lot of fitting density over here, so I'm kind of thinking out to here, out to here. Over to here. - That to that. - That's exactly what I said. - That's what you said, okay, cool. See, you there, you're there. You're on it. (Linus laughing) He knows what he's doing. - I love having my ideas repeated to me. I think I got a defective screw. This screw just snapped off right in the thing. And then another one is not going in. - Are you silly goose? Are they not long enough? - No, they're long enough. I don't know what's happening here. - You're the silly goose. - No, I don't think I'm a silly goose. - You're a goose man. - I mean, goose maybe, silly no. - Serious goose. - I'm the serious dis goose. - What the- - Did you just do the same thing on another screw? - Hell is going on. No, it just. - Are you wrecking my rad man? - It just won't go in. - It's righty tight-y, lefty loosey. - Yeah. (Jake laughing) - I know. - You tell him, David. Man, even that one, did you try to put them one in both of these? - No, the top one, yeah. - The bottom one you didn't. - I don't think so. - [David] I did not crossroad that. - I don't get it. They're just not going in, Jake. - Yeah, you're right. - Are you just going for it? - Yeah. - Okay, hopefully it doesn't snap off again. - I think I have better. Oh, okay, it's in. - Okay then as long as we can get one more in, it's fine. We're not shipping the thing, but. - Please don't break screw. I love you, here mate. - I'm not going to lie, Jake. I'm not super into the color of your coolant here. - It's a little bit pee color. - Oh yeah, I didn't show the finished belt. There it is. 13900K, 3080, water cooling done. It's not the finest water loop ever, but. - That's all right. Price was right. - I don't really care what it looks like at all. I just want it to perform well. - Oh yeah, for sure. That's, that's why you were all upset about the non-matching fans. And, no, I don't want to put the top fans. I don't really care how it looks like at all. I just, it just needs to be exactly the way I like it. - It just needs to be matched, 'cause like OCD, you know. - Wait a second. Are we filling a watered loop or are we enjoying a refreshing Caprisun juice beverage? What is this? - A little bit of both. - A fill bag. - Hey, it doesn't look that yellow. Yeah, it's going to look pretty yellow. - Wish me luck. - Oh my God. No, do it from here. - You got some, are you getting there? - Oh, come on try. - No, no, I got it. - Oh dude. Oh my God, oh my God. - Hold on, hold on. I am not going to get- - Sideways, okay all right, actually fair. I would like to see you pour washer fluid. It's yellow. - I want to watch you pour washer fluid. (Jake laughing) - Told you I'm a car guy. You know of all the people I would trust to do this. It's you, because I always know you can buy me a new motherboard. - It's true. (Linus laughing) - Not because you think I'll pour out. - Ah, look at that. Ah, this is a lot of RGB. - Look how happy he is about the fans that are in the top. - I don't, I don't really care about those ones. I just mean I've never had this much RGB in my computer before. - This looks amazing. - Yeah, it looks dope. - Okay, this is, this is a pretty, pretty good looking machine. - Oh, I like the way, you put a clear cap on that. - Yeah, that's. - Although the metal fittings look a little, I don't know. - No, I like it. I like it, I wish they were black, but. - Yeah, that's what I mean. I wish all of these were black. - Oh, I see I see. - And look, it doesn't really look that pee with the RGB. - You're right, okay. - This still looks like pee though. - That looks like a pee bag. I don't even know if I should point this out to you. - Is the bottom van not spinning? - Because, no, oh, it's spinning. (Linus laughing) That ain't the problem. But you can't miss align the sticker. - Oh my God. (Linus laughing) That's awful. That's actually really bad. - What a stupid tiny, utterly meaningless defect. But don't worry, it's okay. Because he doesn't care what the computer looks like. - Maybe I'll get Dan to fix it. - Why do I enjoy it so much, when I know that things bother Jake? Oh, I know, because he enjoys it just as much, when things bother me. - He's not wrong. - Jake, your setup is ridiculous. - What? - You have an audio interface just on the floor next to your leg thing. Your subwoofer is sitting on a piece of particle board. The cables under here, are probably the worst I've ever seen. - What it what? What's bad about them? (laughing) What is the problem? Like there's too many of them? - Oh, God. - I just genuinely don't understand. These were managed and zap zip tied, like cable tied nicely. And then I started taking stuff apart to remove some of the old stuff last week. That's why the cables were hanging down. - Knock knock. - Who's there? - What kind of cable ties do you have for an extreme tech upgrade? Xtreme cable ties. This is not the worst thing I've ever done. Oh no. - How bad is this going to be? Am I going to not like it? - Pretty good. It'll be good. - Pretty good? - It occurs to me that with the amount of footage we've shot today, there's going to be one hell of a float plane behind the scenes with all the extra footage. So, go subscribe over on floatplane.com, if you want. Basically this, but a lot more of it. - Oh, that's nice. Good job Linus. - Oh yeah, that's fine. But we just want to try it, right? - Yeah, sure. - I'll 3D print something in like three years. Hey, it works! - Nice. - Yes, new CPU installed. That's understandable. - Okay, this is, this is, I mean, they're on. (Linus laughing) - Hey, guess what? Now you have to wire them all. Oh my God. I think it's huge. I think, no, no, don't tape that thing. Just leave it on top of the sub, seriously. Do you want to get licked by a dog? - Okay all right, all right, all right, all right. - Stepping in the pee, move the thing. - That explains why my sock is wet. - No! God! - Oh my God. Those are so cute. And they're all cat's ones. - Okay, but I got three, that kind of match, four is an odd number. I was thinking maybe you wanted to take one. - These are so cute. - I want to keep these three. I was thinking you take that one. - Where? What are these from? Who's done these? - On society something Society6. - Oh that's, that's super cute. I will take you up on that. - Yay, runs a 2.5 gig. - Nice, 2.5 gig is such a game changer. - Yeah, I don't. - And no, you don't need 10 gig. - No. - I can't say I'm a huge fan of how you have that speaker sitting there. - Which one? One that looks like almost falling off the desk? - Which one? Yeah, the one that's hanging off the desk. - Oh my God. - Oh my God, what was that? What are you doing? - I played the test. - Here, do it again. Do it again. - I'm going to turn it way down. - Oh, sorry David. - That's really balanced audio. - [Audio] Left, right. - That's what that was? - [Audio] Left, right. - There, you want to hear it again? - Okay. - That's a, that's sub does webs. Oh, I turned it down to like minus 40. - Oh! - Oh! What? What? - I forgot about the sub. I was so busy listening to the stereo speakers. I was like, um, you sound okay. - Then came in there. (both laughing) - Just give it a sec. - This is so dumb. - I know, it's great, right? - I mean, you put a theater sub at your desk. - These have the same amp as the ones that are in your theater. - I know that. Let's try the racing sim. All right, what game am I playing? - Assetto Corsa. - So this is very sim-my hey. - Yeah. - Boy, oh, you're not even allowed to run over those little things. Why, I thought the, I thought this. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell is happening here? Why are there things in the middle of the road, Jake? - What? - What is this? - You got to enter the track. Sounds good, eh? - Yeah, sounds great. And that torque on this wheel, Jake. Is it? - It must be better with more torque. - Oh yeah. Oh, oh, wow. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - That eight is good. - Oh, oh. - Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down. - I don't know the track. - Jake, I don't know the rack. - Why do you always crash at the same spot? - Oh my God. I've never driven this car in this game, but. Oh! My God! (Linus laughing) - Oh, he's got it. He's got it. Unlike most extreme tech upgrades, I can't really say that I see the difference. If anything, it's kind of messier in some ways. - But a lot of money was spent. - Yeah. - And the experience, racing sim surround sound, pretty good. New shifter, pretty good. - It may not be cable managed, but my boy here doesn't seem to care much because this setup looks like an absolute blast. You're definitely going to want to do something about the- - Oh, that one's falling off stickers here. - But that sounds like a problem for another day. In the meantime, thank you Intel, for one of the, maybe not cleanest looking, but certainly most interesting extreme tech upgrades.

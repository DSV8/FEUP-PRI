    "transcript": "I finally have an AC unit so temperature controlled environment invites some case temperature testing one might say quarantine hair yellow good people I'm Dimitri and what we have here on the review table is the be quiet pure base 500DX we saw this case CES and I gotta say what they've done here is both competitive affordable and I'm hoping more companies follow and what be quiet is doing here the 500DX is basically an airflow iteration of the pure base 500 you can check out that review over here but the guts remain identical with a few exterior changes that make this a very competitive and an airflow excellent enclosure so now that we find ourselves in a temperature controlled environment I want to do some airflow testing both move some fans around add some fans and see what is the most optimal fan configuration for an airflow focused enclosure like the 500DX with my airflow system configuration and the reason why I think this testing will apply not only to the 500DX but many other cases in 2020 is because many brands are choosing the whole front mesh panel and including quality fans so the 500DX for example comes with 3 140 millimeter pure wings 2 fans which spin at 900 rpm don't worry about the lower rpm because the larger fan does move more air and having non-restrictive front intake it gives us fantastic intake and also the 900 rpm gives us that whole peak quiet operation which they're obviously known for so in this video let's test out 7 different fan configuration options all using 140 more fans just so that we can utilize what is already included with the 500DX and see what fan configuration is best right after this the X299 CLX from asrock is the best place to house your new core X processor it features aluminum alloy heat sinks with dr. Mazda 13 phase power design for the best overclocking experience it also has Wi-Fi 6 support 3m 2 slots along with reinforced PCI brackets learn more down below alright so before we get into the air flow testing let's quickly recap what is new on the 500DX so see the front panel mesh is new we have quite high density of the holes in both the left and right side with that a RGB strip in the middle and I do find their illumination implementation inside this enclosure quite tasteful plus we have an internal RGB strip inside the case that is not visible when the side panel is on and it does help to illuminate whatever is in the top section on the case and it does actually spill to the bottom all the way through the glass creating this like pretty cool line at the bottom I also really like how it illuminates the power supply shroud corner so it helps to separate the internal sections I think it looks quite nice obviously you can change the color and modes of this a RGB strip with a button up top and here we also find a type c connection only a single USB 3 port and i really do not like this pattern and this direction that many case brands are now doing now the good thing about the front panel is that we have pegs instead of wires that connect the main panel to the contacts on the chassis but it's really difficult to remove this thing and one more thing when reinstalling the panel make sure all three pegs are making contact with that frame because otherwise this front illumination will not light up so behind this front mesh we have a dust filter spanning the entire portion of that intake and we also have a bottom dust filter removal from the front without the need to remove the front panel first nice the glass panel is attached with the regular thumb screws and the rubber bits on the frame stay with the frame they're glued there and they don't fall out when you remove the glass panel which was the case with a dark base series as for the top panel we no longer have the closed off section that we only have the mesh magnetic plate and behind it you can install dual 140 s or 120 s and their respective radiators as for airflow at the front you can do triple 120 s or dual 140 mm fans with their respective radiators too as for the interior nothing has changed here ATX motherboards support a perforated power supply shroud doula says these beside the motherboard and this nice little cable covered heids whatever is exiting from the back and the right side panel has some noise dampening form applied to it that helps to compress some of the cables and just really dampen whatever is exiting through the right side of the case I don't really have anything else new to say about the 500DX so now let's begin the airflow experiment I kept the room at 22 degrees Celsius I have this thermal meter with dual temperature probes one that kept on the outside of the case to measure ambient temperature just to make sure that my control point was on point and correct and fluctuations for that temperature probe was only 0.1 degrees Celsius I'm very happy about that and the second probe I kept right above the VRMs on the motherboard just to see if a hot pocket would accumulate there and if you add more fans or remove fans what will happen to that space so first let's establish a reference point with our default fan configuration out of stock cooling here we have 74 degrees Celsius and 78 degrees Celsius on GPU and CPU respectively these are pretty decent temps and that front panel is not a massive bottleneck for air flow so we only drop one degree Celsius on the GPU and two degrees on the CPU but that front mesh removed now removing the dust filter as well so we have totally unrestricted intake we do drop slightly on the CPU but the GPU remains the same 73 and 73 and the really interesting thing about the noise profile with a dust filter and the mesh removed is they do dampen this sound a little bit but it's basically like it sounds like an open and closure already which is why having lower rpm fans helps a lot this machine behind me has six fans running and it's very quiet actually the fan on my light is louder I can hear it more than the system with six fans in it so let's see if we can move some fans around and get better temperatures so the first thing I wanted to do is move the top fan to the front so both the CPU and GPU have that nice fresh column of air and as expected that fresh column of air does actually drop our CPU temperature by three degrees and only one degree on the GPU and this is without adding any fans we're just reconfiguring what is already here am i testing previously with cases like the H510 from NZXT having dual exhausts one at the top one in the rear does actually help with CPU temperature but that case has a pretty restrictive front intake whereas here it seems like that benefit of having fresh air intake and having like plenty of exhaust at the back is enough to drop our CPU temperature by a little bit and I welcome that but what if we move those front fans to top exhaust and this actually surprised me quite a bit because our CPU temperature actually increased to 79 degrees Celsius that is higher than our default control point and the GPU temperature also increased by a degree so it seems like having no intake inside the 500DX is not a good thing and having everything being exhausted isn't enough to cool whatever is being accumulated inside the enclosure I then decided to flip the top fans to intake air and a CPU temperature did drop to 78 degrees so back to our control point but the GPU actually increased in temperature I'm guessing there's just nothing to remove whatever air is being accumulated at the bottom and finally let's populate all 140 ml of fans thoughts in here having to the front to the top and one for exhaust so I kept the top fans as intake and having two front fans delivering air so there's a lot of intake happening here and both the CPU and GPU temperature has reached a 74 degree equilibrium giving us the coolest CPU temperature 74 degrees Celsius but still not too far off from the 78 degree of our control point and finally I rotated the top fans as exhaust and weirdly the CPU temperature did go back to 70 80 degrees Celsius while giving us a nice cool GPU staying at 73 now what about that internal temperature probe above the V RMS and as you can see this space is only adequately cooled when there's intake of air either from the top or the front with the good balance of temperatures when we reposition the top fan to the front but what's really interesting here with the top fan set to exhaust this area becomes really toasty because of competing airflow streams between the lateral CPU cooler and vertical top exhaust so something that should be mitigated if you rotate the CPU cooler and it seems like for this type of Tower if we don't have enough front intake GPU temperature suffer and if we don't have enough top exhaust GPU temperatures suffer again and the most interesting thing here is that if we have all fans populated the best configuration is have both top intake and front intake as well gives us better CPU and GPU temperatures at 74 degrees Celsius but the second next best configuration is to simply move that top fan to the front intake which is pretty surprising but then maybe we're encountering the law of diminishing returns of like adding too much air flow where the components are adequately cooled already out of the box for my concluding remarks this whole thing has been quite interesting being in a temperature controlled environment and playing with some variables to see what happens with our GPU and CPU temperatures and the most impressive thing is you don't need to buy any more fans simply relocating the top fan to the front will improve both GPU and CPU temps and if you really want to go all out and having the best temperatures inside this enclosure then in my testing having intake at the top is better than exhaust for the CPU and as long as you have adequate intake for the front GPU temperatures will not suffer so I hope you guys enjoyed this one I'm really interested to test this type of airflow configuration with many other airflow mesh front enclosures coming up in the future like the Phanteks P500a coming out something from Lian Li with the LANcool 2 so yeah let me know in the comments what do you think of this experiment and potentially move your friends around to see what gives you better temperatures now Dimitri thanks much for

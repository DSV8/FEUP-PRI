    "transcript": "now if you've ever watched any of my videos you'll know that the moment oled is mentioned I can't help but gush like a Boston fire hydrant but despite my massive enthusiasm for the technology there is a couple of pretty big problems with it the first one is despite prices coming down you still need to be the Sultan of brunai to afford one and that whole cost issue isn't great considering that OLED has a little bit of a Burnin problem which does call its long-term reliability into question so does that mean that buying a used one to try and get a good deal on an OLED monitor is a terrible idea well for today's video I bought the cheapest OLED monitor I could find on eBay to find [Music] out now the monitor in question is an lg27 gr 95 a 27in 1440p 2 40 HZ Beast of an OLED display which I bought off eBay for a wildly low price now there is a reason for that low price now despite this being a used OLED monitor of indeterminate age the listing also had a pretty big caveat this display does have a scratch right on the display now according to the pictures it looked fine so hopefully we don't have a display that was molded by a velociraptor at some point but um yeah it's let's open it up and see ooh apparently it's a delicate instrument which makes it sound so [Music] fancy that is very ghetty wrapped I like how they put all the cables right by the bit of box that you have to struggle to cut open but we do get a display port and an HDMI cable with it where's the power Brak oh poor little monitor what have you been reduced to just a pile of body parts stuffed in a plastic bag although I'm really glad they decided to add this baggie of Styrofoam peanuts to it I'm sure this was the difference between it's surviving the transit and it not oh no never mind it's okay we did get the power break here it is we also get the little remote with it which is very important because it doesn't have any physical buttons on it so this is what you use to switch it off and on and this also seems like it's un reasonable Condition it's pretty covered in fingerprints and stuff but again it looks perfectly serviceable this monitor hasn't been out for that long I think they've been available for I don't know about a year and a half so worst case scenario this monitor is not going to be that old this bit is metal so unsurprisingly it's held up really well although there's a bit of a scuff over here and on the other side as well so I'm guessing somebody's keyboard kind of kept bumping against that [Music] oh there it is yeah it's not that bad a few moments later oh I didn't notice that initially but the monitor absolutely got its teeth kicked in I don't know if this happened during shipping but look at that it's like curved up and there's a dent in here as well oh no oh that's not good oh If Only They had more delicate instruments stickers on the box this all could have been avoided on the bright side the massive structural damage does make this scratch seem pretty insignificant oh it just hurts my soul to look at it now I'd be shocked if this display isn't ruined but maybe by some miracle it survived its encounter with gang violence so um let's turn it on and see okay It beeped that's a good sign so one of the things kind of makes OLED the best kind of display to have its teeth kicked in like this is because it doesn't have a separate backlight that if that breaks it ruins the whole monitor these are all individually lit so I don't know maybe maybe it's okay and I mean okay is doing a lot of heavy lifting here but let's see I mean it kind of seems to to be fine what say what you will about oled's burning issues apparently these monitors can take an ass whooping whoa oh I think the battery in the no way did they not give us a battery oh no there is a battery maybe it's just dead there we go now despite the terrible things that happened to this display in shipping there aren't even dead pixels in the bent Corner even the RGB on the back still works but we're not out of the woods yet yet we still need to test for buron and some other potential issues now we're going to start off by just doing some gaming on it and as it stands I mean with this full orange screen going there doesn't seem to be any obvious burning from the previous owner and now we do get a nice curve on the edge which does help to add some immersion to our gaming uh but even up in this corner it's still very even now I will do a kind of test to look for buron a little bit later but first I just want to see kind of how the monitor feels there's no obvious issues with the Monitor and even even the scratch isn't that evident like it's something that I'd be able to live with and honestly even even with the damage like you don't really notice it I don't I don't know obviously this isn't the state you want the monitor to be in but I'm still reeling at the fact that this monitor isn't broken it's it's such a beast oh and it's just so responsive smooth and the motion rendering it's it's so difficult to not gush over these displays so when it comes to normal use with this monitor like gaming or watching videos there's no noticeable burin issues or flickering with this display I then did a Burnin test which uses several solid colors which bur intends to show up in but there was still no noticeable [Music] issue although while doing this testing I did notice these scuffs on the display coating which I couldn't clean off something which the eBay seller mentioned in the listing but I didn't realize how much of it there was on the display however it is something that I didn't notice in regular use I then whipped out my Spyder x to do some display analysis and aside from the monitor being curb stomped there was no uniformity issues at all which was really surprising now with the rest of the measurements the color accuracy wasn't quite what I'd expect from a display like this especially with orange but calibration would help with that a lot and the rest of it seems fine now about that damage I messaged the seller who is very very apologetic and promised to do a partial refund considering that the monitor was still working now as of now I don't know how much this partial refund is but I'll pin a comment down below and you'll probably see the final price I paid for it in the thumbnail not including tax and shipping although the shipping wasn't too bad at $ 37 Canadian dollar but considering the damage the monitor held up way better than I was expecting which doesn't mean we should all go out and buy damaged used oleds but this specific one turned out fine I guess let me know in the comment section down below what you thought and yeah that brings me to the end of the video the next video for sure this time is going to be the VR video I just ran into some complications so subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss that and until then bye-bye he [Music]",

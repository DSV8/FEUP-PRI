    "transcript": "look I get it picking a storage drive for your next rig can be a difficult process currently SSD prices are very respectable they've got many storage options many different speeds to consider many different prices I really this video is appropriate and I must confess that this reddit post of all things was what prompted me to create this video believe it or not some good can come from that cesspool we'll discuss that and more in this video not read it but the SSDs so here we go another one for the crash course playlist so there are two basic form factors you should keep in mind when choosing your next SSD the two and a half inch drive and the in bat to drive much smaller the former looks something like this it's usually mounted to SSD trays in modern cases though they can be placed really anywhere in a build upside down sideways duct tape behind the motherboard tray you get the point I've benefited the stylus freedom of placement it'll work with really any relatively modern motherboard boasting SATA ports I recommend SATA 2 or 3 and isn't composed of any moving parts meaning they aren't as fragile as their hard drive counterparts a few pros and cons of a 2 and a half inch SSD for one because they use the SATA interface you'll deal with higher latency 'z and lower bandwidth overall and these drawbacks result in significantly slower effective transfer rates because the SATA interface is the bottleneck typically in the realm of about 500 megabytes per second from both the reads and writes unless you have a crappy drive and then typically the writes are trash and the reads are respectable these speeds mind you are still several times faster than hard drives meaning they'll still be the preferred OS drive expect boot times in the realm of about 10 to 15 seconds depending on what you have loaded on the operating system to slower drives using the SATA interface are much cheaper than their PCI siblings so these straps should be considered in more budget oriented builds 500 gig 860 Samsung Evo's for example these are great drives by the way are only about 75 bucks each I recommend these if you aren't looking to break the bank I've linked them down below I have first-hand experience with these even the 850 Evo's were fine but these 475 or so US dollars are a steal and three you'll need to connect to external cables to these drives one SATA data cable and one state of power cable right next to its the bigger one overall just a tad more bulk added to your build but again definitely worth it if you're in the market for something relatively affordable and decent in terms of speed the next SSD form factor is MDOT - they're 22 millimeters tall and can range and basically length from 40 millimeters up to maybe 120 140 millimeters I really depends motherboards typically support all the different lengths and the height again will be almost always 22 millimeters in that - actually stands for the second generation of mini SATA hence the M in the name the form factor attaches to the computer either via pcie three and occupying up to four lanes more on that a second or say two three or usb3 the physical connector for this kind of drive looks like this right here I'll show a close-up which can be found on again most modern motherboards now a common misconception here is that since these kinds of drives use a different connector they must inherently operate a much higher or lower speeds when in reality the speeds of these drives are largely determined by the way in which data is transferred not necessarily by the form factor the diagram I mentioned earlier on reddit comes in handy here thanks to user Alex 2003 super for the original post the two technology is distinguishing em 2 drives apart are SATA and nvme we've already mentioned SATA whose accompanying drive speeds max out at around 600 megabytes per second which is why you want likely to find any SATA drive in either the MDOT two or two and a half inch form factor pledging a speed above this mark the SATA interface would literally become the bottleneck so this drive for example is a SATA MDOT to drive notice how it doesn't promote transfer speeds above 600 megabytes per second in fact on the box I don't even see it listed and it's probably because it's nothing really to be excited about if you want to pass this off as a much faster drive just don't put how fast the drive is on the box it's gonna be closer to 3,000 megabytes per second you better believe that transfer speeds gonna be on the box so that's a way you could tell that this was a SATA MDOT - just by looking at the transfer speeds you could also tell by the physical connection on the MDOT to drive say to MDOT twos are keyed twice there is an exception to this and we'll discuss that later in the video now a few pros and cons of SATA MDOT - SSDs or as follows one they're physically smaller I mean come on clearly smaller than their two and a half inch counterparts and can thus be easily installed into any compatible motherboard to the board of course has to support the hem dot to interface right but don't be just too disappointed here most boards will have at least one I mean heck even the cheapest a 324 Tyco and find on Amazon supported one more on that this video or right here and then three these drives are roughly the same price as their two and a half inch counterparts though you may actually I'm holding the wrong one this isn't MDOT to envy me drive this one right here might cost just a tad bit extra over its equivalent two and a half inch on our part but in general if I to choose between the MBA form factor and the two-and-a-half inch form factor I would choose this one simply because if I wanted to swap this out or maybe just remove it altogether I don't have to remove say my graphics card to get to the end got to drive which is that's particularly where the port is between PCIe slots it's more annoying to remove this and that's really the only reason why I'd prefer this now another kind of SSD we'll discuss in this video is the nvme SSD now I can hold this thing this is actually from Team Group it's very fast but also fairly expensive nvme stands for a non-volatile memory express and it's characterized by its high bandwidth and thus fast storage solutions when memory is non-volatile it simply means that it doesn't require power to retain stored information you can power cycle your computer all day long and unless the drive itself dies in the process you'll be able to recover your data without loss system RAM DRAM is volatile and on the other hand and and that basically means that the data is wiped from memory when current is cut so that's why you can't use system Ram to store any important applications or data long term well go into that in further detail in a future video but for now what you need to know is that nvme storage drives by nature of their protocols are often extremely fast with respect to their inherent Layton sees and transfer speeds the fastest nvme SSDs I could find on the market exceed read and write speeds of thirty five hundred and twenty five hundred megabytes per second or 3.5 and 2.5 gigabytes per second respectively that is lightning fast and would result in an incredibly snappy system overall os boot times are often under five seconds can you imagine that and any game save you these drives load dozens of times faster than a typical hard drive once you go in via me it's very difficult to look back and that's not to say that all MV messes these are extremely fast a subcategory of these drives relates to the number of PCIe lanes each occupies so for instance this drive right here is a two lane SSD whereas this one is a four lane SSD and the difference is basically and if I wanted to generalize this transfer speeds take this Samsung 970 Pro it uses four PCIe lanes noted by the x4 ording this is what you want to look for when you're buying an envy any SSD for PCIe lanes have bandwidth equivalent to about 32 gigabits per second for basically 4 gigabytes per sec so theoretically the fastest nvme utilizing this interface would cap out at around 4,000 megabytes per second using the preferred SSD standard other env meas however like this one right here are limited to just two lanes so that means that theoretical transfer rates cap out at around 2 gigabits per second instead of 4 moving from two to four lanes basically doubles your bandwidth and this right here is an example of that by the way physically four lane and Vimy SSDs only have a single key you can see there's just one little notch there but a lot of the Tulane and VMI SSDs will have two keys just like their SATA in dot 2 counterparts it's it's kind of confusing I kind of express my frustration with this on Twitter but some tooling nvme SSDs will have just a single key and some will have two keys like their SATA in bed 2 counterparts so that's really not a great way it's not an effective or reliable way of being able to figure out which is which if it's 2 or 4 lanes you have to just read the product description make sure you know which one you're buying and obviously you should look at the read and write transfer speeds because those will reveal how fast these drives are and typically how many lanes they're using now here are a few pros and cons of envy me about two SSDs one obviously because they're much faster in general they're more expensive alright so typically around twice the price per gig or more or less depending it depends on the market really which has historically to turn a lot of PC builders I've got only two for line MVM SSDs in the studio and neither of them are in my personal rig it's just in my opinion a better value to opt for the two and a half inch or say 2 m dot 2 drives too many beefier nvme drives will run very hot and may require heat sinks with active cooling to maintain adequate transfer speeds for long amounts of time to be fair all SSDs will throttle to an extent under heavy load but this is something you should consider along with your use case scenario since you're likely to spend hundreds of dollars on these drives you want extract all the performance you really can now the last a kind of SSD we'll mention just at least mention in this video is the PCIe based SSD there isn't really much that sets these apart from their Envy Miam to counterparts save the interface used in this case it's PCI Express versus the MDOT two-port transfer speeds are essentially the same in fact you can buy little conversion cards that allow you to connect impact choose to those boards and then let's connect those boards to the motherboard via the PCIe slot so they're really the same thing it's just the method by which you connect them to your system is a little different PCIe based drives aren't really as popular since they're much larger than m2 drives and literally consume a slot on your motherboard they're also typically more expensive so just really isn't ideal or functional one benefit may be temperatures where some PCIe and viennese may have bulkier heat sinks or even fans but again thermal throttling really only applies to those interested in transferring gigs of data at a time by the way I'm not gonna discuss a unit two drives in this video they aren't mainstream yet and are pretty expensive assuming you can even find them in a consumer market I have however linked a reliable article down below that may interest you regarding the technology and how it works it is very well written I've also attached affiliate links to several SSDs in various forms that I trust and have personal experience with for those interested in picking something up they are also in a video description those kicked back to do go a long way I appreciate it if you guys like this video thumbs up you know what to do thumbs down for the opposite click that red subscribe button if you are feeling extra fancy and I'll catch you in the next one this is science studio thanks for learning with us",

    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is. Sony likes to think that they have the superior controller when it comes to the DualSense - DualSense. What are you Spider-Man over here? Sensing things. Well, today we're gonna tell you what's better than the DualSense. Starting out with this Donkey Konga Bongos. You actually had 'em prepped. (drum roll) - Yeah. (laughs) Bongo. (intense rumbling sounds) - These are better than the DualSense. I have no doubt. Because you know what the DualSense can't do? Bongo with your friends. - Bongo. - Actually, we had this when we built the ultimate GameCube. Ken and I had a delightful time. - The only thing it didn't come with was bananas. (Austin drums and claps) The Wu-Tang PS1 controller. This was a tie in with the Wu-Tang Shaolin Style album that was released in 1999. - Wait, I've never seen this in my life. - You've never seen this controller? - I've never seen the Wu-Tang. - You're just a hater because you haven't mastered the Shaolin Style. The Wu-Tang controller was the best one. It was released after the DualShock. - Okay. - But it was like for the PS1. So it didn't have all the DualShocky features. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And it also gave you carpal tunnel which was just an added bonus. Like, does your DualSense give you carpal tunnel? When's the last time your DualSense has given you anything? You only don't like these... - No, Matt, Matt. - because you haven't mastered the Shaolin Style. (goofy transition sound) - This episode of This Is is sponsored by the brand new OnePlus 10T. Matt, have you ever wanted the ultimate performance device? - Absolutely. - Here you go. - Oh wait. But I'm only at 8% battery life. - If only you add has a 125 watt charging to go from zero to a hundred percent in 20 minutes. But on top of that, you've also got all the latest tech inside, including the latest and greatest Qualcomm Snapdragon eight plus Gen 1 chipset. And you've got yourself a 360 degree antenna system. So that even if we both wanna hold. - Yeah. - Here, here, look. We can hold it together. And the antenna is still going to allow for the ultimate performance. - [Austin] The OnePlus 10T will be available to pre-orders starting on September 1st at oneplus.com. And that will run through September 28th. Now, if you do that before September 8th there is a major pre-order bonus. And that for this $649 of the base model you can upgrade this to 16 gigs of ram and 256 gigs of storage. Available at the link in the description. And thank you very much to OnePLus for sponsoring This Is. - [Austin] I'll tell you as someone who owns a real baby that (beep) is a lot of work. So instead, you could get the, Wii baby. Now, maybe this wasn't exactly a controller. - [Austin] But this is an accessory that was bundled with Babysitting Mama for the Wii. And this was basically something that you stuffed a Wii remote into. - Where? - No, no, no, no, no. Just let it sit with you for a second. - Where? - You stick the - Where did you stuff the remote? - Into the baby. - As someone who had three of my kids taken away - Did you shake them too hard? How hard did you shake them? - I didn't get to. - Well do you want the Wii baby? It'll make you feel better. It's better than the DualSense. I'll tell you that. - That is a weirdly like thick tuft of hair for just being on one side of the head. - For a big bald baby. - [Austin] I'd get that checked out actually. - You know what I wouldn't get checked out because it is fine, because it's great? (laughs) Its a Resident Evil chainsaw. (Austin laughs) - [Matt] Talk about segways. So this was released with Resident Evil 4 back in 2005. Based on extensive play tests, the execs high up that your way above our pay grade said this vastly improved the experience for playing Resident Evil 4. (Austin makes chainsaw noise) And here's the thing, it did not. Now they are an awesome set piece and I wish we had some to put around. But like, as far as like actually playing these just weren't it chief. - You know what's better than both the Resident Evil chainsaw and the DualSense? - What? - The Dreamcast fishing rod. Yes friends. Who needs your fancy Rumble your speaker, your touch pad, your beautifully crafted little PlayStation icons everywhere? That's all nonsense for losers. You know, what's better than playing video games? Fishing, because fishing is how you go outside. You're one with nature, you sit in a boat, you float you maybe have a couple brewskis and then you go home with your empty bait thing that you dumped out, and you told your family that you caught a bunch of fish and you let 'em go, because you're in fact a failure. And everyone's really disappointed with you. (eerie music) (transition sound) You're gonna go out with the boys. You're gonna go bring your fishing rod out. You gotta come home with something. But if you stay home and play your DreamCast no one's gonna question you. They're just gonna think you're a weird loser. - Yeah. - And ultimately you'll have the exact same amount of fish at the end of the day. This actually had real motion control. So it actually was compatible with both the Virtua Tennis and Soulcalibur. - Would you in fact say that it would be the cast of your dreams? (Austin gasps) - Kenzie, I'm gonna need you to sit outside for the remainder of this video. (Kenzie laughs) (transition sound) (Matt laughing) - [Austin] It's the whipped cream. (screams) Matt no. (transition sound) - Okay, Matt, what you got then? What's better than the Dreamcast fishing rod, and disappointing your family? - Easy, easy. Let me just pull this out. Katana The Soul Controller. This is from Horri, the legendary madlads. It was the first product of theirs to come to the US. And it was actually a DualShot. - This is the first Hori controller in the US? - Yeah. And so it was basically just a DualShock inside a Katana. And it had motion controls. And you could just go. (sword sound) We went to go buy it with your credit card. But it was declined and good thing because they are $1,300 new, in box right now. Moving on. - [Austin] The GameCube keyboard. This was in fact, the greatest gaming hardware ever crafted by human hand. And when I say human hands, you need three or four of them to use this big mother (beep). Have you ever imagined a GameCube controller with the keyboard on the inside of it? Well, that's exactly what you get. Imagine showing up to the Smash Brother's tournament with this. You have your full controller, and then you set it down in your lap. You go type, type, type, type, type, enter (typing sounds) Pick up the controller, and you get back to owning the noobs. - You don't need a full size keyboard to type F in the chat, when you get your ass kicked online. The only way it's gonna make this better is when Razer inevitably makes their own version of it. - I'll buy it. - It's got their optimal mechanical switches in it. - Razer, if you make a GameCube controller. No you just. - Razer. - Now I know what. - This is branded. Tweet @weightRazer. - [Austin] Oh, good lord. - If you wanna see a This Is branded keyboard. Let 'em know that Austin sent you. - I'm gonna get a call from our friends at Razers, like, \"hey, please stop telling everyone to give us bad ideas. We're not going to do this. This is a bad idea.\" You know what isn't a bad idea Matt? - [Matt] The Dreamcast maracas (Austin makes Maraca sounds) from Samba De Amigo. It was a rhythm game, but with maracas. And they rattled like a good maraca should. - I wasn't paying attention to anything you said. I was just maraca-ing. I'd much rather go Dreamcast fishing, than Dreamcast maraca-ing. - [Austin] The Tony Hawk Ride skateboard controller. Matt, you can't even argue with me on this one. You know. - No, this was actually great. I actually really, this was really fun. - Put yourself back my friends, in 2009, a year full of prosperity of joyous times, and of nothing but world happiness and delight. All that was not true. But you could ride on a Wii skateboard. What more could you ask for? - The one thing you could ask for with this, is that it would actually work. - [Austin] It was more of a cool concept and it was only $120. I would say a bargain compared to stepping on your Wii remote. Because that definitely wouldn't work. It's about the same level of like, authenticity to skating. - Moving on. - [Matt] The Mega Jockey 9000, which just sounds like something we made up. - [Austin] This is amazing. - This is for Steel Battalion and needed 44 inputs, two joysticks, throttle handles, radio channel dials, five switches, an eject button, three foot pedals. This thing looks dope. - It was $200 though. And it was only usable on one game. - This would be dope for something like Star Wars Squadrons, which I like playing. - Yeah. - But again, it's you know. - It looks dope. I will say it looks really, really dope. But there's no way you can argue that this is better than the DualSense. - I can. How many foot pedals does your DualSense have? - None, because the DualSense is a bad controller. - Exactly. - Because what a good controller is, is Dragon Quest Slime for Switch. - [Matt] Hori, are you okay? - Again, this is only for people who don't have hands. Because if you have hands, you'll have to grasp it. And then you're like this, which is not exactly the way you want to game. But it looks dope, right? It is absolutely massive. It does come with a treasure chest and a display stand because that's the only place that you will ever wanna look at it because it's dumb. - Can I let you in on an embarrassing story about the Slime Controller? - Yes, please. - I like, my friend had it. - Uh-huh. - And I was using it, because I was the only second, second Switch controller. - You actually used this seriously? - We were playing Mario cart. - Okay. - And so, you know, flip it upside down just got the little tip of the bump. I just like dock that in my bellybutton. - Oh good Lord. Good Lord. We gotta censor that now I think. - Just play it. It was sitting in my treasure chest. - Oh, Aaron can you please censor all of that? Literally every. - I was locked and loaded. - I take it back. This is not bad better than the DualSense. Matt's story has ruined it. The Slime controller (indistinct). - But you can put a hat on him. He has a little hat. - Not after what you did to him. That face, that's a smile of pain and agony. - He wore me like a hat. - No, no, no. - [Matt] We have the Xbox Kinect. - [Austin] You've already given up. Have you already given up? - I won. I already won the points. - What? There are no points in this. - Aaron, if you could roll back the point system right here and just show. (funky music) (transition beep) - If you're feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine. I'm loving cloud city. (music) I'm solo. I'm Han solo. I'm Han solo. - Are you trying to tell me though seriously, all jokes aside, you know leave your jokes at the door, that the Kinect was good? When they first announced the Kinect they way over hyped it. Remember they showed the kids, scanning the skateboard and it was like, as if he could just bring any household item and suddenly it was part of the game. Yeah. That (beep) never flied. I will agree. The Kinect was interesting. There's no way it was better than DualSense. Because you know what was better than the DualSense? The Densha de Go controllers, Go by Train. Have you ever wondered what it's like to drive a real life Japanese commuter train? - No. - Well, I'm gonna fill you in. You use this and you go and stop. - [Matt] You could even apparently use the N64 mic. So you could announce stations to your passengers. (Matt mumbles) (Austin laughs) - So this was specifically for the Switch. But millions of people have purchased these. - Are you familiar with Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors? - No. - So this was a series of video games. And it was a series of joke games. The one that has been the most famous is called Desert Bus. - Oh, Desert Bus. I am familiar with Desert Bus - [Matt] Where you drive from it's Vegas to like Arizona in real time. - For like nine hours. - And just you're in the desert. And when you get to your destination, that's one point. (Austin laughs) And then you turn around and come back, two points. So they have all these now charity events of like how far can I get in Desert Bus and like people pledge money and stuff like that. And it's a really cool charity. There's literally way more buttons on there than what you're referring to. - Those are all the buttons to talk to your fellow train. - You need the N64 mic for that one. But you know what you don't need the N64 mic for? - [Matt] The Skyward Sword for Switch. - [Austin] Wait is this a real thing? - [Matt] Yeah. It's a Joy-Con controller holder. - So when you swipe too hard, your game goes flying. - Goes flying everywhere, yeah, yeah. Like how many TVs did I ruin? Because you know, you don't have the lanyard. - Mhm. - And you just feel like, kind of like (makes karate sound). - I always practice safe Wii-ing. Strap it up. Otherwise, you're gonna lose control of your Wii, and you're gonna be in big trouble. (scream sound effect) It's not better than the DualSense though. - It is. - No it's not. - Because how many games can your DualSense store in it? - Okay fine. You get me there. - Yeah. - [Austin] The Intel Wireless Series Gamepad. Now you might see this and you might think \"that looks a little sus.\" And then you might look at it closer and go, \"that looks real sus what?\" This was though, a completely wireless controller for PC. Remember, this was not a thing back in 2000. Trust the good folks at Intel to always be pushing the levels of sus-ness in the PC space. - Let me ask you one important question. - No, I don't think you need to. It's fine. We can move on. We're done. - Why did it have to look like this? - Because Matt. - This looks like something. - The wires had to be on the inside, not the outside. - This looks like something that would be in. - No. (beep sound) (funky music) - Subscribe to our OnlyFans. (Austin laughs) Get the uncensored version and they see what this is actually used for. - Moving on though. - Oh, oh no, no. Cut that. Cut that. - [Matt] But we have Le Stick. (Austin laughs) A blast from the past of one of our old This Is episodes. The Le Stick for the Atari 2400 was released in 1981. - You also could squeeze it. - It's a great gift for your kids. - You can squeeze your Le Stick. - Come on kids. Give, give, Le Stick a squeeze. Yeah. I'll tell you what though. I've been training to use Le Stick since about 1992. Sometimes you gotta give her a little - While you're playing with Le Stick, you know what I was playing with? - [Austin] The Nintendo Power Glove. - [Matt] From The Wizard. - What do you need in a controller? I don't know, the ability to control things? Wrong. Controlling is overrated. Instead, you want the coolest looking pad that's attached to your glove of all time. - I'm noticing all of these things that are better than the DualSense are all pure motion control. Where you didn't need a controller. - Are you trying to say that it wasn't the DualSense that we needed but it was the DualSense that we found along the way? - But like so many others, they live long enough. - To turn it back into a controller? - That's good. I don't know. - Thank you very much for watching. Please like, subscribe and let us know in the comments, what's the most offensive joke that Matt said in this video that we had to censor? - Was it? (funky music) - Good Lord Matt stop. You need to put Le Stick away. And I need to Power Glove my way to a bright new future where we can forget this video ever happened. (upbeat outro music)",

    "transcript": "hello good people have you ever been in the situation where you're outside enjoying the nature the beautiful flowers the blue sky the fresh trees and just happen to have a hard drive with you that has a lot of important information that you don't want to get ruined by other elements in the nature like rain dust or potentially dropping it due to a slip and fall well there is a product for you which is what we're talking about today so let's check it out prejudice are you ready okay watch this so that is what the components must feel like inside the H500P managed by cooler master check it out in the description below now one of our most popular storage videos comes through the Silverstone MS online where you populate your own M.2 sata based SSD and you have an elegant solution for additional storage capacity you know that you can take with you anywhere it's awesome but what if you have spare as is these lying around that you're no longer using inside your main PC and don't want to go the route of already like you know these little external drives so Silverstone has a solution for you and so these are the MMS02 and MMS01b Wow the name is Kim here they're water resistant shockproof and there's a lot of military-grade stuff in the marketing name so we're gonna put this through a little torture test for the elementals the elements the elements yeah and see if the internal drive survives because with my previous test with the corsair survivor USB the actual internal and then completely fell apart while the enclosure remained intact now i appreciate the difference between these two so the S01 is basically just a plastic shell with a rubber housing so it's good for like you know being rough and stuff while the S02 is more elegant but it's literally just two slabs of aluminum combined together with some rubber in between and the way you access the drives is pretty similar but also different so this one is rated for IP65 which means it's water-resistant you know i'll be fine for rains and splashes and stuff like that but don't submerge this in water and has this rubber housing I'm guessing Institute just prevents a little additional damage to the actual plastic housing that is underneath and it's got a little flap that you can access for this USB port has a USB cable that comes separately you have a little tool so you can actually open it up and insert the SSD inside now my concern is that on the interior the SSD is not being held by anything in particular it basically just sits in the cavity and we have little padding so that it does have a little bit of compression so that doesn't like shake round inside it's a good implementation because it can support seven or nine point five millimeter SSD's so regard it's a thin drive or a thick one it will fit inside the so1 now the so2 has the same idea for external storage but totally different approach so not only this thing more elegant because it's literally just an aluminum slab but it has an IP68 water resistance so it can withstand for 60 minutes and water up to 1.5 meters so that's awesome in case you know this gets actually submerged in water this is fresh water by the way it has an actual USB cable that's built into the around housing which is type C so that's the one difference because the speeds on this one are USB 3.1 gen2 versus Gen one on the sl1 and so here you access the internals by unscrewing six screws all of which have this rubber grommet around it to prevent any leaks and you open it up and inside we have the SSD cavity which has little pegs at the bottom so it actually kind of holds the SSD in place so it doesn't maneuver anywhere we also get two foam pads that you can install depending on the thickness of the SSD and a thermal pad that you can install because this entire aluminum enclosure can act as a heat sink now the type C cable here has a little rubber tip in case it does set gets submerged in water it's not completely exposed so that's fine and the cable is actually pretty long so it's not doesn't have to be like super close to your PC and I like this sort of built-in implementation you don't have to bring any additional cables it's all in one unit all right it's time to torture these things now I didn't want to do anything crazy with this one because it's still a plastic enclosure we do have the rubber protection on the exterior for that additional drop protection but it's really good for anti fungus anti most & NT like really sharp spikes and temperatures so that's good your SSD will be protected but in terms of like impact stuff this is not the way to go but I am curious to know how the aluminum enclosure is doing inside the freezer let's go check it out man this thing is cold let's go see if it boots I just hope it hasn't leaked because of all the drops well looks like the good luck Drive is in fact alive now I was hoping for cool temperatures because this thing just came out of the freezer and it somehow is 2 degrees Celsius harder than my SSD's inside the enclosure not sure what's that about now the enclosure has withstand some damage on the corners are we still falling on concrete like that it's also quite heavy so that also contributes the additional force applied on it but just minor scuffs the drive inside and the cable are working just fine and so if you are looking for something that can withstand a lot of impact this is a good option especially because it's fully waterproof type-c gen 2 so the speeds are fine and you can populate whatever capacity SSD you want inside here while this guy the plastic one is also a good option but less so for impact stuff it's also lighter so potentially a little bit better for travel but this guy not so good for travel because it's quite heavy but it will definitely withstand anything that comes its way alright so that is how you create your own external two-and-a-half inch enclosure that is waterproof and can withstand quite a bit of damage so let me know if your guys interested in all the links to purchase will be in the description below make sure to check out this other relevant content subscribe

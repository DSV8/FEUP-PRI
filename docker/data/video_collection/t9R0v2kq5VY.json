    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, it's Justine, and in this video, we are checking out probably the most interesting smart home camera that I have ever encountered. This is the Genie S Camera from Psync Labs, and it's the first-ever GPT-enabled smart home camera. Now, I say smart home camera, but this little device does so much more than just keep an eye on things. The Genie S has this unique and compact design. It shoots vertical video. It has a built-in LED spotlight, motion detection and tracking, two-way audio, advanced smart home integrations, and amazing built-in AI capabilities with a feature called ViewSay. Generative AI is bringing in an all new era of advancements in all kinds of techs, so it's really exciting to be able to get my hands on the first-ever GPT-enabled camera. A huge thank you to Psync Labs for partnering with me on this video and sending me this to check out. Let's get into it. Here it is! Capture. Sync. Share. (light upbeat music) Oh my gosh, it's so cute. Look at it. It's like a little, it's like a little robot. (gasps) Oh my gosh, it's so cool. See what else we have in the box, got a nice USB-C cable and it's super flat, power brick. Hi, I'm Genie. I'm so here for it. Now, the main reason that I was so interested in this is because of the AI capabilities. Now, they're launching this feature called ViewSay, which basically turns the camera into a super smart camera. It can recognize more than 2,000 types of objects, and it will convert what the camera sees into text descriptions, so you can actually search through your recordings by keyword. And this also allows you to customize the notifications that you receive so you can be alerted about specific areas or objects or people or pets inside of your home. Now, first of all, can we talk about how freaking cute this thing is? Like look at it. It's like a little camera friend, and I feel like we should probably give it a name. So if you guys have a suggestion for our Genie S name, leave it in the comments below and the top comment wins. I also love how affordable this is. It comes in two storage options, a 32 gig for 34.99 and a 64 gig version for only 39.99, and the ViewSay subscription will only be 99 cents for the beta version at launch, and it's live right now for anyone to try. (gasps) Oh, did you see that? There's a little light. Okay, time to set up. Oh my gosh, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Oh! I'm sorry, hello. All right, let's add a new device. - [Phone] Ready to connect. - Okay, that was pretty fast. - [Phone] Bluetooth pairing succeeded. - Okay, it's connecting. - [Phone] Set up completely. - Oh my goodness, hello. Can, yeah, you guys can see that? It's just, this is so freaking cool. So we're here in the studio, now I can control this with the app. Look, like I just dragged my finger. What the heck? This is so freaking cool. Like how cool is that? (chuckles) Like this interface is awesome. I'm gonna turn it around to see me. You're so close to my face. Get out of here. (laughs) Oh, it can't, okay, so I turned you all the way around. So basically goes 360 but you have to turn it all the way back around. Oh, look at it, I'm recording. Come back over here. Hi, hello. Oh, this is so cool. Okay, let me move you back. Hi, just testing out the Genie S, what does this look like, what does it sound like. Oh boy, I can't wait to set this up somewhere in my home and start actually using it. I'm gonna try the object recognition, so let's click right here and it is scanning, scanning, scanning... Whoa! So here's all of the tags. It tagged everything, hair, head, face, forehead, hair, eyebrow, nose, mouth, neck, shirt, necklace, arm, wall. How cool! Okay, here's the little spotlight so I can turn the spotlight on. I can make it brighter too. Holy moly! That is so bright, look at this. You could adjust just like so. So we can change the aspect ratio. Okay, so this is taking pictures. A call. Hello? (voice echoing) (phone squealing) Okay, oops. It calls the camera. So up here, you can change the video quality, so we can have 2K, HD. We're gonna keep it in 2K because that's how we roll. Here's all my media, the photos that I have taken. Wonderful, we'd love to see it. Oh my gosh, I can't wait to actually try this out. Okay, so this is so cool. Now, we have the basic setup done and I think it's now time to find a home for this little guy in my house and really put it to the test. You guys, okay, so I had to come back, I had to come back because I just got a notification from Genie, and because this, like alerts will pop up like little notifications telling you what that it thinks it sees, it says, a man is taking a picture of himself in front of a camera, possibly using a tripod. What that, I mean, other than the fact that I'm not a man, I don't even know what to, I'm just, like I was getting ready to take a thumbnail photo and it just said what I was doing. I'm shook. Okay, I gotta take my thumbnail now. So I have it all set up and this thing is so shocking, like I set it up and I was just going about my business setting up to film, and I get this notification where it says, a woman is standing in a kitchen, holding a camera, taking a picture of a countertop. But little does this know I was actually taking a picture of it, so technically, yes, I was taking a picture of a countertop, like I am personally being attacked now, (laughs) and I absolutely love it. So now let me take you through some of these features and show you really how this app works. I've only been using this for about a half an hour and I am so impressed already. I can't wait to actually have this in my home up and running and be able to really see the capabilities of it over time. So here we are inside of the app. Like I showed you earlier, you have the ability to scroll around, you can go left and right, up and down, so obviously like I'm filming in here, so we can see the camera. I like that I do have this in my kitchen, so I'm able to get kind of like a full view of the entire living room area, and I'll be able to see if anyone goes upstairs, downstairs, or I can even go over here if I wanna see what's going on at the kitchen sink. So when we go into the settings, here we have tracking, spotlight, turn off and on, and we can adjust the framing, so we can go 3:4 or full screen. We also have Co-watch, which is pretty awesome. So when I go into this, this will take us into this menu where we'll be able to send a link to someone. So like if I wanna send this to my sister, like she could actually watch me film right now. And I also like that it allows you to add a password. So now we also have in here some past events. This is where I got the notification saying that the woman was taking a picture of a countertop and like it could not be more accurate. So when we go in here to do the photo recognition, this is where it uses AI, and it determines what we're actually seeing in this image. And this is so wild because this will tag everything. So you can see the amount of times that you've seen a woman, a stand, a face, a wall, a camera, and you can go through and sort all of these things out. But this is an example of what the entire image looks like with the AI overlays, and it's pretty fascinating because it really does get everything. I mean it's like face, hair, door, handle, stand, pool, chair, chair low, pillow, table, like just, wow. So I can download this and I can share it, and what's great is this was an auto-generated event. It gave me that notification that used AI to determine what was in the scene, and when I click on it, I can go in, save it, share it with my friends, or post it online or basically just do whatever I want. This has a calendar view so I can go in, and I've only been using it for a day so far, so I don't have any previous history, but you'll be able to go back to a specific days. And what it's great is this does do local storage, so we're not sending this stuff to the cloud. It is all happening locally on device. I can go up here and do a little search. Oh, look at that, look at all, okay, look at this one, a person using a camera to take a picture of a kitchen, possibly for a video or still image. Like these are so accurate. Now, when I go into playback, this gives you a little timeline history, a woman sitting at a table, smiling and eating food. Ah, I actually wasn't eating, I was drinking, but you're on the right track. We can also turn on a little spotlight, so if it is dark in your room, wherever you have this camera, you can turn this on to give you a little bit better of a lighting situation. This also has voice command, so you're able to start and stop video, which is pretty cool because you don't have to actually go into the app. You can just use your voice and be able to talk to it. Speaking of talking, it does have two-way audio, so let me go do a little demo of that. I'm gonna go outside and then I'm going to call it and talk to it. So let me pan around here to get myself going outside. I also know this records vertical video, which is pretty cool, like thank you for taking into consideration that vertical is a thing of the future or the now. I'm not sure. Okay, here we go. I'm going out. Okay, I'm gonna make my call. I'm gonna go further away. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Little camera, can you hear me inside? Oh, this is so cool. I can look up, I can look down, go turn all the way around, see the camera and my drink. Okay, great, I'm gonna hang up now. So I really love this ViewSay feature and it's so easy to go back and find any moment that you want on video. It'll automatically arrange similar videos in chronological order with text-based descriptions so you can get this really cool visual timeline of everything. So if I wanna see more of a woman standing outside looking at her cell phone and appears to be texting or checking her phone, oh my gosh, it pulls, actually this, I didn't expect this to pull up the other instances of me on the phone. Wow, there's so many possibilities for this. I freaking love it. Now, obviously I'm just testing this out and kind of figuring out how I wanna have my settings, but what is really cool is it actually has intelligent alerts. So in kind of like a real-world scenario, I don't really wanna be getting all of these notifications about everything that is happening. So with these intelligent alerts, I can turn off these notifications. Something that I really wanna try out is the tracking, so let's turn on tracking and see if it tracks me. Oh, look at that. I mean, this is so wild. Like look at it, following me everywhere I go. That's actually pretty fast too. That's impressive. So far, I'm so impressed with this, like this is such a unique way to be able to use AI and integrate it into our daily lives. And what makes me so excited about this is because we have the ability to do software updates and firmware updates. This thing is only gonna get better. So I'm seriously so impressed with this little camera and I think that people would be quick to label this as just another security camera, but honestly, I think that this goes way beyond that. The AI features really make this something unique that I've never seen before in a smart home camera. And even as a content creator, I can see this being amazing for capturing video as well. And the fact that it records 9 by 16 vertical video is so perfect for creating content for social media. But really, this camera is perfect for all kinds of things, capturing moments with family, keeping an eye on your kids or pets, even live streaming. I feel like there are so many ways that you could really get creative with the Genie S. I mean, you guys know that I review a lot of cameras and a lot of tech and this just seems like this is in a whole different category of its own in the world of smart home cameras. It really is groundbreaking, and I think this will pave the way for more awesome tech like this in the future. But I'm curious about what you guys think. Leave me some comments below. I would love to hear from you. You guys are interested in getting more information about the Genie S or to buy one for yourself, there is a link in the description.

    "transcript": "- If I have to take a guess, obviously one's Android, one's IOS, I'm thinking this one's iPhone. Yeah, this one might be the Android. This is the XR? Huh, wow. (bouncy pop music) - I'm guessing that's the XR and the XS, right? - I'm pretty sure this one's an OLED. - XR, XS, I'm assuming. - Are you sure they're OLED, not LCD? - XR and that's a three. - I think I got my assumption. - Its like a XR vs like a XS max type of thing. - Maybe. - Its a totally different phone on the left. - Of course if you see someone who has or loves this phone there's no need to make fun of them, remember they are just 252 pixel rows short of the full picture and not quite all the way there hardware wise, if you catch my drift. (suspenseful music) Yo guys, Jonathan here, and whoo! Today it's going to be a fun one. There's been a little controversy with the iPhone XR display being that it's not 1080p so I thought it'd be fun to stack it side by side against a screen that is 1080p and see which people liked better. So I'm stacking the iPhone XR side by side against the Pocophone which actually worked out really well. They're both 6.1 inch screens, but again the Pocophone is higher resolution at 1080p. So, based off what a lot of people are saying the Pocophone should be better, right? - Pogophone? - Pocophone. - So what I did was rig up this contraption to make it a completely true blind test, so no one knew which phone was which. I even covered up the notches. Now, both phones were set to maximum brightness with auto brightness turned off, and to make things as even as possible I turned off true tone on the iPhone XR. As far as the actually video itself, this is an episode from Planet Earth II downloaded offline in full HD. Both phones were set to airplane mode so there's no streaming or any other kind of variables and with that said, I think the results might surprise you. - [Center Man] You don't really know. - This looks like an LCD. - I honestly like the right one a lot more, I feel like the color is more vibrant. - Yeah definitely. - (gasp) I already know! - Yeah. - Shoot. - I like that one more too. - I already know, I already know what it is. - It's cool. - I feel it. I know what it is, one of mine. - Yeah. - I know what the left one is, for sure, I think. - One thing I do know, is that this one's a little bit crisper, definitely. Yeah, you said these were just on the device, right? - Which one's the XR and which one's the... - Need to get a little bit more of a look. - You know, that one has a weird glare. - It's like-- - On the off axis-- - It almost seems kind of frosted, it seems. Yeah, it seems kinda like-- - Yeah, but this one definitely has some-- - Like the reds are so much nicer over here. - More vibrant. - Yeah, definitely. - You could tell that this one obviously is a little more washed out at certain angles. - Honestly, I think I may like the right better, this one. - Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. - That one, the blacks are better, the overall picture's brighter, like right there, the blacks aren't saturated at all. - The viewing angles are better, I like that one more. - Viewing angles, definitely. - Left one sucks. The right looks better for me, really looks better for me. - This one? Yeah. - Yeah, I want the right one, yeah. - [Jonathan] Okay, I wanna hear your guess. - The left is definitely the red hydrogen. - No. - No? - No. (left man sighs) - I like this one on the right better. - Yeah, the one on the right is better. - I'm liking this one too as well. - That one, technically, technically this one. Yeah. - The right one. - The right one. - And so, I would say right side. - The right side. - The right side, all because of the colors, basically. - I would pick this one, the screen, I mean, generally, you look at a phone directly but even you're trying to show people something or you wanna see it to like a group of people this side has a better angle viewing, this side kinda gets really bright. - Same, I'd pick this one, it has better viewing angles, looks brighter, and I feel like the picture looks a little bit sharper. - I started from the side, so I already know this one looked way better. - I'm a big fan of this phone over here on the right. - I'mma take the right one as well. - I agree with them that I like this one because-- - I say the right one, that one, yeah. - Ooh, that's good to me. I'm leaning towards my right, this one right here. - I'd have to go with this one. (energetic jazzy music) - The XR. - Oh! - The Pocophone. - Oh damn, man, you hid this-- - Damn, this sucks! (middle man laughs) Thought it at least the XS Max. Oh, it does look smaller, damn it! - Okay, okay. - This is the XR? - I get it, I get it. - Okay. - I knew there was gonna be some trickery going on. - You can't really tell it's an LCD, actually. They were making a big deal out of it, actually. - I think you're just, 'cause we can't really-- - Yeah. - Like, view the angles, so. - I mean, even down, it's still pretty good, though. I would go for the XR. - I've been using a X for the last year and it looks really close to that. - This phone here, has kind of a filter over it and this one's a little bit sharper. - Kind of like a gray filter? - Yeah. - Just over the whole thing? - Filter over it. - Yeah, as soon as I saw it, yeah. I'm like, that one's better. - Yeah. - Hey Zack. That's all I'll say. Thanks for the shade. (blows kiss) So, there you have it. I think this is a lesson again don't judge a book by its cover or in this case, don't judge a phone by its specs on paper. This absolutely wasn't meant to bash the Pocophone. I think it is a fantastic phone for the money, but rather, kinda showcase that yes, resolution is important, but it's not everything. The panel quality, the brightness, the color accuracy, the saturation, all those are huge, huge factors and it's kinda similar to where would you rather have a 4K TV with a crappy panel or a 1080p display with an amazing panel, you choose. Aside from that, thank you guys very much for watching. And if that iPhone XR is looking a little more appealing now, I'm actually giving away not one, but two. Details are up here or down below, and I will catch you guys later.",

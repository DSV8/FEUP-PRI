    "description": "The Movado Connect is, hands-down, the most beautiful smartwatch I've ever worn. It's the kind of perfectly-proportioned, well-balanced wristwatch you expect from a 136-year-old company, with a stock watchface modeled on a design that first saw the light of day in 1946. Even the band, made of a humble soft silicone, manages to come off as somehow fancier than it really is.   Yes, everything about the Movado Connect oozes sleek sophistication ... which is why it's going to break my heart to return it, as I'll probably end up doing. Find out why in MrMobile's Movado Connect First Look  and let me know whether you'd keep it or toss it back, in the comments below!

    "transcript": "- [Mr. Mobile] For most of 2017, I've been wearing the same smart watch. And truth be told, it's getting a little tired. So as a New Year's gift to myself, I finally gave into the Instagram ads that have been crowding my feed and picked up the Movado Connect. It's a fetching little smart watch that does it's 136 year old brand name proud. But for two big reasons, I might just have to return it. I'm Mr. Mobile and this is a first look. Yeah I'm not calling this a review because I've only had the watch for a day at this point. So longer term insights about battery life and durability will have to wait for the possible future review. Subscribe to the channel on YouTube and leave a comment if you'd want to see that. So the packaging here is pretty typical, which disappointed me because the Movado Connect is the most expensive Android wear device I've ever purchased. It's over $200 more expensive than the first Huawei watch was at release. And the reason I'm reaching all the way back to 2015 for that reference is because that one still holds the crown for best presentation. Given how much more the Movado Connect costs, and the additional prestige of coming from a storied watchmaker, I expected a lot more than just a cardboard box. Thankfully, Movado does deliver where it counts. The watch itself has a graceful simplicity that I just adore. That spartan look carries over to the default face, which evokes of Movado's museum watch design from 1947. Another preloaded face called day into night suddenly changes color to follow the sun from rise to set. And of course you can download any other watch face through the Playstore. The display is AMOLED with good color and excellent pixel density, and the case and buckle are stainless steel with the band between them a very soft, comfortable black silicone. Even on the charger, the details have been observed. The magnets that clip the ring to the watch are strong and lock it tight every time, which is actually pretty rare. Oh and pro tip if you buy this, there are actually two protective film layers on the back of the watch out of the box. Be sure to remove them both or it won't take a charge. It only took a few minutes wearing the connect for me to decide it's the best looking smart watch I've ever worn. The proportions of black to silver screamed bezel. Casing to band are just perfect. Some folks might chafe at the fact that you can't change these bands, but I would never want to 'cause it's gorgeous just the way it is. So why might I be boxing it back up? Well with a product as expensive as this, I can't help but look at every short coming more harshly. And there's a lot that the Connect lacks. There's no GPS, LTE, or heart rate sensor. I can forgive those because I personally don't care about them. I mean this isn't a fitness watch after all. But it's less easy for me to overlook the old gorilla glass display covering. A wearable in this class really merits sapphire. And while I like the charger, I wish Movado had made it a dock so the watch can be used as an alarm clock as many other manufactures do. The principle killer for me is Android wear. Some day I might make a video detailing all of my complaints about Google's smart watch platform, but for now, I'll just say it's a confused and inconsistent system. The only thing that's made version two enjoyable to me is the rotating side button on my LG watch sport. A feature that I thought the Connect shared because I misread the spec sheet on Movado's website. Yeah that's on me, but alas this is just a button. And it's the only button. So you're stuck using the touch screen for almost everything else. On a watch, that's uncomfortable. And as you've no doubt noticed, it means the screen gets smudgy more quickly than it otherwise would. And on top of that, recent developments at Google haven't exactly been encouraging with regard to Android wear as a whole. That executive departure caps a long year of uncertainty that hasn't been good for the platform's growth. Yet the fact remains. If you want a smart watch for your Android phone, your two main choices are Android wear or Samsung gear. And Android still has the bigger app ecosystem by far. If you go that route and looks are your top priority, you won't find many with the quiet class of the Movado Connect. Certainly not from Mont Blanc or Louis Vuitton who's flamboyant show pieces range from 900 all the way up to nearly $3,000. That might make Movado's pricing a bit easier to swallow. Yes the diesels and fossils of the world are less expensive, but it wasn't made to do battle with them. The connect is playing in the luxury space, and doing it very well. Seeing it through that lens makes me almost understand how people could drop 600 bucks on this thing. Almost.

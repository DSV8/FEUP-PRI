    "transcript": "The Flipper zero allows you to test a whole bunch of things one of the options is to attach a Wi-Fi board such as this one which then allows me to attack a Wi-Fi networks. Don't ever do these attacks against networks that you don't own or have permission to attack. I'm using the unleashed software I'll go to Applications what I'm going to select here is GPIU I'm going to select it to the Marauder software first thing I need to do is scan for Wi-Fi networks once I've done that I can list the Wi-Fi networks don't just connect to any Wi-Fi network out there especially if it says free Wi-Fi that's Wi-Fi network 2, so what I'm going to do is Select 2 say save and then what I'm going to do is attack the Wi-Fi network. I'm going to select deauth and what you'll notice is my phone got knocked off the Wi-Fi network if I try and connect back to that Wi-Fi network it says incorrect password when I stop the Wi-Fi attack I'll be able to connect back to that Wi-Fi network this is a very basic deauth attack against a Wi-Fi network",

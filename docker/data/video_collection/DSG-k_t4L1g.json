    "transcript": "Did you know that you can now easily update your Flipper Zero from an app on your phone and not only that but you can install applications from an App Store. So as an example if I go to RFID nice application available here is RFID Fuzzer not available on my Flipper I can simply click install and that's now installed on the Flipper Zero. These two are paired using Bluetooth as an example if I click open that's now open the app on the Flipper Zero. So I can see it on my phone but I can also control it from my phone. I could load some codes as an example. There's a whole bunch of applications here under games I could install T-Rex Runner click install and that application is now installed on the Flipper Zero and I can simply click open and then I could play that game. I could press the button on the Flipper Zero to make the dinosaur jump and play the game. The point is I've been able to install a new application from my phone directly on the Flipper Zero I don't have time to go through all of it here fantastic that you can now control the Flipper Zero and install and uninstall applications from an app on your phone",

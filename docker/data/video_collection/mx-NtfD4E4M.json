    "transcript": "- Do you feel that? I feel the tech. It's all around me. - What? - I see tech everywhere. - No. - Am I hallucinating again? - Yep. - Oh, okay. - Hello and welcome to This Is. Austin, what are we doing today? - There is a whole lot of tech coming out in 2023. Some good, some bad, some meh. Which is why we've shamelessly stolen this idea from Donut. (Donut blabbering) - From the frigging factory! (Donut screaming) - Like we do with most of our good ideas. To determine how good is the 2023 tech really gonna be. - We're gonna give it either a thumbs up, a thumbs down, or in my case, a meh. PS VR2. So this is scheduled to come out in February. - I just wanna play \"Gran Turismo 7 VR.\" Right? That's what I'm gonna do with this. - The only thing I'm excited for is to play \"Resident Evil: Village,\" and get picked up by Big Mommy Vampire. - My \"Gran Turismo\" was like, wholesome and fun and you just want to be picked up by the mommy. - Oh, there's plenty of wholesome about. - Nope! No, no, no! - PS VR2 is dumb. - But here's the thing. We have to talk about, not necessarily if it's a good or bad piece of tech, but whether we're excited about it. - I'm not excited for this dumb piece of technology. - Why do you think it's dumb? - Because I just think that pretty much every other VR that's out there does it better. - I mean, it's better than PS VR1. - Well, yeah, that's the lowest of low bars to- - Sure. I mean, unlike something like the Quest, which is fully wireless, and then you can tether to get the extra experience. - If you want the crazy high-end experience, you could tether it. Or if you want to have a nice, convenient experience, you can go wireless. - [Austin] PS VR only works with PS5. It is ludicrously expensive. - [Matt] More than the actual console! - I get it, because Big Papa Zuck is personally subsidizing every Oculus Quest that they sell. This is a tough one because I'm actually a little bit excited for PS VR2, but also I think it's kind of a bad idea. I wanna give it a thumbs up, but I'm like a soft thumbs down. - Thumbs down. I'm a hard thumbs down. I could not be any harder about this thumbs down. - Okay. All right. Enough, Big Mommy, let's go. - Ha ha! Moving on. The Pixel Fold. So this is mostly rumors. It's supposed to have a thinner bezel, the same processor as a Pixel 7 Pro. - I'm not detecting a lot of excitement, Matt. - Here's my thing with it. I think it's good. I've said this in so many videos. The smartphones are really boring, and that's because they're like, they're so good, but anytime they do something different with them, I'm excited that something new is happening. But at the same time, I do not care about folding at all. - I will say that, as the President of the Z Flip Owners Fan Club, I'm excited for any kind of competition in the folding space. Because here in the US, it's really Samsung. That's your only option. And the Google Pixel Fold has been rumored for a long time now. Now, is it gonna be perfect? Probably not. But if they can trim some price off of the Z Fold, and more importantly, give Samsung some real competition there, and gimme all the Google Pixel-yness as well as the cameras and stuff, I'm a thumbs up. I'm a thumbs up on Pixel Fold. - I'm a thumbs up as well, but if we're gonna talk about soft and hard thumbs, I am a soft thumb. - You know what? I think we can just say thumbs up or thumbs down. I regret starting this. - I have a flacid thumbs up. The iPhone 15. - There are a lot of rumors about what the brand new generation of iPhone 15 will give us. Including a USB-C port. Can I get a hoyeah? - Can I get a hoyeah in (indistinct)? - Aren't you excited for USB-C? - Not really. I haven't been excited about an iPhone since the mini, and they got rid of it. So like- - You're like, whatever. - Yeah. Like, I use the iPhone. - I'm excited for every year's iPhone almost entirely because I use the iPhone for so much when it comes to like video and for photos and whatnot. Like, not only just for personal stuff, but like most videos, especially those that go live on the main channel, are just like randomly shot an iPhone and no one ever even notices. Having a better camera that always can be in a phone in my pocket is a massive win. So for me, that alone gives the iPhone 15 a thumbs up. - I'm a thumbs down on it. - [Austin] Wow! - And, like, all right. I wanna piggyback off of what you said. The iPhone has become so rock solid. - Yeah. - And that's why I stick with it year after year. But like, it's so good. But again, it's boring. It does not excite me. - Oh, you know what does excite? This next item, which is the PS5 Slim. Oh boy. So if you've been watching the channel for a little while, you know we talked about a PlayStation or two in our day. - I don't think we've ever talked about a PlayStation a day in our lives. - So the PS5 Slim is heavily rumored to be coming out this year. Although it's important to note that we're not talking about a PS5 Pro. Oh no, my friends. I don't think that's ever gonna happen. But regardless, almost certainly not this year. Although the rumors decide a new thing with the PS5 Pro every day. But the PS5 Slim does seem to be a fairly straightforward upgrade. It will be smaller, surprise, surprise, but importantly will also integrate a external disc drive. So essentially you'll have, either it'll be like docked on or attached to the back or whatever. The PS5 Slim will likely not be a major overhaul in any way besides it's gonna be a little bit smaller and potentially cheaper. - I feel like the \"cheaper\" is just gonna be what the price was before the price hike which we just saw. - Okay, mark my words, timestamp it right now. We are not gonna see like a $300 PS5 Slim. Like, I just don't think it's gonna happen. - I don't think we are either. - I think maybe it'll be 400 bucks and then the disc drive will be another a hundred dollars, which to your point, will be pretty much the exact same kind of price that we saw for launch PS5. I will say a thumbs down on PS5 Slim. - I am a meh! Depending entirely how much that thing costs. Meta Quest 3. - [Austin] Ooh. So the Quest 2 was a terrific VR headset, still to this day, even though it's three years old at this point? The Meta Quest 2 was a terrific VR headset. Really, it's not even arguable, probably the best option for most people right now. The Quest 3 seems like it's going to be a pretty straightforward upgrade. The Zuck himself has said it's gonna be launching this year for $300 to $500. It's gonna be a little bit slimmer, probably due to some updated optics. It'll also have better mixed reality support, which I think is probably gonna be one of the bigger keys, because the Quest 2, I dunno if you remember, has like that black and white mode where you can kind of step out, but it's not that great. I feel like I am a thumbs up on the Meta Quest 3. I don't think- - I am too. - I'm not like thrilled by it, but I think it will be a nice upgrade to what is already the best VR headset for both fully mobile use and for plugging into your PC. Z Flip 5, my friends. - The only thing I could say is, I'm thumbs down just so I- - Balance me out? - I never want to hear him talking about the Z Flip again. - Okay, so, my friends, as Chairman of the Z Flip Fan Club, the Z Flip 5 should have a relatively decent upgrade this year. So not only will we supposedly be getting a fully flat fold, but also there'll be a little bit of less of a crease. Look, let's just put my cards on the table. I could not be more excited about a Z Flip 5 if you put a hundred dollar bill inside it. - [Matt] The Sony Car. - [Austin] No, no, no, Matt. Use its correct name. - So, Sony has announced they'll be partnering with Honda to come out with the Afeela, and I can tell you that I'm not A-feeling this name. - I'm gonna put my cards immediately on the table. Thumbs down purely on the name. I am not gonna be excited about something called the Afeela. I don't care if you sell me a cool PS5 car that looks like it came straight out of \"Grand Theft Auto.\" - Having looked at it at CES in person, it looks like a car in like \"Cyberpunk\" where none of the textures rendered. (Austin laughs) Like, it's so plain. - [Kenzie] I just think it's great that it might have a PS5, but it looks like it's rendered on the PS2. - [Matt] The new line of MacBooks with M3 Pro Max, M3 Base, all that stuff. - You're a MacBook user. - I certainly am. - I know you keep a little candle lit under your photo of Jony Ive every night. - It smells like aluminum. (Austin laughs) - We are probably actually in store for a little bit of a quieter year for MacBooks. We just saw the new M2 PRO and M2 max rollout to the MacBook line. The main thing I'm excited for is a 15 inch MacBook Air. Which sure, might not be exciting, but let's keep in mind that if you're wanting a larger MacBook, like 15, 16 inch display, you're spending $2,500 on a MacBook Pro, and let's be honest, that's too much for the vast majority of people. Some people just want a MacBook Air with a bigger screen. I think this is a complete no-brainer. - I am on the exact opposite end of that spectrum. I think a 15 inch MacBook Air kind of defeats the purpose of it. I would be way more excited for them to bring back the 12 inch model. - I agree with that. I definitely agree with that. - And so like, if it was a 12 inch MacBook Air, jumping all over that. Nothing Apple really does is exciting me, but like, I use it every day in my daily life. - It's very good. Very competent. - I know it's gonna work for what I need it to do. I don't have to fight it at all. I have an M1 Max. I have no intention of upgrading that. - Same, same, same, same. I'm gonna still say though, thumbs up. Entirely because I'm excited for an upgrade with M3 and everything, but mostly for a larger MacBook Air. I just think it'll be a good product for a lot of people. - Meh. The Razer Surround Sound Gaming Chair Headrest. - [Austin] Wait, this a real thing? Is this just a speaker that you put on your headrest? - Yes. That simulates surround sound. - Hey, Matt. Hey, headphones exist. They also assimilate surround sound. - Great. But if you're like me, I hate wearing headphones. You have a child at home. - That's why I wear headphones. If you've got speakers that are playing by your ears, yeah, it might be a little quieter, but it's still gonna be like- - Quieter. Quieter. - All right. - No, yeah, you're right. It does need to be paired with certain Razer products. - Oh, it doesn't work by itself? - It will, but not the surround sound functionality of it. Otherwise it's just back speakers. - Thumbs down. Really? - I'm excited for it because it's new. - I don't wanna be a hater. - This this particular one, I don't think is it, but like, I'm thinking about a v2. I think this could be something cool down the road. - I just look forward to creepy games whispering into my headset speaker in my chair. Apple Reality Pro. Now this is a complicated one. For very many years, I wanna say five or six years, Apple have pretty much just been telegraphing that they're working on something in the AR, VR space. The rumor is, is that we're going to see, first of all, a more expensive VR headset that has some AR functionality, right? I will say just, first and foremost, I am excited for this as a product. I have no idea what it's gonna be used for or whatever. I'm excited to see it. I'm sure that it'll be very convincing when they bring it out on stage and show how you can FaceTime with people in your face. This could go so many different ways, and especially with some of the rumors saying this could be $2,000 or maybe even $3,000. It feels like it's probably gonna be more of like a developer thing at first, and then sort of, and people will expand on it later. - Here's my prediction, and I want this down on video so I can call back to it- - Etching it on the stone slate. - The way that they're gonna market things you can do in this, is they're gonna say, you can go virtually walk through every one of our OS wallpapers. You wanna go take a look at Big Sur? - [Austin] I wanna do \"Lion.\" Can I walk through the Savannah with the lions? Thumbs up on Apple Reality Pro. - No, I'm a thumbs down, because everything I think is cool about the Quest, all the open sourceness and all the cool things you can do, I think Apple's gonna lock that down. - But here's the thing, though. This is not about, will it be a good product, is it, am I excited? And yes. I am excited to see. It's always a cool moment when Apple bring out a brand new product category. They got a pretty good track record. It might suck, it might not be terrible, or it might be very terrible, I don't know. But I'm excited to at least see what they've got. Sell me on it, Apple. The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. This uses dual 2.8k OLED display with this weird kinda like origami stand. So you can like fold the laptop up, you can put the keyboard there, which is wireless, or you can open up and have the two individual displays. The vertical position definitely makes me think it would be better just as a folding device. - For like a student who's doing like a lot of document work. I could see it. - It's so expensive though. It's like over $2,000. - Right? And my big problem with any of these kinda like gimmicky feature laptops like this is, they usually pretty under spec'ed because the specs are usually a generation or so behind. And like, again, for how much it is, you're never gonna get a solid GPU in here. - I'm gonna give it a soft thumbs down. I wanna be surprised. If I get my hands on it and I'm like, \"Oh, this thing's really neat.\" I feel like I need to be sold a little bit on it. I'm not sold that this is a better move- - It looks like a big Surface Duo 2. So like, I'm going off my love for the Surface Duo 2, so I gotta give it the benefit of the doubt. The Surface Duo 3. - [Austin] That was really well timed. - Story time with, Matt. - Uh-oh. - I love the Surface Duo 2. That's one of the only devices in the past few years that I've gotten like, legitimately really excited about. For the most part, I talk about tech being really boring because everything is so good. The Surface Duo 2 was just so unique. It is the worst phone I've ever used. Like, let's be clear. As a cell phone, it is one of the worst devices I've ever used. But as just like a tablet, and like a personal, like, media device. I mean, I grew up in the world of PalmPilot, so having something that's a little bit more separated. I love it. The Surface Duo 3 is ruining everything that I liked about it. - Rumor says that they're dropping the dual screen in favor of a folding display. Which obviously seems like the way that everyone's going. - My argument has nothing to do with software. The software needs to be improved regardless. The reason I love this was the two separate screens. - Yeah, it's actually nice. And the thinness of the device. - Yeah, it's probably one of the most well-made devices I've ever used in my life. - Still getting a thumbs up, Matt. It's still getting a thumbs up. - No, it's getting thumbs down from me. - Really? - For taking away the things I liked about it. - I'm a thumbs up for the same reason I gave the Pixel Fold a thumbs up, in which I want more good folding phones out there. Microsoft, can you please just make the software better? L'Oreal Brow Magic. Kenzie, are you pranking us? Is this an actual thing? - This is an actual thing, but I also am pranking you. - Every morning I spend a lot of time drawing my eyebrows on, when in fact, I could just take this and roll them on. For a segment of Mystery Tech that has not gone live yet, so make sure to subscribe to the main channel. - It might have gone live by the time this- Who knows? - [Austin] We took a look at the Prinker, which is essentially a tattoo gun. - [Matt] In the Mystery Tech, it did not work well at all. - Look, this is a thumbs down from me. I would love to see someone with horrific eyebrows. - Wait, you know what? I'm gonna give it a thumbs up. - [Austin] Did you change it? You know what this means, right? We're pre-ordering this right now, and you're gonna have to shave your eyebrows and instead put them on with the L'Oreal Brow Magic. - Thumbs up. - He said it! We all saw it! Subscribe and ringling the dingling button. Matt will shave his eyebrows this year. Confirmed. - I'm not excited for this product in particular. - You said thumbs up. - It's more like the- - A thumbs up don't lie. - The easy augmentation. - Nope, nope, nope. Don't try to back it up, Matt. You said thumbs up. You agreed. We're shaving your eyebrows. Subscribe, ringling the dingling button, and let us know what you think is gonna happen when, not only Matt shaves his eyebrows, but also, I don't know, some tech will come out this year.

    "transcript": "so that was just a quick unboxing of the new Ryzen 2nd generation processors and a couple of X470 motherboards unfortunately I can't get into the performance results and talk about a little bit about the architecture and stuff for these new CPUs because AMD has given us an embargo for that and they have only given us actually they'd be missed to embargoes this is an interesting thing so they've given us an embargo for today which is the Friday April the 12th and it is an unboxing embargo so we're supposed to or we're allowed to reveal the pricing in specs of these new Ryzen processors we can't really talk about we can't really get into the depth of the platform the architecture what are some of the tweaks with this new platform and something stuff like that so it's gonna be a pretty short video but I would recommend preparing your sub boxes for next week April a 19-foot that on your calendars because rise in to coverage is gonna be everywhere I guess reviews and all that kind of stuff so yeah you can thank me for that in the comments anyways what I can talk about today are the newly announced Ryzen second generation processors and their respective specifications along with pricing and availability along with the new x470 platform and some of the features that brings to the table so without any further ado let's get right into it but first a quick message from our sponsor the new OC CTR 200 from Toshiba is a great value SSD if you're considering upgrading a hard drive and get a nice boost in performance with cutting-edge 3d flash memory and ultra reliable controller with built-in power management available in different capacities check it out below alright so what exactly can we expect from these new Ryzen processors well first and foremost the obvious more performance this is AMD's first line of CPUs on the new 12 nanometer technology using these n+ architecture it isn't necessarily Zen to but rather a minor optimization of from the original Zen architecture they've also made some improvements to the soldered HS by using premium indium alloy solder they've claimed to reduce Die temps by 10 degree Celsius which is pretty amazing also say hello to AMD's x470 chipset this is their updated platform that supports these new rising CPUs and they come with a few enhancements that I'll get to shortly ok so let's get to the new CPU's meet the Ryzen 7 2700X it's an 8 core processor which 16 threads comes with 20 megabytes of cache a baseball Cup seven gigahertz and a boost up to 4.3 it also comes with AMD's new wraith prison cooler which we'll get to shortly and it's priced at $329 by the way all of these new processors will be available for pre-order globally on April the 19th next up we have the Ryzen 7 2700 it features the same number of cores and threads as the 2700X except it runs at lower clock speeds out of the box and its TDP is set to 65 watts when compared to 105 on the 2700X and it's priced at 299 that's just incredible considering the performance it's packing moving on we have the Ryzen 5 2600X it's a 6 core processor with 12 threads comes with a base clock of 3.6 gigahertz and a boost up to 4.2 and it's TDP rating is set to 95 watts what's even exciting is it's priced at 229 and I can't wait to test out its performance compared to Intel's offerings lastly we have the r5 2600 features the same number of cores and thread count as the 2600X except slightly lower clock speeds out of the box when compared to its bigger brother but check out that price $200 guys $200 for a 6 core 12 thread processor really exciting stuff now with the introduction of these new processors and new platform Rises and in this case it's X470 it is a successor to X370 from last year and it brings some improvements in the power infrastructure in order to support second generation rising CPUs especially since they can achieve higher clock speeds you can also expect a lot of new motherboard designs from Asus or as MSI X arow + AMD has announced store mi technology with this platform consider this as a response to what Intel does with their rapid storage technology it's basically a storage software that fuses two or more storage devices so in this case it could be your SSD and hard drive plus your RAM into a single virtual disk so the operating system reads it as a single Drive I can only get to the specifics next week when the review embargo lifts plus I'd like to spend some time validating this technology to see if it's actually worth upgrading because it's only compatible with x470 motherboards and not X370 quick note and compatibility if you own an existing Ryzen system so say for example you have an X370 motherboard with a first-generation rise in CPU you can just purchase one of these new processors and do a drop-in upgrade and it'll just work right away as long as you've updated the BIOS beforehand so it is backwards compatible the only thing to keep in mind is that store mi technology isn't compatible with x370 plus I think overclocking there are some overclocking limitations with the new Ryzen processor if you install it into in if you install it to an x370 motherboard so I'd recommend if you are thinking about upgrading from say a 5 or maybe like a relatively older system and if you're considering making the switch to rise in you should definitely pick up an X470 motherboard and one of these new Ryzen processors just sort of take full advantage of the new overclocking capabilities and just just the storage the story in my technology that I talked about earlier another thing that I need to mention is that I've not had the best experience when it comes to overclocking on Ryzen processors especially with the 1700X I wasn't able to get a consistent 4 gigahertz overclock on my CP or on my sample but I'm hoping to achieve even a lot higher on the new rise in CPUs so let's just hope that overclocking would turn out pretty well on these new systems because 4.3 gigahertz or let's say roughly 4.2 gigahertz on all eight cores would be pretty amazing and I'm hoping to I'm hoping to achieve that hopefully when I put together the rise into system so stay tuned for our performance result or a performance build video next week so that concludes this video I hope you're excited for rising to just like I am but most importantly I'm really excited about what kind of performance it will bring to the table when compared to 1st generation Ryzen processors because I'll be testing out the 2700X and I'll be comparing to the 1700X that's on my editing PC right behind me so can't wait to can't wait to test that out but I'd love to hear your thoughts on Ryzen 2 are you excited let me know in the comments down below I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

    "transcript": "WE GOT RYAN HERE TODAY *snaps* *hits table* Ryan come say hello Look at Ryan A real professional Look at this beauty. There he goes. What do we have today? We are checking out A 360 Crave 360 Smartcast Speaker from Vizio. What's with the cast in the name? Well of course you can broadcast to the speaker in a number of different ways either Vizio smart cast which is an app which will turn your smartphone or tablet into a remote control to control this thing. You can also use google cast which I know you guys are familiar with that's the same thing that gets used in the chromecast that little icon that pops up. We've also got bluetooth and this thing can do multi room so you could set up multiple speakers across your house if you want to. This little bass. One of the things is like how do you keep a charge you guys know, I'm a fan of wireless charging. in general this one instead sits on this little bass and stays charged you put it back when it's not in use still works as a speaker. When you want to go wireless. Boom, just lift it off and go. 360-degree omnidirectional sound, glass touch dial, tap to play/pause, so on. Produces base as low as 80 hertz. Ryan what does that mean? (Ryan): No idea Remember when Hulk Hogan used to do the ear? Ryan remembers let's see it how did he do it? OHHHHHhoho BANG You guys know I love speaker videos. Oh what am I doing here? You remove the speaker, charge the speaker and turn on the speaker. Got it. Whoa, look at this. That's the kind of thing it can fit into the home decor, you know what I mean? We gotta power brick in the base this part here to plug in you see that little connector on the bottom there Jack? That guy just pops right on, like so. You're charging you don't even need to think about it. *peeling* *sniffing* Smells like leather, they weren't joking. I just realized this thing spins, what is that? Is that volume? I'm gonna follow the instructions, it's on the base. Hello there. That's a good look right? That's Vizio's version of me. It's like maybe, Ohh. *beat playing* *clap* *beat playing* *clap* That's cool show you the battery life as well as the fact that it's charging. Different, TV services, movie services, music. You can see iheartradio is in here. It also kind of works as a receiver so you can select your various inputs.

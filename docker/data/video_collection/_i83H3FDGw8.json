    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going guys? This is Dave2D. So, the new MacBooks are coming. The ones I'm most interested in, are the MacBook Pros. So, this is a preview based on the information that I've gathered. Now, I think most of it to be quite accurate, I can't guarantee any of it, but let's get right into it. Okay, first thing: the 2016 MacBook Pros are going to be noticeably thinner and lighter than the outgoing models, even the footprints will be smaller. In terms of ports, well, they're Apple and they're pretty aggressive with cutting ports these days and they're pretty forward-thinking, so there's an audio jack and there's four USB C ports, that's it. The 2 USB ports on the left support Thunderbolt 3 and then the other 2 on the right will just be regular USB 3. There's no SD card slot or any kind of display outputs, you will need to rely on adapters for those. So, yeah, with Thunderbolt 3 that means the potential for external GPUs, superfast external devices, you can even feed a pair of 4k displays at 60 Hertz, or if Apple makes a 4k display with Thunderbolt 3 connection, you can hook up one of those. You can also power these laptops through the Thunderbolt 3 port this port is awesome. The display resolutions will be the same. For their laptops Apple always tries to hit a resolution where you're getting around 220 PPI, so that's like the sweet spot where at normal laptop viewing distances, your eye can't resolve anything finer than that, or at least that's the theory. The most unique feature of the new MacBook Pro is this a little OLED screen. It's small, it's just a strip of screen and they're calling it the magic toolbar. It takes the space on the keyboard that used to be occupied by the function keys. So, the function keys can still be there, if you need them, but Mac OS and third-party applications can put their toolbars onto this little screen and I mean you can already imagine the functionality that this could bring. From media play controls to Photoshop tools, I think it's going to be really useful and at the very least it's going to look super cool. Now, on the right of this OLED strip, is a power button. It obviously turns the device on and off, but it's also a fingerprint sensor, like iOS devices, so you can wake it from sleep and then login to your account pretty much instantly. Since these laptops are thinner, the keyboards have to use butterfly switches. The typing experience will be very similar if not identical to the 12-inch MacBook in terms of keystroke. If you're only familiar with the previous generation of keyboards from Apple, like their older MacBook Airs and Pros this will take a bit of time to get used to, because it only has one millimetre of travel, but it is a good keyboard. The trackpad uses Apples for such so. It's that solid-state trackpad with the taptic engine, but because it's a bigger trackpad, it gives users a significantly bigger surface area for any kind of multi-touch gesture, but the cool part is that you can draw on it with the Apple pencil. This trackpad is about 40% bigger than previous trackpads, so you can essentially use it like a small Wacom art tablet. There are speakers flanking the keyboard on both the left and the right. The 15-inch MacBook Pros have always had these stereo speakers, but for the 2016 models, even the 13-inch MacBook Pros will have this placement. Also expect awesome sound. The caliber of audio that comes from the 12-inch MacBook is fantastic, so on these ones, my money is on some really killer audio. Okay, on the inside, the new MacBook Pro is going to be running Skylake chips. These are the sixth generation chips from Intel not the newest KabyLake, but they still deliver really solid performance. This diagram has a single fan, this is for the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The 15-inch MacBook Pro will have two fans, because they have faster quad-core CPUs. In terms of video cards, still no Nvidia, they're going with AMD Polaris chips. As for which cards specifically, I'm thinking the RX4 Radeon. It's an okay card, low power consumption and Apple loves that, but in terms of just raw graphical compute, it's kind of mediocre. Think... GTX960M, you can play some low to moderate games with it, which, I mean, it's okay, but the thing that bugs me the most about it is the lack of CUDA cores, because it's an AMD card, and if you're an Adobe user, like I am, you don't get to use CUDA cores for GPU accelerated stuff, you have to use OpenCL and I don't love that. But if you're a Final Cut user, you're gonna love this thing. The RAM is going to be soldered on, as usual, not upgradeable, my guess is that 16 gigs is what we're going to get at the top-end. 32 gigs would be roomier and more comfortable, but reality is very few people can make use of 32 gigs of RAM. For the drives, with current Samsung NVMe is pushing ridiculously fast speeds, I think these drives will be just as fast, my guess 3,000 maybe 3,500 megabytes per second read, 2,000 write. They can be pretty awesome. Battery life will be about the same as the previous generation, they'll claim 9 to 10 hours, but expect 7 or 8. Still really impressive. It's a thinner design so there's less real estate on the inside for the battery cells, but Apple just has some of the best power optimization in the game. Okay, so, the new MacBook Pros are going to be really exciting, but don't think that the older generation, like the outgoing 2015 or even the 2014 models are obsolete or anything. Yeah, they're not new technology, but they're still really solid performance, because the CPUs in these new ones aren't that much faster than the older generation. The one thing that bugs me, though, is the choice of video card. I understand that they have a great working relationship with AMD, I totally get it, but Nvidia, I mean, they've released a really cool card this year: the 10 series are just fantastic. It's like a 40 or even 60 percent jump in performance from the previous generation. So, Windows laptops are in for a real treat with this upgrade. The AMD chips, they're good, they're just not as good. So, that kind of bums me out, but who cares, it's the new MacBook Pro, I'm sure a lot of people love them. Hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. It's been nice, I'll see you guys next time.",

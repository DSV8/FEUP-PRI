    "transcript": "In the 17 years that I've been a YouTuber, I've acquired a lot of tech. Some of it has legitimately come in handy many times for our content, and some I've kept around for personal reasons, like this mostly working CPU chiller. But lately I've found myself asking, \"How many opterons does one man need?\" \"Do I even have enough computers to put all these old GPUs in?\" \"And how much is it costing me to store all of these cases?\" Fortunately, we have a plan. With our crack team of logistics specialists, we are going to be liquidating everything that you see in front of you. Welcome to the Linus Media Group Garage Sale! Are you guys ready to buy my stuff for pennies on the dollar? Yeah! Let's go! IFixit. For only 48 hours from when this video goes live, you can save $10 on purchases of $50 or more with code LinusFix. Act quick and take advantage of this limited time deal using our link in the video description. Now tell me something, what's the total value of everything that is out here? Roughly $82,000. And what are the odds we're gonna get anywhere near $82,000 for it? Less than 1%. Nice. I gotta say, I wasn't involved in the selection of the items, and I'm already noticing some very interesting stuff that's just low-key hiding in the piles. This right here is that wild small form factor dual GPU case. Well, hopefully it goes to a good home. Oh yeah, and here's that stylish rack from the WAN show. Oh, and I was going to show off the Bragi the Dash, which was the world's first true wireless earphones. But I think somebody already noticed them and snagged them. Now, some stuff doesn't have a price, because we just weren't really sure what to do with it. Like this 40 pound bucket of AIO liquid coolers that are in various states of disrepair. So, we're just going to go out there and try our luck. Here's an exciting opportunity. This bin of 43 and a half pounds of all-in-one liquid coolers. There's also some tubing and there could be a dead rodent in the bottom of the bin. We're not sure. I'm going to start the bidding at three dollars. Three dollars. I have three dollars. Sold! Three dollars. Sorry, this is my first time auctioning. I don't really know how it works. It's yours. Let's see if he can carry it. Barely. This is actually a very good deal, I'm serious. This EK unit alone is probably worth like 50 to 75 dollars. Oh, you got something really cool! Do you remember this video? I can't remember it. What was it? This is a prototype pumpless AIO. This doesn't exist Other than this one. It doesn't work especially well, and you're gonna have to kajigger your own mounting for it But I have no idea how that ended up in this bin. Half the challenge getting rid of some of this stuff is even knowing What it is. Alex, you just explained what this was. How'd you describe it? It was an Aliexpress like tense tablet. A tense tablet. Oh, I remember this one. It's the weird triangle tablet Yeah, what's the price on this? One dollar. Okay, any one tablet. One dollar. Got 'em. That guy with the sunglasses. Sold. I am such a good salesman. A nice young man asked me if we had any monitors and Reese said no we don't have any monitors, and I said I bet we have some monitors I found this 8K Dell that has literally been marked for sale for so long that this pink sticker has now faded to almost white Back! Back Vultures! Back! Okay, I have some monitors I'm really hoping to get something for this stupid 8K Dell Okay, 8K Dell monitor 500 bucks It's 500 bucks Canadian? Canadian I'll do it Sold This is an ancient piece of sh*t But a special one As far as I know it still works And this sat on my desk at NCIX Then it sat on Luke's desk here at Linus Media Group and included with it is this unique item patch That is the number of subscribers that Linus Tech Tips had when we founded the company And one year we did a special jacket for all of our staff that had a patch with their subscriber count So this is Luke's patch that he carelessly left on this monitor Ten bucks Ten bucks, deal Alright, ten bucks, sold This sucker just bought the rocket skates for 50 bucks. He thought he was getting a deal, but he's gonna be dead in a week You're getting them to your kids Hello everyone, I have an exciting opportunity for you for the low low price of what the f*** Sorry, I got distracted there. For the low, low price of whatever I'm about to make up, these, however many cases there are on this cart can be yours. I'm gonna start the bidding at $1,000. Okay, how about $11? Okay, this guy. They're all yours. You don't even know what you bought. Are you sure you got a good deal? Alright, well, hopefully you have a way of transporting these. Anyone need a weird server rack? $20. $20? Done deal? Alright, it's yours. $20. It's 11:30. At what point do we want to say, okay, it's 30% off everything that's still left, like, to start counting? 12:30. 12:30? Yeah. Alright. We're selling it, we're selling it at full price for the game. Okay. We got an offer for $200 on the scorpion chair. Do we have any other offers? That's it? That's it right now. Okay, you just volunteered to help me haul it outside. We're gonna sell this thing. We're gonna sell it, okay. Let's go. Alright. I'll tell you what, we're gonna play a little game. I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna see if anyone will take it for $600. If they don't... You can have it for $20. Ooh! Ooh! Take that, dude. I think it's worth it. You think it's worth it? I'll take the gamble. Worth it for the gamble. Let's go, let's go. Let's see if we can sell a scorpion chair. To the left, to the left. It's my throne. Everything you own in a box, to the left. Where's the box? Sorry. I know Beyonce. Okay, right down, right down. Here we go, here we go. Watch your head, watch your head. Watch your back. Okay. I have made a deal with this gentleman. He made me an insultingly low offer for my fine quality scorpion chair here. And I said, Okay, look, sir, I think I can get three times what you offered, and if I can't, I'll give it to you for 20 bucks. Do I have $600? Okay, 20 bucks. It doesn't have to be picked up today. Too late, 20 bucks, it's yours. Oh, there you go. Oh my god, thanks so much. You gotta carry it though, get that thing out of here. Hey, look, a wild Elijah appeared. Wanna go on a journey with me? Absolutely. All right, let's find some stuff to get rid of. Ooh. How'd these guys say we couldn't spare any SSDs? Because there's quite often a lot of projects where we just take like eight of the same ones. Look at these SSDs! I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm just saying, it's gonna, you know what's gonna happen? We're gonna sell these. Jake's gonna start a video next week where he needs 16 of them. And you know it. But, uh, but, but, Kodak? Okay, that, okay, that one I agree. That you can... Still works, but do not use for important things. All right, get it in there. Vader hard drive. Yo, that's lit. What else we got? Do we need this many GPUs? I don't know. Do we need two 3060s? Do we need four 3060s? Elijah, take these GPUs to the people. Yes, sir. What else we got? How about some minion Wi-Fi routers? Don't think I'll be needing those. This switch ran our video editing for years. That'll be a fun little piece of history. And speaking of, do I really need this many 45 drive Stornators? Many employers may not be aware of how to reduce the risk associated with lifting. I am stuck now Okay, so Jamie. Yes, sir. Here's what I'm thinking. Okay, I'm gonna get out there move all of these and then we'll do the thing. What thing? You know the thing. Oh. Oh 30% off. Shh! They're right there. You get rid of the scorpion chair? Yeah 20 bucks. You got what? You sold the Scorpion chair for $20? I made the guy a deal. He offered 200 and then I said I think I can get three times that So I went out but I said if I can't get three times that I'll give it to you for 20 bucks Will you gamble now? You know what? I'm not the one that has to answer to your wife. He's not wrong. Before I cart this out there, I should probably figure out what it is We've got a couple of what look like LSI HBAs in here supporting a total of 16 drives Wait, 32 Who the heck screwed this in like that? Does anyone have an LTT screwdriver on them? What are the odds? If it's not LTT, you're fired. It is. Nice. Perfect. That is hilarious. Like the fact that we can just be like yeah can I get a screwdriver and there's someone in earshot. It just proves how good quality it is. That many people have it. Yeah exactly. That and we've sold like a hundred sixty thousand of them or something like that. Thank you. No thank you. All right what do we got? Oh no drives. Okay, okay. So it's just a 45 drive chassis, I don't know like, I don't know 500 bucks? 600 bucks? Is anyone here a major data hoarder? Do I have 350 for the Storinator 60 drive chassis? 350! Do I have 400? I've got 400. 450. 500. I've got 550. Anyone? 550 going once. 600. He was first. 650 going once. 650 going twice. And sold. What are you gonna put on this? What do you need 60 hard drive bays for? You know what? Video games. Sure. Games my ass. You drove from California? Sacramento. Wait what? Sacramento. You're gonna drive this all the way over the border? Another 15 hours. We told you guys not to travel for this. Yeah they got listening problems. I mean you've seen America's education system. Happy birthday America. If you want to announce 20% off we can do that for every single purchase. It just is one extra tap for the cashiers. I did already test it once so someone got 20% off I just wanted to make sure it worked. Can I have your attention please? Can I have your attention please? Will the real Linus please stand up? Thank you Elijah gets the reference. This is his first time. I'm evolving. From this moment forward everything is 25% off the sticker price. 20. 20. 20. Sorry Chase. 20. 20. I almost did it wrong. 20% off the sticker price. Go. This LG digital signage TV has gotta go. I paid 5 grand and I feel like I'm gonna get a lot less. Can I get 50 bucks? Do I have 200 dollars? A thousand. A thousand. Do I have 1,100? 1,100, okay. 1,200. 1,300. I have 1,300. We've got a bidding war here, folks. 1,400. 1,500. 1,600. 1,700. Going once. Going twice. Sold! 1,700 dollars! Yes! That's much better than I was expecting to do on this. I'm so happy to have lost $3,300. You did good, though. Yeah, thanks, Jamie. I have a Bob Wi-Fi 6 router. Do I hear five dollars? Yeah. I saw McGill over here first. Do I hear seven dollars? Okay, I got guy in the white shirt went first, okay. Do I hear seven dollars and fifty cents? McGill was first. Okay, sold. That's okay. He got the chump one anyway. Bob sucks. I've got a Kevin Wi-Fi 6 E router. 50 bucks. Just take it. Okay. This one's a bit more fun. This was our main 10 gig switch for, I don't know, like three years, five years or something like that. So many videos have been run through this switch. It's been modded with Noctua fans, so it's a little bit quieter. Anyone interested? Okay, it's 40 bucks. You want it? Yeah, no, I'll take it. 10 gig switch. Enjoy. Sales are going good, but I think it's slowing down a little bit. I'm thinking 50% off. Yeah, we can set that up. Everything that's left. Okay, we'll announce it in four minutes. Okay, I'll change it. For some reason, Red Bull sends us like pallets of drinks. We don't do anything with them we never really shout them out or anything. So sure, we're going to give some Red Bull to the people. I wanted it. Elijah, don't be greedy. Can we just sell this? Sure. Yeah, why not? We've got the badminton center opening soon, got a lot of shuttle cocks. Oh my god, there's so many. Something of a shuttle cock enthusiast. Yeah, me too. Minus the shuttle. Smash champs, opening in August. What the heck is this? Can we get rid of this? No, it's for my upgrade. Of course it is. Child labor laws are to protect the employers from having to deal with this stuff. That's a hot take bruh. Obviously kidding. He's not. None of this is assetted, so I'm just gonna take it out there and get rid of it. Yeah, as long as it's not assetted, we're good. But the Red Bull, you're gonna sell the Red Bull? We got that for free. Yeah, so it's profit. You're not gonna let me profit on one thing today? You're gonna take that away from me? You know what? Because you sold that TV and the scorpion chair, you could do whatever you want. I mean, I sold the scorpion chair for 20 bucks. Dude, I don't care. You got it out of here. Alright, I got a few more special items! I have a bin of fans. That's right, this is my OnlyFans bin. And it can be yours for the low price of... $1,000. I'll take it. No. You know that's legally binding, right? But I'll tell you what. Alright, we got a runner here. I don't need you alive. I don't even know who you are. Okay, in all seriousness, I don't know, 50 bucks. 50, I saw you first, 60 bucks. 60? It's 50, going once, twice, sold! Alright, now I got the lightning round. I got some mouse pads. Does anyone want a yoga mat? I didn't even give a price yet. 10 bucks. Okay, I heard you first. Alright, I got another mouse pad. You gotta wait for the price! You gotta wait for the damn price! I'll sell you the name of my first child. I get to name your first child for a mouse pad? Prove you aren't sterile. Just take it. Oh, but I have something special now. This sign from LTX 2023. The last LTX until if we did another one. Which we probably won't, but we might. Let's make it interesting. We're gonna have all the staffers that are here sign it for you. Hundred bucks. Okay, I got a hundred. We got 110. Do I have 120? 120. 130. 150. Going once, twice, sold. Oh, too late. Alright, it's yours. Man, there's some crazy stuff still left here. This is a never opened Inwin 309. It's got that front panel with all the addressable RGB and stuff. Maybe we just got to incentivize people a little bit more. Okay, I need some height. Those of you who have waited patiently in the heat, you will be rewarded! Everything is now 50% off sticker price! 50% off at the till! This is my balls My Alpha Cool balls, I'm just gonna I was just gonna huck them into the crowd. I will give you another $50 off, but you must complete a challenge. See this ball? When Colton comes around the corner, you got to hit him with it without him seeing you. Do you think we could sell this sign? Like we sold, like we sold the other LTX sign, what do you think we could get for it Colton? Maybe 20 bucks. I don't know. What are you even doing here today? Well, I was just coming to see what's going on. Oh, all right. That's all. Isn't it kind of a long drive. All right, he gets 50 bucks off. Nice shot! What was that? Why? Are we assaulting people to give them discounts? How does that work? Well you're not getting a discount. Do you want to take a guess on how much we've sold today? Most of the stuff that I moved out the door was for like, ten bucks. Yeah, you did you contributed about a hundred bucks. Nice. I'm gonna say 40 grand. It's like 34. Wow, so a $50,000 loss. I mean- I think he thought he was giving me good news. He hadn't done the math yet. Well it's okay, the lights stayed on today, didn't they? Yeah. What a day. And the craziest part is there's entire categories we haven't even touched. Laptops, streaming stuff. We had barely any keyboards. We didn't touch projectors, fully built systems. I suspect we're gonna end up doing this again at some point. Just like I'm gonna end up telling you about our sponsor. iFixit.

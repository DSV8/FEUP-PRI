Not sure how accurate this thing is, but it seemed to give me consistent readings of 0.05-0.06 after drinking two beers (for science of course).

    "transcript": "{Funky Music Plays} What's up, guys? Lew here, back with another video.. and today, I got something you'd probably never expected to see here. That is a portable breathalyzer!! Excuse me, Lew! What exactly are you talking about? This little guy in front of me - you blow into it, if you've been drinking. And it'll give you an accurate read-out of how intoxicated you are. Now, this one is not just portable but it also uses your android device. So, that's kinda where the tech component comes in. It plugs into the Micro-USB port and allows for you to get that reading. Why would you want something like this? If you don't know, drinking and driving... terrible.. thing to do. You don't wanna be doing it! So, with a little guy like this in your pocket, you could turn it into a little bit of a game! You'd be like, \"Ah, ha, ha! What's your blood-alcohol content?\" \"Oh, Sh... Oh!! You shouldn't be driving! Okay, cool! Have a nap on the couch\" It's tech with a purpose! Step One : Download the android app! It's free! Step Two : Plug this baby in! Step Three : Follow the instructions! Your android device must support USB hosting. Android 4.0 and up. No battery required to keep charged! No mouth-pieces! Free app! And a miniature size! And quick results!!!!! Listen! Now you got no excuse, alright? Don't be.. \"I'm good, ah! I'll be driving myself home right now.\" You know, we tr.. try to stop Jack over here. The guy's a wild animal! Let's open this baby up! Now, you're probably wondering \"How are you accurately gonna test this little breathalyzer here?\" Well, I have a.. some emergency beers on hand. Here's a... WOW! LOOK! The little carrying case goes in your key-chain as well! That's smart, man! I like when tech solves a problem, especially when it could save some lives! No, seriously! I'm taking a serious note right now! And, here it is! Look at that little guy! WOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW Lil cap for it. Tiny! This just slides right in there. Just like this! Blow in that end, USB on that end. Install the android.. Drink Mate app, okay! Ahhh! This is important! This tells you when you are impaired. 0.16 to 0.20: nausea likely, dysphoria predominant! You're in trouble, man! Nausea is not good. Okay! Let's grab the app! I got the Batman phone here, of course. Look at me. Stylin', Profilin'! Drink Mate, is what I'm looking for. I'm gonna get some beer. That's gonna be important! Oh, man! The anticipation is REAL here! Wait 15 minutes since your last drink before taking the reading. Don't put your mouth on it! Oh, I got it. (Exhales) Right! Okay! Cool! I can do that. Blow softly like you're whistling! Plug in the drink- Eh! This is just.. I wanna get a baseline with no alcohol in my system here. Woah! I feel like a police officer right now! (Exhales) WOOOWWWW! I got it quickly! (Beep) Calculating... ZERO POINT ZERO ZERO!!!! YESSS!! Zero point Zero Zero!!!! And it keeps a record of it. There's even an area to take a picture of what you look like?? Ha... pffff... Ho! (Opens can) Should I just have two? Alright. I'm reading through the little booklet here and I'm noticing that it's probably a better idea. So, I.. I.. I.. Make sure to at least get some kind of reading to have two beers. Rather than one. (Opens can) Two beers deep... And rough of... (Mouth Fart) And roughly a 10 minute wait? No, 12 now. We'll see how much it effects me.. Am I capable of operating a motor vehicle?? (Exhales) Calculating.. (Beep) Oooohhhh! Point Zero Five. I am currently experiencing : Relaxation, Loss of judgement. I can hardly keep it together! Exaggerated behavior.. Bah, lah, lah, lah, lahhh! Slowing of eye focus, decreased alertness, increased euphoric feeling. I feel fantastic! Ahhhmm.. And impaired reasoning! I.. or a guy like Jack. Terrible idea! Technically speaking, I'm still capable of operating a motor vehicle That thing is quick! It's effective, it's tiny! Well, I'll probably put it in my glovebox. Somewhere around there... Get one of these things for your friends!! I'm not even exaggerating when I say, \"It could save a life!\", something like this.",

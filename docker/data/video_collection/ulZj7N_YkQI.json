    "transcript": "(coughs) (laughter) - I got the chalk in my throat. The last time I took a look at a OnePlus phone, I'm gonna be honest. I wasn't really that hyped. When the star of the show they have for phone launch is faster charging, you don't really have the greatest hopes for the coolest device ever. But this time there is genuinely some kit in here that I am actually excited for. OnePlus might finally be a perfect package. And with perfect packages sometimes you get two packages that apparently have sweet things inside of them. Short circuit Anyways. Hi. Hello friend. You probably weren't expecting space ice cream were you? Just a little something to hold you over until March 8th. Oh, wow look at that. Cosmic ice cream. Whoa, ew. what is it? - [David] You've never had space ice cream before? - No! - [David] It's so good! - That's it? That's all we got was ice cream, are you kidding me, OnePlus? (all laughing) should we try the ice cream? - [David] Yeah! - Okay, I'm going to be honest, I'm really a mint chip guy. So we open it up and then we're good, right? It's not going to make a mess? Oh, and there's another packet. Oh, it's leaking. Oh God. - [David] It's still good, though. - Whoa. Wow. It's actually really good. - [David] Right? (coughing) (laughing) I got the chalk in my throat. Eat slow. All right jokes aside, this is what we're actually here for: the OnePlus 9 series media kit featuring Hasselblad. Now that name might not meet a lot to some of you, but to others, this is where OnePlus finally completes the package. They've got the best CPU's now, they've got the best screens, the best pretty much, some of the best of everything, but they've always been missing one thing and it's cameras. I'm sorry, OnePlus, your cameras, they kind of suck. But maybe that changes today. Yeah, I don't, it's cool, but what does this have to do with the phone? It was like last time. What was their tagline? Ultra stops at nothing or something like that. (man laughing) And it's like, okay? Why? I guess I'm like, Oh, right, Hasselblad made the cameras for the space people. If there's one thing, OnePlus is kind of known for in my heart is beautiful packaging and really nice press decks. And I mean, I guess their products are pretty good too. We got the OnePlus 9 series. Your best shot. I wonder if there's more space ice cream in here, do you think? - [David] Yeah. Yeah! - He's like, there's not. (David sighs dejectedly) Just a bunch of accessories, in here, we'll take a look at these in a second. I want to actually get the phones out first. So we actually got both the OnePlus 9 and the OnePlus 9 pro 5G. But we're going to mostly focus on the pro. Now both of these are gonna have similar, better Hasselblad cameras, but the OnePlus 9 pro's definitely got all of the features. Whoa, D brand skin. What, what is this? But I thought this was from OnePlus. Then I just get scared. Colton. Now inside the box, we've got the phone as per usual a bunch of documentation, propaganda, you know the usual stuff, safety information. All right. We don't need any of this crap. And for the rest of the box, wow. We actually get a charger. That's a nice sight. Is that a phone these days? Obviously with OnePlus hyping up their warp charge. It's no doubt that there would be a charger in the box. Get the nice OnePlus cable. And that's pretty much about it. There is something a little special about this charger. It's warped charged 65 T a little bit of an update but we'll give you a little more on that later. Nicely. Nice. Nice. Well look T brand again, those guys, man. So sneaky. All right. It's a little bit different version of the skin. A little bit different version of the phone. All right. I'm seeing some patterns here. I bet you it's got the same things in the box. Whoa. The same things in the box. No way, man. I don't believe it. All right. I'm just gonna put these phones over here because we do still have a few more accessories to take a look at before we actually get into the phone. Now because this is a media kit. You're probably not gonna get any of these accessories with the phone unless you were to apply them, but they do look pretty nice. We've got sort of a carbon fiber looking case. Probably not actually carbon fiber, but it looks cool. And we have the sandstone one, which is just sort of that like grippy ish material that they usually do. All right. And this is another cool thing. We got charge 50 wireless. So this thing will do 50 Watt's wireless charging. Like that's faster than most phones charged, plugged in, not bad. It's got turbine air cooling. And I think this one actually has two separate coils. So regardless of if your phone is vertical or horizontal it'll charge at the same speed, which is really nice. Okay. Well this looks kinda, I don't know Chincy almost, I mean, it's, it's nice. It just looks like it's, out of 2006 or something Why is it shaped like this? I guess it's to make the vertical experience better but it seems like it's just gonna make the horizontal it's it's actually not so bad. It definitely helps with the vertical alignment. So actually I'm okay with that. Oh, you don't get a brick with, Oh I guess you're supposed to just use this brick. Okay. So while we don't have pricing on the new one but the work charter 30 wireless charger was about 100 bucks Canadian. So this is $100 and it doesn't even come with a thing to plug it into the wall. It's kind of disappointing. If you want to have a standalone charging station that doesn't use your stock break you're gonna be spending another 50 bucks Canadian just to get the power adapter. Okay. So the OnePlus 9 pro, it man like the 80 and the, it's really a good form factor. I use the 80 for a couple of weeks and I've switched back to my note 20 officer just cause I liked the biggest screen but man OnePlus really does a good job of making phones feel nice and also very well balanced. It's really got the last gen Samsung fives on the top there. OnePlus has designed this phone around what they call a burden list design. From what I understand, they're really just trying to make their phones feel good in the hand, which they do and also make the OS easier to switch to for people say that are used to other phones or Apple devices it's just meant as an overall encompassing easy experience. And it does feel nice. I haven't really touched the OS, but it feels good. Sure. Looking at the back of the phone, they've definitely moved away from the 8 pros centered justified cameras and switched over to a consistent layout between both of the devices. So you've got the cameras on the left, just like most other modern smartphones. So that's consistent at least. And we can see the stars of the show. Look at those giant cameras. Holy crap. They're massive. There's a no 20 ultra for comparison. Like I mentioned earlier, the cameras here are meant to be the star of the show. This is OnePlus is final redemption. They are fixing the one big problem that always made people go Yeah, OnePlus, Oh, the camera kind of sucks. Hopefully not anymore. For the main shooter, they have a custom built 48 megapixel sensor co engineered with Sony. So that's gonna be, I said, that's a big sensor. It's got two by two on-chip lenses 12 bit raw support and also supports digital overlap HDR. So that's where they take sort of along in a short exposure and mix them together to make it higher dynamic range image as for the ultra wide camera on this phone. That's what OnePlus is really hyping up this time around it's a 50 megapixel F 2.2 which is supposedly the largest sensor and lowest distortion ultra-wide camera ever on a smartphone with their free farm lens. They're saying edge distortion on this camera is around 1% compared to 10 to 20 on your average smartphone, which is wow. A huge improvement. It's also apparently really good for macro photos with the minimum focus distance of only four centimeters down at the bottom. There's a two megapixel monochrome sensor that's meant to add detail to black and white photos. And they also have the eight megapixel F 2.4 telephoto. They've also apparently added a tilt shift mode meant to simulate the sort of like miniature effect. You get out of a tilt shift lens. We've got an led flash there, the autofocus sensor as well as the rear microphone for video it'll shoot AK 30, like most other flagships but it'll also do 4k one 20 and not just in slow mode. So you can actually take that full 4k 120 which is pretty cool. Around the front although you might struggle to see a little bit. We have the front camera which is a 16 megapixel F 2.4 shooter also made by Sony and their goal with this one was to accurately recreate skin tones with that Hasselblad color science but also to not do any skin smoothing, apparently which is a strong departure from like Samsung or anything like that, which is like they are skin smoothing, AAF. Your phone is going to make your skin look fantastic by default, unless you turn that crap off. around the sides we have a physical mute switch. I don't really like the directly opposing volume and power because when you're in your pocket, man you can never figure out which one it is. Why do phone manufacturers keep screwing this up? It's so simple. Put them on the same side or make them textured or put them in different spots like come on guys. But now I guess we get to turn it off. - This video was brought to you by Mine. - Thanks to mine for sponsoring this video.

So check it out at the link below, - like I said earlier, we're gonna be focusing on the 9 pro. So I'm gonna run you through the main differences between the two devices. For battery and charging they have the same battery. They both can do warp charged 65 T but the non-pro is limited to 15 watt charging rather than the warped charge. 50 on the pro the non-pro has a little bit lesser sensor. It's gonna not have a telephoto. So it's just gonna have that monochrome sensor. It doesn't have a rear mic or dedicated focus sensor. It only has regular HDR not the digital overlay HDR that's for displays. The non-pro is a little bit smaller has a little bit lower pixel density. And it also doesn't have the new fluid display which we haven't really gotten into yet. This one has got 120 Hertz. It's still like smart whereas little throttled down to save battery. But this one, it's got some new tech cooking and it's probably a good transition to talk about this display because this is another really cool feature. One of the first things you might notice is the display doesn't quite curve. As much as on the eight people were complaining that you would accidentally touch this and activate the screen, which you don't want to do. When you're watching a movie, it might be kind of annoying. So they're calling this like a micro curved display to reduce miss touches on the side. And it has some new tech that OnePlus is calling fluid display 2.0, it's still has 120 Hertz screen. You're still getting that full refresh rate when you want it. But what's really cool is this display can go down to one hert. That's right. One frame is displayed per second. If you're say looking at some photos we don't have any photos on here looking at some photos or looking at some texts to save battery. So if you're watching a movie, it can go to 24 Hertz. And if you're scrolling through some texts or whatever and you want that beautiful, smooth why I don't have any apps to scroll through but if you want that beautiful smooth 120 Hertz, it will do that. And the last cool innovation is something they're calling hyper touch, which I don't really know if it's going to make that much of a difference but it basically on supported games the screen actually samples at a higher refresh rate. The digitizer will actually run at 360 Hertz rather than say 60 or 30 or 120 which hopefully should give you a little bit better of an input leg advantage. when you're playing pub G mobile half of the people are bots. Cod mobile tool. Sure. Yes. I'm a true mobile gamer. Okay. And all of these features still work with the crazy brightness. You're looking at 1300 nits peak along with excellent color. the stuff that you would expect from a flagship phone. Oh, I just realized, I forgot one thing which is pretty important. The price for the non-pro in the 12 gig, 256 variant you're looking at 829, US for the pro and the 12 256 gig configuration you're looking at 1,069. Of course on the inside of the phone. You're also getting the latest and greatest from Qualcomm. That's the eight 88. That's the fastest CPU you can get in a phone right now. I mean, who knows, but we're gonna run geek bench here against state note 20 ultra. So this is the 865 plus and just see quickly how much faster it is, a million faster. I mean, right off the bat that the test isn't even done yet. And it's already at 70% here, 72% here and 60% here. So I'm just guessing that this one is a little bit faster. Holy mackerel. Wow. That's a huge difference. Holy crap. I didn't know the ADT. It was so fast. All right. We got to look at the camera. Now I'm gonna get some props in here. We can maybe a space-based cream. I mean, it looks pretty good just in the preview. Oh, it goes into like super macro mode and it looks kind of, but then you back up and it like switches back to the main sensor. Whoa, that looks weird. We'll go to the ultra wide switch over to our note 20 ultra. Let me clean off these sensors, new where even near as close and then we'll do a zoom, forgot there's a second phone here. So we'll take a photo regular one. Okay. So the zoom on this one is only a two X but it doesn't have, I have a telephoto. So I'm assuming that this is just digital zoom. Okay. We got to try out the front cameras too man. Look, I can see on the Samsung. It's just smooth. I have all of the stuff turned off and it's still smoothing my goddamn face, definitely looks less grainy although the Samsung phone let's use zoom in a lot more. Oh man. The ultra wide on this is better than the no 20 for sure. Look at the detail on that. All right. So we got both of the phones. We're going to do a little pan here to check out the video, man it just looks, the Samsung looks choppy. This thing looks like butter. This camera looks pretty good. As for the rest of internals, in terms of upgrades you got UFS 3.1 storage super fast. And if you thought they couldn't make charging faster they've made both hardware and software optimizations so that this phone can charge from zero to 100% in 29 minutes, less than half an hour you are getting this phone charged in 30 minutes or less, or your pizza's free. Holy crap sorry, at 31%, it's already gone up a percent just in the few seconds I've been talking. Yeah. Sorry. I've just I've wow. I'm just lost for words so much so that I forgot to tell you guys the capacity. So both of the phones are 4500mAh power, which is this is pretty respectable. Like the moral of the story. These phones charged so fast. It's almost comical. All right guys. Well, at least first impressions. This thing, the camera looks great. The battery charges fast, the screen looks awesome. Like this seems like maybe one of the best flagship, packages you can get now that they figured out the camera either way. I'm super stoked to see what OnePlus has to do in the future. I'd love to try out this phone more. So if you guys want to see a review comment down below and we can we'll maybe do one for LTG. So thank you guys for watching. Make sure you subscribe and hit that bell. So you actually get notifications when we do videos. All right. Little outtake. I just took the skin off. Oh. No. (laughing) All right. Bye.",

    "transcript": "What's up, everyone? I am still in Germany at this point basically on vacation now that the be quiet tour is finished and that Explains the weird background here and the Lackluster audio But I have been using my macbook to find some ridiculous sales online this time the ebay edition First up on our list here, and you've got to ask yourself what on Earth is going through this retailers mind This is a Z97 board from Asus three generations old mind you and they're asking eleven hundred and forty two dollars for it Here's an i7 6950 x ten core Broadwell-E CPU and they want 2500 us are they not aware that you can actually buy the same chip on newegg brand new for sixteen hundred? No this actually isn't too good a deal when you take into account the fact that you can buy a 7900X for actually Cheaper than that now these are both us sellers by the way this person thinks that just because he has a Vega 64 GPU on pre-order He can subsequently charge twelve hundred and forty eight dollars for it. Please do not buy one anywhere near this price This is so bad five hundred and sixteen dollar asking price for a micro Atx Asrock H97 motherboard Here we go Yon Harus from the United States asking thirteen hundred fourteen dollars and 87 cents for his rog Strix GTX 1080. It's not a Ti. It's just a 1080. Oh and in case you're wondering Financing is available this right here is officially the highest priced PC Case anywhere on ebay that I could find and it is the thermaltake level 10 titanium edition Asking price just seven grand here's a delusional mining crazed reseller Evga GTX 1070 nine hundred and Thirty five Dollars not exactly sure what I'm looking at here, but what I can discern looks like a steel case I think it was a buried, dug up and it's into a war zone the power strip on top is just a bonus But hey at least it's got a basement and all of this can be yours for just five hundred us plus seven hundred and ninety Dollars for shipping here's one I teased on Twitter this guy's asking $1200 for an intel Core I3 GTX 750ti Computer build and check this out see he's assuring us that it's a very expensive and reliable PC So it's got to be a great deal. Yeah Oh, and by the way does this cable management remind anyone of a squid? Thanks tony for that one now you can't unsee it I searched ram on ebay and the highest priced item was a Dodge ram 1500 asking price four hundred and fifty Thousand dollars. Here we go real Ram 463 us dollar asking price for a 16 gig kit of laptop grade DDR3. this is being sold from the United States mind you just for kicks here's a $35,000AUS dollar virtue phone equipped with a gold frame and genuine diamonds it's too bad it looks like a nokia from 2005 this is a 1080p alienware monitor bundled with an alienware keyboard and alienware mouse for three Thousand us dollars. Why? because alienware just kidding seriously because alienware here's an i7 4960X for $4,500 nothing more to say here Not exactly sure what's special about this keyboard, but for nearly three and a half grand it better cook me dinner What's more concerning the fact that they've already sold six of these now this one's actually kind of cool So this is an original apple iphone unopened verified by Apple themselves according to the seller four gigabytes Which is supposedly rare than the eight and 16 counterparts because the four was Discontinued when they realize that not many people wanted the four gig variant and the asking price is seventy three hundred Dollars not so sure about that price. It's oddly specific, but it's firm according to the seller I'm not an expert in this realm But who knows? I've got another phone up here to finish things off this one is the LG L52V Probably something you could buy in Walmart for around 50 bucks and the asking price here is 6,495 USD, this one being sold from Anaheim, California. So it seems like as this video series progresses We are managing to find worse and worse deals which to an extent is entertaining That's kind of what these videos have been about it's the purpose of these videos, but their underlying purpose here Is that you should really do your research before you go out and purchase products like these especially from sketchy sellers that aren't mainstream Maybe Amazon or newegg if you're in the states Some other reputable vendor from your country I would say for the most part is going to be pretty reliable when it comes to honest pricing But when it comes to third-party resellers individual sellers even like myself - price check. Check everywhere even if it seems convenient It seems like a good deal at a time. I mean look several people fell for some of these price scams I mean that's literally what they are they're scams, and that's why in a sense. I don't mind exposing these people They're asking outrageous prices, and they're trying to just use the ignorance of the consumer to make a huge profit I was very pleased with the enthusiasm and number of submissions we have for part two of this series Which you can check out right here by the way, so I'm going to open up another Twitter Just chain for all of you to post submissions for part four So what I'm going to do is review all the links that you guys post. I mean it's it's easy for me I'm gonna be honest, so I don't have to do the research you guys are kind of doing it for me I'll review them make sure that they're legit That they're not you know actually good deals, and then I'll give you credit for those links in part four in that video It'll be just like this video. Just like part two and part one so get active on that I appreciate all of the submissions Be sure to donate on patreon if you want to be super cool all that money gets recycled back to the channel Makes videos look better audio sound better stuff like that You can also follow me on Instagram and elsewhere to get a little more involved on Things that aren't youtube related because I want to branch out just just a little bit more if you like this video be sure To give a thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite click the subscribe Button if you haven't already and stay tuned for real science here on the channel. This is science studio. Thanks for learning with us you",

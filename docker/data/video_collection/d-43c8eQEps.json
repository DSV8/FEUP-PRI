    "transcript": "and today we are gonna unbox a TV En OLED TV so lets get into it What's up guys Lew here,back with an another video and this is a big thing you can tell it's an oled TV if you don't know about oled I feel bad for you to get the deepest blacks in say no contrast and color saturation and whatnot this is a 65-inch it's got a little curve to it it's incredibly slim and because it's oled you can check it out from any angle and you have no color shift LG sent this out to me that like Lew we want you to check it out we want you to share it with your people 4k as well you guys know i upload my videos in 4k so maybe we should check out what unboxtherapy looks like on this beast anyhow let's get inside the box that's what you're here for something about opening a new TV try and do this as elegant as possible it is a mess amazing how then this thing is i mean as as thin as I could see a display getting a I'm not sure this next part is the one is a one-man job thanks to the help of jack it's now resting here here's the remote along with batteries and it looks like a standard remote that's what's cool about it if you want to pick it up and use it as a standard remote or maybe your grandma wants to pick it up you know watch some unsolved mysteries guys on top but you remember that oh you're a new age type dude you want to zoom around the web you want to do all those multimedia things you can do that to a hardware as I guess I'll breakout cable for component input i'll be using hdmi break out for composite input some classes as well let me open this up this TV features passive 3d so you don't need powered glasses so you can be super light some clip-ons mounting hardware I'm going to mount the base now and actually give birth well LG gave birth to the baby not me but ok so I've got the TV set up now and to be honest it's striking like once you've got it in front of you on the stand with the curve it's ummm...I don't know the both of us were kind of like wow look at this so as I mentioned before this kinda like a mouse to move around the screen and this little sleeping dude here needs to be woken up apparently well ethernet or Wi-Fi built right in so i'll use Wi-Fi so you got this LG content store here you can see some of the apps youtube netflix important cineplex of course if you go back to your home here you can navigate down here which is pretty cool Spotify live TV as I said there's a built-in web browser smart share this allows you to share to this display from your phone what not let me go ahead and i'm going to log into YouTube real quick this video i'm about to show you is one of my favorites recently what about the black levels Jack who let's go let's go check out the the volume here it's amazing that this is YouTube this is streaming off you YouTube right now there's something about oled where it's almost like your brain is telling you oh this is the way it's always supposed to it should have always looked i do want to see the 4k that was provided to me actually on a on a USB key which i know is 60 megabit per second bit rate so this is a good way I mean this is obviously why they have included it on a USB drive to sort of check out the range the potential range of what this display is capable of we should talk real quick about the ports on this thing because that's going to be of interest to you I assume so over here on the side we've got all of our ports and audio output standard mini jack output is a few USBs including one USB 3.0 l a few hdmi as well three in this location and then on the bottom is the rest of your IO you have an antenna / cable in there is a digital optical out for audio again and then there are the to break out sections if you want to use component or composite and then lastly there's a land port if you don't want to use Wi-Fi if you prefer to use a wired internet connection throw the Box therapy up there good call unbox therapy that was fast it is an incredible rate unboxing that's the best I've ever seen one of our videos never what that's the best for somebody like me to be shooting in 4k where it can't be enjoyed in 4K now you can turn this on and without too much effort at all we enjoying true 4k content what's the weather easy the weather network youtube videos you should probably get out there take a look at this thing and have the experience for yourself so before I take off LG is actually hosting the sweepstakes so you might be able to win one of these I definitely check out the link in the description so you can participate so there you have it a 65 inch oled TV from LG my first oled TV as you can tell i'm excited to throw different sources at it and see exactly how it handles them but so far it's been pretty damn impressive thank

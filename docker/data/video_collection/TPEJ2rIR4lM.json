    "transcript": "- Beep beep. (car sound effects) - Man. Playing with Hot Wheels is so fun, huh? But you know what's even better? The new Hot Wheels Rift Rally, the sponsor for this video and Hot Wheels wanted us to check out their new experience which combines like a AAA racing game experience with a Next Gen mixed reality doing this thing, basically. How often do we get to unbox just like literal toys? Jake, we should do this more. Okay, we got a quick start guide. It's basically saying that you can either use this as an iPhone app and play like with a controller or is there a touch controls? There's touch controls, or you can play on a PS4 or PS five, like just sitting on the couch. Now, some of you might be confused about what the heck is going on here. In this box is a car. This is called the Chameleon. It's a Hot Wheels car but it's much bigger than a regular Hot Wheels car. That's difference number one. Difference number two, there's a camera on the front and that's because, like I said earlier this is a mixed reality experience. That camera is gonna perceive the world around it like an animal with eyes. But in this case (camera person laughing) This thing is gonna drive wherever you want it to but it's gonna send the video to either your phone or your console and then you'll be able to control the actual physical car from wherever you're controlling it from. Now you're not just gonna be driving this thing through your house and you know having exciting races around the oven or something. Although that does sound great. The app also overlays over the top tracks and cool Hot Wheels graphics into the game. Things are gonna get pretty wild. Hot. You could say. It looks like a fast car. I'll say that, but it's called the Chameleon because you'll actually be able to select different cars in the game. And from your view that car will be overlaid on top of this one. You know you don't have to drive the same car every single time. So I noticed on this side there's this little swivel bit and that covers up the USB charging port. Apparently this guy is gonna take two and a half hours to charge, and right next to that is the pairing button slash power button. We also have lights here, some LED lights. I think when I pressed that, it went red. So I guess that means that you're pressing the power button and then it's off. It was blue earlier so I think maybe it's blue in pairing mode. You'll find all this out when you play with me, but first we gotta find out what else is in this box because you need it. What else we got? We got these little foot thingies that I think are going to hold these gates. So they're going to be detected. The symbols on here are gonna be detected by the camera and it's gonna know where it is on the track depending on that. This is gate number two, the best gate. There are four of these gates in the box. So that's what you got to work with when you're building your track. Okay, we got our four gates set up. We got the This guy's raring to go and we got the app installed. So it's time to set up our track. V, the floating robot guy is telling me that when the chameleon, when it stands in for another car whatever car you choose, this will gain its performance. So it's top speed, acceleration, breaking everything. Your life is about to change Little chameleon. The chameleon needs to decode mystery programs to learn to transform itself into other cars. Okay, so you like you're unlocking different models of Hot Wheels cars. Whoa, he's really Wow! That took a lot out of him. You could tell. Okay, I'm decoding a new car. Decoding! Oh, that was so hard. I had to use all my skills. Bone Shaker! I need to do the training, which is in the campaign. Before I get any info about the car there's like a campaign. There's like a story in here? It's like a narrative. So it looks like with wifi connection mode you'll be able to connect to the car as long as the car and you are within range of your wifi network. Makes sense. But you can also do a direct connection mode where you don't have to stay within the the bounds of your wifi network. However, the overall range, how far away from you your car can get is smaller. What's also nice is that the Rift Rally system supports cross play. So while you're playing on an like an iPhone or an iOS device you can play with someone who's not playing on that playing on like a PS4 or PS five or something. So to pair your chameleon car you hold the pairing button until it starts pulsing blue and then you have to point the camera at the QR code. Comes up on screen. Did you see that? Did you see the lights? Oh, it's green! It's blue! Launch activity. - Oh! Look at that. It looks like we're connected, says V. Oh, what a messy room! Sassy unnecessarily. Why? Let's take the chameleon for a spin. Okay, this looks really cool. I just wanna use it for this. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - All right. I'm glad that it's only going that fast - Because on the screen it, it feels like you're going a lot faster. Oh, oh, slow down! Crazy human. - Don't step - On my, on my bone shaker. David, look - It's coming! - I'm gonna about to do a sick trick. - Let's go! Oh! What's up? - Nice moves. Try another. Okay, I'm gonna try tilt controls Oh! - Wow. Tilt. Tilt is not, tilt is not the way to go. Hmm? What happens if you hold both gas and break at the same time? - Oh, oh - This, this happens. Cough. Cough. That must be why they call them hot wheels. You can boost to inject the rift engine with, oh it's a rift engine. When your rift energy is low, you can recharge it with a bit of wild driving by causing the chameleon to drift. It says that the rear wheels will lose grip and the car will begin to drift. I'm skeptical, but we're gonna have to see. All right, here we go. There we go. There we go. Can't you see? Does it look like I'm drifting? No. Your chameleon has different gear settings and you can toggle with the gear selector low gear gives better handling high gear faster. I'm in high gear now. We were, it was child's play before. Oh, wow. This is actually quite a bit faster. Training completed. Time to build a track. There's two. Then we're gonna have a little bit of a loop here. We're gonna use this. - Yeah? - Guys, I have to confess something. I'm not a racetrack designer. I don't know what the left side - The port and Starbird in racing - Racing V wants me to meet them at gate one. I got a little date. Gate one. There it is. But I'm back as the chameleon car. I wanted to be Bone Shaker. That's fine. All right. Whoa, this track has a giant statue of an amazing cameraman. Great job, David. Drive through gate three over here. Yeah, that's a bit of a loop. Whoa - Oof. - I think I will go back to tap controls, four. Return to V in front of gate one or be punished. Oh, okay. And now I made a track. New track built. Here's a new track. Are you ready to use it? You can like change how intensely the track shows up in augmented reality. So if you want to be like I I am driving more in the real world you can fade it out a little bit or bring it in. I kind of want it in all the way. Yeah. Okay. Use track, training completed. Yes, Dragon scrapyard. Okay. All I gotta do is finish in second and hit three or fewer penalty pads. Launch. Oh, okay. Bone shaker! Oh, here we go. 3, 2, 1 - Go. Ooh. - Wow. This track has some, oh, there's people here with me. There's people! - Oh my goodness. Oh, you get like a little boost. Oh, see, this is, oh, you get a little boost if you stay on the the Hot Wheels track. That's interesting. - Let's go. Let's go. - Okay. I'm not drifting at all. We're gonna do a real drift here. [David}- You guys should cheer in the background. Yes. - Oh, no, I'm completely losing. The cheering did not help. It made things worse. So there's the other racer. There's, oh no, here we go. And here's the drift. Go! It was a good drift though. It was a good drift, Brent. Where am I? I'm completely lost. I forgot to look at the real world. I got lost in the sauce. David, I know you don't believe in me, but I'm gonna do it, okay? - You can't do it! It's like Dad always said. - No, dad would say, I can do it. There. Finished. Did I win? So I was supposed to finish in second and hit three or fewer penalty pads. I got fourth and I didn't do, I didn't, I didn't do well. - How many penalty pads? - I don't think any. I don't know what that is. But the important thing is I had fun. Thanks again to Hot Wheels Rift Rally for sponsoring this video. It was a lot of fun.

    "description": "AMD's Vega 56 has been out for almost a year and now that prices have come down, we decided to run some updated performance tests to see if Radeon fans should finally buy it or save some money and grab the RX 580. Also, since NVIDIA's GTX 1070's price lies right between these two, we decided to throw it into the benchmark comparison too.

    "transcript": "hello people I'm Dmitry and if I look slanted to you it's because I pulled my neck over the weekend so I'll potentially try to correct it and post my weird posture but today let's talk about AMD Radeon because during this interesting position where the rx 580 which was launched in 2017 is basically a rebrand of the 480 that is about two years old now but then the Vega 56 and the 64 were launched of August of 2017 so almost a year from today but you know if you were to potentially buy an AMD card in 2018 does it make any sense and what's interesting about this lineup is that we have the RX 580 which is around $300 and then we have the Vega 56 which is around $500 so there's that giant gap of $200 and literally nothing in between from the red team to satisfy that entire gap price-wise and performance wise which is where the gtx 1070 comes into play at around $400 so price-wise it slides right in between the RX 580 and the Vega 56 I have all three cards in-house let's do the benchmarks right after this the new t46 caliber ddr4 memory is one unique RGB kit with awesome light spill from each module and the special edition has a cool totem design on the light bar you get lifetime warranty up to 4,000 megahertz speeds and full lighting control through the software check out the t46 caliber ramp down below now the reason why we're having this conversation is because prices for GPUs have come down the market is stabilizing prices are still inflated versus launch prices but they're not as inflated as they were a year ago because of mining and so if you are rooting team red then the RX 580 and the Vega 56 are kind of like your obvious choices so we have the Vega 56 pulse from sapphire it's a two and a half slot card so it's got a beefy cooler the fans don't spin it has eight gigabytes of HBM to memory and it is slightly overclocked verses reference and then the RX 580 this is the phantom gaming from ASROCK so this one's also overclocked out of the factory by round 95 megahertz not significant but still nice to have it's got eight gigabytes of gddr5 memory and it's a nice compact cooller so hopefully they perform well no I will say the dual offense on a Vega card are located in one of the worst spots right in the center so routing your cables in a clean manner is almost impossible and for the gtx 1070 and have the founders edition and i'm running all these cards at stock so let's begin with the benchmarks now just to cover my bases I'm only running the benchmarks for the game stead I'm currently playing and we're running this on 8700K at 4.2 gigahertz so there is no CPU bottleneck with 16 gigabytes of RAM at 3600 megahertz let's begin so starting with csgo I'm running everything at 1440p and highest settings you probably won't be running high settings with this game because you want to maximize your framerate but we are achieving almost 250 frames on the GTX 970 but look at how much better the lower 1% is on the Vega card versus the green team moving on to Far Cry 5 so the GTX 970 is faster and average but again we have the same behavior with much better lower one percent on the Vega card we're seeing the same behavior with squad so better lower one percent on the Vega card but it matches to the GTX 970 for the average frame rates jumping you to The Witcher 3 the GTX 970 easily beats the Vega card the same thing with overwatch so much higher averages for the GTX 970 and look at that lower 1% it matches to the average as the Vega card so yeah and the only game I play right now where Vega pulls ahead is doom so about 9 frames higher an average but the lower 1% are basically identical and the one interesting observation is that giant performance gap between the RX 580 and the Vega 56 and there's literally nothing price-wise and performance wise from AMD to fill that space which is where the gtx 1070 comes in because it's priced cheaper than the vega 56 but slightly higher than the RX 580 but it outperforms both those cards and pretty much every title but the one thing you have to consider is freesync versus g-sync freesync monitors are much cheaper so if you're going towards the start of free gaming experience with the aim these side of things you are spending less money overall I would say versus going with g-sync display that is more expensive but getting it slightly cheaper GPU that is more powerful so they kind of balance each other out but the one thing that really surprised me is adobe premiere performance with AMD cards and how much worse it has gotten after the latest updates you can watch the full video here but Adobe added quick sync support which can use the integrated graphics on your Intel CPU to accelerate encoding and so my 8700 K has an Intel HD 630 so that can be used while you're outputting rendering a video file so it can use the CUDA acceleration on the Nvidia card and OpenCL acceleration through the integrated graphics but the aim these side of things use OpenCL acceleration because it doesn't have CUDA and so the premier uses the integrated graphics instead of your GPU when you have hardware acceleration enabled through OpenCL therefore making things much slower to export because the AMD card is not even utilized at all whereas the integrated graphics is being used for that OpenCL acceleration and so that really sucks for premier users who are on AMD cards with an Intel CPU because premiere will not use your graphics card they'll just use the integrated graphics on the processor instead and looking in the big picture I feel like aim the Radeon is going to be in a difficult position you know I included the gtx 1070 because it's cheaper than the vega 56 so it slides right in between the 580 the RX 580 and the vega 56 but it outperforms those two cards and the roaming rumors of potentially a new Nvidia card launch soon you know that really kind of corners AMD to a really bad value proposition market wise one of the best gaming headsets is now available through mass drop the PC 3 7 X has fantastic drivers incredible comfort and the best microphone in the class plus they look awesome for a gaming headset check out the drop link below alright guys I would love to hear what you think about this whole aim D Radeon situation they are in a little bit of a pickle but if you were to stick with team red the RX 580 is a good 1080p card to find it on sale you won't be disappointed it's pretty powerful for 1080p stuff while the Vega 56 so this thing is the beast for the price point the unfortunate thing is that gtx 1070 is more powerful than this guy and it's also cheaper but if you are going for team red then the Vega 56 is kind of a no-brainer alright guys I hope you enjoyed this one let me know which card you're rocking right now and potentially are thinking of upgrading are you looking forward to new in video cards if they come out or you're looking to buy something from existing AMD pool let me know in the comments make sure to check out this other relevant content check out our new boot sequence channel and we'll see you in the next video",

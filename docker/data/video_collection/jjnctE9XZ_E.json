    "transcript": "- I personally look for what kind of passion or the hunger that the person has no matter what kind of question is thrown at this person. (intense upbeat music) - Hi everyone, it's David Bombal, back with a very special guest. I'm really excited about this interview. I know a lot of you live in India, large Indian audience watching my videos, and I really wanna thank you for that. I wanna change sort of the video today and invite a very special guest from India. Pallavi, welcome. - Thank you, David. It's an honor to be here. Looking forward to our conversation. - Yeah, very much so. So tell the audience and tell me a bit about yourself and why you can speak to the very special topic that we're gonna talk about today, which is, why are Indian people so successful in Silicon Valley, and how can you advise someone who wants to be successful like you? - Thank you very much for saying those kind words. I think success is something that you probably define for yourself, and I always keep looking up and thinking that I have so much more to do and I'm really not that successful. But I guess it depends really on the perspective, but thank you for those kind words. Just a little bit about myself. Pallavi Srinivasa is my full name. I've done bachelors of engineering, I went to the US to study masters, then joined Cisco as a user experience engineer in a customer advocacy group and at a time when I had to explain what user-centered design meant or what human factors engineering meant to my friends, my family, my colleagues. It was a fantastic uphill battle. When I started studying this in the university, I really felt that this was really nice subject because you had to not only learn about technology, you had to also understand about the users that will be using technology. But when I got to the real world, I was like, man, uphill battle is fine, but this is too much of an uphill battle. But it was fun, challenging, but very fun. And then I realized that someday, I wanna run a business. I wanna be able to own a business. How do I get to that space? Since I was at Cisco and I was part of the user experience in the engineering group, I had to know about what Cisco is doing, the networking domain, and things like that. But to get into the core aspect of Cisco, I went and studied, you know, took up CCNA, CCNP, even went... So by the time I completed CCNA and CCNP, I was also talking in parallel to our engineering groups, technical marketing engineering division to get into that group. And people had seen my work on the user experience front. I had few supporters, and they felt that I could do the job of technical marketing engineer. And I got a role within Cisco after a couple of certifications. Then I thought I should do CCIE. And I keep saying this, I don't know how you wanna take it, but I keep saying I'm a CCIE fail. Whenever people say, do you have a CCIE? I say, the CCIE fail count. - You paid for that very expensive lunch at Cisco. - Yes. (Pallavi laughs) (David laughs) I just realized I didn't practice it well and I'm not that fast, right? It's not about the difficulty of questions. It's about how fast you can figure it out and get it done. But then I was also in parallel, talking to other organizations, and had an opportunity to become a product manager with a fantastic product line, Catalyst 6500. - A very famous one, yeah. - Very famous one and had that opportunity. I'm very grateful for that. Got to learn from so many people such brilliant minds in that group. I was also a product manager for Catalyst 4500. And this was all, you know, once I started in the US, this was all the work experience in the US. By this time, it was almost a decade that I had started working at Cisco and a lot of things had changed personally as well. And then there was a very critical, personal reason for which we had to move to India. And when I moved back to India, the thought process in my mind was, I like being responsible for a business. I like the numbers aspect. I like working with customers. And at that time, this was about more than a decade back. At that time, in India, if you're talking about the tech world, it's engineering or sales. There was no product management as such. Since I liked the customer aspect, I said, why don't I look at the sales division? And again, after pursuing for a few months, I was able to get into sales as a specialist selling data center products because of the background that I had. It's such a fun experience then when you think that you've... I'm born and brought up in Bangalore, I was coming back to Bangalore, and in my mind was thinking, oh, working in Bangalore should be a piece of cake. What I didn't realize was I didn't grow up in India as an adult. By the time, when legally you're an adult, I was in the US studying. I hadn't really worked in India and being in sales gives you the true, true exposure to what it is in working in India. You go explain technology to the customer, you go talk to them about it, you will understand their business, and they all sit and talk to you. They mean well, and at the end of the day, they say, how much does it cost? - That's a big question. - And it's an important factor. I mean, across the world, it is, more so in India, right? - Yeah. - So you sit there and go, oh my God. I spoke so much and this is the end question. So it was a very, very learning experience, and by that, I mean that particular year that I was in sales, Indian Cisco sales didn't do very well, of course, due to macroeconomic situation, not because of the sales team. So that's why I keep calling it a learning year. When your revenues are not growing, you have to go to every single customer and talk to them about these things and you understand human personalities in those times. So that gave me a huge exposure. And then I looked at what else can I do? And in terms of market strategy, business development was opening up back in the business unit in Cisco, India. So I moved back, had a fantastic manager as an SVP of engineering who guided in many ways. And then, I had an opportunity to again, be part of the team that launched intern-based networking with Catalyst 9K. - Wow. Yeah. - And now I'm looking at the ultra low end business within Cisco, which I guess there's very few people that are aware of it. It's a Cisco business product line, and looking at that and figuring out how do we grow that market for Cisco. And as we're digitized more and more, how do we increase that pie for everybody? So that's my journey, David. - No, no, I love it. What I really like about it is you've done many things at Cisco and you've seen many changes and you've worked with many people, and I think there's a lot of experience that I wanna tap into to try and help the next generation, help people who are just starting their journey. Before we get there, I need to ask you this really important question. Why are Indians so successful in tech and so successful in the US? Twitter's just got a new CEO. We've got Microsoft, we've got all of these tech titans, if you like, Google and so forth that are run by Indian people. So why is that? - I don't know if we wanna say Indians per se are successful. But I sort of attribute this to the... And I see that more, even in India. Well, when you look at a population in a certain city or state, for example, Mumbai or Bangalore, in these bigger cities, you have an immigrant population, and I call that immigrant in a loose sense of the word, as in people coming from their native place, moving into this city that they're completely in and better off, right? - Yeah. - So usually, these personalities have this hunger of, I wanna grow beyond where I am right now. I'm not happy with the state that I am in. - Yeah. - Whether it's good or bad, I don't know, but that's the mentality of these people. And I've seen that consistently, even in the US. And I would not attribute just to Indians. I've seen other nationalities as well, right? And even there are folks locally as well who have that hunger mindset. But I think that mindset that really helps you because when your hunger still remains and you're figuring out how do I figure this entire ecosystem, apply myself, and get to that next level. So it's always about how do I get to the next level. So I think that sort of mindset and applying themselves and constant group mindset sort of gets people there. Also the education importance that Indian middle class have always offered, right? It's always about my parents never mattered with what I'm doing, what I'm studying, but we will not get into this, but we wanna make sure that you are coming out ahead. You're realizing your potential, right? You have the capacity to get at least in the top 10 in your class. If you're not doing that, then there's something wrong. So they're pretty strict about that. And that's generally across majority of the middle class in India. And that's what you're seeing in some of these folks that have gotten to that and that sort of stays in your brain and combined with hunger, you continue to see how can I do more and how can I contribute more as you grow. I think that's what's probably getting it to this level. - It's funny 'cause when I was doing some research for this interview, I was looking and I understand there's many other nationalities that are very successful in the US. But it seems there's this overwhelming percentage of H-1B visas in the US that go to Indians and there's a huge intake, you know, Silicon Valley, there's a huge Indian success rate, if you like. And one of those traits is humility. And I see that straight away in yourself. It seems that Indian people tend to be more humble, more approachable. Some of the guys were saying in these sort of discussions that you get some leaders that are very arrogant perhaps, and we won't point fingers, but there's a trait with Indian leaders that they are very humble and they used to working with a lots of different cultures and lots of different people and that really helps. So do you think that's true? - I think there's (laughs) I think it's a mix. Yes, I mean, for the majority, for the most part, you will find people who are humble because respecting elders, respecting your peers, all of that is an important part of Indian culture. You're not allowed to... You are to address your relatives with that relationship name, not with their name. - Yeah. - Right? So it's sort of inculcate. I'm sure Southeast Asia has that culture. But I myself, I've seen my personality evolve where I went from introvert to figuring out how do I present myself? How do I bring my voice? How do I find my voice? And sort of present it in a way where I come across as confident in what I'm saying, but at the same time, I'm not offending others. Of course, sometimes some of the folks that have worked with me have different names for me, but it's always good humor. - It's always like that. It's always like that. - Yes. - It's you can't please everyone. Yeah, and I mean, another meme is like, it's interesting what you said about your parents, but there's this joke that, and I haven't been in India, so I don't know. So this is why it's great to talk to you and a real story. You can study anything as long as you're a doctor or an engineer. That seems to be like one of the memes that goes around. So is that true? - Yes. It definitely was the case. That's a belief, I guess, I grew up in. My dad was slightly different in that he was about if you're studying well to study what you are capable of. If you get an engineering seat, it's okay. If you get a medical seat, it's okay. If you don't, then there are other streams you can study and you'd be something. I think more than that, my mother was always about, you've got to be independent financially. So that was her statement to both with three siblings, to my sister and I. Of course, my brother, there's an expectation that you will work anyways, right? That is what motivated me and it still sort of stuck in my head, the financial independence. But I never had that pressure, but I have seen most of the parents talking about engineering or doctor, and David, that mainly comes from the fact that we didn't have a lot of privatization when we were growing up, right? India was slowly opening up and people wanted their kids to be in a better position than they are. Engineering degree and doctor degree gave you that better financial status in the society. And it all stems from that. So yes, that was thing. And now I think those parents are giving a little bit of... So it's the next step, right? Little bit of more freedom to their kids in terms of choosing what they want to do in life. So let me ask you this. If I am a young person and we can do it at different ages, but let's say I'm 18 or I am deciding what to study or I've finished college and I've decided to do engineering or something, what would be your advice? So if you were advising young people today, 'cause I believe you interview a lot of people and have over the years, what would you advise them to do? Is it like focus on something? Just give us your advice. How can I as a young person be successful? If I put myself in the shoes of a young person and you do the same, what would you advise us to do? - It's a no brainer that we have access to a lot of information, right? Now how do you leverage that information and how do you apply yourself? I think that becomes a differentiating aspect for a young person who's applying for a job. When we talk to many of these college candidates, at least I personally look for how hunger, what kind of passion or the hunger that person has no matter what kind of question is thrown at this person. And what's the thought process that they take to answer those questions? What framework do they use? And things like that. The technology and everything else can be taught, that is for your domain, and those things continuously change. Even we are learning things these days, right? Even after being in this industry for a long time, you continuously learn and certify yourself. But in terms of how hungry are you to do this, what are your creativeness in terms of answering these questions? What's your thought process? Those are the things that are being looked at most of the times. When I speak to my engineering leadership or even our own leadership, those are the aspects that they look for. For an 18-year-old, I think there's plethora of opportunities with the open source world. They can write their own programs and start selling those to many of the websites, right? And they can make a whole lot of money there. And when you showcase that kind of entrepreneurship, I think there's the opportunity is boundless regardless of where you are. - I've interviewed a lot of people and they've said exactly the same. You need to get your work out there. The world isn't the way it was many years ago. Now you can put your stuff on GitHub. You can create YouTube videos. You can do things. It sounds like you're suggesting exactly the same. Get your stuff out there. It doesn't matter how old you are. - If you're talking, you said there are people even from India that are asking you questions on how do I do this, right? - Yeah. - And it's sort of depending on your personality, it's a tough thing to do, getting your work out there, and talking about yourself. It's very, very difficult. Even for an extra word, talking about yourself most of the time is just something that people don't wanna do. But unfortunately, if we get a resume, the first thing that you go do is look at LinkedIn. Look at any other published work that's out there, right? So you have to do it in a way where your authentic self shows up. You're not just publishing things that you have not done or you're not talking about things that you have not done. Believe in your authentic self, don't be too ostentatious, but at the same time, talk about what you have done. It is possible. Even I'm trying to find that middle ground because being in product management and product marketing, I need to be able to talk about my survey on LinkedIn or YouTube and I've not done that. It's just something that just doesn't come to you naturally. You have to make it a forced function. But that's how the world is viewing people these days and you have to play that game. - So you would suggest, like, let's say I've just finished university and even if I'm at university, I should get my LinkedIn profile up to date. I should put stuff on LinkedIn that I'm doing because you as an employer are gonna go and look at LinkedIn. Is that right? - What I've seen some of the, especially people coming out of bachelor of engineering, they talk about there is a project work that you get to do in the eighth sem, seventh or eighth sem, and people just talk about that in few lines. That is so 1990s. Of late, people wanna see what have you done during those not the first year but the three years of engineering? Have you started learning something that pertains to my job? Have you showcased your work anywhere? Whether it's for free, for money, it doesn't matter. But have you worked on something outside of the college required projects, right? Those are the things that people look for. - In your interviews and when your team interviews people, what are the outstanding things in a candidate that you would look for? You've mentioned hunger. You've mentioned that twice now. They need to be hungry. Is there anything else that when you interview a candidate, you think, okay, this is the person I wanna hire because they did something? So are there any sort of highlights or things that outstanding candidates do that you would wanna mention for someone who's preparing for an interview? - In our case, for product management, we look for people with a little bit more experience. We don't hire straight out of engineering colleges. We look for candidates who have done some of the work, either in a corporate world or on their own and just by way of filtering criteria, we'll go to MBA schools, but as a hiring manager, I've never made that a mandatory requirement because I myself do not have an MBA degree. What we look for is how do they think to a certain problem? And in terms of business acumen, have they understood pertaining to, for example, if I take Cisco product management aspect, have they understood what it means when we talk about revenue, what it means when we talk about margin, what it means when we talk about go to market, what does it mean when we talk about a product strategy? Are they confusing with just day-to-day activities? Are they confusing that with certain specific products? Or are they able to take a step back and look at the big picture? That's one aspect. The other aspect is their personality itself. How well are they able to put forward their thoughts? How well are they able to articulate? And how positive are they about this? If they're just drawing on and on. (David laughs) I've heard candidates like that, and I'm like, do you really want to talk to me? I'm not so sure if you want the job. So yeah, and if they have come prepared, there are many candidates and being in India, you don't get a whole lot of people with networking background, mainly because we don't have that many networking companies in India, right? I've received candidature from different companies and even from chemical engineering, from manufacturing world. But if they have done the homework to know what Cisco is and whatever their opinion and viewpoints on how they wanna take certain strategy to the next level or if they have any feedback and thought processes, that is very, very well-appreciated. So doing your homework, being proactive is very much appreciated. - In an interview, it sounds like one of the first things is you must be hungry, you have to be prepared. It's a bad idea to like go to 100 interviews. You should try when you go to an interview, be prepared for that specific job. So know what the company's about. I think some people make the mistake. They just get a job or get a job application and just arrive, and that's a big mistake. In India, are there any sort of tips with regards to basic stuff? Do you have to dress a certain way? Do you have to do things a certain way? What are like sort of tips for someone who, you know, they might be really nervous. Just from your experience, how would I approach a job to be successful? Obviously, be prepared, be hungry. Are there any other tips that you can give someone? - Yeah, I mean, dress professionally. Try to articulate well, because whether you like it or not, people do subconsciously monitor the language that the other person is using, although we sometimes consciously say that it's okay. It's not that big of a deal. We can manage with that. So dress professionally, nothing too fancy, and articulate your thoughts well, and be confident about whatever you are putting it across. If you don't know something, be straightforward about it and say, this is not something that I have looked at, but here is how I would solve it if I were to think about this, and that's okay to, that's perfectly fine. If you try to circumvent that and come across in a way where I know everything and I'm gonna solve it like this, people will see through that. So be your authentic self and just appear professional. - I'm really glad you said that because I think a lot of people are nervous to say they don't know the answer. But I think for us who've been in the game for a long time, it's impossible to know everything. So from what you're telling me, it's not knowing the answer that's important. It's the process of thinking through or how to handle something that you don't know that's more important? Is that right? - And I learned, believe it or not, I used to think when I was studying engineering that I should know all the answers. And I would get really scared if I didn't know the answer. I remember going into oral. There's a part of the exam that has oral, and we used to call it yver, and I used to be very scared if I didn't know an answer to a question, and I learned it from some of the toppers in my class. I would come back and say, crap, I didn't answer that well. I didn't know the answer to that question and I was like, it's Doomsday and all of that stuff and they would tell me that, why should you know the answer for everything? And no one knows. Just tell them you don't know and be done with it. So I learned it from my classmates and from my college mates and that played a huge role in how I grew up. - I mean, that's so important. You can't know everything. I mean, for me, like personally, knowing how to use Google is a really important skill because I mean, to find like information on sort of even access points or switches on Cisco's website, I mean, you can't know all those details. You just need to know how to find the information. From what you've told me, hunger, you need to be prepared, you should be yourself, you've mentioned that a few times, the authentic self. When you say authentic self, it means just be who you are because people will see through you. Is that right? If you pretend to be something you're not. - See through yourself is one thing, but for your own self, for your own sake, if you pretend to be someone and because you want that particular role or that particular job, you yourself will soon realize after one or two years, this is not something I wanna do and you'll find yourself miserable in that particular role. 20 years back when jobs were not that easy to come by, you could still convince yourself that I will get through this for financial reasons or for whatever other reasons for a few years and then I will do something that fits me well. But you don't have that kind of situation right now. It doesn't matter whether you're looking at metros or you're looking at tier two and tier three cities. There are so many opportunities in India that you just have to figure out based on the information that's available, what is it that pulls you the most? I mean, not all aspects of that role you may like, but you should look at it and think about yourself. Yes, I could be in that for two, three years, and that's about the time. Then after that, you probably get fatigue and want to do something else. But you will be more miserable than worrying about whether others see through you or not. But yes, others are going to see through. - You don't wanna do something every day that you hate. I always like to say, try and do what you love, 'cause people always ask me this question. David, should I do cybersecurity? Should I do networking? Should I do cloud? And the answer is you should do what's right for you, I would say. - You see if you can get an opportunity in that space, try it for a year or two, and you will figure it out whether you like it or not, or you may figure out some substreams in that that you may like. So unless you try it out, you may not know for most of us, people like us. But there are some people who are extremely clear. I am jealous of them. They know exactly what they wanna do, so... - Yeah, exactly. I mean, and I think it's really important what you've said then, also like your career path. You've done many things. I get a lot of questions on YouTube and other places from younger people and they want know exactly the path in life. And it's not like straight, is it? It's like it's often a walk like this and I like what you've said that if you try something and you don't enjoy it after a year or two, there's no shame in trying something else. Our careers are not a straight line. We can do many, many things, and you've done a lot of things in your life. - And if you see many of the leader, many of the people, the CEOs, the senior vice presidents, they have done so many things. And most of them, when I hear them, they say, broaden your base, learn about different aspects, and then try to grow. Whatever works for you, however, and opportunities will present itself. That's one of the things that happened to me, right? Opportunities in certain cases presented themselves and I grabbed those opportunities. Maybe I was at the right place at the right time. There may be others thinking, why did she get it and why didn't I get it? Who knows the answer to those things? But when the opportunities present themselves, give it a try. Who knows where it takes you? And you all know, I'll keep saying that the industry will remain the same. It's all about the skillset and you will have to continuously educate yourself, reinvent yourself, and pace is getting that much more faster as the years go by. So don't be afraid of this or don't be ashamed of it. - So I mean, have you ever felt imposter syndrome? Have you ever felt that you're not? Some people feel they're not the right person for that job. Like, some people say I won't get this job, 'cause I don't feel I'm 100% ready for it. Would you say no, go for it, even if you don't feel you're 100% right for it. - Yeah, many people have come and asked me that. Sometimes you also, when you look at a job description, you go, will they hire me because I've not done this, I've not done this, and I've not done this? Thankfully, I had mentors early on in my life who told me that you don't worry about those things. It's hiring manager's headache. You want that job, you go ask for it, and you go interview for that. That you do your part. Let them figure out whether you're ready for it or not, because when you go speak to them, your personality comes out and what you want to do for that job comes out and why you wanna do that job comes out, right, more than what your qualifications are. So that plays a very important part in an interview and for hiring managers. So I had excellent mentors and I continue to have that, and I have a good conversation with my husband as well. So we discuss a lot career-wise between him and I. So I think the advisor I got early on was you don't worry about what you want. If you have at least 50 to 60%, just go talk to them because no one has 100% of the qualifications. Hiring managers put all of that because that's their dream worker. You have to deal with what you get in the pool, right? And I advise the same to many people who come to me, especially since I'm in product management. There is a notion amongst people and especially women that means that's a travel job, and I have a family, will I be able to do it? How many travels a month? How many travels a quarter? And so on and so forth. So I've always advised that you don't overthink it, right? Don't think about several years down the road, assuming that you've already got a job. Show your passion for the job, show the fact that you want that job, and here is your preparation for that. Travel is one aspect of product management. So you go and have a conversation once the hiring manager thinks you are the right person, then have a conversion about all these things. And usually, most likely than not, many people are flexible, right? If the candidate is right, many people are flexible. So I just feel that sometimes we overthink ourselves and then be a blocker or our own blockers more than anybody else. - And I think that's exactly right. I mean, you've gotta believe in yourself and so the figure that you used was on a job application, if they have a whole bunch of things, if you've got 50 to 60% of those, then go for it. Is that what you said? - Whenever I discuss this with few of my colleagues, both men and women, they say, you know what? Those boys, they thought they could do 20% of it and they just went and applied for it. And this girl, she was standing there and thinking that she had 80%, she didn't have the 20% and she didn't want to apply. I didn't know this, but apparently, people do that. So that's why I take that and I keep advising to folks that just sort of unequally to both. Even men come and say, oh, there's a lot of travel involved and I have a family and I may not be able to do that. It's the same advice to both of them. - I think it's really important because I've looked at job applications, entry level network engineer, CCIE, and I mean, that's the standing joke. It's like, what do you mean entry level with CCIE? It sounds like a lot of these job applications, like you said, are just a wishlist and you mustn't let that stop you. So tell me about the job market in India. You've said it's a lot hot, if you like, or it's a lot busier than it was. So are there a lot of opportunities for young people if they wanna get into IT field? And let's use Cisco as an example. I mean, it's a big tech company. Are there a lot of opportunities? How would someone go about finding a job? - I mean, not just Cisco alone. There are many multinational companies, many Indian origin companies, many, many startups. There are bunch of opportunities than they can find a skillset match for. So I think the obviously, LinkedIn, and I'm not a promoter for LinkedIn, but that's what I use a lot and many other job-hunting websites. I think the important thing is don't just post one resume and think that you will be able to get a job, because there are hundreds of people. We have a lot of population. Of course we have a lot of jobs, but at the same time, people wanting to get to that are also many. So just posting one, one resume, thinking that we will be able to get that job should not be your attitude. What I would recommend is look for all of these, first, the internet piece. Look for all of these websites and make sure you're uploading your standard resume. And then go look for the companies which are your dream companies and then maybe even in your dreams, you have higher dreams, you have mid-tier dreams. So look for those companies and look for the kind of roles that they have available and tailor your resume to that and post it on their portal as well. Then the most important aspect is get hold of either your friend or friend's friend, anybody that works in that company who can forward this resume, because the companies always give more way to the resumes that come through their employees than just a pool, because when it comes from a pool, they're looking for keyword searches. That's a core thing where you make sure for that particular role that you're applying while you're tenuring, your keywords match the role that they have. So when all of these don't work, don't lose hope. Rinse and repeat. You will be able to get a job that you're looking for. It may not be that dream job right away, but there will be, if you aim for that dream job, maybe in the mid tier, and then you can advance yourself. Don't lose hope but keep working through that. But if you definitely put in the effort, definitely there will be a place and you will be able to realize your dreams. - That's great. I mean, what's your advice about some people have advised on LinkedIn? Don't just post stuff there but also try and set up connections to people in the industry that you wanna get into. Would you advise that? - I don't. So I do get a lot of like the cold call connections, right? I saw your profile and this is what I'm interested in. I respond to them just because I know that I was in such a place several years ago. But not everybody will have the time for it. So I don't know if that will work well. But what may work is look for in your connections, maybe there is somebody that you went to college with and that person has a connection with someone else in that particular company. See if that person can introduce you to the person who works in that company. That may work better than just triggering an email and talking to them. - It sounds like the advice is, don't just cold call, if you like, or don't just send like blank, sorry, like cold emails. Try and get a connect in the company or find a friend of a friend who can introduce you. Is that the advice? - Yeah, and it's easy to obtain given how we are. You have lot of social media tools, right? It's not just LinkedIn. You can figure out who's connected through using various different tools. I don't wanna talk about those, but you can definitely. You can figure out a person's life through social media these days. That's why I'm so scared to put up anything on social media. I mean, use it to your advantage for when it comes to getting the role. It will definitely work. - It's interesting, I mean, that at one point in my life, I was very scared to put anything on social media and I had like all my accounts private. And you know what? When I decided to post stuff, then the world opened. For all the bad things of social media, I'm a very big promoter of, if you wanna get further in life, social media is a great way to do that. And we've just spoken about LinkedIn, social media sort of website, especially if you're starting out. I like what you said earlier where you said, put your work out there. Put it on somewhere, but get known for the work that you've done. Work on open source projects even if you haven't got a job but you can start working on stuff. You can start contributing to the community. - You can even make money these days based on that. - Yeah, exactly. I think I love what you said about being hungry and I think being proactive. I've seen young people, even 16-year-olds make a lot of connections in the industry and get known. I think sometimes younger people have an advantage 'cause they grew up with social media. So use it. Just tell us a bit more of your story 'cause I wasn't quite sure I got it. How did you manage to move from India to the US? And what advice would you give someone if they were trying to move to Canada or the US? - During my engineering days, I think I studied in BMS College of Engineering in Bangalore. I had very good friends and my college mates. I think it's the environment that sort of made me think of these moving to and studying in foreign university. So that's the thought or the seed came to my mind because of that environment. And I had great friends who really pushed me and prepared me to sort of think through that and think of various ways to make that happen. I come from a lower middle class family, so financially, not very well off at that time, at least to go to foreign universities, right? I had taken loan to complete my engineering course. But still I think it's just the craziness in my mind for me to even think about it, and also a close friend of mine who really pushed me to think about that, worked through that, and my biggest support apart from the close friend was my dad. And despite I can't imagine being in their situation today. If I were to do that to my kids, would I be such a risk taker? I don't know. - Yeah. - So given not in a great financial position, but my dad was a risk taker and he said, \"Yes, I believe in you, I trust in you. \"Let's figure out how do we fund this \"till you get scholarship,\" which I got after the quarter in the US. \"How you would get a scholarship \"and then we'll support you through that.\" So he was my biggest supporter at that time and was able to do that because of the environment that I had in the college and the support and figuring out different ways of getting this done. Now, while I was doing this, of course, I'm only talking about supporters, there were also other people who were showing me the reality of the situation, saying, you're dreaming too big. I mean, this is just- - Oh wow. - You are just out of your mind, right? Again comes back to the craziness of my mind and I think the risk taker and the support that I got from my friend. I can never forget that. That is something that's always at the back my mind, and I keep wondering every now and then, would I be my dad if I were in that situation? I don't know the answer to that. - But I mean, so you were really hungry and you had this big dream to move to the US. Then you went and studied a masters in the US. Is that correct? - That's right. - And then you got a scholarship to stay on. And then while you were in the US, then you started finding jobs after you completed your studies, then you got a job in the US. Is that correct? - That's right. Yeah. - So what advice would you give someone who wanted to, you know, their dream is to go and work for Cisco in Silicon Valley or Google or some company, well-known company in Silicon Valley. Do you have any sort of tips from your experience and what you've seen others do? - I think these companies look for how much, what kind of qualification you have, and what kind of homework have you done to sort of realize your dream of working in that company and how well do you fit for that role from your home work standpoint, right? And most of these companies have a rigorous interview process where they have multiple different people talk to you and so that they understand you from different diverse viewpoints. So be prepared for that and be prepared to sort of if you get a negative as an answer, don't lose hard because there's always a second chance and a third chance. These companies do not look at this and go, oh, that person is already interviewed. I'm not gonna interview that person again. That's never the case. We always feel that we see so many bright talents and you have so little racks that are open. So we always shortlist the ones that we thought couldn't make that cut for whatever that minute reason at the end, and we always reach back out to them. Look for that role, again, homework proactive, finding out about that role, and how does your background suit that, or how does your personality align to that? What's the sum of what are the works that you've done that align to that? All of that helps with these companies, apart from obviously the domain knowledge and things like that. - It's very interesting 'cause you keep saying that don't just focus on the like the tech piece, but also look at the pieces around that. Is it really important to keep a record of all the work you've done over even if it's months or or years? - It's quite funny even within Cisco when I've changed roles, they interview people, right? So I go through my work again and it's I hate doing that, going back and thinking about, oh gosh, what did I do? I don't even want anything like that. But I sit and write down things that I've done, and most of the times, I don't have a good memory. So I go ask my colleagues, hey, how was that? And some of the manual things that I've left out, actually sometimes that may be relevant to what the hiring manager is looking for. So I sort of jot down all that and I go reproduce away in the interview that these are the things that I feel and I've done is relevant for the job here. Here is why I'm looking for this job because there's always a growth aspect you contribute and you also wanna love on from that job, right? There's also a learning element and the contribution element. So that aspect also should come out when you are talking to the hiring manager. And there's another aspect when you brought this out there. I just remembered. There is a position called distinguished engineer in Cisco. And we say that's like a coveted 'cause very few people, very few techies get that role. Before giving to that, I remember talking to one of the distinguished engineers and him mentioning to me how the rule of the process was. He had to, I don't know if you know this name, he's a quite famous name and I respect him and he's very well respected in the industry, Carl Solder. So he mentioned to me how he to go all the way back to his pre-sales days in Australia, and chronologically talk about the customer interviews, the work that he has done, the deals that he has won, and how he had to go through all that. What are some of the innovations that he has worked on. All of that angle. So no matter whether you are starting out or you are applying for something else, yes, you have to go back and look for what you've done and associate that to where you want to go next. - I love that. I mean, I was talking to someone who's, I won't mention the name, but another person that I highly respect who's also going for distinguished engineer. Very rigorous process, it sounds like. It's interesting that you've said keep track of what you've done, even if it's going far back. So when you're interviewing someone, would you put more weight and this is a difficult question, but so let's say someone's gonna a really excellent, technical, but difficult personality, or would you rather choose someone who's perhaps not the very best technical ability, but they they've got a good personality and they'll fit well in the team? Where would you put more weight on? - Combination of technical and personality. But personality, it's a big no. It doesn't matter how good you are technically. If you cannot be a team player, it is just not gonna work out. - I'm glad you said that because I think, for me as well, if I interview someone, it doesn't matter how good you are. If you're gonna bring bad blood or bad vibes, whatever you wanna say it, to the team, you don't want that person on your team. - I've seen people come in. I mean, you cannot always control it because you inherit teams or you go into teams that are already set up. What is a bad personality for me may be a good personality for someone else. I don't know. I haven't figured that one out yet. But I've seen such characters where we've had to sort of deal with that and how badly that affects the morale of the team. It's just unbelievable, the cleanup that you have to do, and every time you have to sort of motivate people who get bruised by this kind of behavior. It's just unbelievable. You don't want that kind of headache. - That's an encouragement for someone who says, okay, I'm not at the top of my class, but I am a good team player. I think that's important to remember that you don't have to be the very, very best. You can be very successful even if you're perhaps not the very, very best in some specific domain. But I wanna ask you, like, this is a difficult question. Are degrees important for someone who wants a job in India, and what about certification? So you mentioned, you did CCNA and CCNCP and you went for your CCIE, and it sounded like that helped you a lot in your career. Are degrees important, are certs important? What would you advise? - It really, David, it really differs from people to people. If I were to just go by how I've seen from my experience, at least about 60 to 70% of engineering leaders just in terms of filtering candidates, they will look for degrees, they will look for certifications, all kind of good background, the pedigree and all of that stuff. And there are other 30 to 40% that look for what the candidate brings to the table. It doesn't matter whether you don't have a degree or not. But the problem with that is, I mean, this 40%, they won't get to know of people without the right degree because you get so many resumes and you use a certain filtering criteria to get people or to get certain resume until you start talking, right? So that's the only reason why we say a degree, but you may have done certain skillset that make you probably more relevant than somebody else who has a better degree. But you won't be visible because of the filtering criteria that we have set up in the industry. I, myself, I've always said this. Many people have come and asked me and I've always said this. I don't look for a certain degree nor do I look for a certain certification, and I've told you the criteria that I look for. But I've not seen the same with others, and I think it's not that they don't want to do it. It's just that they have to hire a lot of people and they need to look for certain criteria to filter through the pool that they're getting. - Yeah, I think that's important. I mean, I always say get the certs to get past HR or to get to the interview and then shine in the interview. I think you've kind of said the same thing where you need to get past the filters. You need to past the automated filters and that's where degrees and certs are important here. This is a question that I've been thinking about for a long time. I've got two young daughters. One's 10, one's 15. You've been in the industry. Would you recommend that I tell my daughters, tech is a good feel for women, and how would you suggest that they approach it? So just give me your advice so that I can give it to them or to other women who wanna break into tech, or from your experience, what would you advise? - I don't think there's anything different for women compared to men. Most initial years, it didn't even occur to me that I was the only woman in the room within Cisco's conference rooms or meetings and things like that. They didn't make me feel that way. I didn't feel that way. I guess it's just the mindset and the mentality. So David, I think it's more than the tech industry. It's the society, right? - It's what the society is expecting of them when they join the workforce and society as in your immediate family members. How do you respond to that kind of expectation? Are you saying that since you expect me to not take on a job that I want, I will do so, or do you sit and talk about, hey, here are the things that I wanna do and I will not give up just because you want me to give up? So I think that's the conversation. Now, there are people who do not, and both men and women, right? They don't wanna have be in a certain role where you have to make a lot of decisions and stuff like that, which is okay. There's nothing wrong with that. But if you wanna do something and if your environment is not supportive and you need to have a clear conversation on that or you just need to change the environment to make yourself, you know, to make it suitable for you. So I think that's what I would say. But the tech industry, I know I'm glad we are having this conversation, I think the tech industry is having this conversation, and everybody is seriously looking at this. We need diversity and thought process, and that's why we are looking at gender, we are looking at nationality, we are looking at race, various other stuff. I'm glad we are having this conversation, but even the individual has to make it very clear that they want progress in that direction and not get bogged down by things that are going on in the environment. - I think the problem is we've got too few women in tech. So how do we convince more women to get into tech? I just use my daughters as an example. They've got their passions already. I think they're really focused on what they wanna do, but if I was going to advise them to get into tech, how would you advise me to advise them? - I think there are few things, right? You talked about first and foremost, the point zero is don't have that value in your mind that I'm a girl or I'm a woman and do not fit to be in this industry, because that's something that I think the other day, I was just mentioning this where my girls were in middle school and my boy was also in middle school. My girls, all three of them are really good in what they do, but the thought process, it was very interesting to observe. My girls, all of a sudden, started thinking that, oh, this is very difficult, I won't be able to do, and started coming from a math angle. I said, where the hell is this coming from and you've been doing fine? The more I observe, I feel that they're probably getting it from their friend's circle. And then once I started pointing it out to them, once I asked telling them that you are not to put that in your mind, just go through the problems, and if you don't know how to solve it, just get help and solve it. Do not put a bias in your mind, right, for whatever reason that may be. But on the other hand, my boy and his friends are like, oh, you know, math is so easy. I just don't wanna do it. (David laughs) (Pallavi laughs) So I don't know. It's just that whatever they put in their brain. So that should not even go in, and if it goes in, it needs to be monitored and taken out. The second thing is, as you enter, so people entering in from college into tech industry, what we've observed is there's a healthy ratio between gender, two different genders. Now, as they grow in life due to various life events, we see a change in the ratio. And that's where I was talking about the social environment that brings it. And the other aspect that we keep talking about is the unconscious bias or the subconscious bias where I've heard some of the managers say, this person is going to get married, probably this person is not fit for travel, or this person is not fit for working on this high-priority project. So what I was saying was, when you get to the life events part, right, after a few years of entering the workforce, there is one aspect of you yourself deciding what to do, but when the life event occurs. The second one is accepting what the management thought process puts on you, which is essentially taking a very simple example. Oh, this person's getting married. She may not be available for a certain project. Again, I always suggest one is corporation is working to sort of get rid of this unconscious or slash subconscious bias that management may or may not have, but the other aspect is also the employees, the individual contributors. If they sense this, they need to have an open conversation with their management and say, I am available for this and I want to work on this. I've mentioned this multiple times. Throughout my career, I've always gone and asked, what else can I do? What is the next step for me? So do not ever shy away from doing that, because most of the times, what is taught to you is, let your work speak for yourself. Let them come and ask you. Rarely does that ever happen. You have to go ask and you have to go talk about it. So that is as you grow higher up in the career ladder, you need to be able to figure out how do I address this? And then as your family expands, you need to figure out how do I get more help to make this work? How do I make my partner an equal partner in this life? That's a very, very, very important aspect, because if you don't have a partner that believes that both of you can work together on this, it becomes more of a burden whether you're working or not. I think that element is very key and the corporations obviously cannot help you more on the personal front. They are looking at figuring out how do we remove this unconscious and subconscious bias? And it'll take time because that's... One of my mentors who was a VP in Cisco gave me this interesting revelation that you learn about the other gender by looking at your, for example, if I have to learn about male, I will know about it from my father, my brother, and my husband. Same thing for men. Mother, wife, and daughter. And interestingly, I had that experience happen to me firsthand. When I was made a manager for a team, one of the team members was really agitated and I was not sure why that agitation was. So I sat and had a discussion with that person. And the person said, look, I've never had a human manager, and I don't know how this is going to work. He said, \"That's fine. \"I'm glad we brought that up. \"I'm glad we are having a transparent conversation. \"Let's figure out how we make this work \"and let's come back a year later and discuss this again.\" And then later on, he comes in. Now we exchange what needs to be done and the person comes to me whenever he's in a fix and things like that. But later on, I realize that it's because that person was nice enough to share with me because he had a view of women from his wife and mother and he thought for some reason, he assumed I would be the same. Basically, I think you learn about different gender in that fashion, but we need to make sure that these kind of biases sort of weed itself out and will take time, but I'm very confident that as and when the next generation comes in, we will progress in the right direction. - I'm really glad to hear. I'm glad you're sharing that because it's for my daughters. It's like, do they wanna do it? And if they really, really wanna do it, I wanna support them as much as I can as their father. I wanna help them reach their dreams. And I think every parent wants to do the best they can for their kids. Like your father invested in your dreams. We all wanna invest in the dreams of our kids. From my point of view, I would support them in anything. If they wanted to become an engineer, I would love them to do that and support them in that. So thank you so much for sharing. Pallavi, it's been a long time. So I'm going to ask you, have you got any closing thoughts or anything else you want to share with the community? Any advice from your experience? - Yeah, I think, David, I think you mentioned you have a lot of followers who ask you about, hey, I have a single device. How do I get into the tech world since that's sort of the team here for our conversation. I wanna make sure I tell these kids or even youngsters that world is your opportunity with so much of information that's available to you. Even with a small device, you will be able to unlock many doors. The main thing you need is that relentless pursuit and tenacity that you need to bring to the table and pursue it. You will definitely get to where you wanna be or wherever you wanna head towards. Of course, there's a little bit of luck element in everybody's life, but that will happen if you continue to pursue pursue this angle because technology is democratizing many of the things as we see it. So keep at it, just like my kids are. Just do it. - I love that because I think it's, I just wanna talk a bit more about that, it's with the internet and all the information out there, even if you've just got one device that you can learn from or use, there's so much information. I mean, just us sharing this kind of information was very hard to get hold of years ago. I think it goes back to what you've mentioned about its passion. You have to be hungry, and if you have that hunger and you have that drive, you can succeed even if you are limited by perhaps money or the devices that you have. So that's brilliant, Pallavi. Thank you so much for sharing your experience. Thank you so much for giving your view of things. I'm gonna ask the audience, please put questions below. Maybe I can convince Pallavi to come back again. If you have any other questions that I didn't ask in this interview, please put them below. Pallavi, thanks so much. - Thank you, David. Thanks for the opportunity. I hope this was helpful, and I hope the audience finds it useful. - I'm sure they will. Thank you. (intense upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "- I don't really know how to start this video cause I'm actually like super excited for this thing. This is the Logitech G Herman Miller Embody gaming chair. This thing is like $1500, and today we're gonna unbox it and take a look at this freaking thing. So the first thing that we're about to see is apparently you don't have to put this thing together. It all comes just in one piece, and it's ready to go. So, let us open and see how this goes. Watch it just be like broken and in pieces. (man mumbling) Broken and in pieces? Oof. All right, mere seconds stand between you and science-backed ergonomics. No assembly required, just sit down and enjoy exceptional comfort for as long as you want to game. Lift this up. Okay. Come on box. I'm actually really confused here. Yeah, hold on. Lift this up, oh my God, I'm so dumb. (laughing) I didn't read the instructions. Apologies. It's really, it is step by step and I couldn't even follow those steps. All right, what do we got here? It doesn't tell me what to do from this point on so I'm just, we're going for it. Oh it just rolls out. Yo. What is in here? Is this a joke? It's just an empty box. Just for padding, obviously. Man. Whoa. Okay. I'm not gonna lie, this looks a lot different than I thought it would, just based on the images and pictures I found on their website. So right now at home I am using an old Need For Seat chair that we used to have here at the office that I bought second hand from Linus because it kind of doesn't work for like $30. I've been using that for probably about four years, and then the other chair that I've been using is actually the Cougar Gaming Sofa, which I did a video on ShortCircuit, which you can check out here or here, I always forget which way the link is. Yeah, so this is probably gonna be an upgrade, we'll find out. The Need For Seat Chair that I have, the arm rests don't go up, the casters are uneven, I could probably fix that, but when I move my whole, everything just kind of goes tilted a little bit. It rattles, that's sometimes fun. Yeah, so you could say I'm pretty much a chair expert. So going back to what I was talking about before, what's really cool about this chair is that Herman Miller and Logitech teamed up to create it, right? So it's supposed to be the kind of ultimate gaming chair, combining, you know, Logitech's experience in gaming accessories, and Herman Miller's experience in ergonomics, and chairs, and all the other stuff that they do. So, the thing that I'm looking forward to trying out the most, is the back fit and posture fit technology, which is all of this stuff on the back, which is designed to fit to the way that you sit in your spine by adjusting this knob. So apparently you sit in it, turn it clockwise, and then (sucking air) it'll actually kind of adhere to you in a sense, providing you, what I assume will be fantastic support. But there's only one way to find out, and that's by sitting in it. So we're gonna sit in it. And it's gonna be sick! I hope. Or it's gonna be a waste of $1500. But we'll find out right after we talk about today's sponsor: Vincero! Vincero creates stylish watches that are elegant and built to last. All of their watches are designed in house and are created with ethically sourced materials. They provide free shipping, 30 day returns, and a 2 year guarantee. So, if you wanna learn more about Vincero, you can head to the link in the video description, and if you make a purchase, you'll save up to 30% off your order. It's good stuff. (deep sighing) Oh that's nice, that's nice. Horizontal movement, feeling good. Time for a caster test. Very smooth. I'm glad, I almost went right back in the box here. I'm 160 pounds, I'm 5'6\". In terms of width, I've got a fair amount of room here. We've of course got adjustable arm rests. Actually what's really cool about these is that they're curved. So when you raise them up, they're actually raising in towards you a bit. These have a little bit of give when you really shake them. Oh my God, can you not twist them? Shut up, shut up! Can you not twist these? No way, there's no way. $1500, don't you dare, don't you dare. Just stop, stop that! Where's the $1500? I'm just kidding. The biggest thing with this chair, like I said, is the back support. So right now I definitely feel it down here, like, my back is supported. Now, let's try the posture fit tech. So clockwise. That is this way. It's so funny, I don't know what I'm expecting, but I'm expecting something. The only problem with this is, I don't know if it's just my posture in general, or how short I am, but I'm actually leaning a bit to turn this knob, and I think that's kind of screwing with the way it's adjusting. And I've now turned it all the way, it will not turn any further. (man mumbling) Sure. Jono'll adjust it for me. Thanks Jono, appreciate it. Okay, yeah, yeah, so it's pushing in when you're going clockwise, obviously, when you're going counterclockwise, it's pushing out. So, actually I would have it all the way, essentially. I feel support. So the problem I always run into is when I actually have back support, sometimes it almost feel uncomfortable just cause I'm not used to it. Probably because I've been using such terrible chairs to game in for the last seven years, but I definitely feel supported with this. Is it worth $1500? I mean, you're gonna have to come back after like a 10 hour game sesh, I guess, I don't know. Another thing that's really good for ergonomics is having your knees in kind of a 90 degree angle. So what's really cool about this chair is that you can actually extend this based on how tall you are or how long your legs are, and you can actually retract it too, literally just by pulling it. So that's actually kind of neat. So while looking for a way to adjust the height of the chair, I actually just figured out that there's actually two knobs to control the back fit and posture fit tech. So this back one, you can actually see it moving. And this one I can also feel, just like the other one. When I turn it counterclockwise, I can actually go into kind of a more laid back position, something that I'd probably use for like, watching movies, or kind of just hanging out. And then if I'm gaming for a long period of time, I can go clockwise, cinch it up with my back, along with the other knob, and you're kind of all set, right? So this is for your upper back, this is obviously for your lower back. (yelling) Ah, I figured it out! So the thing that you turn for the back fit technology, this little blue thing you just pull it up. (singing lightly) Beauty, okay, how high does this thing go? That's it. That's how you go? How low do you go. (imitating explosions) Uh, I'm pretty short. So, I'm gonna go to as low as it can go, and I'm actually gonna keep that in. Beauty. So, oh! Just figured out the arm rest too. Guys, I didn't read the instructions. I don't know if you can tell. So arm rest. This is great for gamer rage. You get mad, you just lose, you just lose your scrim, just stupid. And then I'm ready for the game again. So, just to get kind of a comparison, we've actually got like a $400 Vertagear chair that I'm gonna try sitting in, and just kind of try to evaluate some of the differences. So, one thing I'll say is that this thing is very supportive, like I feel supported on all parts of my body, essentially. The only thing I'm not really a fan of right now is the arm rest. I don't know, I actually like the, being able to swivel the arm rest. Being able to hit these when you're really mad though. Something with that's satisfying. So, we're gonna try this thing out. (groaning) It's bad, it's not good. Yeah, nothing. I don't feel anything to this chair. Now, for another comparison, we've actually go an ErgoChair, which is probably a more closer comparison, for sure. Goodbye gaming chair. Hello back support. (sighing) I thought I was gonna fall. Yeah, I don't know. It definitely feels better on the back. There's not as much support because there's way more give, right, like this, I mean is easy if I'm really jittery all day, and I wanna move a lot, like, I don't know. (buttons clicking) I don't know, just having the option to slide your armrest forward and backwards, kind of nice. But I definitely don't feel nearly as much support on this chair as I do on the Herman Miller Logitech G Embody chair. But it's a gaming chair. Let's figure out how I game in it, okay? Let's test out some games. (grunting) (laughing) While we're queuing up for this game, though, it'd be really cool if these chairs could have support for LTTstore.com. You know, just, just a little, (clicking tongue) right there. Bam, stay hydrated all day long. Oh I got a match. Usually I play Sage, but enough people have told me that I suck with Sage that I just don't play Sage anymore. Hi everyone, Golic have fun, Twitch.tv/linustech. Hey, what do you guys think of the Herman Miller Logitech G gaming chair? Do that at the end of the game, people are like genuinely concerned. No way, you're not Linus. So I'll say already that what's really cool about this chair too is just it's got a lot smaller of a form factor. So being able to get the back support and everything else, and having the chair being so small helps for smaller desks. This desk is quite a bit bigger than what I have at home. But it's just nice to be able to actually, you know, be able to get the arms under the desk, you know I've got room, I'm supported, my back's upright, I'm ready to game here. I don't know how I'm gonna do on game performance, but that's okay, that's not the chair's fault if I suck at Valorant, okay? (man mumbling) Posture feels good. Like, that's the, you know, that's one of the reasons why they made this chair, and that is the biggest thing that I'm noticing between this and everything else is that, like, my posture is remaining good. I find after, like, even five minutes of gaming at home, I'll just be like. And it comes down to the material too. Like, this material is definitely a little bit more, I don't know, supportive. It's not like, that like, polyurethane leather, so I'm not just like sliding all over the place. So another cool thing about this chair is that it's got copper infused foam on the seat, which is meant to keep you cool. So I'm wearing pants right now, but it's just another thing to look out for, you know? It's pretty cushy, but not too cushy, and not too hard. I'm digging it. Also I died, shoot. - But no, it just feel like, I can actually, like, lean back, and it doesn't feel like it just gives away. - Man, that back support. - Yeah, like, I like aggressive lumbar. So like, this feels like my lower back, cause it usually gets sore, cause I'm a bit heavier. You just feel it like, I just want to like sit down and sleep. - Sleep in that? - [Jono] Riley give it a try. - Riley, get in here. - Is this the Herman Miller one? - This is the Herman Miller, Logitech G Embody gaming chair. - Embody. - Meant to embody you into the chair. - Embody the spirit of the gamer. - Yes, are you a gamer Riley? (yelling) - It's happening! - Do you like it? Do you feel supported? - Um, emotionally? - I mean, maybe emotionally as well, I don't know. - I feel like it's pushing me forward. Like, I just want to lean back and it keeps. (chuckling) - I think that's the point. - You see that? (laughing) - It's like it's like pushing, it's like (grunting). - It's like oh just relax, like no, you're wrong ahh! What's these hooks for? - [Colton] The hooks? - [Riley] Yeah what are they? - [Colton] So you can actually pull the seat out. Bam! - [Riley] Oh! - [Colton] How's that feel? - That was scary. - Yeah, you can actually pull them back too. - So you kind of have to raise, like get pressure off of it, and then you can. - [Riley] Oh I see, yeah. - [Colton] Yeah, yeah, there you go, you got it. - [Riley] Whoa, that's so weird. But also really cool. - So one thing I wanna ask you, the arm rest, how do you feel about the arm rest, trying adjust them? (buttons clicking) - [Riley] Whoa. - [Colton] Does that feel good? - [Riley] Whoa, what? - [Colton] Yeah. - [Riley] What? - [Colton] How do you feel about that? - [Riley] What the heck? - [Colton] That feature. - [Riley] Maybe if someone had like, really, like tiny arms, they could just do this. - [Colton] You're talking about me. - [Riley] What! (laughing) - [Riley] Do you have it like that. - No I don't have it like that. Should Linus have this chair? Like an evil overlord? - Should Linus have this chair? Yeah, I mean, how expensive is it? - It's 1495 US dollars, but it's free shipping, 12 year warrantee, I believe, 12 year warrantee. - You know what the coolest thing I thought about this chair, Colton, is this back thing, what's going on here? - [Colton] The back thing? - This looks like a, this looks some kind of weird cyborg spine. - Yeah, it's gonna meld to your spine. - Does it? - Yeah, so sit back. So you've got a knob, you've got two knobs actually on your right hand side, turn them clockwise. So that one's for your upper back, the other one's for your lower back. Do you feel it doing anything? - Oh, interesting. Yeah, it gives you more lumbar support. - Exactly. So this is their posture fit, and back fit technology. - You know, I'm not gonna lie, I expected a little more elegant solution for this from Herman Miller. For that price? I mean this thing's so cool, it's like, it looks like you're literally just extending the actual seat. - [Colton] Yep. - But the, down, (stammering) if I want to adjust things I'm like, ee er ee er ee er. - Yeah, having to contort your body to be able to do it, that's kind of annoying. So actually, I didn't know if tall people would have the same problem. - If I'm a rich man. - Yup. - I expect to have like an electronic, like. (buzzing) - I thought you were gonna say you'd expect to have somebody to help do that for you. - Yeah, exactly. (laughing) - Sir. - It comes with a tiny person. - So I've got Nicole, she's one of our new editors. She sits to edit, so I figured she'd be a good candidate for this. So come try out this chair, let us know your thoughts. - Whoa, this is nice. - [Colton] Does your back feel supported? - Wow, yeah, way more supported than like, than usually. Cause usually it's like I'd have to adjust it and everything to make it feel semi-decent. But this is like, oo! - So, your feet aren't fully on the ground. I think using that blue knob, you can push that down, and that should lower you a little bit maybe. - Oo! - There you go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, and then the other thing that you can do. So the handles right in front of you, you can actually pull those forward or back. So I would, sorry these, you can actually pull them back, and it'll actually move the end of the the chair in or out. You might have to lift up your legs a little bit. (buttons clicking) - [Nicole] Oh I see. - There we go. - [Nicole] Interesting, so now it's like. - Yeah, it's a little bit shorter. So the idea is that you can get your legs like 90 degrees, bam, you can sit. - Oo! - [Colton] Oo! Review: \"Oo!\" - This is great. - Would you pay $1495 for it? - Okay maybe. (giggling) - Maybe not? You get free shipping. - Eh. (laughing) - All right, that was fine. Now it's time for the outro. I'm just kidding. - [Jono] That's dangerous. - Yeah. What a roller coaster ride. I mean, this thing's pretty sick. I'm excited to see what is to come. Like, if this is kind of their first collab, I'm excited to see what Herman Miller Logitech, other companies do in the future. Like I said before, melding gaming and ergo chairs is sick. So thank you very much for watching guys. Make sure to like, get subscribed, let us know if you wanna see more chair content on Short Circuit, you know, I like doing these, they're a lot of fun, and we'll see you on the next one. Goodbye.",

    "transcript": "- Yo, let's talk iPhone 12. We're getting closer and you know we're getting closer when the world outside of the tech bubble catches wind of those rumors, and while this one could potentially be true for the highest, most maxed-out iPhone 12, we're more than likely looking at four different variants with a starting price of at least half that. So I wanted to break down not only what to expect, but when to expect. Real quickly, sponsor time. PIA stands for Pizza Is Awesome, and also Private Internet Access, who we wanna give a shout out to for supporting the channel. They are the leading no-log VPN service with over a million users. Now, if you don't know what a VPN is or does, in a nutshell, it allows you to connect your phone, your tablet, your computer, essentially whatever device you're using, no matter the platform, to the internet through a server in a different location. So because you're able to connect through different locations, you now can access content you normally couldn't see based off where you're at. This also goes beyond Netflix, Hulu, HBO, YouTube. You're welcome. There are also tons of privacy benefits. You could even hide your IP address if you wanted to. It packs PTP support, unlimited bandwidth. It's clean. It's simple. It's easy to use. You can do so on up to 10 different devices with a single account, and the best part about all of this, if you're watching right now, you can jump on a silly deal. 77% off with three months free, and that link is down below. Now, every year, there's an update to the iPhone, end every year people are surprised that there's an update to the iPhone. So to quickly break that down, typically there is one major update to the iPhone every single year. Do you need to upgrade? No, but that's usually how it works. Apple normally gets up on stage at an event that would normally take place in September, but because 2020 has been a giant jerk face, all signs are pointing to that taking place in October. This week definitely did not make things any easier. Everyone was expecting Apple to announce a new Apple Watch Series 6 and a new iPad Air, and instead Apple was like, psych, here's an event that's taking place on September 15th. Here's this AR thing that everyone's going to analyze and look way too much into it, and ultimately, it just left everybody questioning everything. It's a pretty safe bet, at this event, we'll see the Apple Watch Series 6, a new iPad. Some people are saying a more affordable Apple Watch SE, but beyond that, it's just turned into a giant tech debate. Some people swear we're going to see new iPhones at the September 15th event. I kind of still feel like it's going to be an October thing for iPhones. If anything, maybe we'll see something on the first ARM-based Mac, but the way this year has gone, anything could happen and that could be completely wrong. I realized there's a perception with Apple and specifically the iPhone, where it gets more and more expensive every single year. But if you follow the tech world, it's actually weirdly enough been the opposite the last couple of years where Apple is focused on more affordable options. I honestly still feel the iPhone X was just this giant chess move to get the rest of the market to release thousand dollar smartphones, because that is exactly what happened. A year later, there are thousand dollar smartphones everywhere. Apple of course introduced the iPhone XS, but Tim Cook pulls a trick out of his sleeve and is like, yo, here's the iPhone XR with the same internals as our thousand dollar smartphone, but for $749. Enter 2019, a much simpler time. Oh, how I wish we could go back to that era alongside the iPhone 11 Pro. Apple takes everything that was great about the iPhone XR, ditches the R naming scheme, and then debuts the iPhone 11 for $699. It packed the same internals as the iPhone 11 Pro, two out of the three lenses, and to this day, I still think overall in terms of what you're getting for the price, it might be the best value for an iPhone ever. So I think it was important to go down that path because ultimately it leads us directly to the iPhone 12, where again, based off everything we know so far, it's looking like there are going to be four different flavors. So, two iPhone 12s alongside two iPhone 12 Pros, and if that sounds confusing, to break down what that lineup could look like, we would start out with a 5.4 inch iPhone 12, then jump up to a 6.1 inch iPhone 12 Max. We would then move to the Pro lineup with a 6.1 inch iPhone 12 Pro, and then finally a bigger 6.7 inch iPhone 12 Pro Max. There's a couple of really exciting things here. One is the idea of a smaller 5.4 inch iPhone, which is great news for someone who wanted something more compact and the size of an iPhone 11, but wanted something more than the iPhone SE. The other exciting thing is the rumor of, regardless of screen size or Pro versus non-Pro, is OLED across the entire lineup. That was a huge difference between the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, LCD versus OLED. So the potential to get that across the entire lineup is exciting. As far as that notch, it doesn't look like it's going to be any smaller, although it might appear or give off the illusion that it looks smaller because of smaller bezels. As far as the idea of 120 Hertz ProMotion refresh rate, I wouldn't say it's 100% no, but I also would not bank on it. If the iPhone 11 lineup showed us anything, it's that Apple does care about battery life, and I think if 120 Hertz refresh rate plus 5G ends up destroying battery life, that's why Apple will opt out this year. So while that might be disappointing, and while we might not see a smaller notch, one thing I'm looking forward to is the iPhone 12 design looking a little more iPhone 5-esque. So it would be much more squared off. Kind of think of what Apple did to the iPad Pro when they updated that in 2018, as opposed to the iPhone 6 design that we've seen for a handful of years. Something else I would love to see this year is Apple continuing that trend of bringing that price down. So if we could go from $749 to $699 down to $649, especially with that smaller 5.4 inch iPhone 12, that would be stellar. Just like last year, both the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro models are expected to share the same processor, which should be the A14. That's exciting to me for a couple reasons. One, I kind of feel like Apple was holding back a little bit last year, whereas the A14 should be a monster in terms of performance, and as we know, Apple-powered Macs are coming this year. So the further they advance with their silicon, the more exciting that becomes, I would say the biggest physical difference between the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro lineup is going to be the cameras. So just like last year, the 12 should get two lenses, whereas the 12 Pro will have three. The cameras on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro were incredible, so I'm super excited to see where they take it this year, especially with the processing of that A14. That applies not only to photography, but video as well, and for me personally, the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro changed things forever in terms of shooting video on a smartphone. I would blend iPhone footage into my videos alongside my normal camera, shoot entire videos on the iPhone. I've shot a couple of music videos. So the idea of that getting even better alongside things like 4K 120 slow-mo, sign me up. Now, much like the entire lineup is rumored to have an OLED screen, the entire lineup is also rumored to pack 5G. The 12 Pro models could potentially have more robust 5G options, and while I don't think we're really quite there yet in terms of 5G rollout and speeds everywhere, it's nice that we should see it across the board. From there, one potentially slightly disappointing rumor, especially to those who are really into tech, because it looks like there's going to be one more year of a Lightning port across all iPhone 12 models. On one hand, as someone who's really into tech, I would love, love, love to see a USB-C port on the iPhone 12, not have to worry about going between USB-C or Lightning, but on the other hand, for someone who's not super into the tech world, that might come across as, \"Oh, Apple just changed the port again. All my Lightning cables are useless.\" Either way, curious to see what you guys think on that topic. We can also pair that with the rumor of Apple not including ear pods or a charger or cable in the box. Are you with that? Are you against it? Let me know. Aside from that, thank you guys so much for watching. Hopefully you found this helpful, and if you did, make sure to drop a like down below. Again, big thanks to Private Internet Access for sponsoring today's video, and if you guys want to jump on that deal, I've got that link down below. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later.",

    "transcript": "If you want a successful campaign you really want to emulate the adversary you do this 10% that nobody else does and you will be successful. This list is gold for me as a red teamer these are the addresses for most of Tesla's VPN logins these addresses right here um so already those are prime targets for me to understand you know if I can find credentials of someone at Tesla I want to use them in these areas to try to get into the internal Network because these are the VPN logins. I love this you know you seem to know in some ways more about a company than they do themselves because you do all this recon on them. Oftentimes I do in fact one of the funny things is is taking this recon data to a company and doing like a workshop kind of like we're on your show right now right doing a workshop for them I mean like here's all the stuff I find and they're like we had no idea that was on the internet. This is my people and I'm so lucky to have found this tribe that loves these things and you know plays a bad guy on TV but all they really want to do is protect the world right and be a superhero so I think that's many of us and so I'm so happy to have found it honestly. I will keep on going to the last ounce that I can find out about this company because you know I don't ever like to lose in an engagement in a red team engagement I want to get in [Music] I really want to thank Brilliant for sponsoring this video as well as supporting my channel Brilliant have a fantastic platform if you want to learn Math and Computer Science or AI or development topics, interactive website rather than just reading a book or watching videos you can use their website to learn all of those Technologies and a whole bunch more it doesn't matter if you're a beginner or more advanced you can learn a whole bunch of stuff from Brilliant highly recommend platform use the link below https://brilliant.org/DavidBombal to sign up and get a 30-day trial and a 20% discount I really want to thank Brilliant for their support of my channel and for sponsoring this video. Hey everyone it's David Bombal back with a very special guest Jason welcome. Hey everyone how you doing Jason it's great to have you here you are really well known in the industry but perhaps just for people who don't know who you are tell us a bit about you know what have you been doing for the last 20 years and what you're doing these days. Yeah absolutely so my name is Jason Haddix um I've been in probably what you would call the offensive security space so Penetration testing, Red teaming, Web Application Assessments and Bug Bounty for probably the last 15 years I've also done some security leadership I'm really I'm well known for a lot of my talks and presentations at Defcon and other places like that for being able to find things that other people can't um and thinking like an adversary basically and trying to profile different companies and find ways to hack into their very large organizations so. I'm glad you mentioned that offline we're talking about like what we're going to cover today and one of the things you mentioned is this is something that like the bad guys do right against companies and that's kind of what you're going to show us today. Yeah absolutely so um what we're going to go over today is is what we call in the industry reconnaissance right recon for short and it is the first step in both what I do as a job at my company we have a consultancy called buddobot and we lead a red team which you know his job is to basically emulate a real adversary a bad guy and the first step in any of that is understanding your target right and so I thought we could do something fun today and look at Tesla I'm you know a brand a brand that everybody you know knows and um we could do some some reconnaissance on Tesla and and kind of see what we can find and you know show you what kind of the beginning of an engagement looks like on a Bug Bounty or a Red team engagement kind of profiling a company like that. I mean that's fantastic I always like to get people who you know do this day to day so tell us a bit more about your company you guys are like red teaming breaking into companies uh that that penetration testing is basically the name of the game um is that right? yeah yeah so we we do uh penetration testing but we we really focus on um full scope kind of adversarial we call emulation so you know we're normal pentests will often be scoped and they will tell you where to attack you know we on board with our clients for six months or a year which is a longer engagement than most people do and we really do run a full campaign um looking at every single asset that they have trying to Pivot from the external to the internal so we have a diverse team that's looking at Cloud security external web security we're doing full phishing, we're doing full social engineering, um we're on the dark web looking for credentials that people might be selling about this organization or really trying to you know when I was a security leader at my last job so I was a I was a CSA at Ubisoft we got breached by a threat actor and you know I wish that there was a service that had really emulated some of those things and so that's kind of why I left was to design that service and so you know with my offensive security history uh we've been we've been doing that for um last half a year doing um doing a lot of really good um red team engagements and stuff. So so for anyone who's watching who's interested in like hiring I'll put a link below are you also on Twitch you do a whole bunch of stuff on social media and you like you said you presented Defcon quite a bit right? Yeah so I mean I've been all over the world presenting on offensive security stuff I do stream on Twitch every once in a while um but not as regularly as I'd like uh but I do have some YouTube videos up and I can throw those links to everybody all the links for all the tools I'll make sure that you get them and so any aspiring you know hackers or um security people in fact a lot of these techniques we're going to go in today can also be used on the defensive side to understand what a company uh you know of yours has out on the the internet this is called Attack Surface Management basically the industry took our hacker tools and they turned them you know and they put a nice collared shirt on them and they now sell it as a service and so uh but really they're using these same tools we're going to discuss today and they just give you a fancy GUI so if you don't have an Attack Surface Management platform you could probably uh string this together and you know find the same data you would get out of those. I know the information that we talking about today that's actually part of a live training that you do is that is that correct? It is indeed yeah so um I've been giving my talks uh for uh I'd say about 12 years now at Defcon, Black hat, RSA um and a whole bunch of smaller hacker cons and so I turned it into a two day live training and so I've been doing that like once or twice every year but really recently I've started to really uh give it a few more times a year so it's called the Bug Hunter's Methodology live so one day is full reconnaissance which we're going to do today and the second day of my class is full hacking which is like Web hacking and Infrastructure hacking, Cloud hacking and stuff like that so. I'll put a link to that below um if anyone wants to sign up you know see the links below I don't get an affiliate fee but you know Jason's well known go and support him if you're interested in learning this stuff live rather than through YouTube video use the links below Jason anyone could just reach out to you on Twitter right that's sort of the best way to get hold of you? That's where I am normally yeah it's at Jhaddix on Twitter. Jason tell me have you got stories or examples of where this was actually used in the sort of the real world? Yeah absolutely so uh I mean a lot of my success has been around being really great at this Recon topic right even though it's very in-depth and it can get you know a little hairy sometimes but uh you know one of one of the bigger hacks that I've done is an e-commerce site and uh this company is massive they ended up purchasing a CRM software so if you know what a CRM software Client Relationship Manager Software you know like Sales force is kind of a CRM you know whatever they ended up buying this big CRM software uh and just acquiring this company the acquisitions work that we're going to go over we'll talk about how to identify acquisitions and so I found this acquisition of this company and they still had some infrastructure up and they had a demo of their CRM software and so I found the demo and I logged into it and it's just a demo and so I I took note of all of the URLs that the demo had and they let you log in as the admin to see how the admin worked on their CRM and so I logged in as the admin and I you know and there's no data in this demo right there's nothing in it it's just for them to try to sell their software but I had found where this client had installed their version of the CRM across their infrastructure so I went and I went to their install and went to the same URLs for the admin section that I had found in the demo and so I forcefully browse to those URLs and sure enough they had an access control vulnerability that allowed me to directly browse to the back end of this CRM that had been implemented for this person for this this company and I was able to get millions of customer records so this CRM was housing um multiple contents for this e-commerce company I had Direct access to send text messages and push notifications to their phone because they had the mobile app set up I had all of their personal data that they had entered in all of the mobile apps all of their purchase data for all of the stores worldwide I could pretty much do whatever I want I had admin control over the site it was it was probably one of the bigger data breaches I've ever had access to minus ones that had credit card information at least by sheer number of records it was amazing it was it was crazy it was also really simple vulnerability I went to that demo found out where the admin section was and then went to where they had installed it and and browse to it and they just hadn't applied authentication to um to all of the site and so that was one of the bigger bug Bounty bugs that I had found the report was like you know 5 pages long or something like that all the stuff I had access to and then they fixed it and uh and then I found like that they had not applied controls to their APIs either so I mapped out the API on the demo and then went back to them and said yo you fit you fixed the website but you haven't fixed the access issues in the API and so I I submitted another round of bugs um and that was a really really interesting one and one where finding an acquisition paid off a million fold so that's exactly kind of how the workflow went there. That means if you understand you you found a demo the demo CRM software was part of an acquisition you simply type the URL into the live system and that got you access right? Yeah I mean I had to poke around in the demo until I found the admin section but yeah I just visited that URL in the live production system and they hadn't applied authentication to it. It just shows you I mean I love that example in in this video we're going to be talking a lot about Recon and finding stuff but just by doing that work you found this amazing bug. I lose sleep if I don't succeed and engagement so. So I mean thank goodness you're on the right side of the you know the right side of the how do you say the right team should I say. Yeah yeah yeah I mean I didn't used to be so um it's uh you know it's been a wonderful opportunity to put these very weird skills to good use. You didn't used to be what do you mean by that? Yeah so my origin story um you know I did an episode of Dark Knight diaries with uh Jack Rhysider and um my origin story is actually that of when I was early 20s I was part of the early burgeoning kind of dark web and that was with sites like Carter's Market, Shadow crew, counterfeit Library sites like that um and back then the dark web is mostly credit card fraud and web hacking was just beginning to come out um the way I fell into that was I was uh 20 years old most of my friends were 21 already going out to the bars and drinking and I wanted to go with them so I bought a fake ID from one of my friends and it was horrible it was like the worst quality fake ID you've ever seen and I tried to go to the clubs with them and immediately got busted not arrested they just took it from me and you're like this is dumb. Like and so I got really mad and this is actually a common I guess theme in my life is like I get mad and I want to do things better um and so I started Googling like well how do you make a fake ID right and so I ended up falling into Counterfeit Library which was the precursor to Shadow crew I started learning how to make fake IDs and I only made a couple for me and you know my friends but the only place to get information on that was this beginnings of what is now the dark web and so I got to know a lot of you know how the dark web works the different ecosystems that uh you know work for it you know that is split up into people who hack credit card numbers and then people who take the Hacked credit card numbers and print fake credit cards um and put the tax credit card numbers on them and then people who make IDs to match the fake credit cards so people can cash them out um at least this is how it worked back then chip and pin has significantly assessed significantly change kind of the ecosystem a little bit it still works similar to this today and so there's three ecosystems people there's the hackers the Carters and the ID makers and so I got to know a lot of the hackers because I was talking about making fake IDs in the forums a lot and they're like this kid seems seems to be making really quick progress so I got to know him a lot and they taught me you know kind of the beginnings of you know some of the web bugs I know I knew about then Shadowcrew got busted by the Secret Service and it was led by the Secret Service and then uh it was you know the Canadian Mounted got involved like with the UK authorities like it was a global bust it was the first bust of us of like a dark net site that ever happened you can look it up on Wikipedia and so I wake up one morning and there is this picture on the Forum I used to log into every day of a dude Behind Bars and the Secret Service logo under it and it says we're coming for all of you and I'm in IRC and everybody's like did you hear they rated X's house and like you know like and we're like what is going and so you know know I, I take all of my fake ID equipment my printers my laminates all this stuff and I could go into that another time on how fun an art project it is to do that but um and I drive two towns away and I dump it in a dumpster and I light it on fire and um and just I'm scared out of my wits right like I'm a kid right I'm 20 years old you know I call my girlfriend and I'm like hey if you don't see me tomorrow I love you you know like it's been great you know like um yeah and uh just just scared out of my mind and obviously I was such a small fish I only made a few IDs you know the Secret Service isn't coming for me right like but you know I didn't know that I didn't know really how uh you know that works I really didn't do anything but I had those skills and I knew about the dark web and I had begun to learn about web hacking and then I took a college elective called ethical hacking and network defense and my teacher was showing this stuff that when I was in the class was already like 5 years old by the time he was showing it and I'm like uh his name was Angel and I'm like I'm like Angel this stuff is dated already that you're teaching and I was like this is how they're doing it nowadays he's like you know you can do this for a career right and I'm like whoa whoa what do you mean and he's like there's this thing called Penetration testing and people will pay you to hack into their site and tell them how you did it and help them figure out how to secure it and I'm like nah that's not a thing that's not a thing that exists and he's like yeah it absolutely is and you make a bunch of money doing it and I'm like oh okay and so then I've been on the street and narrow ever since but that's kind of my original story. I love that I mean and what I love about you know the world today is this has become a lot more well known a lot of young people you know like YouTube channels or you know just information out there bug Bounty platforms it's it's giving people with the skills that you had and have a good path to earn the money legally and ethically. Yeah bug Bounty does it um I mean there's more e-learning and content around hacking than ever before and it's all framed in a pretty decent way to like how to do this for good how to do do this for defense and we need that right we need we need hackers we need the community you know not only has it been a tremendous opportunity for me personally but also I love this scene I mean you can see I have the Defcon flag behind me I'm wearing a Defcon hoodie this is my people and I'm so lucky to have found this tribe that loves these things and you know plays a bad guy on TV but all they really want to do is protect the world right and be a superhero so I think that's many of us and so I'm so happy to have found it honestly. Great so I mean enough talking Jason you've got to show us the tools hacking Tesla you know what a great example um so I'm going to keep quiet now um and take it away. The first thing the first thing I like to mention when I do you know the course or I'm you know I'm talking to friends or teaching about this is is Recon is not a crime right it's just like Port scanning is not a crime Recon is not a crime so um we're gonna look at Tesla today because they have a bug Bounty um that is pretty open scope so in their bug bounty on Tesla's about Danny homepage they implore the company to find security vulnerabilities for them can get paid out really if we were going to work on Tesla it's a perfect example because not only do we have permission from the bug bounty to try and find some of their stuff but if we find something we could potentially submit it and get paid. I love that it's it's such a cool example so just with Recon as as a word perhaps for people who don't know what that means that's kind of trying to discover what's out there is that correct? Correct yeah so reconnaissance is the art of uh it's a subset of Osint which you've had some guests on who have done really really great Osint on the show before and that's Open Source Intelligence right it's gathering information that's on the public internet um about a target right in order to hack them or just use that information. Reconnaissance is a subset of Osint really focused on finding assets so these are servers on the internet that belong to a company like Tesla you know when you become a company like Tesla or any big company you start to do things like acquisitions and you have multiple websites and you basically get all of this IT infrastructure that just gets too big for you even to remember where everything is sometimes and it sounds funny but this happens all the time to big businesses so. And you've got developers spinning stuff and spinning stuff up in AWS or Whatnot right exactly right we're going to go over some Cloud Recon stuff today you have developers that are spinning stuff up for testing or uh you know just short-term development you have marketing people who have their own credit cards who can spin up you know branding sites you have sites that are maybe seasonal but don't get decommissioned you have Acquisitions which is a big one so we're going to talk about that also but you absorb whole other companies and whole other domains so um you know whereas we're going to look at tesla.com today we're also going to talk about how the footprint for Tesla is more than just tesla.com right because they have absorbed other companies like SolarCity and Gourmet Engineering and stuff like that really your IT infrastructure even when you're a medium-sized company can get crazy big and unmanageable to understand where everything is sometimes so that is a hackers opportunity that is what adversaries look for all it takes is one site for an adversary to get in and so what I like to tell my students is you know many hackers will just you know like focus on you know one side or dive really deep right but you know if I'm really trying to emulate a bad guy I am spending a lot of time on the Recon process to make my life easier so we'll go through a couple of things like that today. All right so in front of me on the right hand side I have my terminal right which is all we're all the fancy hackery stuff happens right. It's not green Jason I'm disappointed man. Hey listen you know I I'm running on a Windows box and and using a VPS right so I guess I lose a little bit of hacker credit for that but um no no I'm equal opportunity hacker so no. I'm just kidding you know you know wearing a hoodie and all the rest of that but I mean it's what I love about this is like you're an example of someone doing this in the real world not someone like pictured in the movies so I'll shut up go for it man. No no I'll get and on the left side I have a mind map right so this is a program called X mind it is just a productivity tool that allows you to make a mind map and so there's a lot of these tools out there I work a lot in mind maps to keep my brain organized especially when I'm doing a reconnaissance project so I organized the whole thing via a mind map and so here you can see you know today I've decided we're going to work on Tesla so I have this node here on the left that just says Tesla and then I start with some buckets you know things like to do things and things that I've done and things that I kind of want to investigate and I build this mind map as I go along you know looking at a target but for specifically for Recon I have a checklist that I go across and it's over here this is so that I don't forget as you know a red teamer um or you know a bug bounty hunter or any you know whatever I'm doing this Recon for you know what I need to be doing what I need to be finishing uh and then I can make sure that I finished everything make sure the data gets captured and you know the whole point of this reconnaissance is to find websites to hack to find more websites that because if you think about it if I'm hacking Tesla every site that I find is like a 0.2 multiplier in my success to successfully breach the company to find something really good every website or every service I find it's not just the main you know website that everybody orders the car off of which is tesla.com or shop.tesla.com so really that's what I care about is finding as much as I can for this target. So that could be like a sub domain or like like you said SolarCity it could be like some other kind of domain is that right. Yeah so there's there's two things we're going to look for prime or three things primarily we're going to look for today we're going to try to find all of Tesla's IP space uh all of their IPs and servers that they own we're gonna attempt to find all of their what I call Apex domains so that's like tesla.com and then what I call and then what the other sub domains which is like forum.tesla.com or purchase.tesla.com or if we could find something like admin.tesla.com because that would be juicy for us to Target right a lot of the tools we'll use today will focus on finding those sub domains but we're also going to talk about where we look and we're going to use some hacker staple tools I got a lot of content here for people on the show so I'm a big fan by the way and I'm really looking forward to you know hopefully the students take something home and the viewers oh yeah. No I appreciate it man so um I have my checklist here on the left and um I really have like three levels of Recon we're gonna dive into level one today that I think that's about all we're gonna have time for today the first thing we want to do when we look at a company like Tesla is we want to find their IP space, what IP space have they registered with the different Registries um do they have what's called an autonomous system number and uh and can we find that notate it down so that later on we can port scan it and we can look for web servers on it and services and things targets that we want to hack and so you know normally when you're on a red team engagement they'll give you you know an IP range or something like that that they want you know they want you to Target right but in a red team and you know what in a real red team engagement that's no scope you have to find that stuff yourself and in a bug Bounty context you also have to find a lot of that stuff yourself so the first step in being successful in finding their infrastructure is really finding their autonomous system number. So we are going to go to one of my favorite websites for this which is Hurricane Electric and Hurricane Electric is at bgp.he.net it is a BGP uh comp like helper company they handle routing information but they have this open search box here at the top of their website where you can search any company you know I could search you know twitch.tv you know if I was if I was hacking against Twitch um I can search Tesla in a second when it comes up but this freeform text search will allow me to possibly find um you know what I need to get the IP space for something so here I did twitch.tv and if I go I can see that you know they have gathered some information about Twitch they have these autonomous system numbers for Twitch I happen to know since I've hacked Twitch before that Twitch just hosted on Amazon and so I would have to dig through here but with our example today I can just put Tesla I don't even really have to know the right name and I can search here are all these companies that come back with autonomous system numbers for Tesla and so you can see that you have Tesla Motors as an organization name you have Ericsson, Nikola Tesla which is obviously not what we're looking for um so this is the first part also where you make sure you don't go out of scope on one of these tests because many automated tools will just look for this string Tesla and return any autonomous system number to you that has that in the name so you have to be really careful in this part of the methodology and to find you know kind of the right company you know obviously I think we've zoned in on Tesla Motors right and so they have a bunch of autonomous system numbers here now autonomous system numbers are groupings of basically ipspace that Tesla owns right and as soon as your company gets big enough and you know it gets on the routing protocols they basically want to designate your company as a set of IPs as a regis as part of the registry they'll give you one or two or three of these autonomous system numbers and if you just click in here it's just to reference who you are as a company as your IP space if you click in any of these you know you'll get some information on you know there who is information and stuff like this and this is valuable for us but really what we're looking for is one of these that gives us their full range of IPv4 addresses. So we'll click around in here until we find one that has prefixes V4 and so this is where most of their IP ranges are getting lumped together they're public IP ranges if we click on prefixes of V4 we start to see here their Network ranges so this is a start of our view as an adversary to understand where all of their IP space is except there's one caveat here this is owned IP space by Tesla it is not Cloud infrastructure because clouds have their own ASN and so this is not their Cloud infrastructure so we have to do a separate workflow to find their assets that are in the cloud the first step is to grab all this right and there's several tools that'll that'll take down this information so that later we can look for web servers in these ranges here we can look for services that are online in these ranges and you know a lot of your guests have used you know hacker tools like NMAP to you know find what's on stuff like this or you know a new report scanner or something like that so you know we would just grab all this and for the beginning of our campaign I am just going to dump it in my mind map so we can work with it later but we'll just put it in ASN data. And this stuff's all freely available you didn't have to register or do anything to get this right? Nope I did not at all yeah so x-mind is a free program this site that we're using BGP it's a public service uh site that you know gives you information on you know different companies BGP information routing information ranges and stuff like that so this is all free to use all these sites are free to use uh except for maybe one and I'll talk about that when we get to it. So the first thing we've done is we've tried to gather the IP ranges for our target that they own which is great um this is a great start for us as as hackers right now we have uh or right our red teamers so now we have some targets to go after um we also know that there was a couple other autonomous system numbers so there was three right there was this one, this one, this one and then these ranges should be encompassed in the other places so if we click here we just want to make sure there's no other ranges that we missed um so this second one has one more range that we might have missed so we'll grab that and we will also put it here and so yeah I just take notes as I go in my project here and I can clean this text up later obviously on the command line or something like that or I could even ask ChatGPT to do it for me I'm going to use um some AI to help me in my hacking today. Um so that's good. Yeah so we'll notate all that data and we'll we'll move on to the next section of kind of the methodology of targeting um Tesla. I love what you're doing with your with your company sorry to interrupt the Black Hat guys all the guys who really are trying to attack companies they don't have these like restrictions or guard rules do they? They don't. The fact that you're simulating it is fantastic you know how do you as a company make sure that you actually doing it right if you don't have someone that's actually doing that against you. I mean I've been a security leader as well as a bug Bounty Hunter for the last 5 years I would say and um you know being a security leader at a big organization you realize that there is a there's a gap between what the attackers are actually doing and what you're purchasing as Security Services from the security industry you know if you're like me and you have a security incident that's a pretty high profile one and you have to go through that even though you know you had all of the investment in the world um with all of the fancy defensive tools and great a great staff and you still you know get breached if you're like me you get a little pissed and you want to figure out why when that happened it sent me on a tear and I'm like why are none of our services doing you know threat Intel why are they not doing wide scope testing why are we not simulating you know real pivoting on the internal um Network that like the way that real attackers do and you know our threat actor did you know that's kind of the inspiration for a lot of this uh mixed with my success in the b Bug Bounty scene so a lot of the companies that I talk about in my examples I've participated in their bug bounties and found you know critical findings for for them in the past so. Now I love that I mean sometimes the best business is one that's come out of the pain that you've suffered so. Yes it is yeah yeah where any good idea comes from pain that you've suffered yeah. We've got our IPs space data if for some reason you can't find the company you're looking for on Hurricane Electric bgp.he.net there are some other sites that you can use that'll give you autonomous system number data you can also look at your site at look at your target just in their registry page so like ARIN here if you go to whois.arin.net/ui/query.do uh ARIN also has a free form search and it's uh it's up here and you can just search uh Tesla here and you can get some information about um you know what you think might be Tesla here and then you can see indeed the organization name matches Tesla Motors Inc and you can click you know in here and you can basically filter around until you get you know some IP range information for Tesla here's the networks right here. So here is you know one of the ranges but if we look at this range 192.95 I'm pretty sure it's already represented in what we found on bgp.he.net if we clean up this data later I'm going to grab it be sure you never ever want to miss anything so I will put it here cool. So in the background normally when I'm doing an engagement the process of port scanning these really big IP ranges is a long process right it wouldn't be something we could do live while I do have an order of operations of doing the reconnaissance on a company at this point I would take all of these IP ranges I would take just the ranges and I would just like do something like grab all this and then if you don't want to do fancy regex on the command line you can just say can you and always be nice to your AI right can you please we have me just the IP ranges and then paste your data into here so this is a front end for my ChatGPT APIs this is called typing mind but in on the back end it's just ChatGPT 4. So this is just another website that you found that that you can freely use right? Freely use right, yeah so that's correct yeah so it's just a front end for my ChatGPT API it allows me to save questions in a library it allows me to um well allows me to utilize the API there's a difference between when you use the front end for OpenAI and ChatGPT what you can do with that versus what you can do with an API key that you purchase from OpenAI you can set the temperature for the answer to your questions you can specify exactly what algorithm you want to use there's just more you can do with the API than just like the website a lot of people use and so this site you just put in your API key and it is a front-end that's similar to ChatGPT but it's using my API key and it also keeps me informed of how much I'm spending as I go along which is important because sometimes you know things can get crazy like if you leave your Amazon server running and um you know stuff like that so ChatGPT is a tremendous regex helper and so anytime I want to you know do anything that I would normally spend time Googling on um it can help me do that in regex so here I have now all the IP ranges and. You had to put your API key in so that is a requirement you have to put in your own API key? Yeah so that you charged rather than that front-end run yeah. Correct yeah okay yeah and I would just dump these in there cool so now that's cleaner and there we have our notes and so at this point I would send all these to a port scanner so Jason obviously you know I don't really want you to run an NMAP scan now because we'll be here till tomorrow you you run those yesterday so which scanner did you use and like um it just gave you back IPs I'm assuming right yeah exactly so um so yeah running a scan live would take a long time especially for how big these ranges are right so um the scanner I use is mass scan so I feed all of these um these IPs in the mask scan and I'm looking for you know a set of very specific ports but many of your guests have gone over how to use NMAP and if you wanted to use NMAP as well you could feed these to NMAP as well and so I will run those scans in my workflow while I move on to other sections of the methodology and then at the end I'll title I'll tie all together and start you know actually analyzing what came back from the port scans and stuff like that. So the next section of the methodology is asking ourselves questions about Tesla and what I like to say is that for every sub domain I find for Tesla it's like a 0.2 multiplier of me you know having success on the target for every Apex domain I find that's associated to Tesla if this is my target is like a 2X multiplier of me hacking my target because when I find a new Apex domain uh usually an Apex domain and in this case we'll just you know use one that I know exists for Tesla like SolarCity if I can find a domain like that solarcity.com there's probably many many sub domains that exist for that and so it's almost 2x the attack surface that I had before so I want to find out you know what are some more companies that maybe Tesla has gobbled up in acquisitions or or whatever and so for that I'm going to use a couple of OSINT tools um the first one is going to be Crunchbase I'm going to grab Crunchbase from over here so Crunchbase is a business aggregator company where they sell information about uh different businesses to other businesses um whether you're looking for information on your competition or what they're doing or what their funding is like or who they're acquiring you can pay a site like Crunchbase to give you a database of all of that and that could be useful to you as a company. We're going to use it in a hacker sense and we're going to log into it and we're gonna we're gonna steal all the data we we can from it. So so here I've just logged in with a free account to Crunchbase I registered it myself it didn't cost me anything you know they tried to get me to pay for a fancy really expensive license but I don't need that to do my my general purpose stuff here. And so what I want to do is is start looking at Tesla and just in their search box up here and you can see uh pretty easily I find on their site Tesla the organization and I can see that I can get some very general information about the company like you know where their base based out of newly Austin Texas right their main domain here tesla.com which we knew from starting this engagement kind of their number of funding and and you can get a whole bunch of information here that's useful in a red teaming context but the first thing I grab out of Crunchbase is there is as much information as Crunchbase will give me about their acquisitions. So if I click in the acquisitions here you can see that for the last 8 years or so or 9 years Tesla has gobbled up quite a few companies that uh that Crunchbase knows about so SolarCity is one we've talked about a couple times they were a solar energy company Grohmann Engineering a company called Perbix, a company called Maxwell Technologies I'll zoom in on this a little bit. You can see there's some undisclosed acquisitions here on these lines as well and we will attempt to find everything we can, Hibar Systems, ATW Automation, Springpower and Wiferion. Each one of these before they will go they were gobbled up by Tesla had their own infrastructure, their own own it space that maybe even their own ASN they definitely had a website and a domain and so each one of these represents as a red teamer or you know someone who's working on a wide scope Bug Bounty like that 2x opportunity of hacking Tesla because Tesla now owns this and they are responsible for this architecture. um this this Internet space and so the acquisitions are really really important here. So we can go to something like Wiferion and you can see here is their main domain and they still have infrastructure on the net even though they're fully owned by Tesla now if we were a red team you know this goes in the bucket of things we want to hack. Now today we're going to stick with tesla.com mostly for our tool examples but we do now have a new Apex domain wiferion.com and if you want to make sure you're not going out of scope in a red team engagement or a Bug Bounty that's a little bit wider scope you can always you know scroll look at these companies and scroll down and make sure that they already have have changed their privacy policy or trademark down here to mention that they are now owned by the new company and so here it says Tesla engineering Germany so they have already changed their name so we know that this is in scope you know or at least is owned by our target for sure. And so now we have uh you know we have a couple of acquisitions right so if we go back. Do you find that sometimes the easiest way to get into the company is to go through these Acquisitions because perhaps they don't have the same security in place yet as the main organization? Absolutely so in red team context usually they will engage us at the point of they're ready to holistically test you know kind of everything, in the Bug Bounty World sometimes they put what I like to call cooldowns video game term right um they put cooldowns on Acquisitions and so they'll say hey we're really interested in you finding security vulnerabilities for our Acquisitions for instance Google does this but we need you to wait 90 days until after the acquisition so that we can move everything over because it just doesn't happen overnight if you've ever worked in IT and you've acquired a company none of that work of bringing them over to your side you know some of these companies are you know companies working out of their garage right there they make a cool thing and they don't have any security they're they're working out of um you know Google like business Google you know like uh Google domains and you know barely have a website and this you know the services that they write are you know fairly functional they're not going to have security uh. Exactly. Um and so yeah so you do find that a lot of times you can get in through these Acquisitions um depending on what maturity they were when they were acquired. But again it's you know the bad actors if you like are not going to care about that. They don't care at all no they they're gonna get in through anywhere yeah so we have a list of Acquisitions now there's command line tools that will take your cookie for Crunchbase and on the command line parse out all the Acquisitions they can find one thing that's important to realize is that you only get the first X number of Acquisitions out of Crunchbase until they ask you to pay for the service and so I don't have like a full you know try I don't have a full account to Crunchbase or a full but I can get mostly what I need from the free access and then we can you know do some other fancy tricks as well. So I grab all this and I'm gonna um so that's ASN data set up acquisitions if I can spell it right yep and then we'll just dump these in here and I can clean up this data later using you know ChatGPT again if I want to or regex but I just want to put these in there later you know each one of these new acquisitions I'm going to have to find the main domain and do this whole methodology we're doing for on the left four today we're going to stick with tesla.com because you know a full Recon process could take up to for like a full red team engagement could take up to a week or a couple weeks honestly so we're gonna um we're gonna keep it moving. Another place you can find really interesting information in the OSINT world about a company like Tesla is this uh is this website called OCC ALEPH and OCCRP ALEPH let me grab this over here. So this is aleph.occp or occrp.org what OCCRP ALEPH is is it's a search engine for investigative reporters and basically it has a whole bunch of research material and access to databases of company filings and Acquisitions and just data sets related around even court cases and stuff like that for journalists and it's a free tool for them to use that this company puts out there you can go to this website and you can find some stuff that maybe like a Crunchbase wouldn't tell you about Tesla. So if we just search Tesla here or we'll just search Tesla Motors because we know that's kind of how they reference themselves at this point you can go to data sets there's a ton of stuff in here for like filings about Tesla Motors and this is cool like these PDFs are you know definitely like good to learn about the context of your company the court cases they engage in and stuff like that but really you want to get to the ones that have this little data set icon down here and mention just the organization name with the building each one of these data sets you can drill into but for a company like Tesla because they're a US company you want to find the data set that says US SEC Corp watch and so this is the Security and Exchange commissions database about watching movements to do with Tesla Motors and so there'll be a couple of these entries and you have to fish around to find the one that has the most assets associated to it but you can click in here and this one doesn't have hardly anything that we want to use so we will click out and we will just keep on moving along let's look at this one LTD now so we're looking for one that has a bunch of assets associated to it okay here it is okay so. So we found this one right here it's a Corp watch entry and if you click on Tesla Inc you can see here assets and shares 1K and so if you click in this area this gives you a super interesting view of all of the smaller investors that Tesla has made into smaller companies so you'll see some of the big companies on here like Solar Explorer that's actually a medium size but when Tesla was growing into the solar space with SolarCity they ended up buying up all these small mom-and-pop solar panel companies right and those things don't make it on a Crunchbase right but did they absorb a website or did they absorb some IT infrastructure of these companies? We're interested in finding out that question and so aleph.occrp can give us you know some view here that no other place can really give us it also tells us who's investing in them and so you can you know you can grab these and dig into these but really the names are what's important here and once you can see the names you can Google these smaller companies like Presidio Solar and see if they had a website etc that you can can you can add to you know your Apex domains or your recon data here if they're the one thing you want to make sure is that Tesla didn't just invest in them rather than buying them outright. If they're bought out right they're in scope for your red team engagement if they just invested in a small company you probably don't want to go hacking them so you kind of have to Google around a little bit and figure it out but this is like kind of level 1.5 of the acquisition section of Recon. So we would go through here and grab although there's a lot for Tesla and we would mark them in our mind map somewhere over here under Acquisitions I'd want to parse it down with some ChatGPT magic or some regex or something like that but we're going to move on to the last place where you can get acquisition investment data which is actually from AI. AI having trained you know on the Internet it has a lot of information so if I go here to ChatGPT which I'm using 3.5 you have to remember that ChatGPT cutoff is in 2021 so they're not going to know any of the newer Acquisitions you can't ask it because it's trained on the whole data set of the Internet what can you tell me about Tesla Motors acquisitions okay so it's gone through here and I asked what can you tell me about Tesla Motors Acquisitions. And here it gives us SolarCity which we knew um Grohmann Engineering, Maxwell Technologies Deepscale, so it gave me everything kind of I already knew I already knew about all these from Crunchbase I'm pretty sure actually we didn't get Deepscale as a, as an output from Crunchbase so we got one thing out of AI that um that we didn't get out of Crunchbase AI can hallucinate every once in a while and AI's knowledge is cut off in 2021 so we would want to go Google and see if this company is still owned by Tesla and that it indeed did happen but I have done this project before and Deepscale is actually still an owned Acquisition of Tesla and so they would go in you know our Apex target list basically. So you can use AI and ask the different data sets what they know about your target because they've trained on on so much publicly available internet data. It's just crazy how easy it is when you know the tools right? Yeah no absolutely it's I mean the world is is your bucket if you're good at Open Source Intelligence and Recon right like you can find out anything about it anyone honestly uh it's it's pretty amazing I mean some of the some of the level of Recon or of OSINT that you know exists in the community of people being able to look at the background of your photo and accurately tell you exactly where you're standing at the time of day it's crazy yeah so Okay so we've gotten the IP space for our company we've gotten Acquisitions and we're only halfway through there's a lot more to do um we're not even halfway through honestly and we haven't one thing to notice about this is that when you're doing red teaming you know stealth is important you don't want to burn you know an IP address that you're coming from or get blacklisted you know right off the bat by the client all the stuff we've done so far is completely passive um we haven't even actually touched them at all so that's important for red teamers to to stay stealthy and so pretty much everything in the light blue in my checklist here is passive we don't even get to stuff where we touch the clients until down here um so it really gives us um you know a lot of good stuff. Okay so we've got a bunch of Acquisitions we've got a bunch of IP Space that's there's already a really great place to start from before an adversary right like um really really great place to start with they're more esoteric methods to find other websites of Tesla. One is using a bookmarklet and site called builtwith um and so if I go to builtwith, builtwith is a company that profiles technology they sell that technology information to other businesses and the General Industry saying hey a lot of people are using Shopify that's like the preferred e-commerce site right now right or whatever but they offer basically what's useful for me is a bookmarklet it's up here it's a little BW in Chrome they have a fire it's not a bookmark it's a Chrome extension they also have a Firefox extension if you're using Firefox but if you go to just tesla.com um there's our target right main website and you click built with it gives you all of the technology that it can understand that Tesla's using so they're using Google analytics they have a whole bunch of site tag, you know analytics stuff they have a Bugcrowd, Bug Bounty I don't know exactly how they know this but that's interesting this is you know where I know to hack Tesla. They're using Slack, they use Adobe they use TeamViewer so like they have all this Tech that they can fingerprint that Tesla's using and a database of the tech that Tesla's using and usually they sell this business intelligence to other companies but if we look here and we go to the tabs up here there's a tab called relationships and with this tab has on it is Tesla is using ad and analytics codes like Google trackers basically for marketing to understand how well their site's doing in kind of a marketing sense and there's several different ad and analytics trackers that exist there's there's the Google ones, there's New Relic, there's Adobe based ones, there's a whole bunch. If you click on this relationship tab while you have built with installed you can click on this UA code here and you can find out other sites that built with has seen that use this same code and so this can give you some information about okay what other sites might Tesla own? And so you can zoom in here and see that these other connected domains are using this Google analytics tag we knew tesla.com but a domain that they own is also teslammotors.com here's a subdomain that they own, here is like I don't know if these are parked domains or not but um temasiplik I don't know what that is but they're using the same analytics code powertesla.ru yeah and so there's a bunch of other sites that are using their ad and analytics codes and so there are command line tools to grab this data just from built with and now you have basically exponentially potentially increased your attack surface for Tesla by finding all of these other top level Apex domains that they have tesla.cn is the one I've hacked before so and this is like a this is a lesser known Recon method right like not a lot of red teamers are going to this level of looking at the analytics codes of their targets right this is um this is some pretty fancy stuff that you know like real bad guys do in fact I did this at um a major financial company and I did this demo and I'm sitting up there and I'm I'm doing this exact method clicking on the add-in analytics code and we're looking at some of the domains that come back and they're like oh that's a real adversary who bought a domain and they want to look like us so they implemented the same UA code in their source code but it's actually official it's actually a phishing domain for them to try to fish you know our customers and so we sat there with their IR team going one by one and being like is this legit? No. Is this legit? Yes. Is this legit? No. That was a really fun class that we did because they were like this is amazing we can just reverse search this ad and analytics code we spent quite a bit of uh time on this section but um but yeah that was that was a cool example of this being helpful for defenders basically. I love that because I mean you are giving, well you you're selling the service where you hack companies yeah but I mean just for someone who wants to start a business there's a whole business in that you know helping companies find out what fake stuff is out there. Yeah exactly yeah I mean you'll you'll find typo squatted domains you'll find um you know just slight misspellings in the domain that look like Tesla Motors like they'll use a zero instead of uh O um you'll find all kinds of stuff and you know to make those sites look legitimate to Google or browsers or whatever they'll embed all the same admin analytics codes. So yeah so this will balloon out your attack surface this method and it's it's really nice and um at the end of my engagement when I finish level one Recon for a company like Tesla I have thousands of sites um you know let I have you know maybe sub a hundred Apex domains but for those Apex domains I probably have thousands of sub domains and that has drastically increased in my success of running a successful campaign against a company like Tesla breaking in from the internet to their internal because I have so many chances um so many websites that are there that I can attack. I'm glad you said that because you know when you're going through this you can kind of get lost in the weeds and think now why am I why are you doing all of this but that's exactly the answer right there right? Yes exactly yeah I want to give I mean using a baseball term if anybody is a sports person I want to give myself as many at bats as possible and and good Recon gives you more at bats and you know a lot of of people can get stuck in Recon because it's a lot of data it's a lot of parsing and you're not to the hacking part yet and so like hackers get antsy they're like they're like I want to go I want to start hacking the website but I always have to tell my team or you know anybody else like you want a successful campaign you really want to emulate the adversary you do this 10% that nobody else does and you will be successful at least in my career that's what I found. So just for people who don't know the baseball terminology that's in other words you're just giving your yourself more and more chances to hit the ball right? Yes more at bats yeah yeah yeah and then like the other analogy would be rather than going through the fortified front door you go through a window on the back of the house or the floor . Exactly yeah yeah I mean Tesla has obviously probably spent a bunch of money securing tesla.com right and and the website that you buy the car from right obviously they're going to invest a ton of money in securing that but have they you know invested the same amount of money to protect the forums probably not have they invested the same amount of money to test their Regional China distributor website no probably not. So I was going to say in other words you would you'd get into the systems by going through one of these back doors for lack of a better term or you know one of these weakened systems right?Yeah weaker yeah I call them under security loved they're just you know they don't have all the security love that the main site has right so yeah but okay so this is a method we can use to balloon out the attack service for our target and have more chances to hack them the next thing we want to do in our methodology is use your life Shodan and I can't remember if I've seen an episode where anyone on your show has really done any Shodan stuff before Ben did a bit and OccupyTheWeb is a little bit but you just go for it, assume we haven't seen it before so just explain what it is and show us how you use it it's always nice to get different perspectives so okay I assume we haven't seen it before. Okay cool so Shodan is a site that we use next in our methodology and there's a couple reasons we use Shodan next scenario on our methodology so um Shodan is a website an infrastructure spider I call it and what they do is Shodan has a set of technology that will visit every website on the planet as it finds it and not only will it index it in its database not only will it index the URL that it finds and maybe the port that but it also goes way deeper than that it will put you know like the website title and you know some SSL certificate information it's the best infrastructure spider that exists in the world pretty much. Now why is that important to a hacker right well remember I don't actually want to touch my target yet but I want to get as much information about them as possible before I start deciding to hack them and so Shodan has already done a lot of work for me to understand uh has spidered the whole internet and I can use Shodan to find interesting things about my target before I ever really want to touch them. You know like I know other people on your show have you know done some general Shodan but you know for people watching this episode maybe just tuned in for this one Shodan pretty simple you, you go to shodan.com or shodan.io and you can create a free account and you get a number of free queries they're called and it's just a search engine and so the search engine syntax the way you search for something is you can just go org:\"tesla\" I'm just going to say Tesla here and take it and just put it between quotes and then we can press enter. So here you can see um we get IP information for something that they've found when they found it here we get SSL information and then we have Port information yeah so we can get a lot of information about our targets before ever touching them because Shodan has already touched them. Now a lot of hackers use this to great success but a lot of hackers also struggle with like how is this useful to me right like how is Shodan useful to me there are some tools that do some really cool parsing of the Shodan data and so one of the ones I like to use is called karma and so I pre-run it before the show because it does take a while to run and you do need a paid Shodan API key but goes on sale every month pretty much where you can get a free account for Shodan for really cheap like a sale just ended for Shodan for $5 for access to their data set and they're always doing promotions on Twitter for free licenses you know for people retweeting them and stuff like that so even if you pay for it it's not that expensive and for a red teamer like me it is a drop in the bucket for you know kind of what it gets me. So what Karma does is it's a command line tool that will take kind of what we just did via the website but do it via the API and give us a whole bunch of really cool data it does take a while to run because it parses all of the data that's in Shodan so I'm going to scroll back up here and I'm going to kind of show you what the output of something like Karma looks like and why I use it so a lot of output here but we're getting to the top I promise okay. So here I ran karma-d tesla.com so we're just looking at that mainsite tesla.com and I'm telling Karma that um I want it to run and grab all of the data and so the way I tell it that is limit minus one is is just go until you can't find any more data on Tesla and find everything you can in all of your methods to find stuff about Tesla and so you use this tool and it goes through the database that Shodan has connected remember I'm not actually touching Tesla at all right now and it finds thousands you know hundreds of hosts that mention tesla.com it finds all their certificate information and then it starts to give me really interesting results about I found this many sites that were login pages or this many sites that were forbidden for some reason or some other interesting stuff that we're going to get to in the output down here and so this is why it gets kind of valuable to me as a red teamer because I can start to identify really interesting domains right off the bat using just the Shodan data one of the things it does is it looks at all the favicons the little icons in your browser in the top and it looks for favicon that it knows are associated with interesting technology Shodan is kind of catered towards security people it is a you know it is a service that anybody can purchase but it's very catered towards security people it tells me hey these favicons for these websites are things that I think are interesting now I wish it gave a little bit more context right here but I know that a path called dana-na is actually the path for a VPN login this list is gold for me as a red teamer these are the addresses for most of Tesla's VPN logins these addresses right here so already those are prime targets for me to understand you know if I can find credentials of someone at Tesla I want to use them in these areas to try to get into the internal Network because these are the VPN logins it'll also go do some other stuff and then it gives you like a huge dump of information like neighboring sites I ignore all of this um so I'll scroll down through it until you get to the interesting finding section uh eventually I can look in these text files that it outputs and find random SSL stuff some some sites that have like forbidden in them Tesla's really useful here because in some of those ASNs that Tesla had they also own IPv6 space right because we were you know apparently running out of IPv4 space a long time ago which I don't know if that actually came true or not you know we we made the slight pivot to IPv6 now for me as a Pentester Port scanning an IPv6 network is most of the time impossible because it's so big there's so many addresses in an IPv6 range but by looking at Shodan it also tells me a bunch of address IPv6 addresses that they're hosting websites on yeah in this data you can see that these addresses are here and so I can go visit these and see what they're hosting on IPv6 addresses which could be interesting. Have you ever found that it's easy to hack IPv6 was it still IPv4s like the bread and butter of hacking? You know I have found companies utilizing IPv6 and probably falling into the trap of thinking no one will ever find this because it's on an IPv6 address and so it's okay that I don't put any security investment into this development website or whatever well so yes I have found that several times in in my red teaming and directly because I look on Shodan for IPv6 addresses. That's interesting so you don't try and scan it you just find it here and then those are the ones you see it's worth it it's worth someone's time to attack IPv6 because often it's it's misconfigured or something. Yeah but it's not worth it like when we went to um bgp.he.net if I would have clicked around in that section I would have seen their IPv6 ranges but that is billions of IP addresses or billions of addresses for IPv6 and that would take me years to port scan right this way I know they're already associated because Shodan has done that work for me and I can just sift through this data and find the addresses that I know are up so it's. I mean I mean with with my background it's really interesting to see you know how you think about IPv4 versus IPv6 yeah so um that's great. Yeah I mean I found some real gold on um on IPv6 addresses because like I said developers assume that nobody would ever find it which I don't know what that says about IPv6 right but we're not using it as much as we thought we were. Yeah let's get heated comments you know yeah IPv6 is never going to get used you know people will start screaming at me in the comments of us and stuff like that yeah. I mean I know you have a big a big Cisco routing crowd and um you know you do trainings there so it'll actually be really interesting you know if we fully ever pivot over it it basically renders Port scanning almost like null because it just takes too long to do at scale for an IPv6 range um so it'll be really interesting how security testers pivot and adversaries pivot to finding infrastructure for companies when we do. But I love I love that you've like the hacker mentality you've used Shodan to get around all of that problem and just find the addresses like it so simply that's great sorry go on. No no worries so um what it'll also give me uh Karma will give me like anything that has login in the title of the web page for Tesla so if I go like here and I grab this just IP address and port and these all get dumped to text files this is we're doing this live so I don't actually know what's on this but if I paste and go to this in my browser I mean that's something interesting right like they have a cPanel login associated to them on Port 2083 right so this is a web server running on Port 2083 but I don't know if I would have necessarily found this using any other thing than Karma because karma used the Shodan API and then looked for the name tesla.com and something that had login in the title up here and was able to alert me and so that's that's kind of why I like Karma it has a whole bunch of these built in what we call Shodan Dorking checks in it and it keeps on updating them as time goes on and I can build my own as well if I find something interesting so let's say I wanted to make a Shodan query for move it I can add it to this framework and it will scan everything that it sees it says tesla.com and look for move it and in case you know viewers don't know move it is a big vulnerability that just came out you know for a file transfer protocol website had SQL injection and some other vulnerabilities in it and it affected a lot of companies and was really really a big deal for for still is to this day actually . So for people who haven't seen the video I've linked it below OccupyTheWeb did a whole piece on move it um and explained a bit about SQL injection and you know the issues and the CVE and stuff but yeah sorry Jason I want to take us on a tangent that's great. All right so um I'm gonna move on to the next uh thing I do with Shodan so this will give me interesting stuff to look at I'll parse through this data as I go along the next tool I use is called shosubgo and all shosubgo does is just give me the sub domains and domains uh from the Shodan data set right so it's really just a limited view of what I can get out of it it's not telling me interesting sites it's just telling me what it can find for tesla.com you have to manually specify your API I key on the command line so I'm not going to show my run of it but this is the output that it gave me and it just gives you new lines and limited lines of everything it found for tesla.com you know this data will end up going on my mind map at some point and some people don't use mind maps they'll use you know like a spreadsheet or something like that so. I think the one concern I have perhaps in the viewers might have is is an overwhelming amount of data here it is how do you decide what to look at or you will you cover that in like some in something else? Yeah so so we're going over many very in-depth ways to find assets that belong to Tesla right and this is this is already just from one method we have a bunch of subdomains here that we'll have to look at right and when I talk to security testers or when I tell people like what are adversaries doing there's a few things that allow them to prioritize what to do with all this data but the the true answer is it's like how do you eat an elephant right one bite at a time honestly there's no magic to it it's like okay so I dump all of those domains in my mind map and when I'm done with all of this Recon I could have thousands thousands of sites to choose to hack and there are some slight ways to prioritize them but most of the time I'm just going down this list one by one and actually hacking them right like right now we're not hacking anything we're just finding stuff uh I will just go down this list one by one and do a full website assessment on each one of these sites and then when I'm done I take it from the box here and I move it into the done box on the other side and it's it's not technical at any means but that's that's just how you do it you know there's there's no way to hack a site unless you hack a site so so. But I love what you're sharing because it's the same thing I've heard from other people you know it's the difference between Tick Tock hacking versus all the movies versus what you're actually doing in the real world. I mean there's a lot of people that'll take this data and they will do a vulnerability scan on it and you can automate that right that's a that's a good thing you could do but as a red teamer and um a Bug Bounty Hunter that's not going to get you anything that you really want right you will go to these sites and then you will do a full web hacking methodology on them which is the second day of my course and what we spend a majority of our time on my red team doing is looking at these sites and being like okay let's see what they are are they a login do they have default credentials you know platform are they written in can we do SQL injection can we do cross-site scripting you know all of those things that you normally do with um a web test basically yes you just have to do the work basically. You just have to do the works don't you. Yeah that's it yeah there's no there's no magic way to not do the work right I mean people wish there was but yeah. Yeah of course yeah yeah um so we'll. I've got the solution to that actually all I need to do is pay you to do it so. Yeah yeah I know exactly right I mean I mean there are levels of this that get automated and we've written a bunch of automation to get us to the manual hacking point faster but you never want to skip the manual hacking point so yeah come come see us we'll help you out. So the next thing we're going to do is um we could do look at reverse who is which is the idea of you know every single one of these websites has to register with Whois and instead of looking at um you know Whois record from one point of view we can reverse it and try to see who's registered uh who you know if a person has registered more than one site to do this idea we use a site called Whoxy which is a online reverse Whois database you can go here to Whoxy and it is paid but it's a pretty cheap license for you know a red team or something like that I try to keep most of my tools approachable for my students you know to you know if they're going to invest and you can go to reverse Whois and you can go to company name and you can say like Tesla here and this tells you other things that Tesla's that Tesla as a company name was registered in so you can do it this way and look and I don't know what a lot of this stuff is like sometimes companies park these domains so that other people don't grab them sometimes they only exist for a little while this is one of the lossy kind of methods for reconnaissance so I have to do a lot of manual research to see if any of these are actually valuable to me um but the what the other thing you can do is just do like the regular who is look up here and just enter tesla.com and then here if you look at the regular data here eventually you'll see that you know the registrant was a a proxy the administrative context is all proxied by DNS extension technical content all proxied so really the only thing we can do here is is use their API for like similar domains and so it's just looking for the keyword Tesla so this will be pretty lossy as one of our methodologies but you can do reverse Whois analysis on your target and get some some neat fines from there one of the ones is um is that I'd use in my demos all the time is like if I do the Whois look up or the who is history I can do twitch.tv I'm a gamer so I really like twitch and I stream on there right and so if I use Whoxy to look up twitch.tv it gives me the history of kind of their domain ownership and here I can see that they used to be called Justin TV but first they were Justin TV then they rebranded to Twitch and then they got purchased by Amazon but I can see that the company Justin TV registered 20 domains back when they were registering their own domains I can click on that and these are new Apex domains that I absolutely know belong to Twitch so twitchevent twitchcon is um twitch's con like they have a conference where you can go and streamers go to and stuff like that and so and then there's our main domain twitch.tv so you can use analysis of who Whois records to understand and find new Apex domains. I love this you know you seem to know in some ways more about a company than they do themselves. because oftentimes I do Recon on them yeah oftentimes I do in fact one of the funny things is is taking this Recon data to a company and doing like a workshop kind of like we're on on your show right now right doing a workshop for them and being like here's all the stuff I find and they're like we had no idea that was on the internet either we we had no idea that's on the internet still or we have no idea what that is at all like what is that and we'll go and look at it and they'll be like oh that was a thing that we did in 2015 and we never took offline or like I don't know what that is it's definitely ours but I don't know what business unit inside of Twitch or Tesla made that site and it's so interesting how fragmented companies can get they just don't understand their attack surface at all. And I mean in your experience with Bug Bounty and like red teaming and and the like it's because of those things that they've forgotten about that's often the door in right? Yes absolutely when you when you run an Enterprise level Bug Bounty um it's about 50/50 right you'll get submissions to your main site and you'll find people will find vulnerabilities on your main site and then the like you know about 50% of the time and that's really good right because that's where a lot of people spend a lot of their time on and then the other 50% if you allow them to submit will be for or other sites of yours that you had you had no idea and so you know using a Bug Bounty as a defensive tool is really like a an absolutely like investment you should make right it makes my job as a red team harder if a company's already had a Bug Bounty because a lot of the bug bounty hunters have found stuff like this and already submitted it you know one of my biggest targets I don't use it as a demo because I don't want to get the lawyers you know after me but is uh Walmart they have a public Bug Bounty and I have made much money from uh Walmart doing Bug Bounty it's one of the biggest scopes on the planet they have over 6000 different websites based on my Recon 6000 websites for them and all of their brands right Walmart in the US own Sam's Club they owned uh asada in um in the UK they own seiyu in Japan they're multinational company that owns many Brands so when I do Recon for Walmart it gets real hairy because it's it's huge but I found a ton of stuff on there you know when they opened the Bug Bounty uh at least I know people who work there in the defensive side they're like we found stuff we didn't even know that we owned for instance they had a whole bunch of brands that were their South American brands and they're like yeah we own this I can see that we purchased this group of grocery stores in South America and we own the site but no one's looked at this for security since we bought it and you found SQL injection there and you know now we know um so that's good you know so. That's great I love this I love the stories. No no worries so we can use Whois Data to find more Apex domains um and then these go back into the beginning of our methodology again we do the subdomain enumeration showed on and stuff like that Recon is a cyclical process you have to decide when enough is enough though that's where a lot of hackers get stuck is they do get information overload my mind thinks about companies like this and I teach my teams to think about companies the same way I do but um many bug bounty hunters are just like okay I am overwhelmed and so you have to decide when enough Recon is enough and when when you move on to the analysis phase of the sites you start hacking the sites right I will keep on going to the last ounce that I can find out about this company because you know I don't ever like to lose in an engagement in a red team engagement I want to get in. For everyone who's watching Jason can do a whole bunch more so please put in the comments below stuff that you want to see I see like get there Jason I see some a whole bunch of other things that you that I'd love to see you know you cover but perhaps you can just wrap it up with one more and then we we can do the rest in a separate session. Absolutely yeah sounds good um okay so we'll finish up the first one I guess with Cloud right so we know we know our target and their IP Space from their ASN data right but what we don't have a visibility like a full visibility of is like what do they have in the cloud right and many organizations today are hybrid they have owned IP Space and Cloud Space and so like how do you go about finding what a client has in the cloud and this is like thing that most most pentesters will miss they'll only go after IP ranges that the customers will give them or red teamers will give them and so there is a number of projects that their whole thing is going out to the cloud ranges which are published right you can go to AWS ranges you can just Google it and Amazon public publishes all of the IP ranges for their networks online and so you can pull this from a link somewhere and you can pull data from it but what a whole bunch of these research companies are doing is they're going to those IP ranges and downloading all of the SSL certificates for the IPs they will send a port scan across all of Amazon and then anything that responds on Port 443 they'll then visit over https and download their s their SSL certificate and in the SSL certificate is referenced what site that certificate is usually for it's in the metadata of the certificate if you've never seen an SSL certificate you can go to your browser and click on on the lock yeah here's connection is secure and then certificate and then here's your certificate for Google there's certificate for google.com is referenced to *google.com and it's got a whole bunch of areas here in the certificate but there are some areas that you can look at in the certificate that'll tell you other sites this certificate might be used for now with Googles they've done a pretty good job about not leaking you know anything let's look at Tesla so this project Kaeferjaeger it's a group of hackers and I'll I'll float you guys the link Kaeferjaeger will go out and they will do that scanning for you they will go out and scan all of Amazon all of digitalocean all of Google all of Microsoft all of Oracle now there's a couple of groups that do this that do this crazy level of scanning don't pay any attention to the dates here because these are old if you go into here you can see that the last time they scanned was a seven five so like that or a five seven that's not that bad so this is a complete view of everything that responded on Port 443 and had a certificate as of that date and so you can download these files to your local Linux machine and you can just look for Tesla inside of them if I go here to my command prompt I mean I just have some fancy bash scripting that'll do this for me but it's pretty it's a pretty easy like command line syntax so if I just cut all of these text files which represent all of the cloud data that we could find I mean we get everything this this will go on forever this is every site that responds to 443 in the clouds and it will it will go on forever and so let me kill it but if we do that and we grep for make a little bit bigger here let me grab for tesla.com and we'll put this in quotes and then we will also have to escape this period and then we also want to look for DOT tesla.com and we'll escape that period as well if we search this here's everything in the Cloud that Tesla has that least we've seen and let me make a little bit smaller here so it's readable but here is all their Cloud infrastructure they are in mostly AWS from you know what I've seen um and inside of their certificates we can see that they've referenced themselves and even inside of their certificates we can already see some pretty sensitive references to like other subdomains for Tesla so billing.tesla.com is in the cloud this certificate right here is for several sites uh Kronos Dev anything that says Dev I'm really interested in testing Kronos Dev database I'm interested in looking at et cetera et cetera and so I'm starting to look at the cloud for all of their assets uh Fleet streaming API engineering vncloudtesla.com definitely want to look at that these more engineering focused names for subdomains if you go to them and you're able to visit the website they're usually under secured right like Engineers who are doing like a you know an API for a very specific thing in the cloud Cloud first of all they might not think anybody can find this second of all they don't get the same budget to secure this service as you know the main site gets budget for the cloud data here is really really valuable for hackers so you can download these files and just parse them on your local box actually I'm doing a Defcon talk if anybody's interested in coming on releasing a tool set so you can download this data yourself with my friend um Gunner and so me and Gunner are going to release what we call Cloud scan Cloud scan will do the scanning for you and you can keep a really fresh database of everything in the cloud and it'll also monitor the cloud anytime a new domain for Tesla comes up if you tell it to Monitor tesla.com and so if I'm a hacker and I'm sitting here at my desk and I'm having coffee and I'm watching a video about Diablo 4 or something like that it will alert me and it will be like hey a new domain for tesla.com has come online you should be the first to hack this and I will go start looking at it yeah so that's a Defcon talk we're doing. Wanted to ask you like if you hack a Dev site will they still pay you out? Yes they will absolutely I mean it usually depends on what I get access to by hacking it you know those are all what we call the red team World initial access right so once you get in on one site you know you can usually leverage it to to pivot to other things so every every success is a win in my eyes usually but for the bug bounties it all depends on what data you were able to take from that platform so you know like whatever Kronos is I don't know exactly what that is for Tesla but I think from my previous research it's API data actually about the telemetry of the cars and so if I'm able to get into a Dev version of Chronos and they have actual instead of just test data they have actual car data there I mean that's a breach of privacy for Tesla and they will pay out big for that so that's kind of where we'll stop it for today we got all the way to you know Cloud analysis right here and then you know maybe we'll come back and finish out the rest with some more demos obviously Recon reconnaissance can take you into this crazy world and it it could go on for a long time but I just want to tell the hackers out there and the professional red teamers you know like this wins this wins and it makes you money and it gives you a really good idea of what your company is and if you can find these assets and security vulnerabilities on them um we're all better for it because otherwise they would just sit out there at adversaries these are the exact sites that they target. Jason that's fantastic so just for everyone who's watching put in the comments below stuff that you want to see so is there more stuff that you want Jason to cover like give us ideas uh in the comments below Jason has this live training which is two days so Jason the first day is Recon and the second day is actual hacking right? Yeah the second day is uh actual hacking it's the other part of my mind map that's kind of collapsed uh somewhere over here but uh yeah if you're interested in Bug Bounty or red teaming um I have a whole red team component on uh on some of this stuff and then also Bug Bounty and web testing you know that class is probably one of the it's basically a conglomeration of all my work in research it's my master class so I give that class a couple times a year another one's going to come out I think probably in November I'm gonna do another one and it's live two days with me and you get to ask all the questions you want and we build a really good community and then if you're looking for someone who does this for you and wants to do a really tight red team assessment and we will find you know stuff like this check out Boddobot buddobot.com that's my consultancy. And your courses is it online or was it like in person? It is virtual so it's it's live but virtual we do it over Discord. Oh that's great so I mean anyone can attend it from anywhere so that's brilliant maybe we can convince you to you know give us some snippets of the actual hacking in another video but uh just for everyone watching you know give us give us comments about what what you what what you want Jason to cover. Jason I really want to thank you you know for sharing um your knowledge and like you said in sort of the intro you went down a dark road but fortunately turn around and you know walking the the good path now and inspiring other people to do the same so thanks so much for sharing thank you thank you for having me thanks everybody [Music]",

    "transcript": "(light electronic music) - Hey, guys, it's Justine, and today, what is inside this box is something that is so perfect that I think that it was actually made just for me. Like, it should have my name on it, but it doesn't, but what name, or rather a logo, that it has on it is the Razer logo because this is a brand-new, 13-inch Blade Stealth, and it is pink! I think that you can feel my excitement. Like I'm trying to keep sort of calm because sometimes, when I get really excited, you guys say that I'm overreacting, but I'm not. I just get very excited about things that I like and that I'm passionate about. So with that being said, let's open it up! Also, for this unboxing, since everything is beautiful and pink, we've got this. This is one of my favorite unboxing knives, and not only are we gonna be unboxing the laptop, but I've also got a bunch of their pink accessories as well, so that is in a box over here. (box thuds) Just know that this video is probably never gonna end, but first, friends, the laptop. Here, put this away. Oh God, thanks. I am not strong. (knife whooshes) (knife bangs) (knife rattles) This is also one of my favorites. It is so beautiful. (package tape tearing) (cardboard rubbing) Oh, there's a box inside of a box. Surprise! (packaging rustles) We've also got this. (box thuds) Don't need that anymore. (package contents clatter) First things first, we've got our power cable. (cardboard rubbing) This is so freaking exciting! Look at this! So this is the 13-inch, wow! What I love about this is this is definitely something that I could also travel with. Look how beautiful this is! Okay, shh, listen. (plastic crinkles) I think my nails maybe are a little, a little (chuckles) aggressive. It's so light. I'm so shocked. So we've got two USB ports here. (light electronic music) We've got a USB-A, USB-C. We've also got the same but also a headphone jack. What else do we have in here? What's this? Is this a note? Is it a note for me? So they don't actually call this pink. They call it Quartz, which is great, because quartz crystal is probably one of, well, it's one of my favorite crystals. (pages flapping) Look at this! Holographic stickers! You guys are about to see the most aggressive Quartz setup ever. Let's turn this on! It's so beautiful! Like, this thing looks so great! I'm honestly shocked! Like, it looks so good! (Justine inhales sharply) Wow! So this is a part of the Blade Stealth line, and this particular model came out in December, but now, it is out in pink. Well, it's actually called Quartz as that's the official Razer color, but if you ask me, this looks pink to me. I'm gonna plug this in and let it charge up, and now, let's get to some other really fun Quartz unboxings. (box thuds) (grunts) Oh gosh. I've unboxed a few Quartz items previously, (bubble wrap crinkles) but a bunch of these are not necessarily new products, but they are new in the color Quartz. I have dropped something. Oh my gosh, I'm so, (makeup compact clatters) oh, shoot! This makeup powder, I just dropped this, and then I dropped the knife on top of it. This is why I'm not a beauty hero. Oh boy, we've got so many things to unbox here. I'm not really sure what to start with, but let's just think about this logically. I've got my laptop. I'm probably gonna want a mouse, and then, for my mouse, I'm gonna need a mouse pad, so let's start with those things. (packaging rustling) It's so beautiful, so I have a bunch of other pink Razer things that I got previously, but my sister and I split them up because she took half and then I took the other half, so this is great because now, we both can have pink things, and so now, we've got our mouse. Make sure I don't lose added pieces. You can swap out this little guy if you want a shorter little button. So we've got our mouse. We've got our laptop. We're gonna need a mouse pad, obviously. (package thuds) This thing is huge. I haven't, I haven't opened one of these up for quite a while actually, (package rustling) and today is my day. More stickers! Gosh, these are so beautiful! (package rustling) So what's great about this is it has LED lights all around it. I'm also working on redoing my office again, so this is gonna be such a perfect addition. (knife tip rumbles) Oh yes! Okay, this is so incredible! You basically can just have an entire freakin' desk be a mouse pad. This is gonna be great for the setup that I'm currently working on. It's probably gonna be a while until I finish it 'cause realistically, I've been trying to do this for over a year, and here I am, not accomplishing all of the tasks that I would like. Probably a little aggressive for (giggles) my laptop setup here, but never say never says Justin Bieber. This is gonna get interesting because I only have two USB ports on here, but what I do have is on this Base Station for my headphones, this gives me three additional ports, so what that means, my friends, that's gonna be the next thing that I have to open. So what's great is you can also adjust all of these colors inside of the Razer Synapse app, which you would think that I would have internet in my house, but for whatever reason, Spectrum keeps failing me, so I can't even connect to the internet right now. Hi, I'm Justine. I don't even have internet! Like, I'm gonna have to tether to my phone. So we're gonna open this up next so that we'll be able to have additional USB ports. (package rustling) This stand is actually really nice. This would look so good with my new setup. Like, I'm so hyped to show it to you guys, but (giggles) I still have the box stuck to it. So we've got our headphone stand now (giggles). Gotta plug this in over here. Let me sound wild. (laptop chimes) I know there's a lot of cables going on, but there are LED lights here. We've got LED lights at the bottom of the headphone stand. This is the Seiren X. This is one of the many little microphones that they have, and I love this one because I probably will use this when I'm traveling. I have one of their larger ones. It's actually the microphone that I use all the time to record all of my VO. (package rustling) I'm running out of room (giggles). I love that everything matches. I feel like the stereotypical girl right now, but you know what? I'm living a dream that I never thought would be possible when I was a little girl. Like, I wanted pink accessories. Guess what we didn't have? (box thuds) So also inside this box, we've got a USB cable, base stand here for this. Looks like this just screws in here, and that screws in here. This is like freaking Barbie's Dream House. Barbie's Gaming Dream House. I'm loving it. So this is one of the new Kraken headphones, also comes in Quartz. The ear cups have been updated. They also have a little extra padding at the top, so for more comfort, and the new microphone has better noise canceling. Hmm, smells fresh. This smells like a fresh (cords clatter) freaking headset. This is so excessive! I can't even handle it. So I can also plug in my headphones into the microphone as well. So we've only got one more thing left to open, and it's a keyboard. (packaging rustling) Yeah, this looks good. (Justine grunts) I've run out of desk space. Okay, well, here's the keyboard. Yes, Razer has definitely outdone themselves with their Quartz. Okay, over here, setting up, I just heard my headphones pop on. Let me watch a YouTube video. Let me hear a song or something. Let's pop it on YouTube. Let's see, I'll look up Slayer, Angel of Death. This video, that is not even a video, has 18 million views. (\"Angel of Death\" by Slayer) I just keep thinking of high school Justine listening to Slayer and it was the time of my life. (electronic music) I don't regret it. One of the cool things in the Razer Synapse app like I was mentioning before, you're actually able to customize all of the LED colors. So inside Chroma Studio, you have all of these little presets and effects that you can add. You can change colors, all kinds of plugins and add-ons that you can get to work with the LED lights with Razer, with your hue lights. So it's really cool because you can not only control the LED lights on your computer, but you can basically control the lights in your house as well. Let me just shut off one of these lights. I'll shut off the big guy. Does that help? Can you guys see some things? Let's click over here to lighting. Yeah, it looks good. The breathing, ah, it's so good! It's so good! And we can basically just make everything pink. (giggles) Go figure. Pink, okay. We are, so everything is, everything is breathing. Okay, I'll turn the lights back on. Well, thank you guys for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed this unboxing. I'm definitely looking forward to more people getting their hands on these because they are so awesome, and I'm a huge fan of Razer and all of their products, and I'm especially a huge fan of the Quartz line. I know, it might be stereotypical, but I don't care, and neither should you. Again, this is the new Quartz 13-inch Blade Stealth laptop. Huge thank you to Razer for sending me these things to check out. This video isn't sponsored, but they did send me these things, and I'm so excited to set up my new gaming office and my editing bays. I have so much stuff in store for 2019, and I just, I need to get started on it. It's so crazy 'cause January is pretty much already over. We're already hopping into February, but thank you guys for watching, and thanks for coming along for this unboxing. Now I gotta go edit this video and put my knives away. So with that, I'll see you guys in my next video. Bye, oh my gosh! (Justine exhales sharply) So beautiful!",

    "transcript": "What's up guys Lew here Back with another video And today we're taking a look at another mechanical keyboard but a little bit unusual That's because most mechanical keyboards are wired. Now I went on a search. A hunt Looking for something that is wireless. You know me I try to eliminate wires whenever I can. If you've seen pictures of my set up on Instagram. You should go check it out if you haven't. You've seen those pictures then you know I'm trying to eliminate all wires from the visual field but I still want a quality mechanical key switch because those membrane keyboards are not quite as satisfying so I did a little search This is one of the keyboards that I found and what I like about it is not only is it wireless It's also back lit and it's small. It doesn't take up much space on your desk and in my case I don't use the numerical keypad either so maybe this one might be suitable I know that the key switches are not of the highest quality. Their not cherry MX blues or reds or browns Hopefully this one is satisfying enough and after all it's wireless which is very appealing to me. Uses bluetooth technology. Uh here on the back of the box You can see those mechanical key switches I've talked about. It's also a very slim keyboard which is appealing to the eyes. Has multimedia keys, adjustable backlight So let's go ahead. Jump inside the box and see what this Rapoo KX mechanical keyboard is all about Open it on this side here. Oh you may have seen my new multi tool in that shot as well the Leatherman Charge. I'll link it in the description. Get that part off You guys know what that's about. Inside fairly simplistic. We have the quick start guide It's a keyboard. Get with the times. And here it is Very slim for a mechanical keyboard Damn I gotta say. That's it inside the box. Oh the charge cable too. I gotta say That's a pretty good look. You can see it has like this brushed aluminum On the sides. You have touch sensitive multimedia keys up on the top And as I've mentioned before it's backlit. Now the question is How do these key switches feel? Let me go ahead. Woah those are way different. Not sure I'm gonna be able to get used to that. So it's obviousy very compact and because of that the key spacing seems to reflect that-uh-which is a reason it's kind of a strange adjustment They're very tight together They are satisfying though. This keyboard does come in a couple of colors as well This one has the black keys with this aluminum or brushed metallic look. You can also get it with white keys and there's some colorful options as well: There's a red version and I think there's a teal version. Also I think there's a yellow version So if you want to get funky with it On the bottom you have some feet here The receiver lives in the back of the unit I guess that's where you store it. Yeah a little storage area And then you have an ON/OFF switch followed by a micro usb port for charging it Now obviously I'm not the most skilled typer in the world. I'm more of a an editor as most of you know. There's a little plastic on the top here And so what I look for in a keyboard is a little bit different I suppose then somebody whose Typing a lot of words. You know I'm doing a lot of shortcuts and things like that but i'm not typing letters to the president. Atleast not yet As of right now I'm gonna go ahead and say that these keys are placed too tightly together for my meaty paws Alright guys so that wraps up this unboxing and overview of the Rapoo KX wireless mechanical keyboard A rare breed of mechanical keyboard but one of your few options in this space if that's what you're looking for Thanks as always for watching. If you lied this content make sure to leave a thumbs up down below And other than that I'll catch you on the next episode. Later guys.",

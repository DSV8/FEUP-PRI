    "transcript": "- (Justine) Hey guys it's Justine and today I am going to be making a Fortnite Cake, (uptempo music) and this is going to be celebrating Season 3 because Season 4 is upon us or it's actually already out depending upon when you're watching this. This is going to be my Season 3 cake. I am really excited because I just started playing this game, and it was one of those games that I really avoided playing because I knew that it was something that would take up all of my free time. So if you guys were wondering \"Justine why haven't you been posting YouTube videos\", it's because I've been playing Fortnite. Why don't I stream Fortnite--because I like to just sit in my pajamas, with Doritos on my belly and be left alone! And I like to play my game and not have to talk to anybody except my teammates, sometimes unless I'm playing solo, then I'm just... dying a lot... Anyway I'm excited about the cake but I'm also giving myself a time constraint, so basically while I'm building the cake, the storm is incoming, so if I don't finish by the time the storm gets to me, I'm not really sure what's gonna happen. This is the first one I'm making so, stay tuned, because your guess is as good as mine. Currently while I'm shooting this, I don't have any information on Season 4 so depending upon when you guys are watching you probably already know everything about it. This is me, this is me in Loot Lake (laughs) swimming. Okay shut up Justine. (quick beep noise) Okay let's make this freaking cake. If you guys are new here, (Fornite Bus Sound) I am absolutely a terrible baker. Every once in a while, probably like 4 in 55 things that I've made-- what's that percentage?--Doesn't matter, (Fortnite Storm Alarm) Okay the storm is incoming, starting...now! (mumbles \"cake\") These are our little meteors because of the end of Season 3 the meteors were coming to destroy everything. This is just as stressful as the game when I'm going, running around, trying to loot. (Chest Opening Sound) We're going to do our meteors first I probably should make them a color but I'm not going to because I don't have time, I don't have time for that. Meteor #1, when I'm baking, all I want to do is listen to music but I can't because I'm shooting, and you guys can hear the audio, but like maybe they'll just hear like one Post Malone real quick. - (Amazon Alexa) Here's the newest album by Post Malone: Beer Bongs & Bentley's You know I never meant to let you down, let you down Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything You know I say that I am better now, better now - (Justine) I almost used an entire container on these meteors, this is gonna be a problem. (Storm Alert Sound) Oh gosh no! The storm's coming! Okay so these are all the weapons that I have looted. We got to get moving. (Plop) I have to make green icing. I have to make green icing, because if I don't, how am I going to have the grass? (tearing sounds) This is, super creamy. Oh cause it's cream cheese. (Justine chuckles) That would make sense! Time to make this green. (Storm Alert) Gosh...oh boy it's happening. I haven't even freaking started icing. Geez I should've done this ahead of time. Let's go, let's go, let's go, we gotta get this grass. Oh this is looking good! - (Offscreen Man) Storm's coming! (Storm Alert) - (Justine) I'm trying! (thump) (Justine laughing in shock) What are you doing! - (Brown Haired Girl) You said there were meteors... - (Hysterical Justine) it's stuck to the fridge. Alright, well, that's a thing that happened. (plop) I don't even know why I need this cake, but we're putting it on. Oh come on Jenna! No! Don't you...no! What! This is never gonna come off of my fridge. (Jenna inaudibly responds) Okay icing in, the freaking storm is coming. Uh, well, we've got 2 meteors. I haven't even built a Fort yet. I haven't built anything. (mumbles) Storm, storm, storm... How's this look? This looks like a nice little... Mountainous range. (Justine squeals) I'm hurrying! Oh man, let's go, let's go, let's go! If there's one thing that I spend way too much time doing it's icing cakes when it doesn't really matter, especially when we are supposed to be looting and looking for weapons, and here I am, icing a freaking cake. I'm actually, probably, the last person that you would ever want to be anywhere near your kitchen. Running out of time guys...running out of time! Oh no! (plop) If meteors were actually cupcakes (Justine laughing) this would be the best thing ever. Like I'm shooting this and there's not even a real storm coming but I'm freaking out. Let's go, build, time to build. This is super unsteady, just like my emotions. Oh gosh, we need steps, we need some stairs right here. Oh man we are running out of time and I feel like I haven't accomplished anything. I wanted to put Loot Lake in. Do we have any blue? Yes, Yes I do! Loot Lake baby! This looks like blue turds... This is disgusting. (plop) (Justine gasps) You threw that..so freaking fast. I'm just trying to make Loot Lake. Uh is this expired because it smells like rotten. I gotta move all my items in (Storm Alert) cause anything that's outside the circle... We're in trouble. Oh no guys we're so--oh wow, oh no. The meteors, guys meteors are.. (inaudible shrieking) I'm not done building! I'm trying so... Leave my Fort alone! I will protect this Fort until I... I'm trying so hard to catch it. If you think I'm gonna stop building... I'm not gonna stop building. I'm not gonna stop building. I think we're all out of meteors so guess what, looks like I win. So I don't really know what else to do in this video except claim this as a victory. Let me know if you guys would like me to make a Season 4 Cake, I'll try to make it before the season is actually over. I'm looking forward to playing it and as I said before at this current point of filming this video, I don't know anything about Season 4 yet because it has not been announced, it's not out yet. Most likely when you're watching this it's already been announced, it's already out, and we're probably all playing it. I will see you guys there, and if you see me hanging out in my little Fort, come say Hi. I'll see you guys later. (pretzels falling) I just cut down..so many trees for this. - (Off-Screen Man) Wanna cut? _ (Justine) There's cake everywhere. - (Man) I know. - (Justine) What do we do now? - (Man) um...batting practice? (Justine groans)",

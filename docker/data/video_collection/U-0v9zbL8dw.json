    "transcript": "Be careful accepting cables from strangers to charge your phone. This looks just like a standard USB charging cable if you like. I could plug this into a power bank and then charge the phone I don't even need to do that I'm simply going to plug it in and show you what's possible because this is not a standard USB cable this is an O.MG cable this cable allows me to manipulate the phone USB debugging hasn't been enabled on this phone I haven't enabled developer options or anything else it's a standard Samsung phone what I've done on this iPhone is connect to an access point in the cable and then I can open up a web browser and browse to a website running within the cable and then I can load a script in this example I'll load a script from slot 5. I'm not going to touch the phone but notice what happens when I run the script so notice that that photo was taken because I sent commands from my iPhone to the O.MG cable that send commands to the phone.",

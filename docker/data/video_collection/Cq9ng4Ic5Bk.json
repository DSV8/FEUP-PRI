    "transcript": "What's up guys Back here, back with another video And today, I've got something special That's why I'm in this special location in fact This is not the studio environment you're used to instead I'm in the south of France on a beautiful day and this is my very first, possibly the worlds first 360 unboxing video What does that mean ? It means pick up your phone Get on the official YouTube app And look around Move around and explore the environment There's a lot to look at But, as I said, it's an unboxing video So we're gonna be checking out This HP Workstation Laptop The reason why is because Since there's this emphasys on 360, you've heard about 360 You've experienced 360 You know, a lot of people are aprehensive about how do they get envolved How do they get started with 360, because One of the fears is, there's going to be this Crazy kinda workflow, to get from A to B on 360 And it is a very resourse intensive task when it comes to stitching video together Which is something anybody who shot 360, is probably familiar with You need a lot of horse power To Make that process something you're going to do That is what, This workstation laptop aims to do So this guy here is called the Z-Book Its configurable in a number of different ways This one i got Actually has a Intel Xeon processor mobile processor Now... If you aren't familiar with Xeon, the Xeon brand its because It has been used in workstations mostly, suppose to consumer products So when we're talking about workstation grade getting that into something which is mobile Is really compelling It doesn't stop there tho Its not just... Its not just workstation processors but also graphics too, And look at this guy! That is slim Its actually only about, 4.4pound, with a 15.6 inch 4k UHD display Check that out Lots of ports on it too, but after all its a workstation so you got USB3.0 full size HDMI Now this is very cool, these are 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, Thunderbolt 3 capable for insane transfer speed If you are like me, and you're on the video production side You know how import, having fast access to external storage is This is going to let you... have.. Highres video files, possible 360 video files on external storage, and still get that quick access to it Internally.. the storage on this is something i have not seen stocked eather Its PCI-e SSD.... But up to 2 in a RAID configuration inside of a single laptop, that's pretty amazing And we all know PCI-e is as fast as it gets for mobile storage So cracking it open.. Lets check out the inside here You see the keyboard there As well as a very large trackpad The screen, the display as i mentioned before 4k UHD, you can see it has this matt finish on it That is something.. people on the workstations side tend to look for Ofcourse less glare, its also IPS meaning that the viewing angle should be better And there should be less color shift, associated with other display technolgies Pretty slink actually We also got dedicated buttons, for Wifi, Sound. on this side of the laptop there is a full size RJ45 ethernet As well as a couple more USB3.0 and than lastly a SD card slot So a fully featured... workstation... laptop With some specs that we are used to see in desktop style designs Xeon is in here as i mentioned before It got a 4Gb... Up to 4Gb.. graphic options, in the quadro line-up, quadro series from Nvidia Again this is stuff you are not used seeing in a laptop That exists in this series right here, so thats pretty damn exciting Anyway! There you have it 360 video... The new front tier 360 unboxing videos I hope you had a good look around this envoirment, it's really amazing This is hopefully a little bit closer than, standard flat video could get you to feels like stand here And unbox! in the south of France Ha ha Thanks for watching guys Take a look back, watch it again And see if you can find something else going on, that you didn't see the first time Because once you play back these 360 videos, you always find something new...... to look at Alright! That raps it up, i'm gone go stich this video together. This one right here The one you're watching... On this workstation Thats the workflow i'm talking about Later guys",

    "transcript": "- Today, we're in Long Beach and we are heading on a boat and heading out to Catalina. I'm so excited, because we're here with the Sony Alpha crew, and we're all testing out the brand new A6400. The camera actually comes out in February, if you guys want to see my review that I did of it previously, I'll put a link in the description. Here's Jenna. - Hello! - Hello. What's up? Today I'm shooting in 24 frames a second. I don't know how I feel about it. This is a test for me. It's a big day. So come along for the adventure. I have no idea what's going to happen today, but there's a bunch of other YouTubers here. I feel like I fell into some weird alternate reality where everyone's vlogging and filming themselves except I just realized, it's a reality!(giggles) Everybody is vlogging and filming themselves. (suspenseful music) - [Justine] What are you doing? - You know me. You know me. - [Justine] What? - One is never enough, okay? - [Justine] It is true! - Yeah. - So I look like I'm dressed for the winter. I've got a scarf, another jacket, another winter jacket, plus I have a hat in here. It's gonna be cold on that island. I don't think anybody else is prepared for this, but I'm prepared for winter. Let's get on the boat! (suspenseful music) Step one, we made it to the island. Step two, get the golf cart. - [Background Person] Alright. You Welcome Look at this dog playing basketball! (soulful trance music) Justine here, I'll be your driver for today. Please rate me five stars. Or four. No less than three. I forgot what he told me. He just gave me instructions, and I don't remember what he said. - [Instructor Lady] And then reminder guys, if you're zip-line or aerial, you're gonna go out, around the plaza and then you'll kind of curve around, come back, follow the line, follow the water line, and you'll be fine - Hey look, it's Sam. - [Jenna] Where you going? - We're in the lead somehow - [Jenna] Where are we going? - We're leading this whole charge. - I think I'm gonna go to a cafe and get a coffee. - [Jen] Is there cup-holders? - Yes! We have four cup-holders. We get four drinks (upbeat pop music) - Egg and cheese. All squished - [Justine] Whoa! What you get me? Look at that frittata! - That looks lovely - [Justine] Wow - breakfast all day. - The sun is setting, very very soon. But, Jenna called, and I was watching her stuff and she said they have breakfast all day. And also - We gotta get it. Gotta get it - gotta get it. (upbeat pop music) - I just did a quick little interval shot up here. It's probably one of my favorite features on the A6400. Fruke is back there, iphonedo! - Hello! - [Justine] Hello! - How's it going? - [Justine] let me zoom in on you. Do do do - Mildly fast, mildly furious. - (giggles) These are so slow. Golf carts are regulated with speed. It's quite tragic. - This is slow! - [Jenna] Hit the break, see if it goes faster! - I did. It doesn't. - [Jen] Oh. - Why're you here? - [Justine] I don't know! Oh, hi! Oh God, I'm gonna wreck! (laughter) Can you hold this? (engine roars) whoa! This is not like a Rapture. (upbeat music) - [Jenna] So we've been driving around the island and we gonna go watch the sunset. (upbeat music) - So, while Jen and I were out on our go-kart excursion, I thought about you! - Why? - I said Greg's in shorts. (giggles) I was like, I wonder if he's brr, chilly. - Not only shorts, but look at these shorts. Short shorts - super short! Hold on wait, we got a get a good look. Super short. - I'm really cold. (laughter) - I'm really cold still. - His Brr, chilly. (giggles) - [Justine] Did everybody have fun today? - Had a blast! - [Justine] Yeah! - Was magical - today was incredible. - So what's everyone's favorite thing about the A6400? Let's not all talk at once. - Is it nerdy? Does it say color signs? - I really love the way the colors look on this camera. It's much better than the A6300, which is the camera that I'm used to. So having really good skin tones, is a huge upgrade. - [Justine] Did you use the 6500 at all? - Not today. But is the 6500 better than the 6300? Color slides? - [Justine] I never had the 6300, so I don't know (giggling) I'm not sure! - [Justine] Cheers! - cheers! - [Justine] Oh, that Autofocus, look at that, wow. - Oh yeah. The tracking is insane on it. - [Justine] It's tracking your face now, so it didn't. - Does my hair look good? - [Justine] Um. - flawless. - Hi Sam. How are you? - I'm 12. What is this? - Wait what? - That's an internet meme - I'm 12 what is this. I don't get it, I'm so not cool at all. - You've never seen that meme that's like, I'm 12 and what is this. Oh, Justine! - No! - Well that's my vlog from Catalina (giggling). These guys are making fun of me. I hope you guys enjoyed the video. I'm not even sure what I filmed. We did a lot of things very, very quickly. But I had fun. I wanna come back here and do that aerial thing that you can like climb the trees. Did anybody do the aerial stuff? Did anybody here? No? Aerial? Nope? Okay, bye friends! (upbeat music)",

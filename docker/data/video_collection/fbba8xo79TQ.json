    "transcript": "- (both speaking together) Couple fortnights, couple fortnights! couple fortnights! - Hello and welcome to This Is. A couple fortnights ago we did a little tear list about the worst, the weirdest, the wackiest handhelds. And some of you were not happy with that tear list. You said, \"You forgot this and that and this!\" We didn't include those ones because they were not commercial successes like the rest of them. So we have the rest of the handhelds that you told us we forgot here. - So, today we're gonna be taking a look at some of the weirdest handhelds of all time. Let's see what we got. I'm excited. - [Matt] All right, The Tiger Electronics Game.Com. - [Man With Glasses] I remember the Game.Com. Do you remember the Game.Com? - I remember the Game.Com, which was released in 1997 and discontinued three years later because during that time it sold less than 300,000 units. - I'm going to Game.Com. - So this is the first game console to feature a touchscreen and it had not one, but two game cartridge slots. It could connect to the internet via an internet cartridge. So, I guess it really only had one cartridge slot when you actually play a game. - That's cool. - So when you got a high score of six in Tetris, you could tell them. - Six! I'm surprised that Tiger Electronics gave up Game.Com. - Yeah. - Hopefully they acquired the bag for that. - [Man With Glasses] The Watara Supervision. This was released in 1992 for the low, low price of $49.95. The top part looks exactly like a Game Boy. High quality stereo sound, green display. I mean that looks like they straight took a Game Boy display off. But instead, some horrible mishap happened to the bottom. Just look at that D pad and if you stare at it for long enough, you can hear what that sounds like. - I feel like if you just rub your hand over a sponge, you'll get the same effect of that D pad. - Here's a pitch for you Matt. - All right, pitch me. - The Game Boy is incredibly popular. The kids love it. So, what if we make a shittier version of it that has all the worst parts, including the terrible green display, but we make it even worse. With fewer games that are essentially all shovel wear, a D pad, which would make your mother cry, and we call it The Supervision. - No. So, the reason this is so cool is for one reason, one reason only, okay? The nineties kids are gonna know it. This was the grand prize on Legend of the Hidden Temple. - Wow, that sounds like a punishment not a reward. - I wanted this so bad because of it. - [Matt] The Cybiko. I do remember this one. - Time out. What in the M.C. Escher is this? The more I look at it, the worse it gets. Even the keyboard slides itself up. You got your buttons to go \"whoop.\" - This was released in 2000 for exclusively cool teens. - [Man With Glasses] Oh, good Lord. - [Matt] This thing had two-way radio, so you could get at me at any time. It had text messaging back and forth to each other. Texting when you were in high school, that was kind of hard. But for us Kyle's, we had a way to talk to baes. You had four hundred and thirty official games and apps. That's way more than iPhone ever had. It had MP3 cartridge, which I don't even remember what that means, but also had a dating app. I was swiping left and right on biddies. Left and right, man. - Kyle, was this before or after you hit the vape juice a little too hard? - I mean, if this had a vape built into it... Perfect device. - I get that it seems kind of cool. The industrial design of this makes me uncomfortable. - It also came in blue. - [Man With Glasses] The Gizmondo, which is, blue is just a state of mind. This was a 2005 handheld. This is quite possibly one of the worst selling handholds in history because it's ready for Felipe (indecipherable) - [Man With Glasses] Who has his little tiny baby hands as he uses the Gizmondo. Gizmondo sold this device for 400 United States Freedom units, or $2.99 with the Smart Ads. Yeah, do you want some 2005 Smart Ads all up in your Tony Hawk? - [Matt] Well, because Gizmondo probably would've done it if they extra ever shipped it. - So the executives lavishly spent, I'm sure, their well earned venture capital funds on lavish parties, going to the 24 Hour Le Mans... - Tons of promise features that never materialize. It was pretty much only available exclusively in... - In malls! - In US mall kiosks. - Yeah, yeah. - [Matt] Everyone knows where you get your best video game systems were mall kiosks. - Apparently, you could like, there were a few of these that sold, but the director of Gizmondo Europe was quite literally in the Swedish Mafia. So, this company surprise, surprise, went bankrupt. - [Man With Glasses] And just a couple weeks afterward he crashed his Ferrari doing 182 miles an hour. - And the smash hit included my favorite summer game. Sticky Balls. - [Man With Glasses] (laughs) - [Matt] Select a Game by Entex. - [Man With Glasses] Oh, I know what this is. - The console is literally called Select a Game. - You can select a game. - [Matt] Remember when we built the Switch book? - [Man With Glasses] Yeah. - [Matt] Which could have two players back to back playing. - The selected game had that ability way back in 1981. - This is actually where we got the idea for the Switch book. - That's probably it. - [Man With Glasses] This had a screen that was very similar to like a digital clock. So, it's like a VFD display. Obviously, it was only like red and blue and it looked quite bad, but it came with Space Invader 2. There were five other games, like Pac-Man. - It actually is kind of all right for the time. - [Man With Glasses] You had some high quality games available, like Baseball 4. - 1981 was a time where handheld gaming wasn't so much of a thing. So like the fact that you have like replaceable cartridges, and different games and stuff. But you can see how this led to Game Boys and all the actual good consoles that came like a decade later. - [Matt] Mega Duck. - [Man With Glasses] What the Duck is this? - Released in 1993, known as the Cougar Boy. (cougar growls) - Clearly, this is designed to trick unsuspecting children into telling their parents, \"I want the Mega Duck! The Game Boy, that's lame.\" - [Man With Glasses] Snake Roy. And it's our dude on our snake. What? - [Matt] I'm more concerned with Worm Visitor. This worm also has a bunch of legs. - {Man with Glasses] Oh no. - I feel like the only reason this failed was they ran out of animals. - [Both Speakers] Snake Roy. - Worm Visitor, Mega Duck. - Oh, it's almost as bad as Frisky Fever. (whisper laughs) - So, this is the one that most people got mad about that we didn't include. - [Man With Glasses] The Wonder Swan! - Yeah. - You didn't include the Wonder Swan? - Well, we had the Mega Duck. A lot would argue that the Superior Waterfowl named handheld was the Bandai Wonder Swan. - The Wonder Swan! - {Man With Glasses] So this was from Bandai, who obviously make a wide variety of games, but they're trying to get into the console space. - There's a real argument to be had, this was the proper successor to the Game Boy. Because the architect of the original Game Boy, He actually went on to create this, and you could argue that it was a little bit more of a forward facing device. 16 bits! Ain't more than the Game Boy. - So, they sold a lot of units. The problem is it just was in only one market and so, like it didn't really have this mass appeal. - The thing is why it was really cool, Nintendo, I mean, let's not forget. Nintendo basically spent almost the entire nineties sitting on the original Game Boy. Like, it was so long before they finally updated it. And even when the Game Boy Color came out it was a fairly minor update. But by the time the Wonder Swan was really starting to pick up Steam, the Game Boy Advance came out, and as soon as that happened, it was a wrap. - None of that matters though, because there's one thing that made the Wonder Swan better than them all. - [Matt] It was featured in Common Rider X eight. (theme music plays) - Cool, wow. - All right. - I've learned so much that I didn't need to know Moving on, The Digi Blast! - [Matt] What I did in every- - The Digiblast! - [Matt] Friday night in high school. - The Digiblast! - Oh, my God. - The Digiblast! - [Matt] So, this was released in 2005 and it was aimed at younger kids. It was designed to compete with the Game Boy Advance. - So I actually remember this. I never had one, but I remember seeing it in stores. I always thought it looked more like a cassette player or something. It looked a little weird to me. - Like, it had really cool features on the box. It had like a cartridge you could do that was an MP3 player. But, like the problem is these were like cheaply made. The people who had these definitely got them from like an aunt or a grandma. - Yeah, you're not cool enough to get a Game Boy. - Yeah. - So you get a Digiblast. - They only sold a hundred thousand units. - No, no, no. It wasn't even that simple. They sold a hundred thousand units because they launched 2005, no one bought that they went on clearance, so they relaunched it in holiday of 2006, and that still didn't really help them that much. It's almost like the Digiblast was relegated to the Digi-past. - [Matt] The Atari Lynx. - [Man With Glasses] Okay, objection! The Atari links was not weird. It was wonderful and it was great. And I will fight anyone who wants to disagree with me. - So, I do have to make an apology. For our last video, we had wrongly said that the Game Gear was the first color handheld. - The Lynx did come out first. - Yes, I'm sorry we got our dates confused because of Japan and America being on different calendars. - Years. - We have different moons, What do you want me to do? Like am I supposed to keep track of both moons? If I'm looking at the moon and you're looking at the moon we clearly can't be looking at the same moon. That would be impossible. - That's no Moon, it's Japan. - So, this was a early handheld device launched around the same time as the Game Boy, and it had a 16 bit processor. It was about $200, which in today's money is closer to 400 bucks. So very expensive. But it was a big chung-y! - Yeah. - Okay, It was a little hung-y and it needed a nap after every few hours, where you need to replace the double As. - Same. It was so expensive and so unreal. It like really didn't catch on the same way that the Game Boy did. - Well, it's one of those things where like a lot of these early sort of portable devices, not even just handhelds, think like old laptops and stuff. Shrinking this technology, which was meant to be, you know, big on a desk and power consumption wasn't an issue. It was really like these companies had to go take stuff that was semi off the shelf, cram it in something, load a bunch of double A batteries up, and hoped it would work. - I feel like the biggest like problem with these is that like the power consumption was an afterthought. It was good. It just never had the mass appeal. - If it was just more massive, it would've done great. - [Matt] The Turbo Express. A. K. A. the Game Tank. - Hey man, you got any games on your walkie-talkie? - No! - [Man With Glasses] This was a portable version of the Turbo Graphic 16 / the PC engine, and it was chunky. - So, copy and paste everything I just said about the Lynx with the Turbo Express. Because this was actually larger. - 80 bit processor, 16 bit GPU. Yeah, my friends GPU! Look it up! - Stands for Great, Power, Underneath? Throwing the Nintendo Switch in the garbage. This bad boy could be hooked up to your TV. - [Matt] It could be hooked up to your TV. You could also get a TV tuner for it. - Yeah! - You could take and watch TV on your Turbo Graphics Turbo Express Tank-y Boy? - Yes. - You trying to tell me that there's a mobile device that allows you to watch television in the palm of your hands? - I've said this before. All right. The reason these failed is because no one wants to watch TV portably at all. - If you're watching this video in anything other than an amphitheater, you're a dirty pirate and you should ashamed. - [Matt] Next up we have the Tiger R-Zone X P G for extreme pocket game. - There are a lot of problems with this, mostly the fact that it's called the X P G. Can I just draw your attention to the buttons? It is C, D, A, B. Excuse me? - I applaud Tiger because they love to try and make something different, but man, do they never succeed. - We know it though. I'm glad that after the R- Zone XPG took the world by storm, they had the Game.Com to back up, to fall back on. It was literally hit after hit over at Tiger Electronics. Are they still in business? I don't think they're still in business anymore, are they? - Tiger Electronics was just like so much worse with shovel wear than like Nintendo or Atari ever were. - They just weren't games, these were games! G, uppercase A, lowercase M, uppercase E, lowercase S. - It'd be like G, A, I, M, Y, E, S. - No, but no, hang on Matt. We gotta give it some props here. You know what the most extreme pocket game that I've ever tried is? - What's that? - Frantically pressing the subscribe button and then ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button on the This Is channel to make sure that I'm always notified. As soon as your buddies Austin, Matt, Kenzie and Aaron all have some high quality entertainment to directly feed into your eyeballs. Thankfully though, you don't have to watch this video on an X P G. The amphitheater will do just fine. - Like, follow, subscribe and let us know what weird handhelds we forgot for the next one.",

    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   This video features a knockoff of the iPhone 6s. It's actually quite similar in appearance and could probably sneak past the untrained eye. The software is an iOS lookalike skin on top of Android. This video identifies some of the key differences between a legit Apple iPhone 6s and a fake Apple iPhone 6s. Remember, if your App Store icon opens the Google Play store and you're using an iPhone, you're not using an iPhone.

    "transcript": "So, I received this box it looks like an iPhone, you take a glace around here, iPhone 6s, the back looks the same I mean it looks like an iPhone, But it ain't an iPhone This my friends is a high quality, high caliber chinese iPhone knock off Lets go ahead and find out what the differences are! Maybe there are none, Maybe they all fool me, completely Maybe we should all be using it now, I highly doubt it So, the first thing, being a guy who has unboxed a number of iPhones The first thing that'll tip you off that you got a fake is this little bag here This tray, they've something similar to that. Lets look at the-- Oooh! The device actually, Wow that's a pretty good fake Here's a real one, and here's a fake one Whoaa Okay, the other thing I noticed is where the front facing camera is It's a little bit more pronounced on the knock off, and also, oh the writing here There's few more FCC, Do not dispose type logos there But otherwise, MAN, Okay, You can-- that's another spot. So on the real iPhone You have got this type of cut out on this one, you have a line almost drawn into the aluminium Also, is it a little bit lighter? That area there is pretty much identical And this area here is pretty much... That is- That's amazing There's a ridge here You can kinda feel it with your finger That doesn't exist, it's much more smooth on the real deal I don't know man To... to the untrained individual, that baby might pass! Wow! Chinese writing there, a bit of a giveaway Lightning cable--TWO! A European plug and then some ear pods. Oh my- A little bit slower The display is a bit of a giveaway as well much more dim but look at this now this thing is obviously running some kind of android right but, it's skinned with this iOS look-alike. There's the settings menu, the font is a little bit off when I use the ringer on this one, that's what it looks like. On this one, slightly different. Something tells me the camera image quality is not going to be as good okay there's one off the fake iPhone, real iPhone. Yeah, that's another giveaway; image quality on the camera I mean what happens if you go to the iTunes Store here? *Laughing* The iTunes Store takes you to Spotify! Ok that's a bit of another giveaway, but let's be honest man if someone's trying to swindle somebody on Craigslist or something and they don't go in and check everything-- What about FaceTime? Does that bring me to Skype or something? Oh, just the dialer. There's a little vibration as well that's prominent on the fake unit ok let's do a little video/speaker test here. Okay *Laughing* Knockoff sounds like a knockoff It's true, it's true regular iphone selfie time versus definitely not of the same caliber here are my rules, real vs. fake- The screen should be bright and vibrant, this one's a little bit washed out. Check the camera; the quality should be obvious Check the app store, the fake one will take you to Google Play and of course the iTunes Store, which takes you to Spotify. Don't be fooled by that either but otherwise, they might have you fooled. Don't send your grandma to buy an iPhone off of Craigslist. She might come back with a fake one.",

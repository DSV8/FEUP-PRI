    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, it's Justine, and this is my sister Jenna. - Hello. - Actual real legit sister. Sometimes they think that we're sorority sisters. - No! We're too old for that. - No, no, no, no. (thuds) - She is. (Justine gasps) - Speaking of being too old for things, I recently did a video where I was cutting soap, and some of you guys loved it, some of you hated it, some of you were confused. I also was confused in the entire making of the video, but I thought I would bring my sister along for the fun, because-- - So I could be confused as well? - Yes, well we're gonna be cutting soap today. You saw my last video didn't you? You don't watch my videos, that's totally fine, I'm not even upset about it. - I was in the same room when she was filming it. I feel like I don't have to watch it. - So previously, I used some fairly large knives, but I thought let's up it a little bit. Let's get a bigger knife and add another person. (crackling) This here is my machete. - What! (laughs) No, no, I gotta go. I've got an appointment. - (laughs) Where's your appointment? Tell me, show me, it's not on your iCal. Let's cut soap. (whacks) Okay. (Jenna gasps) So, to be honest with you guys, what I learned in my first video, is cutting soap with a smaller knife, is actually a lot easier, but I thought we should probably test this out. The thing about this is it's really good, for hacking down weeds and things like that outside. You have to be really swinging. This is not something that is good, for what I'm gonna be doing. (laughs) - So, why am I here, because there's no space, for me up there? (both laugh) - Oh, hello. - I don't like it. - Okay, well, then let's start small. Let's cut just maybe something tiny just to give you, a taste of what we're gonna do. - Okay, but you're pointing the blade where my body goes. Yeah, set it down. I have a question why does this soap have... - That's an Easter bunny. - What do you do with this soap? Is it like a bath bomb or do you like rub your body on it? This one matches me. - It's giving me a headache. - But no, seriously, what do I do with this fancy soap? - I think, I don't know. - Is this a bomb? - The girl was very confused, as to why I was buying so much soap. (laughs) - [Jenna] This looks like a cookie, I feel like I should be eating it. - You shouldn't. 'Cause, here, I'm gonna give you the little knife, because it's actually a lot more fun, to cut with a smaller one. - [Jenna] And what should I do, should I... - Do whatever you want. This is your soap cut. Oh gosh. This looks like an Oreo cookie. - So does this. - [Justine] So you should probably, no, so maybe start on this side. So, see this, 'cause you just kinda... See, look, you wanna do like nice little slices like this. - [Jenna] Sure, (upbeat music) sure. - [Justine] Aw, they're gonna hate mine. That's a nice cut, and then just scoot it out of the way so they can really see, and you wanna cut real thin slices, like ooh. - Sure. - [Justine] Did you see that cut? - [Jenna] Sure. So it's the wrong hand. (laughs) - I'm ambidextrous, so I can switch. Here let's switch. - I'm making a mess. - Here. See, look, yeah. (thuds) - [Jenna] Wow, see they're just much nicer to cut. (thuds) - [Justine] This is beautiful. So what do you guys think of dual soap cutting? (thuds) - I wonder what slow-mo finger slice is gonna look like. - [Justine] I hope we don't find out. - [Jenna] Are these gonna be in slow-mo? - Oh yeah. - [Jenna] So, Jenna, what do you do for a living? Well, I was thinking the same thing, when I did the first video. I thought about what led me to the point, in my life where I'm cutting soap on YouTube? - I've got two science degrees. - I do the same. (mumbles) filming you cutting soap. - Jenna and her science degree, Nick shooting feature films and documentaries, but today, my friends, we are taking all of that knowledge, and we are throwing it out the window. (Jenna laughs) - Throw it out the window! - Throw it out the window! Do what you want, cut soap! So now I think we need to test out the machete. We're gonna give it a big cut with this one. (thuds) I'll do it. - Well I, I've gotta... - You should probably back up. - I've gotta go. - To be honest with you. - Where should I go? Think I'm safe back here? - Probably. Depends how... (laughs) - Well, oh, wait. I'm in the worst spot. - I didn't hit it in the middle. (whacks) (scrapes) Now is the point where you think, \"Oh, what led me to this point in my life?\" (clangs) Does it look good, do you think? What the heck is in here? - I don't know, but you just dropped something. I'm gonna get down, so please don't swing your chet. - Oh, God, this stinks. This is disgusting. I hate everything about this smell. - [Jenna] What's this? - Oh, here, you cut that half. Just a little chalky. (thuds) It's very, very vibrant. Nothing this color should be touching your skin, unless it's a freaking carrot. (thuds) So next up, what do we have? - [Jenna] Let's just jab it. Just straight up - Wait! - give it a jab. (thuds) - Oh, I thought you were gonna winding up. Yeah, that's nice. (thuds) Oh... (thuds) Okay, this looks good. - Oh, this is a nice cranberry smell. - This is like a muffin! Oh, look at the cut. - This smells good. I'll give you $10 to eat it. - [Justine] $10? - [Jenna] Just take a bite. - That would-- - But then I'll have to take you to the emergency room. - [Justine] That wouldn't even pay for how much the soap cost me. (thuds) - [Jenna] That's your own fault. (thuds) (scrapes) - Oh, I'll do it that way, too. (thuds) - [Jenna] Oh, I don't know, I'm just goin' to town. - [Justine] You never go to town! (thuds) - (mumbles) go to town on the soap! (thuds) (scrapes) Just still don't understand. (thuds) - [Justine] There's nothing, sometimes, Jenna, you just need to accept the fact that we're cutting soap and this is the life that we're living right now. - This looks like an onion. I've never cut an onion, but onions are gross. - I'd say that looks like a beet. Okay, I think that's enough. Oh, look at this one. This looks like... Like a gallbladder? - [Jenna] Let's cut it. (mumbles) - [Justine] You're not even on the screen. - Well, you're shoving me off! (scrapes) All that hard work to not be noticed. (thuds) (Justine laughs) This one feels like makeup. Is this makeup? - [Justine] Oh, it might be, I don't know. Hmm. - [Jenna] Is this a bronzer? - Ooh, look how nice. This is my palette. This is the... Oh, wow. How do we get that off of our bodies? So, guys, that was Cutting Soap Part Two, Machete and Jenna Style. The machete does not work very well. I don't recommend it if you plan on doing this. It's also potentially dangerous, but I think-- - Well, what about this bunny? (Justine gasps) - [Justine] Let's give it, I'll dig in there. Let's dig in there. Oh, it's a little pompom. Oh, my, look at that. (thuds) (slams) This is the last soap we have. (thuds) Jenna, what did you think about the soap experience? - It was fun. (thuds) - Oh, this smells good! Ooh, it's like a lemon. - Yeah, this one smells like, oh it smells like PEZ. - Mmm, oh my gosh. - Oh, my God, lemon PEZ! Should we start a new thing (Justine gasps) where we cut PEZ? - Yeah! (thuds) - Why not? - [Justine] This looks beautiful. - [Jenna] Yeah, it was fun. (thuds) - [Justine] Would you do it again? - Well, why wouldn't I as long as you're buyin'? - Alright. - Boop. - Ugh. Well, guys, that was Cutting Soap Part Two here on my channel. Thank you, Jenna, for cutting soap with me. - Thank you for having me. (both laugh) - I'm sure you're so ecstatic. What did you think of this experience? - It was fun. - Did you enjoy it, or... - I definitely enjoyed the little slices, was very nice and smooth. Some of the smells weren't that great, but... - Yeah, I feel a little nauseous, to be honest with you. - I definitely have a headache. - Yeah.

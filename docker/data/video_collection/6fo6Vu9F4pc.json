    "transcript": "When it comes to tv technology, a lot can be confusing this goes for for really any screen technology actually lcd plasma amoled oled they're all designed and tweaked differently in search of the most uncompromising picture and today a relatively new technology has made its way to the forefront in lg's nanocell tv lineup we've partnered with lg in this video to discuss its technical differences and advantages over traditional lcds since people seeing nanocell for the first time probably won't exactly know what it is or how it works i don't blame them so let's start with the basics nanoset technology is reliant on lcd technology in which liquid crystals alter incoming light from backlights behind them nowadays most of these backlights are led based though other light sources have been used in the past you'll typically find rgb color filters on top of them along with polarizers to filter certain wavelengths as they emit outward from below now at this point liquid crystals and ips panels controlled by electrodes essentially expand and contract to varying lengths allowing certain amounts of red green and blue from below to pass through the result is a specific color and brightness value for a single pixel in a huge array of them creating the dynamic moving images we see in most displays today now where things really get interesting is in the nanocell department see lg's pretty much pushed lcd technology about as far as it can go in its basic form you get excellent color reproduction in these panels and incredible viewing angles but limitations in liquid crystal response and shape prevent it from exhibiting deep blacks and minimal ghosting things where all lead panels excel so lg added an extra filter comprised of you guessed it nano cells tasked with filtering out unwanted wavelengths of light this is a in a way improving upon the already great colors that you find in panels like these now you might be asking well greg don't lcds already kind of sort of filter light i mean isn't that what polarizers are for well yeah i mean you can think of nano cells like an additional polarizer to the conventional ones you would find in any lcd the particles in nanocell film are roughly one nanometer in diameter hence the name and as a result are able to absorb specific wavelengths of light that standard polarizers and competitor products cannot the result is an ultra rich color gamut like the one you're seeing here we'll get more into that in a second and in combination with lg's alpha 7 gen 4 ai processor which leverages deep learning to better optimize content and filter unwanted noise you'll find that it's one of the best lcd implementations on the market hands down so what you're looking at here is the 75 nano 90 one of lg's largest 2021 nano cell models it's super difficult to convey true color quality of course via camera and i ran into the same issue with our lg oled video but what i can mention is the color gamut which far exceeds 100 of srgb color space which for those who aren't aware is really good and it also approaches up to 90 percent of dci p3 you can think of this like an lcd on steroids something i can't really fully explain with words apart from empirical data you'll have to see it in person to truly understand i approached the oled panel the same way mind you colors are incredibly vibrant here but i can only do so much on video because chances are you're watching this on a different screen with varying levels of color and contrast so it's not really going to translate one to one and that's the perfect segue into an obvious shortcoming of lcd technology yes we're going to talk about pros and cons in this video that's contrast it's something nanocell technology simply cannot remedy in its current form thanks to where the light is sourced in relation to the color filters and polarizers it's nearly impossible to get a contrast ratio approaching anywhere near that of OLED but that's okay i mean you're paying for that quality for that feature in an OLED tv so it comes down to managed expectations here instead nanocells do a great job making up for ips shortcomings were possible in the color department the true limitation here is the pixel technology itself and the price you'll pay reflects this but where i really wanted to see this thing in action was in gaming the 75 9090 isn't marketed as a gaming tv per se at least to the same extent that many of its oled counterparts are however some nanocell tvs out there still boast many alluring gaming features including vrr for variable refresh rate stability allm for reduced latency and freesync of all things right for consistent frame rates all of which can be controlled in the game optimizer menu and as you might expect the experience is quite good plenty for battle arenas and artsy titles alike heck even racing games farewell with this panel thanks to the inclusion of true motion which interpolates motion by inserting fake frames throughout a fast-paced scene and even so if that wasn't good enough for you the native 120 hertz refresh rate in this thing and minimal ghosting as seen in this ufo test are a testament to this panel's gaming capabilities so the baked in nano cell technology doesn't hinder the speed of this panel in fact it aims to make it more immersive with its precise color reproduction and on that note lg does market nano ips gaming monitors which also boast high refresh rates and still great color reproduction thanks to the inclusion of their nanocell film so here's a brief synopsis of what nanasel does and doesn't do it does improve color reproduction it also does improve upon ips technology's already excellent viewing angles it doesn't solve response time limitations associated with ips technology because it doesn't necessarily change the pixel technology itself as we discussed same goes for contrast and it doesn't improve refresh rates since that's not for what nsl was designed suppose it also doesn't break the bank relatively speaking and that's why i think it's a feature worth pursuing at least in your next tv unless you're willing to shell out a few thousand dollars for an oled model like the c1 we featured a few weeks ago nanocell is about as good as it gets and i think you'll be happy with the purchase consider checking out lg's latest nsl tv models via the link below i'll also link our c1 OLED video for those who are interested in something a bit more um a bit more flashy that's all for this one leave a like consider subscribing and i'll catch you in the next one my name is greg thanks for learning with me",

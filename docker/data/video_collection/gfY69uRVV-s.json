    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin'? The controller cables for the Super NES Classic Edition are about five feet long, but for many, that's still not enough. This time, let's take a look at a wireless controller designed with the mini retro console in mind. [ Music - Intro ] This is 8BitDo's wireless controller for the Super NES and Super Famicom Classic Edition. Like the Pro controller I reviewed not too long ago, it comes in two versions: One with the classic rainbow buttons, and the other with the North American purple ones. Both were sent to me by 8BitDo to check out and review. It's the same size and shape as an original Super NES controller, and while the button layout is identical, it does have a bit of a different design on the front. The buttons themselves have the same feel as those included with the SNES Classic Edition, and while the plastic isn't quite the same, it still feels plenty sturdy. In terms of functionality, this controller is very similar to the NES version that 8BitDo launched back in 2016. Pressing Select and Down is just like pressing Reset on the console to get you back into the menu. A small receiver is included and it draws power from the console itself. And while it's advertised for use with the SNES Classic Edition, it'll work just fine with the NES version too. Wireless pairing between the controller and receiver is automatic, and you can use two sets simultaneously. I didn't notice any issues with input lag, either. While it's wireless, it isn't proper Bluetooth, so the controller will *only* work with the receiver. But you can hook it up to a Windows, Mac, or Android device through a MicroUSB cable. And that port, of course, is also used for charging. It takes about an hour, and 8BitDo advertises up to 25 hours of play time. Ultimately, while this is a nice controller, it does serve a bit of a niche purpose because of that wireless receiver limitation. That said, I think it's fairly priced at $25 US. So if you've found that the wired controller's cable is just too short, that may be a small price to pay if it lets you play your retro games... from the couch. Big shoutout and thanks goes to 8BitDo for sending me these controllers to review. I'll include a link down in the description if you wanna check 'em out. If you like this video, I'd appreciate a thumbs-up and be sure to subscribe if you haven't already. You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram at thisdoesnotcomp, and as always, thanks for watching.",

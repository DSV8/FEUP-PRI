    "transcript": "(Laughter) Intro music What's up guys Lew here, back with another video. As you can tell, I'm in an unusual space But, there's a reason for that. I'm part of a special event where Five creators in one day are gonna look at various products. In front of me, I've got the Phillips Sonic Care Electric Tooth brush. I am very excited to check this out, test it out, see what it's all about. So, let's go ahead and jump inside the box Actually before we do, Let's take a look around the package here. The, power reach tip, replacement bristles... densely packed Believe it or not i don't own one of these things, I'm still using the old school tooth brush. Which is actually kinda depressing considering uh, I'm a tech enthusiast. You'd think I'd upgrade my tooth brush. Maybe that's exactly what this is... Look! It's the special edition Black as well \"Angled neck, it improves the reach for better cleaning at the back of the mouth\" good. \"Recharge indicator, so a charge lasts 2 weeks.\" Good, Alright, I'm happy. Okay So this is the important part (High speed motor sound) Some paper work \"Buy more stuff from us.\" The usual. What else? A little charge base. So as i said, they claim that the battery lasts for two weeks, so Theoretically you wouldn't have to have on here but this seems pretty convenient anyways, look at this. Just leave that on a counter top You, just upgraded your oral health. theoretically you've upgraded your life because of that. Alright i think i should test it out I probably need some tooth paste. You got any tooth paste around here? Jack? (Vibrating Tooth Brush sound) I'm gonna let the tooth brush do the work That's the whole point It's like a massage kind of. Water...(inaudible)... Ok beautiful, thank you. Stimulates a bit you know Gets the gums breathing and what not... gums don't breath... Um, it just yeah, I don't know I think it did the job, did the trick. From this moment forward I think I'm gonna have to swap out, my old school version Uh, for one of these guys. Yeah Philips Sonic Care. Very unusual un-boxing. Little bit of fun though hopefully you've appreciated that If you did make sure to leave a thumbs up down below!

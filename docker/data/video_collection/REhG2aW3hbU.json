    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today we're talking about one of my favorite features in the new iPadOS update that will be coming out later this year. It's called Scribble. It's basically handwriting recognition for your iPad. At WWDC 2020, they announced some new updates to iOS 14, and of course the new iPadOS update which I'm running a beta version of currently. If you do have access to a developer account, it is recommended that you don't install beta software on your main devices, because they are beta, they are still in development. There are bugs, and there are things that they are working out because it is in beta and it's not for mass consumption. But I do have a developer account and I'm installing the iPadOS on one of my old iPads, with, of course, the new iPad Pro Keyboard. Not the Magic keyboard. But in this video, I wanted to show you my favorite feature that they announced. I thought this was something that they would have had a long time ago, but they are just currently releasing this, and it's pretty cool. Let's check it out. Let's go into the Notes app. And I'm going to write you a Note. Dear YouTube, I love you! So, now I'm able to take this text and I'm able to treat it as if, it were just regular text. It gives you these little anchor points, And if I wanted to copy this text, I would just do the same action that I normally would do. So let's just press on it like we're going to copy it and you have the option to copy as text. So we're gonna go over to Pages, and I can take this handwritten text, and paste it into Pages. Dear YouTube, I lore you! Okay, so that could be maybe a handwriting issue. That does look like an R. Okay, you're right. Let's try it again. Now I'm going to try to rewrite love. Look at that. Let's copy that as text and see if my better handwriting helped. It did. It's also cool because you can use this and you can change the colors of anything that you've already written. I love it, because it's just treating this like a piece of text, which it is, but it's handwritten text. Handwriting recognition will also work in the search bar. So, if I want to search for, let's see, Twitter. That is terrible handwriting. Okay. It found Twitter. That's cool. Oh my gosh, it's my sister's baby. (squeals) I am... Oh my goodness. I am writing this on iPadOS. So, I just wrote that in Twitter, like in the Twitter app. Another cool thing is scratching out something that is wrong. So I'm going to just scratch out the M, delete... Hello. I'm writing this on my bed. This handwriting recognition is so freaking cool. I love this. This is going to be so fun. I don't like to write, but now that I know that I can, I might start writing again (laughs) Oh, look at this. Choose an option. Smart annotation drawing. I'm gonna do drawing. I can add a drawing here into pages. This is not new, but I still think it's pretty cool. I can add my drawing right here. Justine was here. I feel like I used to always tag stuff in school. I'd be like, \"Justine was here,\" when I was a child. That's probably not good. So going back to drawing in Notes. This is cool too, because you can just do a long hold and it will automatically make the lines super clean and neat. So, if I want to draw a triangle, I want to draw a circle. Everything is so perfect and neat. I'd love this. You could also treat these as images. It will also separate images and texts. So, it will be able to determine if you're drawing something or if you're drawing something that is supposed to be text. So that's pretty awesome. I cannot wait for all of the new updates. I can't believe it's almost iPhone season already. Like, where has this year gone? I have no idea. Well, this is one of my favorite features: Scribble on the new iPadOS, that should be out later this year. I would love to know from you guys though, what is your favorite feature that was announced either in iOS 14 or an iPadOS. There's so many new fun things coming that I just can not wait for all of them to be released. I'll put got a link in the description if you want to subscribe to our podcast. My sister and I just recently started one and we did a special bonus episode talking about WWDC and some of the things that were our highlights. Be sure to subscribe and hit the bell, so you'll be notified when I post a new video. I will definitely be posting some more. So stay tuned and I will see you guys very, very soon when I post new videos. But with that, I'm gonna go edit, and I will see you guys later. Bye. (upbeat music)",

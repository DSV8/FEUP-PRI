    "description": "Asus apparently hates display bezel as much as we do, which is why its new 2018 ZenBooks have almost none. With a massively reduced footprint, the new 14-inch ZenBook is now smaller than the old 13-inch ZenBook, while the new ZenBook 13 is a tiny bijou of a laptop. With prices starting from $899, these are the affordable members of Asus' high-end laptop line.

    "transcript": "- Hey, I'm Vlad with Verge here at IFA 2018 and with me I have the 2017 ZenBook. And the reason I have it is to show you the difference to the 2018 ZenBook. Now these are both 13\" laptops but as you can tell there is a massive difference in size. And that's because ASUS has shrunk down the bezels all around display. It's taken it down to much less than a centimeter on all four sides. Like, I don't need a backpack for this thing. I can just carry it around with me and be stylish and stuff. It's like a book size. It's impressive is what I'm saying. It's good. Technology moving forward. (slow electronic keyboard music) - The new ASUS ZenBook also keeps the web cam at the top of the display where it belongs and it also has IR cameras so you can do Windows Hello authentication. The display is nicer, they're brighter than the old generation. And the laptops are just so much smaller. You basically lose nothing and gain a ton of goodness. Okay, I lied. You do lose something. You do lose a USB-A port. You still get USB-A and USB-C and you can charge with USB-C. And you no longer have an SD card reader. It can only read Micro SD. Aside from the super obvious upgrade and display, the keyboard is also new and improved. It now has a backlight and it's not the old classic type. So that's a significant upgrade. And ASUS is also adding it's ErgoLift hinge design which basically tilts the bottom part of the laptop just a little bit up so it makes it easier to type on. And sinks the display down a little bit. This really contributes to the whole sense of this being a bezel-less display. Again, it has a few milometers of bezels but you really don't notice them when you're actually using the thing. And it's really advanced look and feel. It feels like it's super high end and premium whereas the ZenBook line, the non-pro version, isn't really ASUS' top of the line stuff which is pretty cool. You know it's a high end feel in a device that is cheaper. So ASUS is launching the new ZenBook 13, 14, and 15. And 14\" is actually smaller than its previous 13\". So that's how big of a leap it has been between 2017 and 2018. All of them have Intel 8th gen core processors inside of them. And you can get them started at $899 up to $1199. That's with a 16x9 10HZ display again across the line. You can get a touch screen option and if anything I would really want to upgrade or anything else it's the RAM which still has the four gigabytes. Really not sufficient for most people. Otherwise the standard spec is pretty nice. You get a much better display, a better keyboard, a back lit keyboard. And of course just a much smaller, more convenient form factor. Unlike making the laptops any thinner, which left it small of any benefits, reducing the bezels reduces the footprint of the entire machine, makes it that more convenient, portable, and easy to move around without needing to carry a big old technical backpack. And I'm really liking this trend which mirrors the one we already have with smart phones. So these are ASUS' new laptop upgrades series for 2018. For more from the show and for other beautiful, lovely, amazing advanced technology keep it up to the Verge.",

    "transcript": "before the video get started I do want to give you a heads up that of course this was recorded before social distancing wasn't put into place which means that of course you should stay at home like I am or stay in the office by myself like I am but I do want to give a huge thank you to my Crescenta for still allowing us to share with you guys this latest version Oh broke versus Pro so enjoy hello welcome to broke versus pro gaming last time can may have gotten the jump on me however I'm flipping the tables of time with the good help of our friends over Micro Center we're sponsoring this video you did not yes no yes I did you have a $300 setup that's all the money you get really good yeah 300 so the cool part about this episode is that I get to do whatever I want so in like last time we had to like build my PC outta like ten dollars I could go straight to like I don't know what we have yet risin 9 but yeah sure resinize do it thread Ripper why not but you know what to keep things fair okay which really embody the spirit of broke versus Pro and if I'm pro I'm not building my own PC whoo but that's for losers who builds their own PC I'm just gonna buy one I mean you yeah you can have fun building your 300 ollar PC or whatever you're gonna do I don't really care I'm gonna go ahead just pick a prebuilt okay by the way that's our sound guy rich hi rich rich you're in the shot again your roof good hey Cody okay I need some help so we're doing pro verse broke again okay ken is finally been dethroned I get the unlimited cool budget so can you help me find a cool desktop ya know for sure I'm the building today money up like Dells we have plenty of power specs okay oh what's this oh wait this is what we Ken got this for the first episode right the lien leuwen this is almost like I feel bad unlike you who goes like completely overkill I feel like if I did something like this that's not fair because you don't even know what the rest of my setup is I've already talked to the Micro Center guys I'm already this is all planned out I know exactly the way you scripted the video no I know the other things I've got I've got to you script the video I have a secret weapon on the other side of the store but I need my PC first with you okay if I scripted the video would be much better than this okay oh I call it the great this one yes Strix jido 10 th $13.99 k look at how reasonable that is those 10 Pro for all your professional whoa I'm a pro onion we're happy let me see what's inside okay I can't open it so this this is my secret weapon this behold no no not the arcade oh yeah so I picked f1 for a reason because this is a full simulator setup this is by next level racing and I've actually wanted one these for a while so this is the full seat we have the pedals we have the triple monitor setup gonna you know tell me back or I will show you how it's done mmm I knew what I was doing I came here hmm I don't like this my pedals are a little loose go away this is mine let me have my happy moment can we in there boys whoo I hate to admit it but that looks pretty good it's pretty good right okay slight miscalculation there well thank god this isn't a real game or Austin would be dead yes dude oh I'm so happy right now oh no my controllers connected what'd you do what did you do why did they disconnect I get the point so what's the plan I don't know everything's out of my price range look why nine seems like totally there was a spot to start I mean it's all good sign when Windows 10 is already like more than a third of my budget I will say you are kind of right 50 bucks for an Athlon yeah fine what are the prices looking for like feeding motherboards okay you really need to look at 80 320 here 320 right here I'll take pity on you and hope okay that's what you need how much $43 see okay so you're like 98 dollars right now you can do this I believe in you wait but I so wait for $300 I also need to get a monitor and get work yes a lot of work costs like 40 frosted would cost like 54 it would cost like 20 cases probably like okay well I don't realistically at this point I don't even think I can use a case well what do you do an xbox again or something maybe a laptop a $300 laptop okay sure what options do I have mr. I got sponsored by micro center and giving Ken scraps oh wow I wouldn't know anything about something like that and imagine so a sea of laptops yeah a lot of which are out of my price range will all be fine look see it's a suddenly over W okay okay yeah out of my price range out of my price range nope too expensive too expensive too expensive close but too expensive chromebook too expensive whoa hi there oh this guy let's see $299 bucks okay but wait oh it's rising it's rising by thirty three thirty two hundred you will you be able to play f1 on that on rising three in a bigger plan if I can get twenty frames out of this I'll be happy oh okay you know what okay I'm gonna take pity on you since you've got such a powerful system here okay come with me I actually saw something your ghost was here you need a laptop cool this is a setup video I will graciously provide you this cooler which with five RGB fans will give you at least half an extra frame per second I don't think this is RGB I think this is just gee I don't think this will help me but it'll definitely make it more different and push that push that $30 oh yo you get the red one you want red or green there get green you Capitan you have a razor laptop for the gamers by gamers rise up rise up on me I appreciate the help I don't know why I'm doing this how heavy is this thing it's a hundred pounds oh this your PC oh yes wait wait wait wait wait wait there's there's a there's a gap so stalk it comes with a metal side panel however metal is so 2011 so instead I put on the clear side panel to see my RX 2070 super my rise in system it's very impressed look look it's RGB this RGB implant - okay so I'm holding the camera now yeah because I'm a good buddy rich to help me out nothing like a pro set up to have pro friends to help you build I am also happy that you were able to buy yet another friend to help you out where's my pain you to be here now no look at that true friendship this is probably one of the most important parts of the setup is this is our seat this is where we not only all three of our monitors but also the petals the wheel pretty much everything is built around this setup I've never built one of these before so I don't know how I'll just gonna go oh no one what a nice box hey yo Ken here's your desk oh you can game on this I'll take what I can get oh look at that look how comfortable look at my lumbar support here I'll just be like chillin like oh look meanwhile I'm just gonna how's your setup come and start my build just gonna whip this up pretending to build a car right now are we seven again I'm not gonna lie this is actually not that bad look this is actually kind of cool yeah I didn't even need glue or tape but the real question is will the back of that box hold up with you leaning against it all day long I would hope so if it held a hundred pounds worth of stuff but big you're leaning against it yeah I'm not at a hundred pounds of force you ain't my honey I'm sorry to say he's all yeah yeah yeah would you tell me that where you going Ken so while Austin and rich are over there building Austin's place eat my setup is actually pretty much ready now all I have to do is assemble my racing wheel which is really just this charity case Xbox one controller that Austin was gracious enough to lend me and my racing wheel that conveniently just sits on the Xbox controller we'll see how this works well we got we I guess put this girdle thing then we put this thing on here the arm lines up with the analog stick and all I have to do is put the cap on it hey I like that look at that nice steering wheel so now that this steering wheel is done I'm gonna go ahead and to see how Austin and rich are doing and from the sounds of it they're still heavily in build mode right soon as you left we got a lot of work done we're almost done with the seat now this looks almost the same as from when I left it alright well they're still building I got bored so I left and most importantly we're at Austin's house so we're gonna do what anyone would do when you're at your friend's house and they're not watching is a chip the fridge this is like the saddest version of MTV Cribs if you thought Austin was living large apart from his fridge that's very stainless steel he ain't living that big in his kitchen at least that's for sure he started 30 minutes ago to format my computer something oh no I'm just scouting the competition so close it's so close no you're crying the screens behind and I'm lined up here don't you guys take a bolt through to hold it so this rust master chess xw and it's $70 it is certainly not cheap however now is this a incredibly good meal there's also a really salt set of petals Oh what it's like a real spark ooh it's it's a real sparkle wheel that looks like real carbon fiber and that's Alcantara holy also in the Box we have a nice set of petals to over a micro Center and Thrustmaster have the hook up we have the TLC n petals now this is actually as far as I know not even out yet so they specifically set this out so we can take a look at it these are load cell and magnetic petals so this will run you about $200 when it goes on sale but essentially these are supposed to be some of the best sort of race and petals that you can get as they're fully customizable oh okay will you clear some boxes out here all right that is a set of petals right here do you see the brake pedal right here look how much pressure that is oh oh I'm gonna take this what do you stop taking my things upgrade there we go for the displays we're using three of these ASIS vg2 seven eights now there's a couple reasons why I like this first of all it's a 27 inch display which is about the maximum thing we can fit on this setup but on top of that they're 1080p low resolution it isn't really matter because they're fairly far away and they run in a full 144 Hertz with not only free sync but also G sync and like 260 bucks this I feel like is easily the best call to get us the most immersive experience short or something like VR or a projector but I much prefer using ivory plays I'm coming boy yet so when you bite this cockpit it doesn't come with any kind of monitor mounts now if you just want to use a single monitor you can do that we have the triple monitor setup right here so oh yes the triple monitor stand might be a pretty hefty 150 dollars still 850 dollars less than the Apple display stand and it supports three monitors so it's like that means it cost like $50.00 per monitor yeah okay so first monitor setup again everything's pretty loose so we can adjust it to just the right angle but to this gonna be sweet next step is to get the other monitors mounted there's gonna be a ton of cables here so we have monitor display cables we have monitor power cables we have the power cable and the turbo for the wheel the pedals have to have cables run but from there we should be pretty close to actually getting a game up and running there'll be a lot of tweaking and tuning once we have everything mounted together one more time actually one more I'm not ready okay oh sure I'll do it again alright he's good the second time so austin needed some help to install his bezel free kiss story of my life you can see this is what looks like obviously this is not fully aligned but this is what it looked like before with the bezel free kit it's not 100% perfect I think we may have to do a little bit more tweaking do you can see especially when you're kind of sitting roughly in the seat that actually looks to be pretty good oh look at that look at that hey what's my button I don't know which button this is you could already tell the difference with also throwing balls that's fast that's 90 frames per second Oh like that's ridiculous oh I mean obviously need practice on it but this totally works yes I feel good in saying that this is actually going to work right I mean the wheels feels good I would like to tweak with a little bit more force feedback but you can see it's pretty accurate we're getting 80 frames per second or so which on three monitors seems to be fine the pedals seem to be pretty much accurate oh all right do it I'm gonna tweak this we're gonna put that the bezel freaked it on but I think pretty close we're ready to start the broke versus Pro challenge okay very Savior you're not allowed to turn off the halo by the way I'm not a trap the halo good no assists besides the dragon line because breaking it sorry alright so it is 5 minutes to 4 so we have approximately been shooting for about 10 hours or something like that mattre um but the Sun is going down so we're gonna have to hit the lights here there we go and here it is my setup Wow so impressive it's great right $300 HP risin laptop with some kind of vague Radeon integrated graphics I did have to make some slight modifications I have a door yours doesn't have a door need doors mr. Bryton it's fine I can also jump right in and we're good we're good fighting there we go okay your door opens we're good we're good we're good you feeling good right now yeah shut my door on you I think it's time for qualifying sure so the rules will be very simple we're going to have how long do I need five minutes of practice sure okay five minutes of practice one qualifying session and then a five lap race to determine is the broke setup really better than the pro setup that sounds like a bomb all right this let's go let's do it what are you getting I'm give me 32 frames I'm getting a 80 that's cool man I looked up and blew the corner yeah that's why that's why I'm trying not to look up if I'm real though this wheel not doing much for me really so the 3d printed controller wheel thing is giving me more precise control but I'm still only using one thumb to steer because my shift buttons are X and ay which is what I'm most used to on a controller and I don't feel comfortable switching to shoulder buttons right now to change my ears so with the way that's configured I might actually take my wheel off and just straight up play with the controller I'll definitely feel way more at home which is kind of what I need right now considering it Hey I'm gonna say the best part of this is definitely the wheel like I get so much force feedback here really kind of tells me where the car is trying to go like where it's like really fighting me these pedals are also really nice I bet they want to spend more time with them and kind of actually figure out exactly the right sort of level like I feel like the brake pedal could be a little bit firmer with one of the other Springs so with our practice laps done and neither us being a clear winner the next step is to qualify so I think we only get doing it one lap to this I believe so all right here we go here we go whoo the Suns in my face with these giant displays luckily I don't have that brightness so I can't really I'm not too confident my qualifying just because I've missed a few beats but we'll see whoa one forty point six taught me obviously I beat you you haven't finished yet yeah there we go yeah I beat you by three point four seconds on that lap all right so it all comes down to this should you spend $200 and build your set up a box or should you get the old $300 or whatever it was or should you get the ultimate racing Pro setup and see what the real pros do you know all right like me this is for the 1% no this is for this is for the 99% I'm so used to being the 1% oh we're gonna have to oh wait I need clutch really oh go oh you're right there with my giant monitors I can see you oh okay you know you can have that that's fine I'm not gonna get my eggs I started better than Austin I didn't go your so why are you so wide Oh Oh gotcha I like to do drive carefully now well this is great Wow like really ahead yeah like a terrible spot I had to put in Reverse to get back to life a little too late there but that's okay I have a lot of room for error now oh alright it comes down to this going keep the porch keep the porch keep the push I need you to make a mistake I don't think I'm gonna catch you unless you make a mistake it feels great it feels really good oh man I beat the rich dude my fastest lap is two point two seconds passes yeah but I was a more composed driver which is all that matters thank you very much for watching this episode of broke versus Pro if you like check out the stuff we talked about this video the links will be in the description again huge shout out to Micro Center for sponsoring my setup and I guess part of yours until next time can any parts I want",

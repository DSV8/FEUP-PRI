    "transcript": "this pile of Amazon crap contains about as cheap a gaming PC as you can build yourself using Amazon Without Really licking up bezos's skid marks and by that I mean scraping the bottom of the barrel I guess um anyway let's see what we got in terms of case we get the quite nice mccube by Deep cool which is a successor to the infamous Ebola case and it was on sale for about 55 Canadian which is a steal for what it is also making it the cheapest case I could find which is pretty cool now the storage that's going to be contributing to bezos's next trip into space via penis is this SP a58 it's a 256 gig SSD which costs a surprisingly small amount storage on the bottom end has gotten pretty cheap on that note there's 16 gigs of X power gaming turbine Ram was also surprisingly cheap for a 3200 megahertz ddr4 I'm pretty excited that we could get a reasonable Ram configuration especially considering the rest of the system apu-wise which means this is our CPU and our graphics card because you know cheapest dish we're using the AMD ryzen 5 4600g which seems like it has a pretty beefy CPU section with 6 cores and 12 threads and at 140 Canadian dark me for the CPU and graphics card that sounds like a bit of a deal to me assuming the performance isn't horrendous power supply wise I don't think this is necessarily an IED but its box does dated quite well with this Haswell ready branding on it so either a thermaltake is super lazy about updating its packaging or this has been sitting in a warehouse for the last 17 eons uh let's hope it's the thermal take being lazy then wise I'm using the using the MSI b550m Pro Wi-Fi and the total price of all of these components before tax for some reason is 357 US Dollars looking back if we really wanted to cheap out we could have gotten 8 gigs of RAM instead and this a520 motherboard saving us 30 US Dollars however the a520 board wasn't available when I ordered these parts and in terms of the single 8 gig stick no one wants to skidmark lick that hard and with that beautiful imagery let's put the system together and see how it runs first let's check out the why is it so sticky now aside from the weird excretion on it this is a surprisingly nice looking motherboard considering the price point not only do we get a bit of heatsink on the power delivery we even get some post LEDs features that are normally reserved only for the landed Gendry and the i o isn't too bad either look at that we've even got Wi-Fi although the rear i o Shield is straight out of 1998 garbage town aside from the six cores of Glory the 4600g also has a Vega 7i GPU in it which should give us reasonable gaming performance I'm excited to see how that works out now I went out of my way to get some blue Rams so that we have just a splash of color in this build you know oh no it's one of those terrible impossible to open plastic clamshell things just like the kind of packaging that like staplers coming oh I hate it although it actually doesn't work too terribly for Ram because you can just kind of pull it out like that you just gotta love some X power gaming turbine action oh it's our old friend The Wraith stealth cooler the cooler the Intel stock cooler wishes to become when it grows up oh I actually can't remember which way around was considered the correct way to mount it I I think this is but if you're offended by this mounting orientation then um good oh that's quite a nice looking base for a system which I'm not going to test before dropping in the case like a real badass and by that I mean dumbass foreign Cube which is quite a Nifty case and I'm surprised I could get it for as little as I did now the front may be restrictive enough for even the most adventurous hypoxophilia enjoyer but it's a pretty low powered system and there is a bunch of ventilation in other places that makes up for it but before we start packing stuff in there let's unsheathe the power supply I don't know how safe I'm supposed to feel with this power supply but at least it's not as light as a quail egg which you know is a reasonable sign I guess oh this power supply is not modular and it comes with one hell of a cable Clump that we're gonna have to hide in our little matx case so hopefully that's not too hard to do ew it comes with a Molex fan which is pretty disgusting and this is quite an inconvenient side to have the connector so I'm gonna flip the fan so that I can more easily cable route that gross Molex connector through here so that we don't need to ever see it again foreign just like that we've got a much cleaner cable run nice the standoffs have these little Loops which catch the motherboard and keep them in place a lot of times in budget cases they just have smooth standoffs and then it's it's harder to accurately Mount the motherboard so good job nice looking good all we need to do now is plug all the ugly cables in cable manage it and then we can install Windows and finally run some games on it oh and I almost forgot the SSD we also need to mount that in somewhere that's cool just kind of sticks in there let's see how much elbow grease it takes to get the rear side panel on oh so now we've gotten to the part of the video where I'm going to do a bit of a glamorous sequence so you all can jealously admire my mad PC Building skills and then we'll see how it runs thank you although before I get ahead of myself being all arrogant about it we should probably see if it fires up so let's see if it works there we go it's posted at which point I enabled xmps to make full use of our RAM and installed Windows after which we could unleash the fury of the Beast now with GTA 5 running a 1080p normal settings which is like low we're getting about 60 frames per second at 1080p on a hundred dollar igpu that's not bad at all granted it is low settings on a 300 year old game so on the grand scheme of things it's not spectacular but for an igpu this is pretty good we also have CPU Headroom in Spades so later in the video I'll drop a dedicated graphics card in here which should make a huge difference aside from that the little wraith stealth cooler is doing a great job the temperatures are very good the performance of this little system is Miles Ahead of the nas in the previous video which cost more than this but that is is a Nas wow so CS go with 1080p uh competitive settings this is a significantly better result than Nas gaming and this is a usable CS go result like it you can play some casual online gaming like this it's smooth there isn't a bunch of input lag like yeah this is a usable CS go result which obviously doesn't make me a better gamer foreign what settings am I using did I just default it to high like I've defaulted it to high like a papega okay that makes that makes a lot of sense as to why it was running that poorly yeah even at low Battlefield isn't going great we are getting about 40 frames per second but it feels like we're gaming in a heavy treacle but it is running quite a bit better than I was expecting like the IG the igpu in this 4600 G is no slouch I missed everything oh louder luckily they also missed everything so that helps okay at 1080p low settings we are getting under 20 frames per second with cyberpunk which I I don't think is massively unexpected considering that we do have an eye GPU in here that we're using luckily we do have a very powerful tool available to us in cyberpunk which is super resolution quality and see how much that helps oh we briefly hit 24 frames per second there which is still not great let's try some more FSR performance so this is about double what we were getting without FSR on uh it it doesn't look amazing uh I don't think it's going to capture on on camera very well but we've got a lot of pretty weird visual artifacts going on but we could always make it look worse Ultra performance now with ultra performance we are getting above 30 frames per second but wow does it look terrible it doesn't look just like we have vaseline rubbed into our eyes it looks like our eyes are Vaseline it is it is brutal but again we can always make it look worse let's drop the resolution to 720p with ultra performance FSR oh yes there we go we have 50 frames per second happening and it feels okay there is a little bit bit of input lag but it feels reasonable however visually it kind of looks like the gameplay is being censored I don't know this is some properly terrible looking gameplay but it doesn't matter at least we're getting a playable result you know on that note let's drop a graphics card into the system to really step up the gaming performance in terms of graphics card I decided to go with this RX 6600 because you can get them used on eBay for a reasonable amount under 300 Canadian which considering how Wild new GPU prices are on the lower end these days this seems like a pretty good bet to me oh no terrible breakout pcie slot covers we meet again foreign oh I hate that so bad foreign GTA 5 I had to step up the settings to 1080p high so that we didn't run into the stutter Zone and we're still getting more than double the frame rate so unsurprisingly the dedicated graphics card made a big difference now again with Battlefield 5 I took the settings from 1080p low to 1080p high and we're getting a very good gaming experience here it's made such a big difference but what I find the most interesting about this performance is that the 6600 seems to be pretty much maxing out what this 4600g can keep up with in terms of gaming GPU so there wouldn't be much of a point spending any more money on a graphics card than this at least the 1080P and then finally when it comes to cyberpunk I I don't know I think it may have made a little bit of a difference dropping a graphics card in here seems to just be running slightly better which brings me to the end of another video yes it's the end bye thank you foreign",

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Happy 2017, guys. Welcome to one of my first vlogs. Today's video is focused around one simple question, what do you wear to the White House? We're on Pennsylvania Avenue right now. We're about to head into the White House. - Yeah. It's like this entrance. - Jenna got her math book stolen. I think for this I'm gonna use this big guy. - That's cool. - This is so cool! This lens is so good. So I made it to the airport. - Social media influencers on this flight. - Hello. - I'm just doing a vlog recap. - Is that what you're doing? Is the mic on? - Oh hey, hi. - Hi! You never used Vine, well, it's too late, 'cause it's no longer with us anymore. - It's like we've never eaten before. - We haven't, I'm still hungry. - I think it turned out pretty nice. Steelers lost. I don't think I'm gonna go to the Super Bowl now. Do you wanna hear some doggies? Let's go see. What are you doing, hi. It's so good. You wearing your Yeezy kameezy shoes shoedaboos today? - No, not no Yeezy kameezies. - We're going to see Stanley the Giraffe. I'm an idiot. I'm careless, I'm reckless. Accidents happen. Phone just drops. This one is for Tom Brady, and we're gonna call this the deflate cake. Mess, mess, mess, mess. Alright, that's it. Now I gotta clean up my kill zone here. - Oh. - Wait, what are you holding? - Oh, that's not glue. - Hey you know what's a great idea when you're cooking? Why don't you wear a freaking sweater that has the biggest, most obnoxious sleeves ever. Wonderful idea. I only made a little tiny mess. If you make this for your lover, your lover's gonna be like, wow. I love you. I'm freaking out. Like, I'm freaking out. It's just a tiny mini pizza. - I'd say pretty good. - I can't even turn around because I'm in such a tight space. Does it look good? They both fell out. I can't even pick it up with one hand, unfortunately. (Justine slurps) I'm sure many of you have been waiting patiently for this video, when will iJustine lose her AirPods? And guess what? 64 days. - Hello. - Can you believe this, we happened to just be in Hawaii at the same time, like, crazy. - We did not plan this. (Justine yells) (Justine laughs) - Oh my, you're beautiful. And there it is! Baby. (gasps) We need a microwave. - I got one. Real deal, Justine. - Oh my goodness. - Am I on something? - You're on the table. I've opened a lot of Apple products before, this is not the handiwork of an original, unboxed iPhone. Pretty sure yesterday I probably put in 15 hours, because I didn't really leave the couch. - Guys, I'm starting to get worried about her. She won't go home because she doesn't want to stop playing her game. - It tastes like Play-Doh. You ever eaten Play-Doh? - No, I haven't eaten Play-Doh. - I have. I'm going to be importing all of these amiibo into Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This has become an actual serious issue, and I'm concerned about my wellbeing, because there is nothing else that I wanna do except play Zelda: Breath of the Freakin' Wild. (relaxing music) This is the happiest day ever. Technology is incredible. Super impressed. Look at our balls. Look at this little thing. Wow, this is a really nice feel. What do I got? What! Wait a minute, I thought my, I was supposed to reflect. - Boost around New York City. - I can't do that. - I believe in you, Justine. - I don't, I don't think so. - You can do it. - People that are joining us are not just any people. They are the Power Rangers. So here's what it actually looks like right up here. Hey everyone, I am Justine Ezarik, and I am so excited to welcome everyone to the Power Rangers Virtual Reality Experience. - Happy birthday! - Oh! - How did they get them to your door? - I don't know even how this is possible. We're trying grinding today. That's what we're doing, and eating cake and pizza. - These are my friends, Phelba has friends. - Hi! I always say, I'm not gonna do it this time. I'm not, I don't need it. And then here we are, at it again. We got the phone, guys. Do you think I should keep this phone, or should I stick with my jet black phone? I'm returning my red iPhone. I just realized that I don't like the color red. The transaction is complete. And then we've got our glazed meat, which I am unbelievably surprised at how good that actually tasted. - Yeah, let's try. (cow moos) More milk, more milk, more milk. - You beat me! - Whoa, 17 cups! - Oh my gosh, SuperSaf TV, right here. - I came branded. - You did. Hi! Oh my god, what do I do? How do I get my freaking egg out? There's Jenna ready to hike. - [Jenna] I swear to god, you gotta hurry up. - I lost my tweezers! - They're on my shoe. Oh no, I made it backwards. - Oh, is that it? So we're going to Long Beach for the Toyota Grand Prix. We found Conor. - A vlog? - Hello! - Oh hey. - This is solid chocolate. Why don't we just cut off, like the pieces of it? - Oh god! Ooh, this is interesting. Place it, twist it, crunch it, fill it, stuff it, dip it, place it, twist it. Oh, it's also topped with fun. Look at this stuff that they gave us to work with. How are you supposed to do anything? - I think this is the best one. (rock music) (moves into playful music) (moves into hip-hop music) - Let's take a taste. (Justine screams) What? Oh my, it's like, it has a sour taste. - [Woman] You can open 'em. - (gasps) Mario's in my house! It looks good. That's perfect. This is the life that we live. Can you believe this Friday night, Jen? I'm myself, I'm Libby. - [Man] What's your name? Libby. I'm just, you know, swimming out here, just seeing what I can see. I just bought these shoes today, too. - [Man] Who's writing the story? - Me. - Okay. - Yes, I am. Is that bad, do you think? - It's good. - Yes, I thought so. So this phone looks really good. What the heck? (rock music) Not a secret that I'm obsessed with my Nintendo Switch still. Yes, I'm still obsessed. Oh my god, no! No no no no! - I don't know how to do that. - Getting very fussy. I'm not even getting the pairing option again. - Do you need my Wi-Fi? - No. I mean this is, this is the future here. - So all of our scholarship players, they can come in before and after hours. - They have a scholarship program for League of Legends. - Yeah. - That's what you're telling me. That's so awesome. Oh, wow. Look at this thing, it's huge. That's not the right color. There's also an undo. Here's a nice red. (laughing) This is full of lies. You wanna get a box of lies, this is what you gotta get. I just got scared. You can't turn off Like a merry-go-round My head is spinning I see you're up and about I'm sure as hell not What I am most excited about, what jobs are you going to create that do not exist now? - Yes. - So good luck. - [Host] Can we take a selfie? - Yes! Impeccable timing. Yeah, this is still a little doughy. A beautiful kind of mess When in Chicago, you go to Portillo's Every time I think about this I get so confused it's you That's gonna work out. - That's so many candles! How old am I! - It's only 16. - Thank you. (upbeat music) - [Man] Oh god, are you okay? (cheering) - I just want to say, you should be very careful with knives because they are not a toy. You should not play with them. It's still making noise. This is crazy. Snak-Saks? (laughs) Grab 'em, share 'em, zip 'em, take 'em. That's something you can't make up. (soothing music) - [Man] How you doing there? - Oh my god, I have two goats. - You can do it. - How does it feel? - Uh, great, great. Oh my god. Matty, go say hi to Lizzie. Go say hi to Lizzie. - [Lizzie] Hi, come here! Oh, he's so-- - He's like, go back. Lindsey, Lindsey. Oh my gosh, guys. Your film was incredible. - Oh, Justine, thank you so much. - I'm so glad you got fired, 'cause I got the job, man, a future. - I got my friend back. - I can see you filming me. But like, it's like an out of body experience. I'm freaking out. Holy crap. Are you ready to land, Jen? - Yeah. - Let's land. So ever since the Mac operating system was called Yosemite and then the next version was El Capitan, that's the only thing that I wanted to do. I wanted to go and visit Yosemite and then visit El Capitan. So we're here. We made it. My goal has been complete. Is that our El Capitan over there? - [Man] Yeah. - Wow. Hi baby. (machine whistles) Shut up! Get out of my house! - Bye, guys. - Get the fuck out of here! - I'll see you later, Justine. - Oh, this could be it. Okay. - [Together] One, two, three, four. (both scream) - My fingers crossed at a Mac Pro announcement. I feel like this WWDC will not disappoint. Original Mac Pro came out in 2013. We've been waiting for a Mac Pro. I'm gonna spray paint this thing fluorescent pink. When we were young and free Like queens upon a throne Round number one. - Yeah, just like boxing. - I already got 100 points. - You did it! (playful music) - [Man] Oh god. - Oh no! I keep wanting to call it Xbox Scorpio still. - So do I, actually. - But it's not! - It's not. - Let's see what they look like on the Switch. I'm loving the one color on each side Joy-Cons. Man, hot pink though. Gonna look so great. Ooh, ooh. - Oh, come here! - Wrong game. So sorry, I'm so sorry, you're in my way. You're gonna have to get out of my way. Holy shit! Oh my god! (screaming) Oh my god! Holy crap! - [Man] Look at it go. I think that's all the plastic melting off right now. - [Justine] Oh god, it stinks. Is it safe? - Now stand back, because that battery might explode. - Well then what happens? - [Man] Let me take the lid and put it back on. (upbeat music) - This is insane. Look at this! (gasps) I am blown away. - Let me go pick up my controller, and I'm gonna throw it over to iJustine and Goldenboy and Paul. - Hey guys, welcome to the world premiere of Star Wars Battlefront II's multiplayer gameplay, Assault on Theed. Hey guys, it's Terry Crews. Okay, alright, so I was at the E3 press conference, and when we saw you pop on that screen, for the Crackdown 3 trailer, people were going absolutely nuts. - Tomorrow you'll be throwing cars. (screams) Forget dropping bombs. It's always been my dream to be in a video game. - This text is so small. I never thought I needed reading glasses, but I don't even think reading glasses would help out with this. We need a freaking magnifying glass. So I'm in Toronto right now, this is actually my first time here. I've never really been to Canada. (audience applauds) On YouTube, this experience isn't a one-way broadcast. It's a two-way conversation. And one of the features that makes YouTube special, is the way that our fans are able to come together to shape communities around their favorite content. (relaxing hip-hop music) (moves into pop music) - I hate it. - I'm gonna throw up. - I don't think I like this. I'm so in love with you - [Man] True influencer. - Do you like the term influencer? 'Cause I don't think-- - [Man] It's kind of a bad term, isn't it? - I feel like it is, but I don't know what else to call us. I mean, they used to call us YouTubers-- - [Man] Or creators. - They're really good, they're super good. Like I feel like these trees should just be coming out and hitting me in the eye. I remember every word you said Every coffee in your tiny bed - [Man] Oh, Matty show, hey Matty. - Okay, so I'm gonna say that the Echo Show is pretty cool. Even though this is something that isn't really that revolutionary. We didn't finish that yet, movie magic. - We're gonna finish that. - Exactly, good stuff. - [Justine] Cheers. - Cheers, cheers! - This is Madison Square Park. Neither one of us live here. You're visiting. - I'm visiting from Boston. - This is cool. - [Cameraman] It's super cool. - Oh my god. - [Justine] Is it good, Matt? - You gotta try this. - [Justine] That looks so good, Jen. (dance music) - I know what we need. - A drill? - [Jenna] I wonder how many calories this is. - I don't know, do the math. No, no, no, what are you doing? Yeah, look at that sweet treat, lady! I can't believe it! This box was all beat up and I was like, ah, there's probably nothing cool in here. Wow. (relaxing music) The 3DS XL is a little bit taller. You shoulda been a baller, shot caller. Wanna be a baller Shot caller 20\" blades on the Impala - [Man] A serrated knife, you can use mine, too. - [Justine] Oh, I have one upstairs. That's where I keep my knives. - How do you have a serrated knife upstairs? What's happening up there? - So I don't know if this one would work. This was my first machete, I'm super excited about it. - Why do you have that? I have to know why you have that. - This is my Bowie knife. - But when I said serrated, I didn't mean so aggressively serrated. - The iPhone 8 is real, but the fact that we're already talking about the iPhone 9 is, come on. Ow! - Come on. I've never seen any iPhone 8 rumors, I've never seen anything, I just stay away. - What? Today, I just installed iOS 11. Wait a minute. Hey Siri, what time is it? - [Siri] The time is 11:00 p.m. - That's what I look like in 2008. - Your hair and eyebrows have come a very long way. - Thank you. - Wait, so this was how long ago? - This was a year after the iPhone bill video, and I'm kind of just revisiting the place that I went. I was just looking at my meal and I'm seriously incredibly impressed. Happy birthday! - Thank you! - How are you? - I'm so good, how are you, thanks for coming. - [Justine] This cake is amazing, oh my god, I love it. (electronic music) - I got it. I'm the ultimate memer. - Wow. - And then we can light it over the flame. (yelling) Celebrate you! Celebrate you. Get it in there! What does esket-te-te-te mean? What does that mean? I'm freaking out, man, I'm freaking out. Guys, I'm still alive. I haven't died yet. - [Dentist] That huge hole. - [Justine] That's huge. - [Dentist] Yeah. - Thank you, can you tell them I did a good job? - She did great. Happy birthday to you - Thank you. - [Woman] Blow it out, blow it out. - [Justine] Hey, are you DJing? - Yeah, when you book me. Book me up, please. - Yes. (record scratching) These look great. This is some Martha Stewart action here. Rachael Ray would be like, girl, you're so good at everything, making frozen food. Oh, goodness. There are so many goodies in here. (funky music) I was trying to be Kesha. It may be a given to most people, but not having seen the movie, are we in Hogwarts? - That's Hogwarts. - Oh, so where are we now? - We're in Hogsmeade. - Hogsmeade. - [Woman] Look up, literally, it says. - Oh. Do you know fashion? Because it's me. (laughs) Wow. - [Woman] You can kinda see it through the glasses. - It's copper. It's not rose gold. I don't like this color at all. I'm just gonna be 100%, completely honest with you. It's beautiful. - Okay. - It's not good. At all. (computer beeps) Do you what that sound is? That sound means oh baby, we're charging. And I'm happy about it. I seem to be doing a very good job on this one. Hey Jenna, what's your favorite color? 'Cause I feel like you like blue. Oh yeah, slow-mo sizzle. What is this color? I might die today. Oh geez, oh god, my body, my body, my body. I look so dumb in hats. - [Man] I think you look great in hats. - You're a liar. - You should pull it all the way down. - Tip it forward. Lettuce, mom. Hi Stanley. Okay that was it. - Wait, I'm scared. That tasted like nice. - Oh no! No! Shoot. - I literally just had a mini-heart attack. - I'm so excited. So she sent me a few of these things already, but there's a few that I do not have. Oh I had a small mishap. (relaxing electronic music) What I'd like to know is how many kids are gonna use this as their back to school backpack? I feel like I need one of those advent calendars, like the countdown to Christmas but this is the countdown to my Christmas. And that's iPhone announcement day. I have an announcement to make, and I'm not sure how to make this announcement without freaking out. I'm going to the Apple event. September 12, my body! Usually when packing, the best advice is to pack the largest things first. I didn't adhere to my own advice. Okay. The first person that I ran into when I stepped up to the theater was Steve Wozniak. And you know it's one of those things like when you meet your heroes, you don't know what to say. I didn't know what to say, but I said thank you. Thank you for everything, and then he walked away. Oh hey, hi. - Hi. How are you doing? - Good, I'm really excited, are you excited? - I'm not as excited as you I don't think. - Here it is, the iPhone X. It was officially announced today and I've got it in my hand. This is the white version and there's also a space gray version, and this thing is absolutely beautiful. Precious. I was trying to, stop it. Look at this. I am crying in my own paper. Slim my face, I'll make my eyes big. I kinda look like in the Mario Brothers movie, the Goombas. Could I just take like a normal picture? Oh my god, all the effects are still on. I don't want large eyes, I want mine. And they seem to be the same size. So, okay. Good to know. This is someone who is genuinely enthusiastic about iPhones and everything Apple. Yeah we can move in, move in I've taken it A sun to set Crystal on the back is bigger. If I'm kind of just eyeballing this, I mean you can sort of very vaguely tell that it's slightly more raised. Oh, this matches my knife. So right here is the little eject button. When you press this, it prepares your device for, come here, for tablet mode. What apps can I not live without? Oh, clickbait, hello. Only clickbait if it's not true. So starting off here from the top, I've got my Calendar. Which one looks the most like us? (playful music) - Where's the voting thing? I'm pointing down but I don't think that's right. - I'm not sure. - [Jenna] That does not look like pumpkin pie. - Shut up, what do you think it is? - Why is the crust on top? The pumpkin pies I ever had were like just. Did you make apple pie or pumpkin pie? - I completely messed this up from the beginning! - [Cameraman] I was wondering what the plan was, I've never seen it done that way. - I've never either, maybe you're onto something. - Hence the name Platinum, hello baby. (electronic music) The only thing that would make me happier is if I could eat this cookie while playing Cookie Jam while my cookie is in the game. I feel like that's some crazy Inception nonsense. - [Man] Doc Brown in Back to the Future right now. - (screams) Holy crap! This is so bright. So I'm definitely gonna mess around with this, because I feel like this isn't the ideal setup. I don't like where this microphone placement is. - You think I can make it? - No. - No? - No. You didn't even hit the backboard. It is Super Mario cereal. It's just like Lucky Charms. - Eating cereal's a one person job, I don't know how else I can help. - Matt, how fast can you drink this milk? - Guys, it's Jeff! - Hey guys, what's happening? - Congratulations on the show, are you excited? - Yes, I'm very excited. We are live like very soon, it's gonna be a big show. - [Announcer] iJustine and Lance Reddick. - [Lance] What's up guardians? - I'm kind of scared, to be honest with you. Things just got so crazy From a simple maybe It was a long way down I just feel so happy - [Robot] A high priest who has a mysterious and powerful connection to the traveler and a-- (Christmas music) - Happy Vlogmas. Oh, we are making a s'more. I think we're making a, there's a bit of a s'more happening here. - [Joey] Woo-hoo! - I mean, this is the perfect tree topper. I think everyone should do this for their Christmas tree. I feel a very large range of emotions right now. These are my YouTuber gingerbread cookies. And what's great is as a YouTuber I feel like we've got a great community, and here we are all unified (laughs) by one common thing. Put this around the tree. - Okay. Justine, you've got me in there. (laughs) - Okay, cut it off. - Okay. Let's go and buy a bunch of toys for Toys for Tots. - Going shopping! - Woo! - [Jenna] Push both those carts, Jus. - Now watch me. - [Jenna] I'm watching. - Here's all our toys. - [Jenna] There's a lot of them. - I know. Maybe it's an acquired taste. (coughs) Oh wow, yeah, gimme another hit of that. Oh my god. Said I don't gotta dance (Justine laughs) - I'm putting myself in the freezer, I quit. - You should go in there, I'll see you in a couple of years. I'll come be like, Jenna's in cryo-freeze. I had all intentions of making this beautiful. Now it all just looks like trash. Is this something, is this like a put it on your head? - (laughs) You could. - [Justine] I have absolutely no idea what this is. - Lights up. - We have activity. - Yeah, let's go fire it up. We can plug in now. We can fire it up. That was the whole thing. You just got served. - I did! (\"Back That Thang Up\" by Juvenile) Oh my god, look, use your head. Turn! See it. - Don't touch me. - Might be how we. (laughs) - There. Okay, you hold it. (both scream) (electronic music)",

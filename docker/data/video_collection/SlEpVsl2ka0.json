    "transcript": "- If I were a Jedi, I would use Force heal on the wounds Star Wars has inflicted upon itself, but I'm not. So. (squawking) AMD has confirmed some heavily anticipated upcoming product releases with the Q1 financial results, which had some pretty nice numbers by the way. - [Man] Oh yeah. - Those were are some nice, - [Man] Oh. - good numbers. - Oh, they're so good. But the highlight was AMD confirming recent rumors claiming that Team Red was prepping Zen 4-based Ry zen 7000 chips for desktops, code-named Raphael, which will launch later this year, while next year will get APUs for thin and light notebooks code named Phoenix, - (Man squawking) and more powerful note and more powerful laptop. Chip's code named Dragon Range. - (Man) Whoa. - Oh that sounds spicy (Man laughs) leaks so far have made Phoenix look like a powerhouse but AMD's roadmap lists those with a TDP of around only 35 Watts. - Well, dragon Range is rated at 55 Watts. So team Red's chips will still spread their powerful wings but they might be a little more leathery than we thought. - (Man) You ever felt dragon wing? - I've never felt the dragon wing. - It's very interesting texture. - The NFT faithful will love to say that you wanna get in now and watch the value of your cartoon animal picture, grow to the moon. But a report from the wall street journal claims that the NFT market may be collapsing. As daily average, sales of NFTs have dropped 92 hole, 92% from their peak in September, 2021. However, the report is based on data from market analysis platform, non fungible, and has been criticized by other elements of the crypto community which frankly no one saw coming. Right? - Right. And what why? weird? - Hmm. Coin Telegraph argues that non fungible analysis includes data from the NFT game. Axie infinity, which is in a bit of a crisis right now but the rest of the NFT market is simply seeing its value consolidated into the top five or six collections like board apes, a Zuki, Clonex, and the other pictures of cartoons. So while it's all the other cartoons, you know the ones? the ones that don't look like anything. So while it's still absolutely dumb, that Starbucks is trying to sell you NFTs with your frappuccino. - (Man) No way NFTs may linger for a little while longer like a societal drug resistance tumor. - I decide I'd like to get grand A no whip back for NFT pump - I should have said societal drug resistant tumor but I said resistance tumor. So it's, it's a tumor that fights the power - Of the first order. - Yes. And India thinks that the thing that VPNs do, you know protect your privacy is done, and they should actually do the opposite of that. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. It's an interesting perspective. (audience laughing) Last week, the company's ministry of electronics and IT ordered VPNs to keep user data including customer names, physical and IP addresses usage patterns and more, for five years or more or her face up to a year in prison. And it's not just VPNs either data centers cloud service providers are also affected by the order. Like, I mean, - What? - VPNs, okay. VPNs regularly advertised and not keeping data as a selling point for their services. So needless to say this order doesn't make a ton of sense. Although the order went out on April 28th businesses have until June 27th, which is not that long actually, to get their systems in order. And then we can all have a nice internet where nothing bad happens ever. This will fix it. I think. - This end TikTok - Yeah. Yeah. Just, just ban TikTok. - We're heading in the right direction - And make it so that you have to keep all the data and that way world peace. And now it's time for the NFT bits brought to you by manscaped who have partnered with the text cancer society. And for some reason, I can't say testicular very often the testicular, cancer society to help you take care down there. This year for a limited time get their new special edition TCS lawnmower 4.0 electric waterproof trimmer because, with its launch manscaped is donating $50,000 to the TCS to help those impacted by testicular cancer head manscap.com/tcs to grab your lawnmower and as always use code tech at checkout for 20% off and free shipping. I see quick bits and the way you look at me, it just feels bits. - Good. - Is that what you were? Is that what you're going for? - Yeah, that's perfect. - Okay. TikTok is taking its position as the defacto culture generator for the youth. A bit more seriously with the announcement of TikTok pulse, a program that will allow creators to earn revenue from ads run alongside their videos. Kind of like how YouTube does creator payouts but set ads will only run on the top 4% of all videos on TikTok, and only creators with at least a hundred thousand followers are eligible. We wish to at extend our heartfelt congratulations to all the E girls. - You earned this. - You really did come on. Samsung liquid and tanzanite Silicon have demoed something called composable memory at the Dell technologies world conference. And it sounds kind of boring, but it's actually a big deal because it could allow servers to create virtual systems on demand, using separate banks of memory, CPUs, storage and more that could then be paired together as needed. Why do you, why do you look bored? Come on, come on. It could be great for machine learning. Fine, fine. We'll do the next story. Who cares? Razer just announced that the company's newest blade 15 will be the world's first laptop with a 240 Hz OLED display. Wow. That's actually kind of interesting. We've had laptops with 300 Hz displays before and OLED laptops, but never both OLED and like, and 240 Hz in the same laptop. So this is really cool, right? Yeah. Not like that last topic. This is making you happy? You primitive simpleton. - Whoa, - Come on. Last year the USB implementers forum released the specification for type C cables that could carry 240 Watts of power. And now they're showing up in the real world, club 3D announced 3, 240 wat rated cables which could conceivably provide enough juice to power an RTX 30, 80 ti quit gaming laptop on their own. - (Man) Woo - They will not however, provide your body with enough juice to power through an all nighter. - Ah - Do not try this. - I already did - You? - Too late - How did it go? - I feel great. - Oh You should probably get that checked. - Nope. - Amazing. I feel so good. - Euphoria is a bad sign sometimes. And watch out SpaceX. There's another rocket booster catching company in town, after delivered a payload of satellites into orbit Rocket Lab successfully caught their parachuting electron booster with a Sikorsky S-92 helicopter. However, the pilot thought the load was a bit concerning and jettison the rocket into the sea, where it was recovered by boat. But the company is still marking the exercise as a success. Since the data gathered here we'll make the next recovery trivial. Now they just need to buy a social platform and they'll be time with SpaceX. - (Man) Same thing. - Same thing maybe by ruvian too, Hmm. Well, that's all the news that we have for today. So, come back on Friday for more, frankly I think it should happen more regularly, but it's all about the Astro MAX these days, hype is super overblown. - (Man) Hey, whoa What about our five cute ones? - Nah, just, just, just gimme.

But what can Intel do to effectively compete against the Ryzen 9 3900X and Ryzen 7 3800X in benchmarks and value?  Its also starting to look like the Ryzen 7 3700X and Ryzen 5 3600X may be two of the best processors of 2019.  Let's discuss all of these Zen 2 CPUs, some of their limitations and how Intel can strike back before the review goes live.

    "transcript": "so it's been a little over a week since AMD showed off their upcoming processors and graphics cards honestly there is just a lot to talk about in fact I've actually covered all of the Navi GPU stuff in a separate video so if you're interested in that link will be right over here but this video is a little bit different from our normal explain series you see we wanted to put a little bit more time into reading all of the information than AMD has bestowed upon us with regards to Zen 2 and the upcoming Ryzen 3000 series processors but the further we got into the information the same question came up over and over again how does this all compare to what Intel has to offer right now and our Intel Desa platforms really in a bunch of trouble so let's just cut through the hype and get into this from a more balanced perspective while I explained some of the finer points of AMD's approach to third-generation Ryzen oh and yeah this video is gonna be a little bit a longer one so definitely make sure to check the comments where x temps will be pinned the first a quick message from our sponsor the master fan series from Coolermaster has now received a fresh new look with a square frame designed to generate high pressure air flow and silent operation the fans feature this beautiful addressable RGB illumination and you can pick it up in 120 240 and 360 millimetre variants learn more in the description down below alright so let's start with the obvious thing about this whole intel versus AMD cpu wars team blue was caught with their pants down when AMD announced Zen now what could even be worrying for Team Blue is that Zen 2 seems to be performing even better than anyone else expected including AMD they initially thought you know of about 7 to 10 percent uplift in instructions per clock or IPC but it's right now hovering around 15 percent but there is more to usually companies have some issues moving to a new manufacturing process like Intel sticking to their 49 meter for about half a decade now since 10 nanometer just wasn't ready but with the new 790 meter technology aimed he has been able to drastically increase density while also cutting power and of course increasing performance per watt also do keep in mind that switching processes usually leads to decreased core frequencies between one generation to the next but somehow AMD was able to avoid all of this and so there are new 7 nanometer basic views will have equal or higher Quincy's than the ones they replace now if Intel was hoping for lower frequencies to offset aim these architectural improvements well they were clearly wrong but I also want to focus a bit on that density point from before because it's gonna be really important in the battle against Intel and it's key point to understanding how aim D can do what they're doing you might have noticed that Lisa sue showed off a Ryzen CPU that looked something like this with two smaller dies alongside one larger one those small course are what AMD calls chip lights and they happen to be the cornerstone of reisen's future remember I said that density matters well each of those little 74 square millimetre chips houses processing cores cache and more meanwhile the larger da you see here is the input output section that houses things like the Infinity fabric memory controllers and device communications dining a bit deeper those complex designs triplets or C CDs are super small but the 7 nanometre manufacturing process allows them to house 2 quad core a threaded Ryzen cores and 32 megabytes of l3 cache now when you add 2 of these C CDs together and you have yourself a CPU with 16 cores and 32 threads while other designs can be created by simply disabling course for example a 12 core part can be created by including 2 core complex designs but disabling 1 quad core section meanwhile an 8 core 16 threat CPU can be done by including just a single one of these shifflet's alongside the cio D but the really cool thing here is that in theory these 8 cores can keep being added or removed to create all kinds of different products now for Intel this could cause a massive challenge since AMD can now use this modular approach to pack as many 7 nanometre cores onto the CPU and this will allow them to launch relatively affordable and efficient CPUs with higher thread counts that could potentially overcome some of intel's most expensive h EDD processors a perfect example of that would be the upcoming Ryzen 9 3950x a 16 core 32 threaded monster that will go for around $750 u.s. I can't imagine the look of horror on Intel spaces when the price was announced since their closest competitor would be the I9 9960x and yes it goes for a ridiculous $1,700 us now the new triplet approach does bring up something a bit concerning and that is heat you see while the Ryzen 3000 series processors seem to be really efficient concentrating heat on multiple cores in a relatively you know small package could cause heat buildup we saw this with Intel when they moved over to stacked 40 nanometer transistors with Broadwell and Indy could face something similar now supposedly AMD's internal testing proves their chips do run cooler than Intel's and results like these thermal images seem to prove that but we will have to test that out ourselves especially when overclocking other than the 1350X I already talked about AMD's line up will have a bunch of other processors starting with the Ryzen 9 3900X which is their first 12 core 24 thread CPU available for the aim for platform at $500 it's the most expensive non-threaded for CPU yet but if you want something less expensive there's the $400 Ryzen 7 3800X and the 330 dollar 3700X the last two processors will follow in the footsteps of the 2700X by offering a course and 16 threads along with higher boost frequencies all of these have TDPS of just 105 watts which is really impressive except the 3700X which is 65 watts rumors are to be believed that will allow it to overclock quite high - one thing that should jump out right away is the fact that the Ryzen 7 3700X costs exactly the same amount as the 2700X when it first launched so AMD isn't charging a premium for their new architecture part of that could be due to how similar the specs are between the 2700X and a 3700X but I really really hope Intel is paying attention here while the more expensive 3rd gen Ryzen processors will probably get a lot of attention or actually more excited about the 12 thread Ryzen 5 3600X and 3600 Ryzen 5's are usually a nice performance per dollar leaders and these newer ones don't look any different remember they're competing price-wise against Intel's six core sixth thread i5 9600k and the 9400 which should be an interesting battle especially when it comes to budget gaming bills here you can pretty clearly see what Intel's likely scrambling right now to get influencers on board and content for their processors out the door when viewing the battle from this perspective there's a lot of reason to believe that AMD will be a dominating player at every price point but there's some areas where AMD may still be a bit weak and Intel can capitalize on that more on that in just a bit something else that I just wanted to highlight are the two new AP use in this lineup the 3400G and the 3200G these are basically updated Raven which ap use which still use the 14 animated manufacturing process and simply bump the clock speed versus last gen 7 nanometre AP use on do out this year so these are simply placeholders alright so I mentioned that in some areas AMD might need improvement you see if you remember with 2nd generation Ryzen processors they tended to lag pretty far behind coffee lake in you know single or life he putted workloads and because of that gaming suffered as well now AMD things that they've addressed that with Zen to when you combine their design enhancements as well as improved clock speed consistency they're supposed to be a 21% increase in single thread performance in a perfect world like Cinebench that is but what about gaming well AMD has also doubled Ryzen 3's level 3 cache sizes and calls a game cache more cache means more information can be stored locally on the processors high-speed memory rather than being dumped on to the slower system memory when you combine that with the fact that sin 2 can hit 30 600 megahertz as an overclocked memory speed there are some big potential framerate boosts but does that mean Intel should be worried yes and no on one hand AMD showed that the Ryzen 9 3900X pretty much matching the 9900K but remember the rides in CPU cost a few bucks more than a 9900K it's good to see them being at an even playing field here and the game seemed cherry-picked as well to show the best in Ryzen what's a bit more concerning is the 3800X versus 9700K benchmarks because they do show Intel leading in a few more cases but by how much well there's no way of telling just remember that all of these benchmarks are at 1080p and if the resolution was increased the gap would reduce by quite a bit due to the GPU being a bottleneck now gaming benchmarks was one of Intel's last safe havens against Ryzen but it looks like AMD is narrowing the gap even further with these new third generation processors now when you look at it overall there doesn't seem to be a clear-cut winner in the whole 3000 series lineup at least against Coffee Lake I mean sure they do look better but a convincing win doesn't look possible yet where Intel will lose and lose big time is in multitrader performance benchmarks AMD can simply offer more cores for less money but there's one thing that we noticed here there is no way AMD enabled Intel's quick sync support for that Adobe premier test since with it on the 9900K would have dominated everywhere else though the wind seems pretty convincing while virtual threats don't scale nearly as well as physical ones in this test we can see that AMD absolutely needs their core count advantage over Intel to win even though that the 3800X has double the thread count as Intel's 9700K it can only edge it out by a maximum of 37% wow that's a huge win given the price of each CPU there are obviously some strong points in Intel's current architecture can they actually build on that well just gonna have to wait and see now another key selling feature of AMD's next generation platform is the x570 chipset in fact if you're interested in learning more about that and the new x570 motherboards yes motherboards super exciting right you can actually check out our in-depth coverage of MSI's offerings right over here but as we kept digging through the information that AMD did provide us some things did come up that were quite concerning with regards to pricing one of the most talked about features of x570 is the PCI 4.0 interface super exciting right now while graphics cards aren't anywhere close to needing the bandwidth it provides storage devices can sure benefit gigabyte corsair and other manufacturers have announced nvme SSDs that can operate and 5 gigabytes per second which is absolutely insane PCI 4.0 also offers a lot more flexibility for devices that need additional bandwidth so X570 boards will have a lot more high in connectivity than either C390 or X470 the problem we see is cost since the price of these motherboards is trending upwards you see PCI Gen 4 twice writing requires upgraded PCBs for signaling strength and many of these standard motherboards actually use workstation technologies so that obviously drives the cost up another thing that's boosting prices is the sheer number of features many of these boards have that's a vote of confidence from the motherboard makers to AMD since they now feel Ryzen is the premium product everyone hoped it would become but finding a lower priced x570 may be a challenge but to me what's really concerning is AMD's more affordable b500 series and a 5 minute series that are nowhere to be found during the last two Ryzen launches both chipsets were detailed right at the start but this time they haven't been mentioned at all now luckily AMD has almost complete backwards compatibility for Ryzen 3000 series processors but there are some limitations if you want a more budget-friendly system around 3rd gen writes and CPUs maybe look for a be 450 motherboard or maybe even an X470 if they go on sale honestly I really think the lack of lower price 500 series motherboards will end up hurting the Ryzen 5 3600X and 3600 more than anyone else could the new Hydra x-series from Corsair is a full water cooling ecosystem with transparent blocks for RGB goodness and built-in flow indicators with soft and heart tubing available and the full array of fittings so you can design the perfect loop for you hide your X by Corsair everything's linked below alright guys so I mean it's time to bring up that question one more time is Intel any spot of trouble in the desktop market the answer to that is yes they probably are you see MD has new CPUs shiny new CPUs power efficient CPUs little bit cores and they also perform very competitively against Intel and they don't cost a lot of money but until the biggest issue is that they don't have a direct answer to AMD these 3rd generation Ryzen processors you see the sunny core architecture isn't ready for desktop yet and even then on notebooks it's only expected to come later in October but then again Intel did vaguely announce that they're gonna come out with new core X processors which I know for a fact are gonna be super expensive then again if you think about it the Ryzen 9 3950X is a direct answer from AMD to that and remember it takes years to build changes into a product roadmap and honestly Intel doesn't have years or even months Zen 2 and some nanometers are here now and Zen 3 with refined 7nm process is coming in 2020 so let's quickly talk about what Intel can do right now lowering their damn high prices would be a great start but sadly they've been completely unwilling to do that in the past first they've got to stop burying their faces in sand and making believe Ryzen doesn't exist AMD and NVIDIA battled it out for years with continual price cuts until their next edition cards already and it would work here - Intel isn't out of the game by a longshot but I think they have stayed calm listened for too long if the Ryzen 3000 series lives up to expectations their entire z390 platform looks like overpriced last gen tech now of course AMD needs to actually deliver on their promises and deliver products to buy on July the 7th but judging from what we've seen so far I think Intel has a much bigger hill to climb so that's it for now guys and I would love to know your thoughts about this whole topic would you still stick to your current system or would you consider switching to 3rd gen Ryzen I mean there's a new platform look appealing to you in fact if you have any questions or concerns with these new CPUs definitely let us know in the comments down below and we'll definitely make sure to check them out during launch day which is July the 7th it's certainly an interesting exciting month for us here at hardwood connects but yeah definitely stay tuned and even retardo connects thank you so much for watching sure to check out some relevant content over here and I'll see you guys hmm there's been a long one in the next one",

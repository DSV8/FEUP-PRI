Lots of details shown including signal strength, radios enabled, MAC address etc.  wifi 6 changes the game: low latency, low delay, 802.11ax apps are here.  This is the year of big changes! 5g and wifi 6 are here!   Learn more here: What Is Wi-Fi 6?  Cisco Access Points:  Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) Solution:  5G or Wi-Fi 6?

    "transcript": "- [Ashutosh] I'm gonna go and augmented reality kicks in (clicks) (bouncy music) here, (pops) (clicks) (chants) (chants) (chants) - [David] So show us about this demo. I mean, what is this demo? It's really, really good. - Yeah, so what I'm gonna show you today is an augmented reality app. - Yep - And the reason we built this is, first of all, with WiFi 6, what we think is gonna happen is we're gonna have a lot of good low latency infrastructure, high bandwidth, and also, not just that. Because of high throughput, because that means you can have more devices connecting to the WiFi. - Yeah - So what that enables is the whole new set of application builders, like AI or RVI. Think about it in retail. You'll be able to go to a retail store and check for prices on the shelves. You want to get coupons, whatever. Those kind of experiences will start coming in. In school or classes, what's gonna happen is more and more education is gonna be more like \"Hey, maybe you wanna experience a war.\" People will be wearing their augmented reality, or mixed reality glasses, and then actually experience the whole war that they're learning about in the textbook. So those kind of experiences will start coming up now. Now what we have done here is we've built an application and this is very specific to WiFi. The main motivation behind this application is I am a field services engineer, and somebody called me and said, \"Hey, the WiFi in this area is not good.\" So typically what happens is this WiFi engineer he will actually go in and start debugging, pull up a couple of things. One is show me the map. Show me what AP's are around me. So what we said is with DNAC, given that it's an open platform, I have API's to access that information, we built an application that would actually help this field services engineer. So basically it has three features: The first feature is about show me the AP's that are around me. So wherever I just walk in, I'll be able to get the AP's that are around me. Now how do we get that information? It's like wired DSSID getting to figure out what AP's are around us, and then go and talk to the NAC and get that information. That's one. There are other tricks that we've played. Like putting QR codes. Doing actually like recognizing a QR code or maybe a unique feature and then showing it on our dashboard. So that was the first feature. The second feature is about locating access points. Now that you're telling me that there are four access points, I wanna know which direction should I be looking towards. So, for example, you can see here it's telling me that AP3 is basically in this direction. If I actually go and look around, I'll actually see AP4 is in that direction. - Oh wow! - And I have a radar view that is telling me that this is the general area where it is right now. Right? And the last thing, which is, now that I've actually found that AP, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna actually use a feature that we call Track the AP. And here, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and augmented reality kicks in here. Now you can see that it was a regular AP over there. And now-- - Oh wow. - it's gonna improve the augmented reality more. Now the first feature that we have here is called Get Me the Static Information of the AP. And given the MAC address of the AP, I can go and create a DNAC and get the information off that AP. So it will give me information like CL number, MAC address, IP address-- - Oh wow. - everything-- - That's really cool. - in one touch. Right? So that's what we call a static information. The second one is basically the dynamic information. So I want to know how many... what channel it's connected on. Tell me whether the four antennas that are there, are they enabled? Because a lot of times, there could be a misconfiguration, where somebody will just turn on two antennas. And they'll say, \"Hey, I was expecting better signal over here.\" So you can see that, and also what other type of SSID's that it is broadcasting, right? So that is the static information. Now the third part, which is pretty cool, is the actual signal strength-- - Oh wow. - of the AP. So what you see here is right now we're in the green. What it tells you is that we're pretty close. Right, obviously. So it's all beautiful. But as we start moving back, what we will see is an actual band of how the signal is actually traversing. - Oh wow. - Okay, so this is a way... Like you could actually be designing or actually you get a feel of how the network or the WiFi signal is traversing in your environment. - So green is good, yeah? - Green is good in this case, yeah. So that way... One of the things... And, in fact, like we are trying to make it even better, so there are different views in this, so, for example, I could actually have a wave view as well. Typically, if you want to see if there are bouncings and all those kind of information. So these are the different kind of waves that we can show. Now, just as I said, this is just a sample application that we built, but I am sure that with Cisco opening up a lot of their API's, it's not just about creativity. It's just a matter of how creative people can get, and start building applications. - That's brilliant! Thanks so much for the demo. I really appreciate it. - No worries at all! - So how do they get this? Is it free on DevNet, or... - We are actually gonna put it out there. So we are still deciding whether it's gonna be a free tool. Maybe it's gonna be something that they need to log in and download it. We're still deciding on that. - [David] But it won't be paid? - It most likely won't be paid. Most likely. Because we want to offer this as a tool that people can use in their environment. - So I'm gonna say this: \"If you think this application is really good, \"and if you want DevNet to make it available, \"then please comment below this video. \"And also register on DevNet. \"Make sure that we let DevNet know \"that you're excited about this \"and that you want it. \"Because, with your feedback, \"hopefully, we can convince them \"to give it to us for free.\" - Awesome! - [David] Really appreciate it! Thanks so much! - No. Thank you! And we ain't got nothing Gotta do something Get it right Gonna keep on running",

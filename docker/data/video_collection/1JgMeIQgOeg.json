    "transcript": "- [Michael Fisher] This video is sponsored by ViewSonic. The Herschel wallet, the Key Smart keychain, the Sesame ring public transit pass. These are just about the only survivors from last time I showed you what's in MrMobile's bag and that means we've got a whole lot of new stuff to look at in the MrMobile Every Day Carry for 2018. (upbeat rock music) For the record folks, with the exception of the fun sponsor spot at the end, all the products in this video are ones I chose of my own volition. Some of them were a surprise even to me. Take these Sony headphones, model number WH-1000XM3. (laughs) Just rolls off the tongue doesn't it? Anyway I was expecting to put these on for two weeks, review 'em and then return to my trusty Bose QC35s, just like I'd done with every other headset this year. But while the Bose headphones are still more comfortable, the Sony's are better in almost every other way. Noise canceling options that let you decide how much sound you let in. Touch controls, USB-C fast charging. The only major letdown on this headset is voice calls and who does those anymore? Stay tuned for the full review if you want a more detailed breakdown but yeah, these are my new go-to for on-ear audio. Maybe the Surface headphones will give 'em a run for their money we'll see. (upbeat rock music) Connected to those cans to connect me to my fam, the Blackberry KEY2. My reasons haven't changed since last year when I carried the KEY1, I like something different, I like long battery life, I'm a nostalgic fool. But over and above all that, this phone managed to re-addict me to physical keys. I'm not faster on this keyboard, I'm not even more accurate, I just find it more satisfying than typing on glass. It's been a while since I mentioned the KEY2 I know, so I'll drop a bonus plus and minus on here. On the bright side, it's aging much better than the KEY1 did. KEY1 was always too slow. On the down side, I've really come to hate the issue first reported by Matt Moniz. The Bluetooth radio on this thing is weak and I almost have to keep the phone in my chest pocket to keep the static out of those Sony's. Now as you now I always carry a second phone mainly for imaging and while the Pixel 3 is by no means a perfect device it does pack the best camera for a YouTuber looking to ditch a bulky gimbal. Now I do shuffle phones a lot, and I find other handsets much more exciting, notably the Huawei Mate 20 Pro which I still prefer for still shots thanks to it's versatility. But the Pixel 3, with it's object tracking focus and insanely good stabilization, well it's just the phone I reach for when I need something that I know is gonna deliver with a minimum of tinkering. Now normally I'd keep those phones linked to a Smart watch but the one I'm really looking forward to is the LG Watch W7. And it's late. For a while I was using the Samsung Galaxy watch which is great but not exactly a style stand-out. I'm still on the waiting list for the month-long Summit 2. So I'm not really wearing a Smart Watch at the moment. In it's place sits a Jack Mason A102 from an old sponsorship I did with Man Outfitters. When I want to go old school I switch over to a Mondaine Pocketwatch I bought myself on a birthday a few years back. Now of course I had to ruin that by teching it up too. So on the other end of that Mondaine chain is one of two of my Google Titan Security Keys. You probably heard about this a month or so ago. It's a physical key. It makes it a lot harder for people to break into your accounts. I'll have more on this in a dedicated video coming soon, but it's changed the way I think about security. Check out Modern Dad's explainer in the meantime. Hey Phil! But MrMobile, I'm sure you're asking. Without a Smart Watch how are you tracking your steps? Well I'm glad you brought that up. The Motiv Ring I reviewed a while back just got an upgrade. Heart rate, step tracking, sleep tracking, all in a tiny ring and now it too can serve as a two factor authentication key for all those times a pocket watch is overkill. Trouble is I wear this ring on the same finger as my Sesame ring so, maybe I should get measured for a pinky-sized version. What do you think? Let me know in the comments. And please subscribe to the MrMobile on YouTube while you're there. Let's do a quick touch and go on the core of my mobile workstation. My main machine continues to be a MacBook Pro. I had to upgrade to the 2018 model because the 2017 needed to get the infamous keyboard repair plus its speakers were blown, USB ports were on the fritz. You know what, it wasn't my favorite machine. But I'm tied to the MacBook Pro because Final Cut Pro is my favorite editing program. When I don't need to use that the 2018 iPad Pro is my favorite tablet. The iPad has been the best tablet you can buy well for years and while Apple ditched the headphone jack this year, the other port change it made from lightening to USB type C it makes up for it. Finally I can charge all of my devices all the ones bigger than a phone, anyway, with one cable. (soft techno music) Speaking of charging in recent months I've been helped up the mountain by this guy. The Sherpa from Goal Zero. It has about the same capacity as my old Anker pack but it comes equipped with an AC inverter so I could plug in devices that don't charge over USB-C. Microsoft if you're watching that's a request. The Sherpa kicks out up to 60 watts and I can even charge wirelessly while I'm charging something else via cable. It's pricey and I wish it had a bigger reservoir but it's a great little power pack and I like it a lot. (soft techno music) Finally we come to the bag that brings it all together. My everyday backpack by Peak Design has gotten a little worn over the months, a few rainstorms, staining the leather, pull tab falling off, some stretch creeping into it's formerly taught lines. But it's still the best looking backpack I've ever used. For those days I travel light, I fall back on the Brenthaven Collins Vertical Messenger Bag the first generation one, I wasn't a big fan of the re-design. (soft techno music) I want to close out on a weirdo, folks. I only occasionally dabble in clothing commentary and no I'm not talking about that Project Jacquard jacket from Google. But stick with me through a sponsor spot and I'll give you a look at the strange piece of apparel you most often ask about in the comments. (soft techno music) But don't tune out, because that sponsor is a perfect fit for a tech roundup like this. This is the ViewSonic M1 and it's an ultra portable projector. That means it's lightweight and compact but still big enough for a bright LED light source that makes for great picture quality. You're right to worry about battery life when we talk bright lights, but don't sweat it. The built-in battery here is good for three hours away from a wall plug. It's also got great speakers built right-in so you don't need to carry extra. And the whole thing is cleverly designed with a 360 degree stand that doubles as a lens cap and you know I love this, a USB-C port for video and power. So it won't be outdated tomorrow. So whether you're looking to stream some YouTube videos or do some easy decorating for the holidays, snap up a ViewSonic M1 at the special link below and thanks to ViewSonic for sponsoring this video. (soft techno music) So that fancy coat I've been rocking from San Fransisco to SoHo, that's the Hacker Jacket from Volante Design whose booths I've been visitng at Pax East for years. Volante makes amazing, if expensive stuff under the brand Superhuman Street wear. And while this isn't quite a Star Trek design, Volante will be launching a jacket under the Star Trek license soon. So stay tuned. Hopefully I'll be able to swing a sample for a look over on the Instagram channel. (soft techno music) Folks I want to hear about your every day carry, hit me up in the comments with stuff you can't leave the house without. And if you wanna know what other folks are packin' in their pockets, I'll give a shoutout to my friend Taylor Martin who runs a site just for this kinda stuff. It's called Best Damn EDC and you can find it at you guessed it bestdamnedc.com. Until next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends.",

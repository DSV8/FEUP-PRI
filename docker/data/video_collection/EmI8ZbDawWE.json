    "transcript": "It's been a while...since I've indulged... in this sweet taste of honeycomb cereal, but NO! This video is not about cereal I was just inspired to bring this in because... ...of today's subject matter. Apparently the honeycomb design is not only important in nature and cereals, apparently it's also very important in the world of... ...BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS. BAAAMMM!!! Innovative Honeycomb design for clean sound. This is something that I was unaware of... apparently, the shape that makes honeycomb taste so great can also be utilized for Bluetooth sound now, they claim outstanding bass! Outstanding bass. and if anybody knows bass, I know bass, so we'll find out if a.... they're telling the truth and if the.... if the honeycomb shape has anything to do with it, I can tell just from the form factor this if its thumps I'll be surprised because it's, you know I've had bigger boom boxes here but then that said that everyone has the space so maybe that's where this fits in. There're all a bit different. One thing I can say for sure is none of them have claimed to this point that their honeycomb shape is the reason they sound good. Let's find out what this thing is all about. The HC-1... ...BLUETOOTH SPEAKER Alright... No, they were not lying that thing... is reminiscent of a honeycomb, actually kinda looks cool nevermind the sound it looks like a piece of art or something says honeycomb on the top. Power, volume, mute, bluetooth play/pause. These nice big rubber feet on the bottom so it's not going to vibrate too much on the surface. A microSD card slot so you can play music straight off of a.. ...SD card. Micro USB and then USB out so you can charge up another device also in the box micro USB, auxiliary cable, power cable some paperwork that i probably will never read and... a power brick. Ok lets see if its got juice Remember the activities? We got a bunch So I just noticed an orange LED maybe it did have power that whole time but I wasn't holding it long enough. Flashing blue. Right above 'Jack' there you can see 'HoneyComb' listed. And... okay. Sweet! here it is moment of truth let's play some tunes as we normally do that you all've been waiting for. \"That you all have been waiting for?\" \"What you have all been waiting for?\" EQ Beats, by the way... Check'em out... Oh, now let's see volume... On my device is max. Now let's do it on the speaker as well. What did I just do? ... Oh! Am I skipping tracks? instead of volume.... No. Oh, I am... But that's skipping tracks. It's not controlling volume.... Might be one of the situation, when volume is controlled by the device. \"The honeycomb\" How they all know what to do. How to work together and do this kinda action. I mean nevermind. You've got BEES nevermind ants.. what's going on there? Kind of frequency of the operating on.. they're bringing food to the Queen who's the Queen? It's happening here.. Ya.... you've to hold it to increase volume Let's see, ya, there you go.. down Well! then... Well! then... ...a little somthin', somethin' for ya... what can i say i mean i don't know I doubt you're picking this thing strictly based on sound quality it's obviously bringing some thing else to the table in terms of design you're either gonna like it or you're going to think it looks strange i think it looks unusual which is good like you know could be a conversation starter like \"Hey, man what's that bluetooth speaker?\"... for what is it sounds pretty decent now the question is how much does it cost I need to look this up. Alright hundred twenty-nine bucks. I might be able to recommend that a hundred twenty-nine this is a very directional sound you're not wasting any sound in an alternative direction but straight out where people might be but if you want to place it in the middle of the room It's going to be far more directional than some of those other products plus maybe you're a mega honey comb fans like the cereal. I know I am...it's always benefit drawback type scenario...affordability, sound, base, volume and so on, but really what this is about is you honeycomb lovers out there those that want to match their bluetooth speaker to their favorite cereal... I see you.",

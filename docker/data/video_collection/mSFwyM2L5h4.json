    "transcript": "[ soft rhythmic music ] [ chime ] [ chime ] [ chiiiiime ] [ oh, another chime ] [ whooshy sound ] [ drums kick in, with some horns ] [ good lord this is getting pretty ambitious ] [ woah, rainbow horns ] [ THIS IS SO CONFIDENT I LOVE IT ] [ and now the video glitches like crazy because CED ] Yeahh things didnt quite go as planned, did they? Welcome to part 2 of our exploration into the CED, RCAs very strange yet still somehow marketed videodisc system which effectively used vinyl records to store up to 2 hours of video. We went over its history and a bit of the context surrounding why RCA was bothering to do this in part one, so if you havent seen that, you may want to consider clicking that clicky thing up there. Anyway, lets get on [ video glitches uncontrollably] [THUD] ...get on with the show. Well begin by taking a closer look at this player, as well as the device that RCA thought was too complicated to manufacture despite the fact that they were selling them already. On a fundamental level, the RCA videodisc player is merely a record player. It has a bit of a funky pickup, as well as an automated tonearm if you will, but its still just a spinning disc with a needle tracking a spiral groove. An insanely tiny groove on an insanely delicate disc, but with the engineering complexities devoted to the disc manufacturing process and not the player, it was thought that it could have perhaps might have been maybe a good idea maybe possibly. As a matter of fact, in an early demonstration of the system, Richard Sonnenfeldt, the Vice President of VideoDisc Operations put it simply; And thats exactly how it panned out. These discs are marvels or precision manufacturing, but the players are mainly just a bunch of off-the-shelf parts. The most complicated bit of the player is how it manages fine tracking control. I briefly showed you the visual search function and explained that an electromagnet can move the stylus with fine control, but I didnt really explore that at all and I should because it is admittedly impressive. Look in the stylus compartment and youll see this pair of little coils. These are controlled by the players electronics in order to move the stylus, either to get it out of a locked groove situation, or to advance or retreat across the discs surface for visual search. Youll also see this little solenoid which can lift the stylus off the surface of the record. And it does a surprisingly good job. With a disc in good condition, the visual search is very fluid. Strikingly so. Way better than any VCR ever managed, and practically as good as the butter-smooth search of a CAV laserdisc. The only thing youll occasionally notice is some screen-tearing since there are multiple frames encoded with each rotation of the disc. But since the concept of screen-tearing was, Im pretty sure, not even a recognized phenomenon in 1981, well who cares? I believe the reason it works so well is precisely because the discs have the synchronization signals hard-coded onto them, and their speed is constant. Even if the stylus skips into the next track mid-frame, it doesnt interrupt the video signal at all because each adjacent track is EXACTLY four frames ahead or behind, down to the precise location on the scanline. So even though it lacks the fine control of a laser-optical system, the effect is exactly the same. Thats pretty much the only impressive thing about how the player works, though. Everything else is cost-optimized as far as possible. Were you looking for a composite video output? NOPE. Too expensive. Ya get RF out only, suckers. As mentioned before, the turntable motor is just a bog-standard AC motor and drives it with a belt, though I should note that later models had a direct-drive turntable that could stop itself in a defined position to allow for a fancier disc loading operation. But more on that later. My favorite cost-cut has to do with the mechanism which moves the stylus carriage. Notice how the function lever engages this felt clutch. When the lever is in the load position, the mechanism which moves the carriage is entirely disengaged. Why? Well, because they used the action of you insterting the caddy to move the carriage back to the start point. Its... a little violent. [ mechanical thunks and clunks of this incredibly refined disc loading system ] Look at that! Its just so inelegant. Just WHAM! You can, with conscious effort, make this not-quite-as-bad if you slowly insert the caddy, but I mean who was gonna bother with that? I will say, though, that if you for some reason are using one of these machines daily, you probably should make that effort. So anyway, once the stylus has been belligerently put back in its place, and you move the lever to play, the clutch re-engages and now the player has control over where the stylus lands. And the first thing it does it bump the carriage forward to hopefully find the start of the disc. Oh, and since I havent yet mentioned it, the disc is read from the outside in, like a normal record, and not from the inside out, like a Laserdisc and the vast vast majority (if not all) of its optical disc offspring. From here, the player just monitors the track signalling to be on the lookout for problems. If the user doesnt press any buttons, its just gonna bump the pickup forward every once in a while as the stylus tracks the disc. If it notices its in a locked groove, it will try to get itself out by kicking the stylus forward with that electromagnet. Unfortunately, as these machines have aged, the felt clutch and the belt on its motor have worn to the point where the carriage itself can get stuck, and the player wasnt programmed with any way to rectify that. This can create the appearance of a badly damaged disc, when in fact its a problem with the player. To get out of this issue, you can use the rapid access buttons to move the carriage backwards, and then use visual search to get back to where you were. Now thats a modern problem related to age, so I doubt it was an issue back in the day. And I want to point out that there is an optical encoder here that the player uses to monitor the carriages movement, but apparently this is only used for the rapid access function, as it barely turns at all under normal operation. Shame they couldnt have made that a little more useful. You may have noticed that the player has a pause button. Well, instead of providing a freeze-frame, that simply blanks the screen. On this television is shows a white screen, but that's the television doing that, not the player. Because there are four frames of video encoded with each rotation, its impossible for the player to provide a real freeze-frame without a frame buffer, and that would certainly not be possible cheaply in 1981. However, there was a mode called page mode which would lock the stylus and force it to read the same four frames over and over again, and it can be activated on this player by holding both the forward and reverse visual search buttons. This mode, though not officially supported with this player, could be used for navigating more advanced interactive discs, but more on that later. Now, weve basically covered everything this player can do. Remember, its goal wasnt to be super exciting or to be particularly advanced. It was trying to be a modified record player, and to that extent - it is. Now lets look at a VCR. This RCA VDT-600 is a Matsushita-built model introduced in 1979. Removing the case reveals right away theres a lot more going on here. Youve got your rotary video head drum. An erase head, an audio head, and a tracking pulse head. Moveable tape-guides are used to thread the tape around the drum. There's a capstan and pinch roller to move the tape across all these heads, which is done at three different speeds with this model. And theres a lightbulb on a stick, which is used to detect when the tape has reached the end by shining a light through the cassette itself, through the clear tape leader, and out these holes on the side. All VHS machines detect the end of the tape optically, thats the reason the ends of the tape are clear, but these really early ones use an incandescent light bulb for the light source, rather than infrared LEDs of newer machines. All of that stuff is just part of the tape transport. I havent even mentioned the electronics which deal with the tapes signals, how tracking is accomplished, the fact that the video heads are coupled through a rotary transformer, or the simple fact that the tape is being helically scanned. If you want to learn more about video tape technology, you can check out this much earlier video of mine, but be warned, its a much earlier video of mine. Anyway, now you can see why RCA thought the videodisc might still make sense. This VCR is horrendously complicated compared to a CED player, and it also lacks some useful features like a real time display or smooth visual search, with this particular VCR not having any sort of visual search function at all. And these things were not cheap to manufacture. The precision required to make the head drum and transport was pushing the limits of mass production at the time, so these machines were sold for outlandish prices, with this particular unit likely retailing for about $1,250, close to $5000 in today's money. Knowing that VCRs were outside the reach of many consumers, and also knowing about how difficult it must be to mass-produce pre-recorded tapes, RCA thought the CED would still have a meaningful place in the market. And they were kinda right, for a while anyway. Remember, both the CED as well as the Laserdisc were pioneers in home video, as although the VCR would eventually become the device youd watch the latest flicks on, at this point in time it was simply too expensive to use $20 blank cassettes, spend a couple hours recording onto them, and sell them for a reasonable price. So, nobody knew how home video would be received. Nobody would know until somebody tried. And you could argue RCAs experiment was the first successful attempt. Although MCA DiscoVision had gotten laserdiscs out earlier, it never got too much traction. RCA seems to have done a better job with licensing content, and while their discs certainly havent held up well over time, early laserdiscs were plagued with issues and a lot of mistakes were made learning to manufacture them. To their credit, though RCA took their sweet time getting this product to market, they did at least iron out all the kinks and release something that actually worked well. In fact, those who bought the players really liked them. They liked them so much that it's no wonder the average purchaser of this player is also buying from 20 to 30 of these discs in the very first year of ownership. That was surprising to RCA, in fact they were selling about twice as many discs per household as they had expected. Their goal of having the system in 50% of American homes by the end of the decade was incredibly optimistic, but they did produce over half a million players, and with the help of other OEMs, a total of about 750,000 players were produced. Still, it was clear early on that things werent going that well. Initially, they only sold about half as many players as anticipated, and the public at large seemed pretty apathetic. I mentioned in my video on Laserdisc that a large part of why it (laserdisc) never really took off was that home video was an entirely new, and completely foreign concept. On the other hand, a VCR which could record shows while youre away, or which could record one show while you watch another, was a true problem-solver. RCA seems to have had better success with convincing the public to take a leap of faith into the land of home video than laserdisc did, but not nearly as much success as they needed. However, they didnt abandon the project right away. They did make some improvements. Notice how this disc has a blue caddy. In the CED ecosystem, blue caddies usually mean the disc is in stereo, and later players were able to decode the stereo sound to be output over RCA jacks. And even on this mono player, you can tell that the sound quality could be quite good depending on the disc. STAR WARS!!!!! But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters! Oh, and some later models did feature composite out, too. The much sleeker 2nd generation players had a semi-automated disc load mechanism, whereby you would only need to insert the caddy about the way in, and it would take it from you, release the spine, and spit the empty caddy back out again for you to remove. Now, I used to have one of those players, and Ill tell you that while its pretty cool, it dramatically slows everything down. Especially disc flips, since you have to wait for the stylus to return to the park position, have the player return the disc to the load position, and then once it finally lets you put the caddy back in, the motorized action prevents you from doing a quick one of these. Sadly, that player never worked right so I got rid of it years ago, but Ive put some links in the description so you can see some of those players in action. Regardless of that little annoyance from the later players, RCA did plan on using the digitally-encoded position signals of the disc to enable things like true random access and discs with chapters. However, that never got far before RCA threw in the towel. In April of 1984, RCA formally abandoned the system, announcing players would no longer be manufactured. The remaining stock of players were sold at steep discounts, and people did buy them because RCA committed to producing discs for three more years. Thats right, RCA was so surprised with how many discs people were buying that they decided, well nobodys buying new players, but at least those who own them are making us some decent money. Unfortunately they didnt make it through to their three year commitment, not only because sales of the new discs started to fall as owners abandoned the format, but also because in a somewhat cruel case of irony, RCA was bought by their original owner, GE, in 1985 and swiftly broken to pieces. What was once a huge company with their hands in the buckets of communications, broadcasting, television, music, and at times even the military industrial complex, was now a bit of quick cash for GE, and a heaping pile of garbage. Although discs did in fact keep getting made for about a year after GEs acquisition, by 1986 the format was officially dead. So. What went wrong? And what could have been had things gone better? Well, fundamentally what went wrong was that the system was delayed, delayed, and delayed further, until finally it was delayed again and subsequently delayed before its final delay happened before its eventual delayed released. RCAs internal target was a 1977 release, though personally I think that might have been a little too late to be truly successful, so lets just imagine they had managed to pull this off in only 11 years and get it out in 1975 In 1975, there were basically no VCRs anywhere. Yeah, there had been these weird experimental things kicking around for a while, and I hear Sonys getting ready to launch this new Betamax system, but you gotta be real dedicated to the idea of recording TV at this stage in the game. And fairly rich. But, here comes RCA with their fantastical videodisc! A player for only $500? And some of my favorite movies available to own for as little as $20? Hmm. That sounds intriguing. The magic of the RCA VideoDisc. A simple, affordable record that, like magic, can bring not just sound, but sound and pictures. Clear, beautiful pictures right into your living room. I would bet good money that if this system was out in 1975, it would have been a big deal. For one thing, in hindsight these discs and caddies are comical compared to a videocassette. But, in 1975 I suppose they wouldnt seem too out of place. Music still comes on these things, and the videodisc is only marginally larger. By the way, Im going to take this opportunity to admire how RCA used a circular theme in most of their artwork to really hammer home that there is in fact a disc in here. I sound sarcastic probably but honestly I love this aesthetic. In 1975, this would have been the only way to turn your television into SelectaVision, and doesnt that just sound neat? Weve never had movies at home! You know what were gonna do? Were gonna bring the magic home with RCA And it will be wonderful. The fact that RCA sold half a million players, and a few millions discs, 4 years after the VCR was pretty well introduced should prove in and of itself that the idea was actually quite sound. So in a world where VCRs just... werent a thing yet this would probably be an extremely compelling product. And, with home video having proven itself before videocassette recorders truly became affordable, many people may have seen little reason to buy a VCR. At least, until they got really cheap. With a robust installed base of, maybe, 10 million units by 1980, blockbuster films in theaters could expect to make another $20 or $30 million after theyre on home video, and you just know movie studios would jump on that bandwagon real quick. With the greater manufacturing capacity financed by this successful system, RCA could start manufacturing more niche content like television shows, and maybe third-parties would get into making their own discs, and oh god this is horrible! If RCA had succeeded here, and everyone was selling their content to be owned on videodisc, would the VCR have been outlawed? You might recall that there was a supreme court case on whether videocassette recorders violated copyright law, and we in no small part have this wonderful man [to thank, but Alec didn't say those words for some reason] for settling that with with an emphatic \"no\". Yes I know this disc is in horrible shape, but come on, Im not gonna pass up an attempt to use this picture of Mr. Rogers on a videodisc, I mean duh. That case was settled in 1984, when it was clear that the CED was a disaster. But if CEDs had become successful, and everyone from television studios to independent filmmakers was putting their stuff on CED, then suddenly the case against time-shifting becomes a lot stronger. Of course you cant tape your own TV shows, since NBC is gonna release that season next October. That would be infringing on their ability to make a profit, and we cannot have that oh no. As a matter of fact, movie studios kept on lobbying for some sort of legislative action from Congress making time-shifting illegal, and the fact that they were making serious money from rentals and home video sales is cited as one of the main reasons Congress basically said buzz off. Though, to be fair, requesting that you buzz off seems to be Congresss default strategy these days. That horrible hypothetical aside, a 1975 release would also have beaten Discovision to market, and I have a feeling Philips and MCA would just give up were that to have happened. See, though the existence of laserdisc was, I don't think, really hurtful to the CED, confusion between the two standards was definitely a thing, so having just one videodisc on the market would further help RCA. And, RCA didnt repeat Sonys mistake and be real stingy with the licensing of their tech. They were open to third party OEMs getting involved, in fact Hitachi, Sanyo, and Toshiba all manufactured third-party players, so its unlikely there would have been a VHS of discs to unseat RCAs CED. Now, of course, RCA didnt manage to get their product out in 1975. But they still thought it would be worth trying. Their thought that the cheap-to-make discs and inexpensive player would be a good value compared to a VCR wasnt wrong. But they fundamentally misjudged something about the home video market. RCA basically forgot about the concept of rental. OK, \"forgot\" isnt quite fair, but their research led them to believe that people would prefer to own a movie than rent a movie, and with that stuck in their heads, VCRs could never make sense. But of course, for the VCR, rentals were a perfect two birds one stone scenario. Pre-recorded VHS tapes are expensive and time-consuming to manufacture, sure, but if youre renting them, well youre spreading its use out between 10 or 20 people. And of course, that means you only need a tenth or a twentieth the number of tapes as you would if people were buying them, so tape duplication facilities don't need to be huge. Really, this was the one thing that RCA failed to imagine. Their product essentially relied on economies of scale and people wanting to buy their movies, and lots of them. That would in fact get expensive real quickly if you were buying pre-recorded VHS cassettes. But with a VCR, you could not only just pop down to your corner video store, and pay something like $5 to borrow a movie for the night, but you could also record TV while you were away. And once people started getting into that groove, they werent interested in RCAs. God I love puns. Well. I didnt think I was going to end up making three videos about this format but it looks like I am. Before I end this one, though, have you noticed something about the CED? Those of you who know a thing or two about Laserdiscs will know that they come in two flavors, CAV and CLV. CAV discs only held 30 minutes per side, but CLV discs could hold an hour by slowing the rotational speed of the disc as it played, making use of a discs geometry. Well? CEDs are CAV! They spin at a constant speed of 450 RPM. And yet, they hold an hour per side. If RCA had said, you know what? Were gonna make the players a bit more expensive by using a variable-speed motor, but at the same time well get 2 hours of video on each side, I think that might have made the format work. They had incredible information density on these discs, but wasted a lot of potential by using a constant rotational speed. If they figured out constant linear velocity, two disc titles would essentially be eliminated, and most movies wouldnt even need a flip in the middle! Double-feature specials could be sold, two classic films for $20! And, had television shows started to be released on CED, an entire season could fit across just 4 discs, with bonus footage! Look, its a little late, but if I had a time machine I might just whisper some thoughts into somebodys ears. For now, I hope you enjoyed part 2. I think its safe to say that had RCA just timed this a little better, the CED wouldnt have failed. And I also think its a fair bet that had that happened, our media landscape would be quite different. Maybe VCRs wouldnt be illegal, but you can bet that the home video scene would look nothing like it does today. Well, streaming is king today, so make that But you can bet that the home video scene of the 1980s and into the 2000s would look nothing like it does today. In the third and (probably) final part, well look at why RCA couldnt get this product out in time. It turns out that story is a lot more involved than at first you might think. Im waiting on materials to arrive, so I may do something entirely different next, but be sure to subscribe if you havent already so you wont miss part 3. As always, Id like to thank all of the wonderful people supporting this channel through Patreon, with special thanks going to the fine folks scrolling up your screen.

Thanks for your consideration, and Ill see you next time! regrettably smooth jazz ...and that would certainly nuh bu baa buh buh buh You may have noticed that the player has a pause button, well. There was a noise. Over there. Cool. ...clear tape leader, and out these holes on the sides of the woah! I skipped some words! The discs are marvels of pre oh yeah. Hang on. This is going so incredibly well. So well. Cause weve planned this all out. Definitely didnt rush anything. Arrgh. Come on. Come on. Be a good little defeat device. [click] Thank you. Look at that, its just so [gestures and flails really oddly] No. And also knowing about how difficult it must be - this is a very loud rattly cassette.",

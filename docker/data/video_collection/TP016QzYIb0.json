    "description": "This video is sponsored by IBM  Check out what I call, Watson basketball. This robotic ball, the Sphero, was programmed specifically for me and is using IBM Watson, which is a technology that understands all forms of data and reasons and learns at scale. With Watson, you can use language, vision, speech and data insight APIs to add cognitive functionality to your application or service. Watson is available on IBM Bluemix, an open source environment that helps you quickly and easily create, deploy, and manage applications on the cloud. In this case, the Sphero was programmed to be a basketball player, and using Watson technology, it can respond to a variety of basketball commands through changes in movement and color.  Watson APIs used in this demo:  Speech to Text:   Conversation:   Text to Speech:   Tone Analyzer:   Learn more about IBM Watson:   FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

    "transcript": "Whoa. You guys have seen this before. Its called a Sphero. Works with this cool app, you drive it around. You can go off jumps, play games, but believe it or not, this thing is more sophisticated than it looks and today were going to test that out. I have teamed up with IBM for this video. Were going to be using Watson to take this Sphero to the next level. Now many of you know I am a Toronto Raptors fan and the Raptors actually use this Watson tech to do player evaluations and make decisions based on data, so were going to carry forward with that basketball theme and were going to play Watson basketball with the Sphero. The table, as you can tell, is now a basketball court. Thankfully, Jack is somewhat artistic here. This little Sphero is about to become a basketball player. How exciting is that? Through the power of Watson, the Watson API, weve got an application that means hes going to interpret my commands as if Im his coach and then react like a player. Maybe even experience what victory feels like. Now obviously this is not what the Toronto Raptors are doing. Actually, I dont know. Maybe this is exactly how they make their decisions. Probably not, no. theyre doing far more sophisticated stuff crunching data. Theyre using Watson APIs in order to determine sentiments surrounding a particular player to look at stats and crunch it all down, so they can make better, more informed decisions. The various instructions result in different behavior for the Sphero. For example, certain instructions will result in him changing color whereas other ones will result in certain actions. Lets get the game started with, of course, an important component in basketball the tipoff. Watch this. Tip off. I got this. Lets get the possession early on. You saw him turn green. You heard the response. Interpreted that language. Games now started. I need to tell him to make a move on the fast break. Lets try this out. Fast break. On it. They wont know what hit them. Look at that. Moves right over to the offensive zone, okay. Hes down over here, but whats the next move? What about defense? Youve got to come back every so often. Youre trying to be a two-way player. Alright, Sphero, play some defense, please. Yes, Coach. Tracking back now. Oh, you see the way that happened? Right to the rim, he was tracking the whole time. Youve got to keep the shoulders in front. Thats a tip for you kids out there. Eyes on the chest, never mind the ball. You dont want to get crossed up. Alright, Sphero, the other team sent the ball out of bounds. Please head down there and inbound it for us. Turnover. Time to go on the attack. Whoo-hoo, he jumped straight out of bounds. The cool thing here is its actually pretty sophisticated, so even if you dont necessarily phrase things in an exact way, there are key words that are picked up as reference points. The Sphero can still interpret what action it is that youre looking for. Something I want to mention at this point as well is that this app is browser-based, so theoretically it could run on a laptop, tablet, an iPad, an iPhone. I told you how in professional cases like the Toronto Raptors, there could be some sort of sentiment analysis tracking social media in order to interpret whats being said about a particular player. Okay, Sphero, job well done. You won the game. Its time to celebrate the victory. Wahoo. Knew we would win with you as our coach. Thats right, Coach Lew. Maybe Ive got a future in this. Look at him dancing around, turning red and if the Watson API is picking that up as sentiment off social media, Spheros going to celebrate, so please send your tweets, #victory. What you just witnessed was three separate Watson APIs in action. First, speech-to-text, thats me speaking to the Sphero. A conversation API allows the application to understand what Im saying and then respond. The text-to-speech API actually converts text from the app into speech, so then I can hear what the app has to say rather than reading the screen. Truthfully, were just scratching the surface. This stuff is used at all kinds of different companies. Its even used for music recommendations. If you want to check it out for yourself, theres a link in the description.

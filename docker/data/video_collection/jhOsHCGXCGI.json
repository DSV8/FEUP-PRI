    "transcript": "- Do we go to one? - I think. - [Justine] Or out the door? Oh, is this? Where does the other door go? We are off on a mission today. There is a Luigi's Mansion installment here that Nintendo's putting on. So, they invited Jenna and I and we were at a previous shoot, so we have Matte. I don't think it's like, dog friendly, but we had to bring him, because we had him with us already. Coming to to downtown is like an event. Downtown - [Jenna] Yeah, pee on that, yeah dude. - I don't know man. Whoa, this is so neat. There's cool little gargoyles and stuff set up. Oh, look, look how spooky. (laughing) - [Jenna] It is spooky. - This is something that I never thought would ever happen. Not only are we in Luigi's mansion, but Mattie is in the mansion. Mattie, should we go get a picture? (upbeat music) - Do you have reservations today? - Of course, yes. - Let me lead you to your room. - Okay. - Right this way. I do apologize, we're having a bit of a ghost infestation. It's not a good thing. - We've got to hold our pup. - You've got to hold your pup. (Justine laughing) - [Justine] This is do cool. - I can't put you down because you'll pee on this. - He would, yes, he would potty on the plants. This is so cool. - Did you see Luigi in here? - Yes. - Oh my gosh. - Because Luigi can get through the bars, you know. He's made of goo. - Jealous. - I know, right. - [Jenna] Do you wanna see Luigi? - [Justine] Super spooky. - [Man] I think you're over here. - We're inside now, Mattie made it inside. There's all kinds of little game stations set up. There's a library over here, for Nintendo Switch Lite where you can play some multiplayer. They've got snacks, Jenna snacks. - I think I smell french fries. - Let's go check out the snacks first. Spooky popcorn. There's a spooky mac and cheese, I'm going to get this for Jenna. (upbeat music) Well, I think I'm now, officially, a ghost hunter. This is so cool. I've got leaves in my shoes now. Mattie, you scared? It's okay, Mattie, I'm taking care of business with the ghosts. This is where we are right now. Look, here, this is it, no way. This looks great. (upbeat Halloween music) - Mattie, do you want a mac and cheese, a little noodle? - That was my fork, but. - Mattie is living his best life. (upbeat Halloween music) All right Mattie, it's time to go. Okay, were heading out, we had so much fun here at Luigi's Mansion popup, this is incredible. I cannot wait to play the game. It'll be out very, very soon, October 31st they say. Yes, October 31st, Halloween. Happy Halloween to me. Okay, Mattie, let's go bud. (upbeat Halloween music)",

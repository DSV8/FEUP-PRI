    "transcript": "BUT YOUR NOT HAVING ANY ISSUES NO JUST LOOK AT THE LENS YOUR'E A PROFESSIONAL IM A PRO. I DO THIS. WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE TODAY? WE'RE BEING PROS. **Laughing** WHAT'S UP GUYS LEW HERE BACK WITH ANOTHER VIDEO AND TODAY AS YOU CAN TELL THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT SOMETHING SEEMS STRANGE HERE... WHAT'S GOING ON? I'M DOM BIG DOM. DOM ESPOSITO MISTER PURPLE -MISTER PURPLE DOM'S A FRIEND OF MINE and.... he's a youtuber - youtube.com/don -there you go happens to be visiting my home town and so we decided why not do the youtube thing and collaborate on a little piece of content for you guys we have the new nexus devices nexus for the first time we have two nexus devices launching at the very same time closer to me here we have the Nexus 6P And Don in your hand - Nexus 5X These are some skins from our good friends at DBrand. A new style, this is called Copper And as you can tell it has got a cool texture to it and color Take it to the Nexus level But the point of this video to sort of look at the benefits and drawbacks of each of these two devices Which one should you buy? Yeah! Go ahead and sell the people the 5X Budget phone. It's under 400$ Got a 5.2inch HD display, 1080p got a nice 12.3 megapixel camera on the back I mean if we're comparing to the nexus 5 better big step in a rolling rack obviously got a plastic build but we do have the laser autofocus like you know you have with a lot of other LG phones that are out there competitors for this device may be a moto x you got your Moto X pure there is something about nexus in the Google Experience the way that it was intended when you boot one of these devices up man is it clean but maybe the nexus terminology is going up market a little bit starting with this 5x and then being fully realized in this 6p. you know you got your like 380 and your 500 and different processor set up two gigs of RAM, Snapdragon 808 way. 3 gigs of RAM, Snapdragon 810 so there's you know there's some differences there but overall I mean you really can't beat this if you're a purist you didn't talk yet about the fingerprint sensor but you have actually been using this 5x for a little while so I mean you can give some feedback and fingerprint sensor it's you know right where your finger would rest and I were just holding the phone my finger just goes right to that spot and it's very fast i mean it does work exceptionally well for what you asked this one is at least a hundred dollars more than this one yeah what do you get in this one makes it so much better yeah then just going with the budget option you're getting kind of a feel here up construction that is more in line with the other flagships on the market weight can actually add sort of a feel of presence of quality whether it's legit or not now if you are somebody with dainty little pods maybe you're a hobbit then you you need to take that into consideration but of course bigger screen means a greater sort of consumption experience when you are watching video it almost always means a bigger battery as well you're getting close to 3,500 milliamp hours at 3450 with a six inch display a higher resolution and this other one over here is 2700 yeah that's 3450 yea yea big difference a big difference when I turn this on oh that's an amoled display I could just tell like just based on the colors right the richness of the colors I think to a large percentage of people you show them an AMOLED display they are like oh that looks better it's hard to go back yeah on the front of the device the fact that we have stereo speakers it was not on this guy now you might you might look at me being in your you see you with the design of the 5x is deceiving you only you only the bottom on the 5x is actually a speaker. the forward facing camera yeah you got a 8-megapixel vs 5 so you've got a little bit more res. cameras i know you touched on this very similar we were doing some test shots prior to coming in here and recording they are pretty damn close it is not a major differentiating factor on the both of these what is the the main consideration here when it comes to a person making a decision they know they want a nexus but they don't know which one well first of all how much money do you want to spend yeah it's important to know going into it second you know I i hate to say it but this one is made by LG this one is made by Huawei how many people have heard of LG vs. how many people have heard of Huawei to really get the consideration for sure i would say it's hard to pass this up for what it is yep but i'm a built guy really i'm a build . okay I mean I like the build all right you know it seems that especially looking at some of those old Nexus devices they keep getting bigger things that keep scaling and they keep accelerating the rate of scaling when considering the size of your device you need to think about how you use it. size-wise they're pretty close but they're not they're not because this is on the fringe of one-handed use look at this i mean i can reach with my hand the top corner of the screen makes a big difference i couldn't do it on the other one without making major adjustments with my hand that's nothing about the big the big fella see that you drop them yeah there's later they're just a little bit more awkward especially in one hand I think this guy here is right on that fringe of usability and consumption yeah and when we took out that nexus 5 earlier yeah hold the nexus 5 feels great confidence confidence in one hand butter I personally will prefer to see premium build materials in a slightly smaller form factor that why why then come and and and one of the things that's unfortunate is it seems that the flagship if as it were is only a thing that comes in a in a larger form factor so I'm going to pick the opposite you said the 6p with for you i'm gonna say save your hundred and twenty bucks and get the 5x to keep it Nexus this is as pure as it gets this is as pure as the driven snow as they once said in a famous movie pure heart do you know what movie and talking about no never mind i hope you guys enjoyed this video big thanks to dom for jumping on this collaboration big shout out to DBrand for hooking these devices up and putting some really cool skins on them if you enjoyed this content make

together get your nexus on hotline bling ya like like Drake then later guys",

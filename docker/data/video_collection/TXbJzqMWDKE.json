    "description": "Every phone is filming in 4K. The settings are on automatic, and I am using the stock camera apps on each phone. They are all mounted to the same stabilizing rig, that holds all the cameras equally.  Today we are testing the Galaxy S7 Edge, the iPhone 6s Plus, the LG G5, and the latest windows phone: the Lumia 950XL.  Camera quality is improving faster than screen technology can keep up with.  It is a good thing though.  More pixels to work with, means that video editors can accomplish more things with the extra real estate.   Which 4K camera do you think performed the best?  The Galaxy S7 Edge? iPhone 6s Plus? LGG5? or maybe the Lumia 950XL?  I know what I think! I voted in the video poll!

    "transcript": "Today we are doing a camera test between the Galaxy S7 Edge, The LGG5, the iPhone 6s Plus, and the Lumia 950XL. The Best course of action is to make this video full screen, for your complete viewing pleasure. Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to decide which of these flagship smartphones has the best video camera. Let me know which camera you think is best in the comments of this video. I will leave a poll question at the end of the video, so you can vote there as well. Looking at color quality; which phone is more vibrant. Image stabilization, white balance, and clarity. All of these phones are currently filming in 4K with the stock camera apps, on auto settings, and all of them are mounted to the same stabilizing rig to hold them equally at the same time. All of these phones have OIS image stabilizing. So the camera itself is moving around inside of the phone like a little gimbal to stabilize the camera while the phone is filming. But none of the cameras are created equal. So its important to compare the different cameras and see which one you like best before buying an expensive phone. I don't want you spending money on a camera you don't like! My channel is dedicated to reviewing tech from the inside. And comparing the quality of different phones side by side. I have plenty of other camera tests on my channel very similar to this one. I initially uploaded this video at the full resolution of 8K to YouTube... but it turns out that they ended the beta 8K upload period, and this video just sat processing for the last 40 days. So here we are, back at it again with the 4K. Hit that thumbs up button if you enjoyed this test, and hit that subscribe button for more videos like this in the future. Let me know what you think! Do you like 'side by side' comparisons? or do you like seeing four cameras at the same time? I show all my behind the scenes stuff over on Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat, all @ZacksJerryRig And dont forget to answer that poll question in the upper corner. Thanks for watchin'! Hope to see you around.",

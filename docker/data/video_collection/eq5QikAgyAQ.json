    "transcript": "- This is the greatest gaming mouse in history. If Razer is to be believed, spoiler alert they usually aren't, huh? The Viper Mini Signature Edition. This is the gaming mouse that Razer came up with the design philosophy of price does not matter. Let's take out the outer box. We get our beautiful little what I'm assuming is vegan leather box. We got a little message from co-founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan, your gaming math. Oh, I went the wrong way. Oh no. Wow, look at me. Professional unboxing. It's locked again. Wow, that is a nice hinge. If we're rating boxes, this is up there. We have the actual mouse. We will talk about this but first let's just finish the unboxing. Wow, it's got this little custom foam piece. It's almost felt like, so it feels extra premium. It's got a little nameplate signature edition. This is 902 of 1337. If you don't know what that is, there's no helping you. Next we have all our documentation, all the the features. Oh, multilingual. Oh, they hid the Razer stickers. Are they ashamed? Are like it's two premium for stickers, but here they are. Here I am chilling. We have, ooh, nice little microfiber cloth. Interesting, it's like more texture than I'm used to microfiber like it almost is reminiscent of a leather look. We have alcohol prep pad and then we have some grip tape which I actually have learned to appreciate on honeycomb mics. We will talk about the body more in a bit but I'm not a huge fan of like touching this weird shape. It feels inconsistent on my hand. It's definitely a preference thing. I know a lot of people don't really care but I like putting the grip tape on so it kind of closes it off and gives the impression of a closed bodied mouse. Oh, oh. The folio goes further and this is something that's very cool. You get a choice of PTFE mouse feet or glass mouse feets and they are gorilla glass three so they're very, very durable. I've never personally used glass skates on a mouse, but I've heard it's supposed to be theoretically a smoother experience. Back to the box, we have our USB type C cable that is braided. Razer does do a great job with their cabling on both their wired mycin, their accessories. They always feel premium. They've paid for the right to use a different color than the USB standard. The green always a nice little touch even on the type C side, a lot of devices these days are coming with type C to type C cables. I think for phones that makes a lot of sense but I prefer type A to C on a PC accessory mostly because I have a lot more type A ports on my computer and I'm someone that, even though I know using a hub for your dongle for your mouse and keyboard doesn't theoretically make a difference, I just don't believe it. I feel like somewhere sometime I'm gonna be trying to click ahead and there's just gonna be some handshake somewhere that happens that slows it down by 0.1 millisecond and you know that's gonna be the difference. Not my skill level. I appreciate having type A to C for my mice still. This mouse actually comes with a really cool little accessory although it's really poorly branded and so maybe they're just tricking me. This is the hyper polling wireless dongle. So they sell this as a separate accessory. This is the one that's specifically made for this mouse and it's supposed to be up to 4,000 hertz polling rate, which is pretty neat. That's something that Razer has been pushing for a bit. You know the 8K wired mice but they now sell this as a separate device. The 4K one that works with I think three of their more modern mice, but this one as it is their premium price is no object mouse. They include it with this one. One thing that's important to note is that this is made specifically with this mouse in mind. It can't be unpaired compared to another mouse and you can't use the separate version on this. I'd imagine Razer has a replacement program that you can do 'cause that would suck if they don't, Logitech does. So that's it for the unboxing part. Let's do an exploration of the mouse. First impression is, wow this is a light mouse that's due primarily to three things. You know, it's a smaller mouse, it's a mini it has the honeycomb shape, but what's kind of unique to this mouse is it's magnesium alloy body. Most mice, there's some formula of proprietary plastics or rubber, this is magnesium alloy. That's the stuff they make premium laptops out of. Magnesium alloy is light, it's premium feeling and it's durable, to scratches and stuff. But it's actually one of the more corrosive alloys that exists. It's usually corroded by the wrong type of screws. But I don't know if there's that many devices that are magnesium alloy that are in constant contact with my disgusting oily hands. It remains to be seen. This is a very new product. If you know finger grease is gonna mess this bad boy up, but as it is, it looks stunning. Let's just, why did that add a sound? It has its own sound. My sound's better though. I don't know if you can see, but there's a difference in texture between the magnesium alloy sides and top and the plastic bottom. That's a compromise that makes a lot of sense. It's probably a cost saving measure. Plastic's still very light, but the structural rigidity of the magnesium alloy is quite impressive. It's thin and you know the honey comb shape that's a lot of comb for your honey baby and it feels solid. Like I've held closed bodied mice that have felt much less rigid. This is quite impressive. It comes with switches that are rated for 90 million clicks which is very high. Often like Logitech mice, they've come with 20 million. I've seen 50 million very commonly. They're not hot swappable like the ROG ones are which is fine. That's not a super common feature. Even though this is a Mini mouse, it doesn't feel tiny in the hands. I've held some that with my hybrid grip just feel off and this my palm doesn't immediately want to land on it, but it's not hard to imagine just adjusting my grip a tiny bit. So for claw, this is totally a good mouse. For hybrid it's there for palm, it fits pretty comfortably. Even palm grip, this is a well thought out mouse. It's slightly smaller than a G PRO X, feels like it was designed with a hand in mind not just theoretical weight elimination. Speaking of weight, this thing is 49 grams according to Razer. Let's find out. 50 grams, that's close enough to 49 grams for me. This mouse is designed with competitive shooters in mind both the weight reduction but also the amount of buttons on it. It has the two primary buttons the scroll will with the click and two side buttons. My first impression is that they're quite thoughtfully placed. My thumb rests naturally on them and it's pretty easy to press both. I feel like the buttons aren't separated enough from the body that I would quite easily lose track of which button I'm pressing and you know if my thumb's resting on the button or not. In the heat of a moment, it's not a bad placement but I wish the buttons were just slightly more pronounced. On the bottom we have the pre-installed skates. We have our power and DPI button. I don't love that it's a power hole. I would prefer that it was a toggle. Again, weight reduction, but in the center they're hiding their Focus Pro 30K Optical Sensor. Razer touts three big features with the sensor. No asymmetric cutoff. You can customize at what distance it's doing the liftoff sensor smart tracking which seems a little weird to me. It keeps track of what material it's on and changes some settings so that it tracks better on different settings. And then motion sync, which I think is just a Razer gobbly gook where they apparently tune the rate at which they're sending signal to the computer so that the computer can best accept it. And you know there's fewer moments of input lag. That all being said on paper, this mouse sounds absolutely fantastic. I can't wait to plug it in and test it out after I tell you about our sponsor. War Thunder. War Thunder is a very comprehensive vehicle combat game. It's free to play with cross play across a variety of platforms. There are over 2000 historically accurate aircraft, ships and planes to pilot ranging from 1920s all the way to today. Every vehicle is modeled down to individual components for highly immersive combat. See the damage on your vehicle, not on your health bar with War Thunder's damage x-ray system. Check the link below and start playing for free. You'll also receive premium vehicles boosters and more. Pairing the most was quite easy. I plugged in the dongle, held the power button and a green LED turned on to indicate that the mouse was paired and Bob's uncle, you're gone. Let's open up Razer Synapse Razer Cortex. Why do you have so many apps? Razer, I don't even want one. Well, and also change the naming scheme but how am I supposed to know which one is the control? Synapse, Cortex like yeah they're all brains. It's cool like for an app, I get it. But moving around the pre-installed PTFE skates are very smooth. What I would do is I would keep these on until they wore out and then switch 'em out after. No need to waste perfectly good skates. Having it plugged in brings my attention to the fact that there is no RGB. I'm totally okay with that. I don't want any of my battery life wasted but that's a preference thing. Speaking of battery, they say that this thing can do 60 hours of battery depending on your polling rate. So I'm guessing that's, if you said it to 125 you're gonna get the full 60. Once we're finally past all the bull (beep) We get our customization screens so you can customize what each button does. That's neat. You can save different profiles you can change what the indicator LED does. So connection status, battery status, basically it's your battery indicator and you can turn that off have it be just is your mouse connected? I don't see any reason for that or it's off, but it'll display a blinking red when your mouse needs charging. I think that's a nice little control feature. We have control of our sensitivity. I'm an 800 DPI guy. You can change even the number of stages. That's actually neat. I usually, with my mice I'll set two DPIs just so if I need it for a specific game. Some games have weird sensitivity ratings so I'll have like an alternate one for a game that'll just go back to 800 if I'm playing regular competitive shooter. And then here, confirmation that this is 4K right here we can go up to 4,000 kilohertz polling rate or four, sorry it's not kilohertz. That would be 4 million. I apologize, previous David misspoke. Here's where you can control your smart tracking. Set a single cutoff point for your preferred distance regardless of the surface placed on, I am not going to change that. The asymmetric cutoff just means that you can change the distance from liftoff and landing. The defaults are gonna be fine. Neat that you can change it. And then you have your wireless power savings so you can set the length of time before it goes to sleep. There's also the low power mode which you can set a percentage battery, it'll go. But if I'm using the 2000 or the 4,000 hertz polling rate, that is not available. Excellent, we're gonna pop into some Aim Lab. I'm gonna see if I can shoot these C4s outta the air with this little beast. First impression, the tracking is perfect. This is not the first mouse you use at sensor. The smoothest, no, the skates are quite good. This is a very smooth experience. Immediately yeah, my hand found its comfortable position. I'm finding that my limitations are my own, not this mouse. This is a very good experience. If I squeezed out of anger, I'd be good. If I slammed out of anger, I feel like it's feeling pretty rock solid. But I'm very curious about the glass skate. So let's switch those out and see if I can tell the difference. This feels like such a shame to peel off these feet. It doesn't feel like I'd be able to reuse them. Like my nails kind of going into 'em. Oh yeah, they're dead. That's real smooth. I can't tell if that's because I'm hyper aware of is is this a smoother experience or if it's actually smoother. But that feels very good, very premium. Even if I press harder, it's moving along pretty well. I almost feel like I'm hyper aware of the flaws in this well loved desk pad. It was perfect at launch, lttstore.com. I don't often like Razer products so I gotta give credit where credit is due. This feels very nice, this feels very premium, not luxury it's still a gaming product but I don't perceive any specific weak points. Whereas normally when I pick up like a Viper Ultimate there's the grip on the side that plastic feels cheap or there's like a little squeeze somewhere. This on first inspection, this is a pretty flawless product. QC remains to be seen, longevity remains to be seen. Those concerns aside, this has a three-year warranty which is pretty good. But as far as unboxings go, this Razer mouse is really impressive and it better be, this thing costs $280. That ain't cheap. At that price, you could buy two G PRO X Super lights and to be fair they can justify the price by 4K dongle, magnesium alloy, even lighter than a Gpro X. It feels, looks great. It plays great, but $280 for a mouse, that is kind of a hard pill to swallow. Yeah, there's some Starlight mice that are getting close to that but they're all like special editions, beautiful mice. I think that if Razer wants to justify that price they might have to bring some of their customization features from some of their other mice and let you personalize this mouse or make some, signature, signature editions. But all in all, I can't say that it's not worth the $280. I know it's expensive. I know that's a really premium price and trust me I probably can't afford it myself. But this mouse feels like $280 and I'm beyond impressed and totally taken back that Razer has managed to make a product that I really want. Thank you so much for watching Short Circuit.

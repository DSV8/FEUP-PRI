    "description": "The HyperX Quadcast is one of the most anticipated USB streaming microphones announced in the last year.  At $140 it isn't cheap but as you'll hear in this review the sound quality produced by this mic is pretty epic, even when compared against the Blue Yeti series.

    "transcript": "there's a time and place for you to hear my voice but I know you're here for the bureau so let that resume at last this is the HyperX quadcast I'll write you people so the HyperX quadcast has received a lot of height because of its looks and I think it is one of the better-looking microphones to have come out from a gaming company even though it's not necessarily a gaming microphone it is targeted towards streamers so kind of like a two-in-one but in terms of sound quality thing is great feature set is fantastic but at $139 is it worth it so I have a few microphones around and particularly the blue Yeti and the blue Yeti Nano we'll see how it compares in terms of sound quality towards those and also many other gaming headsets and their microphones to see if this thing you know is worth your time let's begin by the way all the microphones will be linked in the description below thank you very much alright so let me get a few things out of the way first this is not an RGB microphone it is red and black only keeping to the true color scheme of the HyperX branding you know the red string on the shock mount and that beautiful soft ambient red illumination inside the honeycomb mesh now the thing is you cannot turn off the illumination unless you mute the microphone so that is a good visual indication when the microphone is off by lightly tapping at the top right here very nice implementation there is no popping sound when it is muted I mean when it comes back up so I love that but how cool would it be to have a black microphone with RGB illumination I think that is the next step for HyperX for sure now the mesh built-in inside the honeycomb is a built-in pop filter so if you're recording on an angle like I am doing now you'll avoid any pops however it's not like a super nice pop filter so if you are actually breathing into the microphone your wind will be picked up the microphone capsule here is metal and the whole contraption is pretty light with a slightly heavier base to have stability and despite the shock mount I think that's more of a visual thing because anywhere you touch on the microphone all the handling noise will be picked up unfortunately at the bottom of the microphone we have our gain control so you could adjust that on-the-fly it's super smooth but there's no way to lock it and you could accidentally brush against the bottom of the microphone if you're like reaching somewhere and change your game so for example if I want to be slightly further back and increase my gain all the way to 100% as I can see my levels are almost peaking or if I want to come in a bit closer and reduce it if you want to be come a little bit more intimate how you that's creepy and because of the name we have for recording patterns to the back so stereo bi-directional cardioid and omnidirectional so cardioid is my favorite pattern to use for voiceovers it's pretty much what I keep all my microphones on but the other modes are pretty good if you want to podcasting if you want to have the stereo output and if you want to just have the omnidirectional which records everything right now for example I'm in stereo mode if you're going for that seperation between right and left channels omnidirectional is pretty good if you try to pick up everything around the microphone like the really annoying dog outside that will not stop barking hey it stopped the microphone worked and finally bi-directional is good if you want to be recording anything from the front and the back I guess it's good for interviews and now we're back to the cardioid pattern which is my favorite and I asked you guys on Twitter what you'd like to hear tested with the microphone so let's do some keyboard clicks and mouse clicks - all right so I have MX brown switches over here now the thing is the microphone has no built-in noise cancellation so as I'm typing everything as you can hear it will pick up all the keyboard strokes which is why I would suggest for streamers in particular to use a quieter switch or reduce the gain on the microphone become a little bit more intimate with the microphone like this so I'm not peeking and then start to type so it will still be semi audible but definitely muted versus when the gain is boosted like this and so it sounds like HyperX has removed that noise cancellation that we heard at CES which is a good thing makes it more natural but then you have to go about try to cancel out a mute those background noises now what about the mouse it is audible unless you reduced the game get really intimate with the microphone like this still audible tone you power the microphone with the microUSB cable at the back and there's also a headphone jack so you can monitor what you're recording however there is no volume control for the headphones only the gain control for the microphone itself we also have a microphone stand adapter which is quite nice it's what I used in the intro and if you want to position the microphone on a boom arm or something but on its own base it has a little bit of angle adjustment and so that is the feature breakdown of the HyperX quadcast now let's compare it to other microphones and for the sound test let's do some reading now let's consider IBM's famous Watson an artificial intelligence system that won the Jeopardy television game show in 2011 beating humans former champions Watson is currently groomed to do more serious work particularly in diagnosing diseases in the eye such as Watson has enormous potential advantages over human doctors firstly an AI can hold in its data banks information about every known illness and medicine in history it can then update these data banks daily not only with the findings of new researchers but also with the medical statistics gathered from everyday LinkedIn clinic in hospital in the world secondly Watson will be intimately familiar not only with my entire genome and my day-to-day medical history but also with the genomes and medical histories of my parents siblings cousins neighbors and friends thirdly Watson will never be tired hungry or sick and will have all the time in the world for me but if you're entering medical school today and expectations of still being a family doctor in 20 years maybe you should think again with such a Watson around there's not much need for Sherlock's alright so that is the reading test let me know which one sounds best to you in the comments now in terms of digital noise the microphone is super clean regardless of your gain setting here for yourself the only thing picked up is my computer absolutely no noise great stuff you gotta appreciate the smooth and engaging sound with master up and - an H e 4x X planar magnetic headphones that sound amazing without a fancy amp and they're built to satisfy your ears and not destroy your wallet check out the drop down below alright so that's it for the quadcast let me know what you think of the sound quality I think it has fantastic neutrality to the vocals not too much bass not too sharp on the vocals just super natural and clean and again the the cleanliness factor is amazing the fact there's no digital noise even at the maximum gain but of course the downsides the fact that there is no noise cancellation so you have to just play around with the gain to eliminate the keyboard noises eliminate the mouse noises and you know get really intimate with the microphone in order to just have the vocals and not any distractions in the background now mitri thank so much for watching make sure to check out this other world and content subscribe to boot sequence as well and we'll talk to you next video",

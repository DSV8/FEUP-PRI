    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to \"This Is\" Samsung's about to release a \"duder\" and it's gonna be- - [Host In Glasses] The S 23, the \"duder\" edition. - S 23 \"duder\" edition. We wanna talk about what the S 23 needs to be, what we wanna see to not be absolute snoresville. - So here's the thing. Right now, if you are considering a flagship smartphone you have a wide variety of options. But if you want to go with the safe bet you buy yourself an S 22. Now this is the base model, which is the best version but you can go with the S 22, the Plus or the Ultra. But here's the thing, right? While Samsung have been on top of the Android game for, what, 11, - At least- - 12 years now at this point? While a lot of competition in the Android space has come and gone, if I'm Samsung the thing I'm gonna be worried about is not the iPhone. Oh no friends, it's the Pixel. The Pixel has gone from having so much potential but being kind of wasted to Google are on top of it right now. Not only is the Pixel an seven incredible value but also has really caught up to Samsung. 'Cause one of the things that you used to be like, \"Oh I want a Samsung 'cause it's gonna work it's gonna be simple, I don't have to worry about it and it's gonna have a lot of nice features.\" Guess what? The Pixel is now pretty reliable, cheaper and has all the extra pixely goodness on top. So it's becoming I think, a little bit more difficult to just blanket recommend a Galaxy S device. - So when I say that the S 22 is boring, I said it about the S 21, I said it about the S 20, that's not a bad thing. I think the iPhone is boring and I still daily that every day because they're really good they're really reliable, you know what you're getting. So like being boring is not a bad thing. - You wanna be competent? - Yes. - Right? You don't wanna be boring and incompetent or incontinent that- - That's just called one plus. The Samsung line has been really boring for the past couple years because they were so good that there's like, you know again this I'll compare it with- - It's not boring. - I'm gonna ignore- - This is not exciting? This is the exciting phone that Samsung makes. This is the the regular phone. - But again, not a bad thing. It just, they haven't needed to stand out and that's - Yes, I agree. - And I think that's the point I'm trying to make here. They didn't have to have these big leaps and bounds like they have in the past because they were already leaps and bounds ahead of pretty much any other Android manufacturer. What does the S 23 need to have to not be boring? To stand out against a Pixel and that's, to me that's the biggest thing. - Yeah. - Is like you say, \"Pixel has the pixely goodness.\" - Yes. - And Samsung doesn't have that. And that's what I think that Samsung needs to like focus on moving forward is building a better ecosystem around the Samsung. The flip phones are gimmicky and fun, like they're fun for some people. - Good. You said the word, you did say the word good. - I said gimmicky. When we talked about like our last Z Flip video. I don't think I've ever seen like a 50 50 split of people being like, \"You're crazy. My Z Flip is the best phone I've ever had.\" - Yeah, the correct people. - And then the person who was, \"My Z Flip died six minutes after using and Samsung wouldn't do anything about it.\" - That, those people don't exist. - I've never seen like a 50 50 split like that. - Everyone universally loves the Z Flip. Everyone who has a Z Flip has already subscribed. - I'm gonna take him out back and fold him. - The S 22 I think was a solid device. Now the thing is there's obviously like the specific specs and stuff, so we're recording this, they've announced the event right now, but the event and the actual launch won't be happening for a couple of weeks. - We only know what has leaked. That's fine. - Always take with a grain of salt the size of this - It doesn't matter too much. Like we're not here to talk about the specific specs. I think the more interesting thing is where Samsung is now and where they're going in the future. So if you look at the S 22, right? So again this is the base model, in the best color way. This phone was $800 when it was new, it had good specs, Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, good cameras, solid build, 120 hertz display like this has pretty much everything you would really need. Now you can step up to the plus which in my opinion doesn't make much sense because it was a $200 upgrade and didn't deliver a whole lot. Or if you really wanted a proper upgrade you would go to the Ultra, the 10 x Zoom it's got the 108 megapixel camera, it's got the S Pen or whatever they call it these days. Like the Ultra was kinda like the true ultra model of the phone. But here's the thing, right? $800 and $1,200, while that's competitive with what Apple's doing, what it's not competitive with is what Google are doing. I really think Samsung need to be looking over their shoulder at the Pixel. The Pixel seven is $600. It undercuts this, which is our reasonably priced by 200 bucks. And while I will say this a little bit more of a well-rounded package, better display, you've got a better spec and arguably pretty similar cameras, but still with Google out here undercutting Samsung, they can't just be focused on competing with the iPhone. And so I'm gonna be curious to see with not only the S 23 but also the S 24, if they continue with three devices instead of two, and also what they do with pricing, do they keep it the same? Does it go up to try to match what Apple's doing or what I think is a little bit more realistic does it need to come down to try to fight the Pixel. I'm curious though, Kenzie, can you actually fact check me here? So I know that the S 22 launched, 800 bucks and the Ultra was $1,200, but if I wanna buy these right now, what do they actually cost here in January of 2023? - [Kenzie] On Amazon, we have 650 for the S 22 and a 986 for the S 22 Ultra. - So they're 150, 200 bucks off. - Okay. - That's like decent. I will still say though, the Pixel seven makes it very strong case for itself and that's not considering that the S 23 is about to come out, right? So like price is tough here. I think Samsung need to watch their back. Google are coming for them. The Pixel has had such a like chaotic few years of they haven't really had like, you know they've been kinda all over the place. They had a lot of issues, - That's the thing, like I- - Pixels. - I have a hard time recommending Pixel to anyone because it's so hit and miss. I have a hard time recommending Pixel because, like I said, it's good now. Pixel was great. - People didn't know what they were doing. But no, no, here's the thing, Google didn't know what they were doing with Pixel. Like every year they went a completely different route. - And right, but at at what point? - Hold on, hold on. - At what point? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They've been making the Pixel now and the Nexus for like for long enough they should have this sheet laid out by now. - They do. They do have it figured out now, right? Pixel five was the last of the weird wilderness years. Pixel six. - Pixel five we said was good. - It was good. But it was still weird. - Pixel six wasn't. - Pixel six was not good, but it was a first generation product because they had just brought out Tensor. - But, I don't care, - New design. - I don't care though. Like I wanna see seven and eight. I wanna see good, good before I can say they figured it out. - Okay, that is fair. - That's what I'm saying. - The Pixel six was pretty good but had real issues. Pixel seven has ironed those issues out. They just need to continue with that. - Right. - Pixel seven is really, really solid, which makes the S 22, the S 23, you know that you're going to get a large number of years of software support. - [Matt] Yes. - You know, you're getting a terrific screen, you're getting very good performance. That's what the reason why I like the S 22 is that this is the safe, basic, absolutely good option. - Yes. - Like you know, that this is gonna give you everything you need. And I still do think that the Pixel seven has hit the point where I could recommend it with a completely straight face over something like this. But you just think yes, I know that Google have still work to do and yes, I know that the Pixel seven is not a complete one-to-one match. It doesn't have the telephoto, it doesn't have the 120 Hertz display, but it's pretty close. So I'm like what are they gonna really do with the S 23 to make this the still default standard Android device while still trying to tent people from the iPhone? I think that's a tough sell. I think they've an uphill battle. - I just don't think, I don't think they're ever gonna do that. I think that carriers, both iPhone and Android they're saying, \"We're not gonna, we're not gonna switch our people.\" Like most users who want to use an Android phone are not gonna switch over to iPhone and the majority of of iPhone users are not gonna switch over to Android. And I think that the companies who have kind of stopped trying to drive you back one way or another. - I hard disagree. I hard disagree. I, there there's one huge thing and I know you're gonna roll your eyes. The only thing that keeps iPhone people remotely interested in Android in my opinion is not necessarily the S 22. - Right? - It's the Flip and the Fold. I would say just as a broad sort of statement, most people who are on iPhone are totally happy, don't care. But the different form factor of the Z Flip and Z Fold that's where the interest is. That's where people are excited for. - Yeah, but- - I think that's the reason why Samsung is trying to bring iPhone users over. You usually use iPhone. - Yeah. - What Android phones interest you besides, - The Z Flip. Because, this is an old conversation. I'm not gonna buy a Z Flip either. I had a Z Flip. We talk about this every time the new Android phone comes out and every time a new iPhone comes out. The reason I'm on iPhone is because I'm on a Mac. The seamless like, oh just switching between all these things is that is the value proposition for me because this is not a conversation between Android and iOS. - Why would people buy an S 22 or an S 23? Like that's the thing that I think- - It's just a safe, really good bet. You're getting a better phone. - [Host In Glasses] Yeah. - Like you're getting better specs than you are with a Z Flip or a Z Fold. I wanna bring up something that Marquez tweeted about. - Yeah. - And I think that this is something that Samsung needs to start doing. His tweet was, \"No more budget phones whatsoever. Get rid of the A, get rid of the J, the three year old S 22. This is the budget phone.\" So the budget phone is like a couple years older, - [Host In Glasses] Right. - And then what you do is you extend the light, the support for those phones. So you're getting, because that's essentially what budget phones are, just the specs from three year, two three years ago in a slightly different build quality. But I almost always would recommend someone buy a flagship over a budget Samsung phone. - I know Marquez did the video on the budget phones. And while I do largely agree with a lot of what he and you are saying here, there are a couple of things I do think are worth considering. First and foremost, not everyone wants a used device, right? - No, I'm not saying used. I'm saying Samsung sell the S 22 for the next five years. - There's no way this phone, if they just sit on a warehouse within five years, they're gonna start suddenly start selling it for $200. - Why not? - It costs them more than $200 to make this. It's just 'cause it sits in a warehouse doesn't mean it's as depreciated to the point where they can do it. The only reason that smartphones, flagship smartphones, go down in price is because they are used they're secondhand, right? You're not gonna get this new for 200 bucks, right? Well if you're gonna spend 200 bucks on a phone you should probably be looking at something used, refurbished, whatever you wanna call it. But something like that I believe is going to give you a much better experience than buying a brand new but very, very cheap device today. Right? Because even a flagship from a few years ago was very, very competent. And while I do agree that software support needs to be extended, I'm gonna say I think Samsung pretty much has one of the longest support windows of any device outside of an iPhone. But we're already to the point where flagships from the last year or two are offering you five years of support. - [Kenzie] Samsung is four years of one UI and five years of security updates. - There you go. Four or five years is a lot of time. So you figure something like an S 22, right? It's about a year old right now. Say you're gonna buy this used in one to two years, right? So it's a two or three year old phone, it's probably gonna be 200, maybe 250 bucks, right? At the point you will still have one to two more years of security updates. And assuming that you're able to get a refurbished one that has a nice screen and the battery isn't completely trashed, this is gonna be so much better than any budget phone you're gonna be able to get. Now there's an argument there that that's where these S 22s and S 23s really land is not so much buying them new today, but being a very, very good phone in the future. But I'm telling you that right now, today I have a hard time recommending non-Pixel seven devices at this price point. The Pixel sevens are so good. - Maybe that's the maybe that's the takeaway of this of don't buy a new phone. I mean, we're kind of at that point with cars now like it's very rarely justifiable to buy a brand new car. - Oh, absolutely. You should almost always get it used and save- - Even a year old is gonna be a massive discount. We've said this for how many years now, reviewing phones. This is, it's a good upgrade. It's not a big upgrade. We're done with leaps and bounds. Everything that we're getting is a, is a incremental. What does the S 23 need to do to, to sell me on it? It needs to not exist. No. All the specs that they would put in the S 23. - [Host In Glasses] Yeah. - Needs to just go on the Z Flip. Stop making me choose between having the interesting form factor or a slightly better phone. This is all really good for Samsung. - [Host In Glasses] Yeah. - But for the consumer, I have to trade off every single product now. - Yeah. - Or I have to spend a ludicrous amount of money to get like the Ultra. That's really the only thing that would really interest me to get the, like an X 23 or whatever is incorporating the other lines kind of like they did with the Note. So like if I had a folding, fully spec'd phone that had the S Pen, that's basically all of what they have to offer, then that entices me. But at the moment it's a really good phone that a lot of people should get, but they probably shouldn't get new. It's not gonna be that much better than your old phone. - [Host In Glasses] Yeah. - And it's gonna be a lot cheaper if you buy the model year down. - So is the theoretical recommendation here, if you are buying a phone in 2023 to fall into one of three buckets, if you want a phone that's couple hundred dollars, you want something that's on the budget end, you should almost certainly look for a used flagship that's either an iPhone or you know S 20. If you want something that's sort of like mid-priced you should just buy a Pixel seven, like straight up, you should just buy the Pixel seven. And if you want something that's expensive, treat yourself to a Z Flip. Is that what we're saying right now? Cause I think that's what I'm gonna say. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. - I'm gonna Z Flip (beep) out. If you mentioned Z Flip one more time. It's good features and it's great to have, but like the way people talk about specs, they act like their life depends on these specs and they don't. - Excuse me, Matt, if I don't have a 5,000 mAh power battery, I will literally die. - I'm glad that your battery in the phone is operating your pacemaker. But like, \"I'm a food photographer for ants. So I need that 200 megapixels to be able to crop in on the smorgasbord antstagram is that's-\" - Did you mean to say Antsagram? - Anstagram. - Okay, I was just make sure you meant to say that. Okay, good, good, good. - Again, I just think that a big part of this conversation why it's so hard to get excited for Samsung phones. - Yeah. - Is because at any given time, what eight phones in their lines. But this is just the American market. I think that Samsung should just simplify their lines because what is the flagship of Samsung right now? - Z Flip. - No, no it's not. No like, like actually look - Z fold. - Look me in the eye. What is the, what is the- - Z fold. Z fold and S 22 Ultra are the flagships right now. Do that in the Z Flip. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Samsung, you're great. And I will continue to buy Z Flips forever and I'll probably keep buying S 22s and threes and stuff if you keep giving me good ColorWays like this one or the green one that's coming on the S 23.",

    "description": "The future of lawn care is here with the new 100% Electric Riding Lawn Mower from Cub Cadet:  Huge thanks to Cub Cadet for sponsoring this video and sending me the XT1 LT42E lawn tractor to help me mow and prepare my yard to get my fruit trees planted! This mower is powered by a lithium ion battery and is insanely quiet. Weve wanted to plant fruit trees on our property for some time, so getting the yard in check was the first step.   When it comes to the future orchard, its pretty cool that different kinds of fruits can be spliced into one single tree. Grafting different fruit trees together helps save space, and helps spread out the harvest over a longer period of time. What fruits would you like to see on the same tree? And what do you think about the all-electric mower? Let me know down in the comments.   Get my razor knife here!

    "transcript": "[Zack] Should we bury you? Like a tree? [Music] So one thing I bet you didn't know is you can take a fruit tree branch from one tree and spice it onto another fruit tree and have one tree that makes multiple kinds of fruit. Kind of like Frankenstein, but productive and actually exists in real life. Today we're going to take one of those fruit salad trees and plant it using my 100% electric Cub Cadet riding lawn tractor. Which of course, since it's electric, can mow my yard much more quietly than a regular mower, but I'll show you more of that in a second. Let's get started. [Intro] (silent electric tractor noises) So we have a couple different trees today. This one is our Bartlett Pear tree. This one is a Gala apple tree. This one is something called a Pluot. Cambry, what is a Pluot? [Cambry] A Pluot is a plum and apricot mixed and it's like the most scrumptious piece of fruit you could ever have. -I've never had a pluot, if you've had pluot let me know if it tastes good down in the comments. I don't quite believe her just yet. But the one we're most interested in is this guy right here which has all of the different fruits combined into one tree. And this particular fruit salad tree has plums...what's on this branch? This is the apricots. This one is the Polly White peach. This one is a Harken peach, it's a different kind of peach. And a Harko nectarine. If we look really closely where the branches connect with the stock, they're even different colors of bark. Like this guy back here is new and green, while the trunk of the tree is more brown. Kind of fun. One of the perks of having this Frankenstein tree, or the fruit salad tree, is that with the different types of pears they give fruit at different times of the year. So instead of needing to harvest and eat it all at once, one peach branch will give fruit like late in the summer, and then the other peach branch will give fruit more early fall, which spreads out the harvest over a longer period of time. Our fruit salad tree only has 5 different types of fruits attached to it, but there's a guy in New York who has been able to graft 40 different types of fruit into one gigantic tree. People do some pretty cool stuff. So we'll start by cutting out a circle in the grass. The hole is going to be about twice as wide as the pot that the tree is currently planted in, and about the same depth. We're going to save this grass and plant it somewhere else, so I'm trying to keep it in as big of chunks as possible. And once the hole is deep enough so that the surface level of the dirt in the pot is flush with the ground, then we can take the tree out of the pot and put it into the hole. Then we can mix some compost in with the regular dirt that we took out for the tree, pack it all in around the tree and we're good to go. I'm building a small little wall also around the tree that will help hold in the water, since as we know, plants need water to grow and this little dirt wall will create a mini dam that will help hold the water in for the first year or so. Once the tree's established we can get rid of the mote. So I'm no tree planting expert, but one pear tree is in the ground and we've got four more to go. The best time to plant trees is in the spring when they are waking up for the year, just getting their leaves and flower buds. So fruit trees are interesting because they can't always be planted just by themselves. They need to be planted in pairs or have more than one so that they can pollinate each other so that the fruit will grow. So we have spots for 6 trees here, and trees are quite a bit less expensive than you might think. I think we paid about $30 for each of these. -So we're going to plant our fruit salad tree, the grafted tree, and the pear tree next to each other since one of the branches is also pear and they can help each other out. Then we'll do pluots next to each other, and then the last row will be apples. -Looking forward to this one. [Toddler nephew] Babbling... -Is it still recording? Thanks dude. [Toddler] Babbling. [Music] -Of course the best time to plant a tree is 5 years ago, but the second best time to plant a tree is today. Alright Cambry, what do you think of the trees? -I'm so excited! I can't wait to see them...not the trees, but the fruit! -So you might be wondering how does an electric lawn mower even work? Well this is the key, and once the key is in the ignition, come over here, step on the break, hit the power button. It's going to beep twice. There's also a sensor in my seat that tells if I'm sitting down or not. Then I can let off the brake, hit the accelerator, and we're off. The reverse is right here. As soon as I let off the accelerator it goes into a brake. And then the reverse is here. I'm going backwards. There's no horn, unfortunately. We do have the adjustment lever for the grass level that we're going to be cutting. I usually leave mine on 2 or a little bit above that. But what about what's under the hood? Not a whole lot. This big box right here is a 56 volt 3 kilowatt hour lithium ion battery, which is 3,000 watt hours. One of the best things though, with this being 100% electric, is that there's almost no maintenance...no gas, no oil, no air filters, no spark plugs, no pulleys and no belts. I'm sure most people when they think about electric equipment think of a gutless golf cart, or one of those old school electric mowers that has an extension cable. Those are pretty sketchy. I've had this mower for about a month now and it's capable of mowing two acres of grass with a single charge and no power fade. It charges up in about 4 hours from a normal wall outlet. And as you saw earlier, driving around the whole thing it's completely silent. The cutters underneath are spun around by direct drive electric motor, so there's no pullies or belts or anything to worry about, and they're electric so it's super quiet. But there is some sound. To turn on the blades I'm going to press this button here. Cuz just like with any fan, or a helicopter, the blades are going to make noise as they spin around. They leave little pockets of air, or little vortex's behind that the next blade comes through and has to hit, which makes the noise you're hearing, because it's not the electric motors. So there's no way to avoid the sound of the blades spinning due to the current laws of physics, but it's still more quiet than a regular motor. And another thing that's pretty cool is that this mower has a 16 inch turning radius which makes it perfect for cutting around all our newly planted trees. And, of course, Cub Cadet has a huge selection of electric equipment, from push mowers to electric mowers larger than this one. So I'll leave a link down in the description if you want to check out the current pricing. They'll be selling at Home Depot and other stores this spring, and come with a 4 year battery warranty and a 3 year machine warranty. And they are made in America. I'm pretty excited about this guy. It's kind of like a Tesla for your yard. As well as, I'm excited about the fruit trees we just planted. Alright Cambry, now that we've filmed the whole video, do you think it's time to tell them the bad news? -Yeah. We have to wait 4 years before we can harvest any fruit for us to eat. -Apparently the tree needs to focus on itself and develop before it can start producing fruit for others. -Lessons of life. -But 4 years from now we're going to make a taste test video with all of the fruit that we just planted in our little mini orchard. -I think pluot's going to win. -We'll see about that. Want to finish us off? -Thanks a ton for watching. We'll see you around.",

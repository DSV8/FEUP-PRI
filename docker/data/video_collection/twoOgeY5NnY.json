    "transcript": "- Greetings internet, I am Ken from the Computer Clan, and man, it has been about, what, almost 4 and a half years since Apple updated the Mac Pro? It was last updated in December of 2013. Why has it been so long? Well, there could be many reasons, but Craig Federighi recently said something about there being thermal limitations, and that could be, Apple has been kind of infamous for having cooling problems with their products because they try to push a lot of power in very small, quiet designs. So does that mean Apple is giving up on the Mac Pro? It may seem like it, but trust me, they're not. We're actually expecting to see a launch of a Mac Pro in 2019. Now, fingers crossed, we might see a preview a bit earlier, but we're expecting a full product release sometime in the year 2019 and it is going to feature a modular design. Now, it's been a long time since I've thought of Apple and modular in the same sentence but, hey, maybe it will be like The Johnathan Computer. Or, maybe not. So modularity might be a big thing with this next Mac Pro and we'll revisit that in a second, but first, let's get to some of the other developments about this news. So Matthew Panzarino from TechCrunch recently visited Apple's Cupertino campus. He met with several people at the company, actually, including Tom Boger who is Apple's Senior Director of Mac Hardware Marketing. In a conversation with Matthew, Tom said, and I quote, \"We want to be transparent \"and communicate openly with our Pro community \"so we want them to know that the Mac Pro is a 2019 product. \"It's not something for this year.\" Now it's not just that, Apple is actually changing some things under the hood at the company. Apple's VP of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, is actually leading a team called the Pro Workflow Team. So the goal of this Pro Workflow Team is to work with creatives and have them use Apple's current systems and see where they're getting stuck. They wanna look for those sticking points and try to remove them when building future Pro products, so that could be a very good move, and personally, I'm quite excited for this, because I've been holding out for a new Mac Pro. I currently use a laptop but I would love to see a new Mac headless workstation. I will gladly throw my money at it, so Apple, hurry up. As for the specs and the design we don't really have any confirmed rumors about that yet but personally, I think Apple could take the elegance of the current trashcan Mac Pro and resize the chassis so it's larger allowing for modularity, and a better cooling system. Pascal Eggert actually kind of read my mind when he made his own concept, seriously, go check this stuff out, it's freakin' amazing. But he basically jumped into my head and built what I was thinking. So I think making the chassis bigger will be great for air flow and if Apple could shove a second fan in there I think that would help a lot, too, and it can be very similar fan to what they use now, something that is very wide, and that can spin at a low RPM so it stays quiet. Shoving a second one of those in there with a redesigned thermal core that can cool more space and more volume I think will make this thing work, but I'm no engineer by any means. Oh, plus, I still like the idea of the top exhaust vents double-functioning as a handle, so I hope they keep something like that. And personally, I think I did a decent job with this render considering I threw it together in about an hour. Pascal definitely takes the cake, he probably spent a lot more time on his. So yeah, we may have to wait a little bit longer for this next Mac Pro but I think it'll be worth it, and honestly, if it doesn't work out, I can just go back to the G4 Cube. (startup chime) Heck, that thing cools itself without a fan and it has a handle built in, so, huzzah. So guys, I'm leaving it up to you. Let me know down below, what do you think the next Mac Pro's gonna look like? What do you think the specs are gonna be? Let's place some bets and then like come back to this video like a year or two later and see who was the closest, I think that would be a lot of fun. So, let me know down below, and also let me know if you plan to purchase one when it comes out, because I would love to. That's all I have for you guys today, thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the not too distant future.",

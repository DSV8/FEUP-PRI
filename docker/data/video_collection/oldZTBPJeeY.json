Version This is Sleephones 2.0 Still sleeping These ones have a new material, So my complaint previously was they were too hot I was getting a little warm under there A little hot under the collar They're bluetooth now! No cords No strangling in your sleep. And... Supposedly... They're better sounding So, What a package. 10 to 13 hours of play time on a single charge, machine washable? And streams up to 30 feet away. Look at the packaging game Upgraded. OK! Wow! There's a lot more packaging here Yeah! USB cable, Micro-USB for charging this up. I hope it has a little bit of a charge And is this t- Oh Some troubleshooting. And Ooh, Maah, yes! Yes that material is much nicer.

They're soan in there, they fit over top of your ears These ones actually feel even more low profiles than the last ones The controls and electronics are in back here And there's a button which is on the seam OH yes, this is much more comf- They were right, they weren't lying That is much more comfortable and cool If you're like me... Before you go to bed, you listen to podcasts, you listen to... Some calming music, you listen to some... Meditation vibes. This right here man, are you kidding me? Maybe you're not even sleeping, maybe you're just on a couch, you're trying to find a comfy... Location, and you've got the big headphones on. And you're just trying to watch your videos in peace. This is about... Comfort. You've been on an airplane before You can't get... How did they get that measurement right? How did they know the distande... The ears? (Music playing) You're not doing that with normal headphones Leaning... Earbuds... You still got the pain in the ear canal You don't need that in your life Improving life! Sleephones!

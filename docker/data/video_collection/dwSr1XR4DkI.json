    "description": "Bezel-less smartphones are becoming the norm, but all started with a phone you've probably never heard of.  Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter -  Follow me on Instagram -   In a world where bezels have always been the norm, it's nice to see new inventions like motorized camera and all screen smartphone design. We're looking at the first bezel less phone that started the trend of current smartphones, like iPhone X, Vivo Nex, Oppo Find X, and future smartphones yet to come.",

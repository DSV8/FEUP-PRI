    "transcript": "This video is sponsored by RhinoShield. Hey guys, this is Austin. Here on the channel, we've built some pretty questionable stuff, but today it's time to give the iPhone X a shot. So, when RhinoShield challenged us to do something a little creative with their new Mod case, I felt like it seemed like the natural choice. So, if you guys aren't familiar with RhinoShield, it's what I use on my phone every day. Now, the idea here is that it is a bumper that will protect your phone while still leaving the front and back exposed. However, with their new Mod case, you actually can do a lot more than that. I like using the black frame with the white buttons, but you can also add a back plate. Now, not only will this help protect your phone, but also will allow you to add lenses to the iPhone. So, you have a few different lenses to choose from, but my favorite is the HD wide angle. Now, the idea here is, especially when you're using the iPhone X, not only do you have the telephoto camera and the normal wide angle, when you put this guy on, it gives you an even wider field of view. The lenses just screw right on and once you get them in place, you can just take off the lens cap, and if you open up the camera, boom! While a lot of lenses can be fairly soft, this actually looks really nice and sharp. Especially when you put it side by side with the normal iPhone camera, it makes a big difference. The Mod case can also protect against some pretty serious abuse, and I found that out the hard way, as well as on purpose. RhinoShield claims that this will protect up to an 11 foot drop test, and uh, this looks like a little bit more than that. So, (laughs) here goes nothing. This is my iPhone, so I really hope it doesn't break. Okay, three, two, one... (crashing) Ohh! Three, two, one... (slow motion whirring) (crashing) Ohh! I don't wanna look. I don't wanna look. I'm gonna look. (laughing) Woo! It's even still recording! Hi Ken. Okay. Oh yeah, totally fine. I wasn't worried or anything. So any good vlogger should know that you need the Casey Neistat special. So, not only do we have a GorillaPod, but we also have a tripod mount for a smartphone. Now, there are a ton of different versions of these. I like this metal one, which I've actually seen under a bunch of different brand names, but I'll make sure to link this one into the description. Also, a little pro tip. Even though this has rubber, it actually does make sense to use something like a RhinoShield, because it will scratch your phone. So, now this is looking a lot better. But, good video is nothing without good audio. That's where this comes in. So, this is the Shure MV88 and it is a Lightning microphone. So, this should, in theory, sound a lot better than the built-in microphone on the iPhone. But, the only problem is, is that the Lightning port on this guy is tiny, which means that we had to improvise. By improvise, I mean Ken cut up a Lightning dock to make it actually fit on our phone, because he's talented and dedicated and hates money. I mean, come on, you clicked on building the ultimate iPhone X, did you not think we were going to get to this point? So, I think the wider angle camera definitely helps for vlogging, but the microphone sounds so much better than the built-in iPhone. And I mean, yes, there are probably slightly more practical ways of vlogging from your iPhone, but for something that if you wanna carry this around (laughs) in your pock-- (laughs) I can't even say it with a straight face. No one's gonna walk around with this. But, it works. Kind of. All right, so I am now vlogging from my super cool iPhone X vlog rig. So, you guys can be the judge for yourself with the quality, but with the wider angle camera, you're getting a little bit more in the shot. Hopefully, the mic sounds pretty good as well. But, say vlogging isn't your thing, but you still wanna build the ultimate iPhone. Oh, we're not done yet. This is the Wireless Universal Foldable Keyboard, and okay, well that's a little bit of a dirty pouch, but whatever. Ohh... What? (laughs) Wait. (clicking) Ohh! (laughs) Wait, wait. That's actually-- Wait, that's a full size keyboard. My Geology 101 report is Ken is a really handsome guy. Okay, that's not great. Can we talk about how you're just using the phone sideways? (laughs) No, we don't have to talk about that at all, Ken. Because... I have a monitor. Hey! (laughs) (laughs) All right. Let's do this. Let's start Tweeting. Hi, my name is Austin and I make bad decisions. (laughs) This is so much fun. I love doing dumb stuff with tech. It's the best. If all that wasn't enough, you can also add a Bluetooth game controller, such as the SteelSeries Nimbus. Because you know, when you have an HDMI display, you gotta play some games. And, I'm playing Minecraft on an iPhone using a game controller and a monitor. Also, why is nothing loading? (laughs) How'd I break Minecraft? That's not-- That shouldn't be a thing. Oh, there we go. I've actually gotta say this does feel like playing Minecraft on anything else. The controller feels good, pretty much just something like an Xbox controller. While for some reason the iPhone is displaying in a smaller window, it does work. Should anyone ever actually play games like this? Probably not. Is it fun? Absolutely. So, while some might say that this isn't the most practical setup in the world, but I'm actually pretty impressed with some of it, most notably the video rig. Now, no you shouldn't probably use a Bluetooth keyboard and a controller and an HDMI display with your iPhone, but if you're shooting video, this is actually not a bad way of going. Just add a microphone, and something like these lenses that go with the RhinoShield Mod case can make a big difference. So, what would you guys put in your ultimate iPhone X? And no, you can't just say an Android phone. Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one. (laughs)",

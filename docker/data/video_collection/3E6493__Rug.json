    "transcript": "Behind me I have the world's most high-tech bed and at first glance it might look entirely normal, But it is actually a liquid cooled and heated heart rate sensing REM sleep quantifying built-in alarm clock and it's called the 8Sleep Pod 3 mattress cover. I've been personally trying it out and today we're gonna see, like we always do, how this works from the inside. Super Brave of eight sleep to send this over and sponsor this video. let's get started. [Introduction] So I've heard of liquid cooling computers, cars, and electronics, but I've never heard of liquid a bed. And it's not just one temperature either. Each side can be whatever temperature you want between 55 and 110 degrees, which we'll have to test If you think about it, liquid thermal systems make a whole lot of sense in a mattress, especially temperature is one of the most important variables when it comes to sleep quality. It's way quicker and easier to cooler heat a bed than it is to cooler heat your whole house. We'll get to slicing open the mattress here in a second, but the initial setup requires distilled meaning all the minerals have been boiled out. Using hard water from the tap might clog up the internal piping, and we also tossed in some peroxide since we know water provides life to all living things. And hydrogen peroxide will ensure the only living things in your bed are the humans sleeping on top. 8Sleep has already solved two of the main issues I would have brought up, so we're off to a good. This is the Sleep Pod 3. We're a few generations in and 8Sleep has been making these beds for about 10 years, so they should the kinks pretty well worked out. Old school mattresses can trap heat throughout the night. 8 Sleep has managed to change that with this guy right here called the Smart Hub. Basically this guy can heat and cool liquid simultaneously so this half of the bed can be whatever it wants, and this half of the bed can be whatever temperature it wants. So I have a little thermal image camera right here doing a little test. You can see that the temperature difference between my legs and the floor. But take a look at this. Half of the bed is super hot, and half of the bed is incredibly cold. That is mind blowing. It looks like the grid fills up the entirety of the bed except for the very edge of the corners. We'll have to take that apart in a second. But wow, that is amazing. All the way up to 110 degrees or all the way down to 55. This will make more sense in a future video, but I want to see how much power draw the Sleep Pod while heating and cooling the mattress cover. And it looks like we're pulling right around 200 watts which is a fraction of the power an AC or a heater would require to maintain the same temperature of your house. So far while we've been using this mattress cover, there's an app that's been tracking our sleep giving us a sleep score in the morning. Based on how long we slept our REM sleep heart rate deep sleep. My wife has kind of turned it into a competition to see who sleeps better at night, and so far winning. My schedule's been pretty bonkers the last couple weeks, so when it does come time for me to sleep, need to make best use of the time I have. Sometimes I get 8 hours, but sometimes I only get 6. And the deeper, more fulfilling sleep I can get during those 6 hours, the better. And this hurts me to have to do since we've grown very fond of the Pod 3, but we do have to see inside. Oh my gosh, that's actually super cool. No way! that's so cool. Oh man. you guys to check this out. They make this thing sweet! The rubber grid itself is surprisingly strong and will not be breaking on its own. I've been using the internal vibration alarms to wake up in the morning and I want to see how 8 has made those vibrators small enough to not be noticed while I'm sleeping on top of them, and how able to check my heart rate and breathing through the mattress cover without me wearing any hardware. Looks like as we are taking apart the bed, we haven't found like the vibration sensors or the heart monitor, but I think it has something to do with this strip right across the middle. I mean, that's got to be something, right? Oh there's a zipper. Let's find the other side of that zipper. You would think that the zipper would do something here in the corner, but it is very much stuck on sides. So we are just going to have to slice and dice. 8 Sleep is a company that has run clinical trials and found that after one month of sleeping on the Pod members fall asleep 44% faster. Get 23% fewer sleep interruptions and Report 34% higher daytime energy scores. Looks like the mattress has one electronic box on the right side and a larger electronic box on the left side with some super long straps running through the mattress underneath the top pad. These straps contain the heart rate and motion sensors. While a bundle of wires above that around chest level contain the vibrators. The vibrators are a pretty sweet looking blue translucent cylinder. When sliced open we can see they're an eccentric rotating mass vibrator like we saw inside the old phones back in the day. They're super tiny, hidden underneath padding and sitting on top of a mattress. So unless this is a princess and the pea situation, they can't really be felt. It's cool that the 8 sleep pod 3 is designed to fit over any mattress. Just like like a fitted sheet. Temperature is cool and all of that, but the best part about the Smart Hub back here is that it learns how you sleep by monitoring your heart rate, breathing, and movement. It can adjust the temperature of the bed by itself through autopilot to keep you asleep. That's the kind of robot uprising I can get behind. It can even adjust the temperature to the local weather in preparation for your sleep. Fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and wake up better rested. And each person on either side gets the same white glove treatment. Plus with the nightly health metrics being monitored, like heart rate, heart rate variability, and the pod notifies you if something is off track. 8 Sleep says that people on average save about 15 bucks a month on their energy bill since heating cooling the pod is more efficient than heating and cooling your whole house. With a few slices and dices in the wrong spots, it looks like I'm going to be buying myself a new 3. Which brings us to the price. Not going to lie, the 8 Sleep Pod 3 is a very substantial investment starting around $2,000. However, if you think about it from the perspective that your mattress or your bed is where you a third of your life sleeping, spending a couple extra bucks could be worth it. 8 Sleep has a 30-day money back guarantee if you're not completely satisfied, and I'll leave those in the video description.

    "transcript": "in the PC gaming community pre-built gaming systems have a pretty bad reputation not rise of the Skywalker bad but pretty terrible in fact if you're spending $1,000 on a prebuilt gaming system from Amazon chances are it's going to be pretty rubbish value for money but how about a three hundred and ninety dollar system to find the cheapest gaming branded prebuilt on amazon is actually not that easy to do because if you type in gaming pc and sought from cheapest to most expensive a lot of these systems are like renewed optics systems and those aren't really geared towards gamers now you could buy one of those and turn it into a gaming capable system quite easily but that's a topic for a different video so this is the little piece that I ended up going with straight off the bat the specs don't really make any sense how can this be a 10 core gaming system now I did a video on this specific listing before and I figured it out in that video because they have an AMD APU in this PC that has a 4 core CPU section and a 6 core GPU section they added those two together to say that it's a 10 core gaming PC by that logic my main computer has 3000 something cores in it and if I refer to my PC on the Internet as a 3,000 core gaming system people would get pretty mean so after using your help to decide on this peasant edition pre-built system I decided to order it and this is what happened and here we have it it's actually a lot smaller than I thought it was gonna be but you don't need that much space to house a 10 core gaming Beast I do actually have a different concern with it there aren't any fragile stickers anywhere on it and when I put it down there was a very clear go dunk sound that came from the inside of the box it sounded a little bit like a loose side panel yeah so I'm a bit concerned about this thing but with that let's open it up and see whether or not DHL killed our little gaming Beast as we get into the ten core gaming beast box oh oh there's actually another there's actually another box in here oh yeah oh that's not ideal but there she is what a beaut that's some of the most fragile packing foam look at that it just kind of disintegrates like that so I think the sound we heard was the power cable and not actually a side panel because everything seems to be secured tightly so this is it amazing looking PC it looks like it came straight out of 2007 there's a DVD drive for some reason and space for two more if you really want to go to town ripping them sick mp3s for all of your friends there's some front airflow which is very good for the 10 core beast that lives inside of here in all honesty the front io doesn't look too bad at least you have USB 3 it comes with a little Wi-Fi dongle in one of the USB 2 ports and then it has the biggest power button I've ever seen on a PC can't miss that even if you tried on the side we've got some more ventilation there's no fan here but you can see a bit of cables through there and here we have the rear i/o which is not the worst looking I mean we've got 4 USB 3 ports here an HDMI port but the VGA port worries me a bit considering that rumor has it this was actually the display output of choice during the Triassic period but with that let's open it up and see what the inside of this little beast looks like oh the thumb screws aren't captive so I guess Dmitry from hardware key Knox would mark them down for that oh ok here we have it that's some pretty terrible looking cable management they didn't use the back of the motherboard tray to actually route the cables and stuff I okay so there isn't actually space at the top here for the CPU power cable but this stuff they could have routed behind the back we've got a hard drive in here that's I mean that's just loose in there they just put one of these in there and then just kind of like pushed it in there that's that's pretty terrible in regards to the hard drive I don't really recognize it although it does look pretty used I mean there are quite a few scuffs on it the biggest problem that I have with the component selection of this system is actually the power supply which is a 400 watt unit that I've never seen before but it does look like the kind of thing that could trigger a chain reaction that ends up destroying all of the electronics in your house oh well I mean it's nice to see that they used some zip ties to actually help with the cable management the motherboard is an ass rock a 320 m HD v it's an AM 4 motherboard so you could technically upgrade the CPU later down the line although the vrm is fairly looser looking so I wouldn't want to run something like a 10 polarizing CPU in here oh wait so with that let's put the side panel back on and see whether or not this system fires up I'll have a closer look at all of the components later I'll disassemble it and try and fix up the cable management and stuff like that but I don't want to do that before I see if it works because I may inadvertently fix something that they didn't quite plug in oh yeah I just need to remember to put the cable tie back because that's that's a very important part of the operation of this system and it's the moment of truth let's see if it fires up oh it's got a nice red power button there we got a little bit of red glow here it seems like it's working okay windows windows thing is happening it's very slow this is potentially the first time it's booting so that may be a lot to do with it but I think I think that three terabyte drive that they included it looks like it came from the bottom of an Afghan well maybe the culprit here oh yeah there we go they've actually got it set up they have Google Chrome installed straight off the bat for you so that's very nice I appreciate that well it's official according to Windows this is a 10 compute core CPU so you know they were they weren't lying you know in Windows it does tell you it's it's a 10 core CPU so I think if you if you kind of confront them about that they're they're just gonna point to this and tell you well it is a 10 core CPU the fact that the system works straight out of the box without me having to open it up and dig around in that terrible cable management to fix anything is a pretty good start although getting it points for that kind of feels like giving it points for not blowing up and taking both of my hands with it it's it's kind of a minimum requirement so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna try and run csgo on it because they didn't seem to install any drivers on the system so I want to see how much of an impact that has on the actual performance and then we're gonna try and run some other popular games on the little engine that could [Music] those results are pretty terrible this thing is a real little crap box even for three hundred and eighty dollars those results are unacceptable and it's not like I'm playing brand new triple-a titles either things like csgo with the lowest settings and dota are barely playable on this system and that really isn't something I'd expect from a gaming system now just out of curiosity I tried to run half-life 2 on this system which is a 16 year old game and this system couldn't get the consistent 60 frames per second at 1080p on a 16 year old game that's some pretty crazy stuff now just to really put the gaming experience on this system into perspective here is some footage of me playing pop G on the lowest settings at 720p just to give you a real indication of what 14 frames per second looks like at 720p [Music] so remember I said that the hard drive looked a little bit used well I decided to do some performance tests on the hard drive and it performs kind of in line with other hard drives you know it's it's decent but when I looked at Crystal disc info it shows that this hard drive is very very used in fact it's been on for at least four years oh it's not good so with that let's open it up and see if we can fix up the cable management in that [Music] and here it is this is after about maybe 20 minutes of cable management it looks significantly better in my opinion but it still does have some problems in all fairness to the guy that built this system this is the worst case I've ever worked in I would rather eat one of my own fingers then have to build in this case again it really was terrible and the power supply doesn't help at all like this cable could go behind the back but it just isn't long enough like it's so close there are a couple millimeters in it but it just doesn't fit so you have to run around the front all the cables are obviously horrible ketchup and mustard even from the case front IO like it's very difficult to hide all of that disgustingness down here I can't get the the harddrive in properly because the actual cage is broken as you can see here if it's if it's not broken the harddrive sits there it's it's never fine but because it's broken that happens so the biggest problem here and one of the reasons that I wanted to actually rebuild the system was because it illustrates the point that okay yes the guy who built the system could have done a better job as I Ellis trated here but the biggest problem with this system is the choice of components even for a three hundred and eighty dollar build this case shouldn't exist they shouldn't have used this power supply and it's unacceptable that the hard drive is older than I am and has worked harder than the most abused donkey not only that but the ten core apu that they use in the system wasn't an acceptable gaming solution when it was first available four years ago so if it's not already very clear you really shouldn't buy the system it's kind of like the PC equivalent of gonorrhea it's just a red and yellow mess so in conclusion in my opinion if you have under five hundred dollars to spend on a system you really shouldn't buy a pre-built PC because in that price range there isn't enough of a margin for profit to make it worth the system builders while without cutting some serious donkey level corners so if you like this video subscribe to the channel because I'm gonna do a follow-up where I build my own is three hundred and eighty dollar system and I'll walk you through the process of how to build that system so that you don't have to fall for this kind of crap just because you don't know how to build a system anyway thank you very much for watching follow me on whatever social media you want I'll have it linked in the description below and until the next video [Music]",

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video and today I'm gonna combine two of your favorite things a MacBook and LEGO You never expected to have those two words combined in such a fashion But that's what this thing is about \"THE BRIK BOOK\" Build whatever you want and it can live on the lid of your laptop Let's see some examples Donut Who doesn't like a donut Penguin! Another fan favorite Or you can just write a message, you could mix it up, you could be in class, get really bored, flip your laptop over and build something Do I have LEGO to go with it? *the noise of the LEGO shaking can be heard* That was louder than I expected it to be I've got LEGO, the classic That's it, simple Now currently you're wondering, why does my MacBook Pro look like some black leather? thats from dbrand Okay, just clip it on there... Yes, yes If you got that baby out and about, people are going Can I say a word or two about the LEGO, it might be the greatest toy on the planet The capabilities of LEGO are truly endless If you can think of it you can build it and now you can take that with you as a point of pride There might be a pretty girl who's having a latte Caramel Macchiato and you can just like real quick you rearrange your LEGO you drop a little Caramel Macchiato Maybe you put a heart beside it... The rest is history Because of who? I want to first do a quick little Unbox Therapy logo on here Now This is not gonna be easy Especially with this selection of bricks Not a huge selection U is an easy letter I can get behind a U or can I? Maybe Woah! There we go \"U\" We'll do a chunkier \"N\" That is a bit too... Look at this, Lego heads When they started coming out with this That was a game changer right there Check it out, okay? The removal tool Ohhh! Ahhh! Yes, sir There... There... It's lookin' modern right now... Yeah The easy \"O\" Hah! Now the \"X\" *rustles around the LEGO in the box* It's a special sound There... There... Ooh, hoo hoo hoo hoo! *dramatic tone* Unbox Doo doo Yeah, I like that Okay, \"H\" is really easy, right? Ooh! That's... You didn't... You didn't think I could... You didn't think I had it in me! Small \"r\" Waddaya think? Little weird, like a little ramp guy Yeeaahh! Ho ho ho ho! Oh you didn't believe it! You didn't think I had it in me! I'm at the coffee shop. You're like, \"woah\"! I think that if you really wanted to like... Write a message, and have it there permanently The move would be to go with like, the thinner Style of brick? Maybe it's for a kid, maybe it's for yourself cuz you're a kid at heart I think we should do one more... Creation We do need To do face reveal of Jack To be to able encompass all that is Jack in the form of LEGO bricks Well, you could probably put that on the same level as the Sistine Chapel Look at the tool Unbelieveable Now the thing to remember about Jack is that the ears are quite large Makes him great for the job He's always listening They resemble that of an elephant, you can tell That's starting to look like him now! Unlike his ears, his arms are very short There's your Jack! Face reveal! Aren't you guys happy? Now you know what he looks like!",

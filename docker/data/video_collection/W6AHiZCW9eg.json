    "transcript": "- [Justine] I don't know where to put all the things. (intense techno music) Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine and I am here with Jen. So you guys know that I am a mess, (Jen laughs) like, my life is always just in shambles, there's stuff everywhere. So about a year ago, I met Jen and she came in with her team and they completely reorganized my house. - Yes. And you're not a mess-- - Okay. - but we definitely did help a little. (Jen laughs) - You're being way too nice. Nothing is where it belongs, nothing has a home, nothing makes sense. I've got electronics in the kitchen, I've got kitchenware in my office, I don't know where to put all the things. (slow jazz music) - So if you guys love organization or you need inspiration to become organized, you guys have to go check out her Instagram. Do you want to talk about, like, some of the stuff you guys post? - Yes, of course, so for our Instagram, @lifeinjeneral with a J, we do a lot of before and afters, so we come into spaces, whether it be garages or closets, or tech spaces or kitchens, which we'll show you today-- - We will! - They're really fun. So we basically come in, pull everything out, categorize, sort and then install it back in with a new system. - What's the first thing that you do when you come into a space? - When we first come in, we meet, and then talk to you about kind of the flow of the room, like what's working for you, we see the space, but the biggest thing is just kind of wanting to know your vision, like what's the space for, what do you need in that space, and then a lot of it is just once we get to work and pulling everything out, really seeing everything, you'd be surprised of what you don't need, what you don't use, what you have a hundred of. - It was actually shocking, so like, I kind of just went away for like a few minutes, and then I came back and everything was out-- - [Jen] Mmmhmmm. - [Justine] Like, they pulled every single piece of thing-- - [Jen] Mmmmhmmm. - [Justine] that's somewhere and then you just sort of like sort through. I got rid of a lot of stuff. - [Jen] You did, and we donate to a lot of really great charities too, which was really great. (laughs) - One of the biggest projects is you guys, I don't know if you remember this, but when I first moved into this place, there was a closet that wasn't built out-- - [Jen] Mmmhmmm. - [Justine] So I think that was the biggest thing to tackle, because not only had I hoarded so much stuff inside of the space, you guys completely took all of that, reorganized it, and then turned it into a closet. - [Jen] Yeah, it's beautiful. I'm really happy with how it turned out. I think for us, too, coming into this space and learning what your real needs are, and then seeing that we needed to build it out, so we brought in California Closets to really make that space a beautiful place for you to have, and then of course with all your office stuff and your supplies and all your little tech pieces and hundreds of thousands of Legos, (Justine laughs) you know, making sure that we have a home for everything-- - [Justine] Yeah. - [Jen] So it stays that way, is really important. - We wanted to go through and do some reactions to before and after photos because some of these I haven't seen at all, actually. - Yeah. - So you just sent them to my phone. Where do we even start? What should we do? (Jen laughs) Oh my gosh! - We were opening the cabinet and stuff was flying at us. - This isn't even something that I could comprehend-- (Jen laughs) When I first opened that, it was shocking. There's just like, Hershey's cocoa up there, (Justine gasps) (Jen laughs) Oh my goodness. (women laughing) These cups are just-- - Stacked-- - On top of it. Do you want to come say hi? - [Jordan] Hey, hi. - Yes, Jordan, you've gotta come over here! - Jordan, come say hi. - Hey guys! - Come in! - Guys, it's Jordan! - Jordan! - Hi! (women laughing) - So you are a part of the team-- - I am a part of the team, there's a lot of us and depending on the vibe of the team, it's definitely important to creating, like, a perfect functional space with the client. - Yeah. - But what was one of the things that you most spotlighted your efforts on? - I, well, I love, I knew you were, like, full of like, tech and everything, and all that, so the office was awesome to, the built out space-- - Yeah. - For when you first walk in was really cool to see the transformation, but I love junk drawers, and-- - We call them joy drawers. - Yes. - Joy drawers, oh we do. - Oh, joy. Joy drawers. It's okay. (Jen laughs) - You have the awesome-- - That drawer is amazing. - Yeah. - It's so good-- - And there's like a-- - I've never loved a drawer, a joy drawer, so much. - A joy drawer. (everyone laughs) (soft techno music) - [Justine] Look at this! All my batteries. - [Unknown Female] The measuring tape! We can never find it! It's always out of place! (measuring tape snaps) - But it has a home. - [Unknown Female] This is great! - Everyone, take a screenshot of this video and tweet it to Burnie and Gavinfree, right now. (Jordan laughs) - Sharpies, pong balls for beer pong, which actually ends up being water pong. Look at these little guys in my shot glass, for Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare. Do you guys want to see something else? This has been new since you were last here, but I accumulated a lot of Butterfinger. (laughs) - [Jordan] Oooooh. - [Jen] Yessss. - [Justine] Do you want some? - [Jen] Coffee, yes! Coffee. - [Justine] This tea organizer is so great. This is where the snacks reside. Oh my gosh, so, Matty, get in there, get in there, see what's in there. See what's in there. Look at all that La Croix. This is my favorite thing, so-- (laughs) pitchers and juggling. (laughs) - Wait, did somebody add juggling? - [Justine] Well, yeah, because-- (laughing) it's like, where else-- - [Jordan] Can you juggle? - Yes! It's like, where are you going to put the juggling, like, put it by the pitchers! - [Jordan] You're juggling all them. Four. - I've been working on my juggling of four, but it's... - And we love these spices and seasons. - Yeah, those are so cool. I love this too. - Mmmhmmm. - It's like, where all the healthy bars are. (laughing) It's just full of chocolate and candy. Does alcohol expire? Because-- - [Jordan] Mmmmm, no. - Does it? No? This little guy, he's got a sweater. Here it is. - [Jen] This here is my favorite. - In real life, like everything is so great. Here's all of Roe's little Nerdy Nummies accessories. Cookie cutters, it's just crazy for someone that doesn't actually bake. (laughs) Do you need a cookie cutter? Yeah, oooh look at this, all my cookie icing has a home? The mixers have a home, it's just the best part is seeing what it looked like before. It is. (laughing) I mean, wow, do you guys want to see the tech drawer? - [Jen] There's no longer a tech drawer. Yeah, this is more practical for the kitchen. - Jordan's favorite. (gasps) - [Jordan] Yes. - [Jen] Wow. This is my favorite. - [Jen] It's so good, oh my gosh. - [Jordan] This is perfect, color coded and everything. - [Justine] Oh, it's so perfect. Matty what do you think about that? (upbeat electronic music) - This used to be, well there was something here, I had like this awful shelf thing. - [Jen] I think it was just like a cube. Yeah, I was displaying like, my Mister Miyamoto Nintendo 3DS, I had, like, my display of like, my favorite Xbox. - [Unknown Female] I built that shelf, I think it was from, like, Ikea. - It, yeah it was. - You think? We categorized every item that she has and then we built these drawers, just all the different tech stuff as well, you can see everything. - [Justine] Oh man. - [Jen] Same thing. - [Unknown Female] All of our cables-- - [Jen] So before, they were just kind of shoved in. (upbeat piano music) And then we just categorized everything, and these are just really great to have and easily accessible as well. - [Justine] So great. - [Unknown Female] Perfect. - [Justine] Now when I say \"Hey, where did I put that SD card?\" (laughing) That's where it is. So you guys may have seen this in Linus' tour, but this is, this whole closet, like all of this was all built out, like this wasn't here before. Garage, garage, garage. It's a process. So this is my Lego collection. This isn't the entire collection, but this is some stuff that I still wanted to build, that I haven't had time to build. I don't know if I ruined this one since the last time, um... don't open it. Oh boy, closet is probably one of my favorite things. Do you guys remember what this looked like. - Yup. - We do. - We do. (ominous music) (tech music) Progress is being made - [Justine] Wow, I can't wait to have an actual closet. (tech music) My undies are folded! So socks, now I just don't want to wear socks because I don't want to touch them. - [Jordan] Those are everything. - This is my favorite. - My shoes have a home! I've never actually worn these. The only time I wore them was to try them on in the store, but I thought one day... So, like, all my backpacks have a home. (sigh) - All your Tieks, color coded! - [Justine] Look at my Tieks! - Look! - [Justine] Oh my goodness, they are. Everything is perfect. I'm freaking out. Wow, everything is so organized, I just can't believe what this looked like before. (laughing) Can I help you? Matty loves it. Hi, honey! (upbeat techno music) Watch us how to fold socks. - Normally people just, like, you know, like, bunch it up, throw it in, and some people say socks have feelings-- - Eh... - I don't know if I'd go that far, but... - I wouldn't. (laughs) - We just like, place them together, we tuck them in, and they're beautiful. - So we do a file fold as well, so instead of shoving, same thing. - Matty, look at my swimsuits! - [Jordan] Matty, yes! - [Jen] Matty loves it. - [Justine] Matty, you want to go swimming? Do you want to go swimming? Let me put you in there, you want to go in the drawer? You want to go? No, I wouldn't do that to you. My camera bags are over here, I love the camo. Do you need a hat? Oh my gosh everything's folded so nicely in there too, it's like folded nicely and you can't even see it, see that's where I could just, you know, get away with like, throwing some stuff in there but no no no. - Not anymore. - [Justine] You gonna stretch? Okay, good boy. - [Unknown Female] You can stretch cause there's room to now. - [Jordan] What is this? - [Jen] What is that? - [Justine] You were walking over here and I was like... - Who put this here? - I think that might have been a note to maybe the... - [Jordan] The store? - Oh, this is the note because you can't hang leather, and so these are, no. - So sorry! - [Jordan] What is this. (laughing) - I am in trouble. I'm in trouble! - [Jordan] God. - Yeah, maybe it's like, Justine, why did you buy leather pants, you know you're not gonna wear them. Do you think I like camo? Well that is our tour, there's still so many more places that we didn't even show you but the before and after pictures was what I really wanted to show you guys, because, I mean, you guys did my entire house. - Mmmhmmm. - And it really did change my life, just having the peace of mind of things not everywhere. - Mmmhmmm and knowing where everything is. - Yes. - And loving everything you own. - It's so great, well thank you so much. I'll put Jen's links in the description, you guys go check her out, Life in Jeneral, her Instagram is such an inspiration and even like watching all of your stories and stuff-- - It's so fun. - You guys, like the process of doing all of this, is so amazing and I think they're going to love it. - Thank you. - Yes! Jordan do you want to come say bye to everybody? - Jordan, yay. - Hey, bye.",

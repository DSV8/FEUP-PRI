    "transcript": "- Imagine the kind of PC this kid would build. Ugh, pretty awful. Now imagine he never stopped. That's right. That kid was me. - Is that supposed to be a shocking twist? - Today, we're gonna be roasting the cringiest, most embarrassing builds from my past. And who better to join me than two of my kindest, most gracious paid friends. Three, if you count our sponsor Lenovo, who's featuring their brand new creator focused Yoga Pro 9i, known in North America as the Lenovo Slim Pro 9i with Intel 13th gen processors and Nvidia 40 series laptop graphics. (exciting music) Oh man. Where do we start our tour? - At the beginning. - I'm gonna have great context for all this stuff that was done when I was two years old. I can't wait till we get to 2015. - Oh man. This is how big this picture is. It's a recovery from when I lost all of my pictures and was only able to recover thumbnail sized images. - How old are you here? - Well, that's not me. - That's not him. - Oh. - Thanks, Jake. - I don't know. - But this is my setup, my hand me down setup from my uncle who was ditching his Pentium 166. - Holy (beep). Zed 95. - Yeah, the Z 95 sticker is legit. Is that a receiver? - Nope. Nope. That's a tape deck. - Oh. - This is sick. - 2002, baby. - Oh, and the corded phone, too. - That was to talk to my girlfriend. - That you can't use at the same time as the computer, I presume. - When did MSN Messenger come out? 2005. - Oh yeah. I was using MSN by this point. - Okay. Yeah. - Oh, when did 2005? I chatted with my sweetheart. Oh nine. That was Yvonne's handle with all the cringey, X's and brackets and stuff and everything around it. Yeah. This is my bedroom. - Yeah, the green. How did you get a match desk? - That was one of my parents' most proud Christmas gifts for me. I asked for Warcraft 2 and what I got was furniture. - Color matched. - Yeah. They were super pleased with their way of supporting my computer hobby without actually getting me any computer stuff or games ever. I was fine with the desk I had before. In fact, this desk was kind of awful. How much mousing space we got here? 2002. First computer I ever built for a client. MSN Messenger. - Who's Tyson? - My friend in high school. - Wait, so you built a computer for your client and then installed MSN on it and talked to your friend? - Don't ask me why I was doing that. I mean, his computer was probably better than the one I had at the time, so maybe I was using it for a little bit before delivery, I don't know. - Burn in period. - I suspect Lyle is like an alter ego and he just got it for himself. - No, no, he's dead. - Oh. - Oh. - My first gaming PC with a dedicated GPU. Let's go. - Wow, is it like translucent plastic? - Yeah. It was meant to match that era of iMac. - Oh. - Which my parents thought was super cool and got for me not realizing that my keyboard was in fact about 40% wider than the Apple keyboard at the time. And therefore, in order to use it, this is the technique I developed. - Yeah, you figured it out, right? You're actually using an Ergo keyboard, hey. - Yeah. Well that was what I was given. - Ah, somebody cared about you. - Yep. - Must be nice. - You were 16. You could have got a job. - I had a job. Which is how I afforded. - Look, this is two years after. He's 18. He should have moved his ass out by then. - This is my first build with a dedicated GPU. This is still Athlon XP. So same CPU is my original build, but I've upgraded from a motherboard with onboard graphics to an ASUS motherboard. - That's pretty big. - I feel like you guys aren't looking closely enough. - Oh my god. - No, I saw that. See, my problem was I was completely fine with that. - Yeah. See, like, I don't know if he's the best person for this video. Have you seen some of the jank (beep) he's done. - Beautiful. See, I, yeah, this works for me. - Is that just cable management? - I mean, it's electrical tape. - Yeah, but there's no windows. Who cares? - No, this case had a window. - Oh wow, it had a window? - Oh yeah. - Do you have unplugged headers in the bottom right? - No, back then your audio headers were either standard HD audio or you had to do the old PC 97 audio where you had to do each one individually. So that was the extras hanging off. - Did you plan on having more hard drives or you just put the fans there for looks? I mean looks is a bit of stretch. - I think that's for the GPUS. - Yeah, it's for GPU cooling. That's my All in Wonder 9600 Pro. - Cable manages great. - All right. I expected you guys to roast me for the cable management. - Oh no, I just was. That was sarcasm. - I see. - Oh, that fan. Whoa. Was that something you could buy or you painted that? - I found some UV reactive water boring paint on an art supply store. With the paint brush. - You mean at. This is 2004. You went to the store. - No, I had to order this online. - Really? - Oh, you couldn't find this stuff in stores. This was niche. - You painted the blades too? - I did, however, buy also online, this UV reactive IDE and floppy cable set, this UV green sleeving, and this arctic cooling GPU shroud tool. - I was gonna ask, that's not a new GPU is it? - Nope. - Nice. - It's got its own slot. - Caption for this. You merely adopted the three slot GPU. I was born in it, molded by it. - You just need some tape to cover up the top so you can't see that. - I mean, there's some tape in here. - I think I just. That's the old P6 connector. I apparently just cut it off. - So wait, you said you got a cable kit? - No, sleeving. - Oh, and there's just that one IDE cable. - Got really good quality UV heat shrink here. - Those cables that he bought would've come all pre-done. - Well these ones, yes. - Yes, that's what I was saying. - Oh yeah, I see the green. - Then the stuff that looks terrible would've been what he did. - I put some UV accents on the top of the heat sink here. - On purpose? Is that on purpose or you just dropped? - That's actually just jank, like that actually just looks terrible. I'm quite pro the do what you can setups but just painting poorly. Painting the tips of that heat sink looks. - Half of them. - Wow. Let's go. - I mean. - Is that how you left them though? - The heat sink still looks like trash. That's what I'm saying. The rest of it, the rest of it's like not that bad, but the heat sink looks terrible. - Not that bad? - Yeah. Okay. Those sleeves look okay. Are they managed well? No, but this, he doesn't have the shroud on in this picture yet. So I think this is an earlier picture where he's testing the UV. - It's like, you know what this looks like to me? When you see a horror movie and they have props that were designed by somebody that doesn't actually know what the thing is supposed to look like and they just throw things in there. Yeah, that looks like a computer. That's what Linus made. - Is this for the Lambo RAM fan? - Where is that? Is that really just, you left that there, you just, were you actually having cooling problems with your RAM or you just wanted pink? - The UV paint came in a kit. - Oh my god. You painted it orange. That was a choice. - This was when I bought the UV pen. I didn't think I had any pictures of this. I used a UV pen. - Oh my god. - To draw a trace light. I must have cleaned the GPU at some point 'cause I think I had problems with it. - That makes sense. - Oh we got the UV trace drawing mod. Oh, I totally didn't think that was here. - I can't even give you those points. - I just like that the CPU cooler was two toned. You did green underneath and orange blades. - My first surround sound speaker setup. - I like the height. One of them is Linus height. The other one was hung by his dad. - Still learning the alphabet there, I see. - Okay. This is the up. - Oh. That's your next set, yeah. - Logitech Zed 680 S. This is post UV paint. - Hey, you got a new keyboard, though. - Yes. Logitech MX Duo. Big upgrade and a freebie mouse pad. You're not even using it. - Well it was awful. Yeah, it was truly awful. Ugh. - No, that's cool. - Wow. - I'm on board with. I would, I'd ironically use a power supply like this today if I could. - Why is your blanket on top? - I don't know. - Insulation, man. - What are you even really trying to take a picture of right now? - What is that on the side of the desk? - That is a UV light. I wasn't happy with the amount of UV light that I could get from the little computer sized ones. - So that's why your side panel's always off 'cause you had an external UV light. - Oh, that might be it. - And external power supply. - That's a full, that's a full dick. Like black light from probably Spencer's gifts or like San Francisco or something. That was a chain store here that had novelties and sex toys and stuff. Whoa. - Ooh. - This was an exciting upgrade. Athlon 64, baby. And one of the dumbest decisions I ever made. This heat sink from Swift Tech was (beep) awful. - Oh, I'm sure. - And very expensive. These were helical coils. I have no doubt they spent a ton of money building the thing, but the performance was dog crap and I bought it completely sight unseen. No reviews. Learned a valuable lesson. - Yeah this is my test bench in literally my mom's basement. - What is that spray? You just used that arrow. - That is lubricating spray. Fun fact. I still own this can. It is at my house on a shelf. I used it. - What were you using it for? - I used it to lubricate the back door like a month ago. - But what were you using it for here? - I have no idea. - Nice. - Wow. - See I I think that's cool. - It is cool. - Okay, this is. - I still don't understand like what, why did you take a picture right now though? You're like 80% of the way to your cable management being done and then like, \"No, I'm gonna take a picture.\" - Wait, what the? Was that painter's tape like on the power supply? - Yes. - Oh, that's funny. Hey, that actually works okay, though. - You can see them all inside. What difference does it make? - It would be worse if it wasn't there. - Oh I don't know. Look, can I, you can see the cable still. Go to the next photo. Are we gonna get another angle where you can still totally see the rainbow spaghet? Yep. Nice. - Okay, he could have done. - I've got the window now, though. - You've done a better job. - Oh man. Look at that. - Intel inside. - Nope. - AMD? - AMD inside, baby. - Did you do that yourself? - No, I bought it from AMD. - I was gonna say that looks actually pretty good inside. - Oh yeah. - Let's go. - Also I could play. - You got a desk. - Only the finest games. - Yeah. Big desk upgrade. - Big desk energy. He finally got the mouse pad upgrade. Piece of A4 paper. He cut it to size, though. - Nope. Nope. That's full size. It's just taped down to the desk so it doesn't move. I was a speaker's boy. I spent all my money on speakers and I was literally in my parents' basement. - Is that tire? - That is a tire. - Oh these are those ones. - This is threaded rod. Just like some weird bracket. - Piece of metal you had laying around. - And a tire that happened to thread into the thing with the. - Did you take it from like a wheelbarrow or you bought that at the hardware store? - No, no, my dad helped me with this. He bought this specifically for this, yeah. - This is all new. Designed like this. - Yes. By design. - I mean it worked. It was probably cheaper than buying. - I grew up in shanty town. - You gotta make stuff happen. Not everything needs to be perfect. I still can't let you go on the paper mouse pad. You clearly had the funds to get a mouse pad. - I was buying more lights and more UV (beep). - UV paint. - All right. It's 2005, baby. - Oh, this is an iconic photo. Your village called, the idiot is missing. - What's on your screen? What's going on? Are you pirating right now? Is that like Limewire? - This is probably piracy. - That looks like some form of that. - I remember the icons at the bottom of like Limewire and Frostwire. I'm pretty sure that's Limewire. - I literally have $500 speakers and a $3 desk. - You have two monitors now. - Yep. Yep. - Was that one also a hand me down? - No. Oh, the black one is super expensive. - You bought that? - That's a P95F+B. - Did you have a job at this time? - Oh yeah. - What were you doing? - I'm lifeguarding at this point. You can't tell because I wear shirts that are too big for me. But I'm actually like kind of jacked 'cause I'm doing martial arts and lifeguarding. - Weird flex but okay. - Yeah, no I, this is the best shape I was ever in in my life. I look like a tool obviously. But the monitor's good. I mean doesn't compare to how far we've come. The pure site pro OLED touchscreen on this thing is 3K resolution, so literally four times as many pixels as that monitor. A hundred percent coverage of the sRGB DCIP 3 and Adobe RGB color space, automatic switching, and a Delta E of less than one outta the box. That thing by comparison, actual garbage. First rattle can paint job. - I thought it was just like dark lighting. - Yeah. - I feel like this is when like you and Bob spray painted a silver case silver. I feel like it's pretty similar. - No, no. My computer, no, no, no. I reject. - No heat sinks on your RAM. Kind of disappointed. - Wait, this is. - This is later. This is my first water cooling setup. - I was gonna say. - Thermaltake big water SE, baby. Hey there's my UV paint, though. - Have you bought like multiple kits at this point? - Nope. - Just remember it was hard to find special order online. - It was. - Oh my god. - It's baby Yvonne. Fun fact. - Same. - Did she just like wearing that? Or do you take a picture, set desk in the background, and then take another picture? - Truthfully, I don't know. This is when I moved into Yvonne's parents' house. - Oh. - Man, you had class back then moving into your girlfriend's house. Girlfriend's parents' house. Sorry, sorry. - Shout out Sophia and Albert. Guys are awesome. - Still got the speakers. They're actually in surround configuration now. Not rear. Right beside your head. - I think the desk is an upgrade though because the previous one was uneven. - Yeah, I know. And now he's got space for his UV paint. I will say despite all of the changes, he still doesn't have his speakers behind his monitor. - Athlon 64 X2. There it is. Still the single most expensive computer component I've ever bought. It was about 700, $750 for a CPU. - That's when things started getting actually kind of sick though, in my opinion. - And this is what, 2005? - 2006, baby. - It says 2005 on the photo. - Then the metadata must be wrong. This was, yeah, so late 2005. I don't know why this picture exists. - Well thanks for sharing it with us. - My first SLI setup. Yeah, these are 7800 GTXs. - Did you paint those heat sinks, too? Did it actually come with blues? Those look like official. - Those are from Zelman. Those are just blue heat sinks. - Oh you just put them on aftermarket. - Yeah, my first custom water cooling setup. - A few big jumps. Are you making more money now? Did you job switch at this point? - I'm at NCIX at this point. - Oh okay. Okay, yeah. Because I'm like there's the Athlon X2 is a big jump. Custom water cooling is a big jump in expense. - Wait, am I at NCIX yet? No, I'm not at NCIX yet. I'm painting houses now. - Oh, so now you got some money. - Yeah. I have a little bit of money. - That Swift Tech block. We still have that, don't we? - We do. - Up and to the left of the water. What's that? - What a wonderful question. That is a fan I destructively clipped off of an Arctic cooling freezer something. It was this weird L bracketed fan that they built specifically for one of their tower coolers. And I was like, you're useful. And I added all these heat sinks to my VRM and then clipped that fan there. - Sick. - Maybe double-sided taped, actually. - I enjoyed the like aftermarket heat sink stuff when that was in vogue for a little while. - What was the pump? - Got the classy worm drive clamps. Well you don't want it to leak, do you? Flash photography. - Oh you upgraded the tape. - The tape is better. - No it's not tape. Oh wait, is it tape? - This is giant heat shrink. It didn't shrink. I just stretched it on there by putting one of the cables in at a time and like reefing on it. - Yeah, it looks worse than the tape. - Really? You don't see as much color though. - I love all your shirts. They're just like, look at how stupid I am. It was the village idiot and now evolution went wrong. Oh my God. - Oh, let's go. - This is a big step forward. - First chiller test run. I posted this on extreme systems so I had these little captions to explain what I was doing 'cause it wasn't evident from just the picture itself. - So this was a birthday present? - Yes, this was a birthday present from Yvonne. Can you tell she's a keeper? Yeah. I bought windshield deicer, but I used water for the test run. This seems like a good time to point out how far we've come in terms of performance and cooling. This has a custom 13th gen intel processor with a smaller package that allows the same performance in a smaller chassis and up to a RTX 4070 laptop GPU with time saving machine learning and media acceleration for industry leading creative apps. The Pro 9i is also custom tuned with Lenovo X power to deliver the best possible performance in all applications with high-speed DDR5 and NDB storage, efficient cooling, and software that optimizes power consumption based on the application you're running. See I didn't have that so I needed sub-zero cooling. - I love that you bought like the windshield deicer and then used it to prop up the cooler and then like to fill extra space, you didn't have to get as much water. It's almost like you could have just poured it in to do the same thing and it wouldn't have frozen over. - Also did she figure out all the stuff or did you like give her a list of parts? - We went shopping together. - Oh okay. - Yeah, we went shopping for my birthday. - Okay. That's cool. - Is she a sweetheart or not? - Is this just glue? - That is silicone. - There we go. - Oh. - I was pretty sure it wasn't vaseline. - That ain't coming off. - Oh my God. Why? - I have not learned about that yet. And this was a brand new motherboard. This was my core two dual upgrade. 6,600 baby. - Even if you like tried to peel that off, you probably rip those calves off. - Oh yeah. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, you're destroying the board. - Yeah, and it stank. - Oh and the CPU is in there, too. Oh my god. - This was a mistake. Believe it or not, I actually attended LAN parties with this system as it is. - How did you carry it? - See I want to trash on it but I'm so into it. I actually love this. - I've got real UV fans now. - Oh yeah. - Was this like you'd unplug all the cables and then you could like cart it or did you undo a lot of this in order to? - You'd take the the block off, I imagine. - I think I just got help carrying it. - Jesus Christ. - I think I had to carry it as one piece. I don't even think I drained it. - Oh my god. - And you didn't like dolly it or anything? - No. - Just carried it? - I didn't have a dolly. Like what are you talking about? - Desk change again. - Logitech G15, baby. - Massive keyboard upgrade. That mouse was so cool 'cause it had these batteries so it was wireless and it had rechargeable batteries and you can see the base just to the top right of his mouse pad. - Oh yeah. - You'd flip the mouse over, press a button, and it would like fire the battery out. You'd press a button on that base, it would fire that battery out and you'd slot it back in. It's like reloading. - Like magazine change mouse battery. - Yeah, it was actually so, for the time, it was amazing. - He wore deodorant. That's good. Why is there an Yvonne sticker? - Because this is Yvonne's bedroom. - Oh, right. So you're just using her desk now? - So we had the same keyboard and the same mouse. - Yeah. I had a better monitor than you, though. That's probably my second biggest ever personal investment 'cause it was like six, $700 on a monitor, which seemed crazy to me at the time. - Oh, is that the really big one? - It's the 2004 FPW which isn't big anymore. It's a 24 inch monitor but it was 16 by 10. - Yeah, I was just gonna say. Just like the Lenovo Yogo Pro (beep). Yogo. - That extra vertical space makes such a big difference for everything. 16 by nine was a mistake. - Especially on a laptop. - Yeah, we've undone that mistake. So happy. - What was the, wait. What was the name of that last file? Hold on, go back. Why do I keep my computer in my girlfriend's bedroom? - This is not my personal rig but this is the first water cooled PC I ever built for an NCIX customer. - There's the, okay, you can see the inverter box that like weird, like off light blue. I told you they were all like that. - I actually delivered this to a client, which is embarrassing to me now. We fast forward a little bit. My girlfriend bought me a Silverstone TJ07. - Ooh. - So this is never side panel on? - No, this is mid working on stuff. - Well the tube goes out of the case. That side panel's flush. - That's my T line. When we're done, that will wrap up here and hide away. - Oh yeah, he's got it plugged in. - That is nail polish. - Ah, so that's what you used. - No, it was something else before. I don't know. - Just anything that can fit in the end, I guess. - He just needed the coolant to go down so he could take the block off. - Pretty clever, right? We have a bunch because every time I saw them, I grabbed them and took them home. - So you started the trend. It's really just company culture at this point. - Ooh. Linus actually starting to have some swagger with his builds. - I like this a lot. I was never a fan of that, say the cable wrap. You did it a bunch of times. - Yeah, I know. - It was never a fan of that. But other than that this is like actually sick. - Well what else would you do? I guess just zip tie it behind? - Oh was this after you got it painted, too? - Yes. - Or sandblasted? - Yes. This is after I got it powder coated by Mountain Mods. - So you had to ship the whole case to some guy? Like this wasn't local? Wow. - Oh, I'm doing maintenance on the CPU and the GPU. So it's empty. - No, Jake pointed out. What'd you do to your wrap? - He did that on purpose. - No. That was a deal. Thermo Chill was based in the UK, couldn't figure out how to package their products. And a solid quarter of one of our shipments was bashed in. So I negotiated a little discount on this radiator that I might have checked to make sure was in fact still working. Can I just buy this as is? - He did it with a lot of things. - Just coil stuff around. - Why cut when you can manage? - Well even the light. - This is pretty dope. - Yeah, this is sick. - Like it was bad before but we're getting there. - Can we bring back UV? Man, I love it. - You're missing some cables. No. 24 pin, isn't it there? That, wait, what? Isn't it? Yeah, you just, oh you haven't? Ah. - Oh I'm leak testing. Wow. I was actually doing due diligence. - Yeah. That's what I said. - Caught on camera. - That dual monitor. - Oh, I didn't even see it. - The casual couch monitor. Yeah, why not? - It's just sitting on the couch. This isn't in her bedroom anymore. You've upgraded to the living room. - Yeah, I'm in the family room in the den. - Wow. The parents must've really liked you. - No, they were just extremely supportive of their daughter. - Oh. Really supportive. - They weren't a big fan of me in the early days. - I was gonna say, have you met 'em? - Yeah. - Very supportive. - Holy support. - So you like trashed their family room? - Oh my God. - I mean that's one way of putting it. - What a jerk. - What did you take this photo with? Like what happened to? - Took a test bench home from work. - Oh yeah. Yeah. That's what the couch monitor is for. That's a test bench. I'm probably benchmarking FX. This is that story that I've told so many times about how A & D promised me this thing was great. So I like pulled an all-nighter to get great performance from it because clearly I was doing something wrong. And then in the next morning I found out it was a piece of (beep) when all the other reviews came out. Not impressed. So were you just benching it because of being a PM or being interested? Or was this actually like for an article? - NCIX had launched Hardware Connects by this point, which they didn't disclose belonged to them, but definitely, definitely belonged to them. - They ever disclose that?. - Well it doesn't belong to them anymore. So I guess it doesn't matter. - But has anyone ever brought that up before online? - I don't think they ever publicly acknowledged it. That's fine. - Yvonne probably studying. - Yeah. Oh yeah. Yvonne's studying to pay for me to just do nothing but this all day. Okay. 2008. So this must be the night before a launch of something. - How's that keyboard? - Oh that's a good question. Really nice keyboard. It's quiet. One and a half millimeters of travel. Concave keycaps. Really comfortable. Nice large track pad and machine learning enhancement on the five megapixel webcam with physical privacy shutter. No, it was Phenom. I call it Phenom because it was part of their spider platform. So like Venom, Phenom. And that's what they sold to me. Everyone else calls it Phenom, but that's why I do it. AMD's fault. Our side by side gaming setups. - Like you renting a whole house or? - This is the house I grew up in. I borrowed a house from my dad who was traveling abroad and didn't have a tenant at the time and Yvonne was doing her practicum in Towassen. So it was actually really close. - So he just let you live there for free? - So we were just living there for free. - Their desk is so much worse than yours. - They're both awful. - Yeah, they look pretty bad on it. - This one, you see these supports? - Oh, I didn't. That's rough. - Yeah, this thing just falls over. Because these don't lock at all. - Oh no. - So when these would pop out it would just. - Oh, yeah. - Racing wheel in the customary spot in its box. 'Cause whoever uses those damn things? - Hey, hey. - Recognize the Samsung true direct DVD drive that I definitely didn't steal from work. - You still have that, too. - I know. - Mousepad upgrade. Pretty massive. Finally cares. - Steel series Acari. - Ooh, Steel series. - I was starting to get free stuff by this point. That Acari and that mousepad definitely made their way to me from Steel series. Sorry, I had something in my eye. Yvonne's first custom gaming PC. - Oh my god. - This is the first wifey PC. - That's a bunch of cop. Okay. So this is, a lot of this is reused stuff from your old build. Not a bad thing. - Yes. - Not a bad thing. - Yes. - Did you have to talk her into this or she was just like, \"Whatever, I don't care.\" - No, she was down to game with me. - Okay. - Well I mean like to make her computer like this? - Yeah, she's all about just doing whatever I do. I mean look at this company. - Yeah. This is true. This is true. Come a long way. - Thank you, hun. This is my desk at work. I can explain this. - Isn't that yours? - My work PC somehow got requisitioned with a really good power supply. Do as I say, not as I do, all of you. Don't you guys like my monitor stands? - I wanna zoom in on the screen. So let's see what kind of work Linus was doing. Oh, that's Steel series. I see you're talking to someone at Steel series. Hey, can I get another free mouse pad? - I'm ordering OCZ SSDs. - Yeah, go over to the right. - Here's our prices. Hold on, hold on. These are, this is interesting. Oh, I can't really read it. That's gotta be a 250 gig. No, no, there's no way that's, that's probably 60 gig at 180 bucks. I am skewing up some stuff. This is the NCIX internal sales report. - And then MSN. - All the chat rooms open. - I see a bunch of pink texts 'cause Linus used to do that. - Pink Comic Sans, bold, italics. This is work. We actually used this for internal messaging at work. - And he ran pink Comic Sans, bold, italics. - We still do now. Teams. - Fun fact. I called my office the box office, not because I was a video celebrity, but because it was literally made of these banker boxes. Do you see them in the background? - That's a wall that you made. - There was no wall. - Oh my god. - My entire office was made of banker boxes. I was just in a hallway. The pants make a reappearance. Now we're back at Yvonne's parents' house. Taking inventory, maybe? Oh, that's funny. Those boxes I was using as monitor stands. Were those the boxes for these? - Hmm? Were they at your house. - When you see it. - Oh my god. - When you see it. - Which part? The water bottle? Is that what we're talking about? - The reservoir. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - It's great. Yeah. Oh, so sick. Are those Gunnar's? - Those are polarized 3D glasses. - Oh no. - For the IZED 3D gaming monitor that I took home for testing. It was awful. I was doing work here. That is not me getting free stuff. That is work. That monitor was a piece of (beep). - Can I ask like, okay. Throughout all of these years of photos, there's always Tums on your desk. - That is the same bottle. - What? - In every single one. Because I always intended to take calcium supplements. I never remembered to do it and so I would just always have it on my desk 'cause I'm like, \"I'm totally gonna start taking these this time.\" - You were taking Tums as a calcium supplement? - Well he intended to, but never did. - I mean I apparently never did. - Why? Just. - Okay. If people go back and archeology it, it might be a slightly different bottle. I guarantee you I never bought more than like two bottles of them. - Oh my God. 3D vision surround. Wow. Where did you post this? - Probably on the forum or something. I was testing something for something. This is in the Linus Tech Tips era. So this might have even been in a video. This became the nursery for my kids. But until it was the nursery, it was my benchmarking room. - Aw. - Yeah. Rocket and Rumble. They deserve to be in the video. Okay. This isn't my computer. I don't think this ever saw the light of day, but I found this. - Oh my god. - That's really cringe actually. - Yeah, so. - I used to like Mushkin, so that sucked. - No, this is not Mushkin. I did this. - Oh. - I'm pretty sure they rejected this campaign. - Yeah, that's good. - Yeah, it's pretty bad. - What a goof. - I learned a lot. I was the PM for Mushkin. We had some MDF to spend and I was like, this must have been Tom. I was like, \"We should do like this.\" And I'm pretty sure this never went out. But if you ever saw it, I'm sorry. - He still took photos. - Are you sure he also still stole that chair from work? - No. - That's from work, isn't it? - Oh yeah. Ergo direct. - Moving on. You gonna make it loop? You're gonna have to run. - That'll be his boss. - Oh. - Nice. That flex, though. And Lenovo is flexing their offer.

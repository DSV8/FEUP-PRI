    "description": "Welcome to the Intel 10th Gen processor lineup confusion Round 2!  They're now launching Comet Lake, a lineup of processors based on an old 14nm architecture that's being marketed as 10th Gen and it uses the 10-series names.  Not only that but its actually BETTER than Ice Lake in many ways...wait, what?  Let's jump in!

    "transcript": "alright guys here we are again with another Intel video and if you thought things were going bad in the last one hold on to that and try not to laugh too hard because actually coming to think of it you're better off laughing than crying at what I'm about to show you now I'll remind you that a few weeks ago I published a quick video explaining Intel's new Ice Lake notebook lineup and the downright confusing naming scheme that Intel gave these new CPUs absolutely ridiculous if you are interested in going through that mess again link is right over here but today today until is taking that Namie scheme and doubling down on it by announcing Comet Lake and no they're not test out parts but more thin and light notebook CPUs that directly compete against ice lake in many cases just just let that sink in for a moment now even though they just announced the tangent eyesight processors on the ten nanometer node Intel is gonna be launching more products that are still gonna be under the tension family and get these guys these new CPUs are going to be using the old 14 nanometer process I think I think this is probably a good time to roll the sponsor message what would you like so I'm looking for a gaming headset with a bit of everything but not overkill something that folds on your neck sure how about the light frame without excessive clamping force yes yes you comfortable ear cushions with proper internal padding excellent I will take the cable and the microphone are removable fine fine this is the one multi-platform compatibility with virtual surround sound dongle avail can I just take one and the sound quality you'll be satisfied with so the new Coolermaster MH 751 and 75 to are here to make you gaming experience alright so now that we're done paying some bills let's approach this from a more calm or perspective and explain what's going on here now the new naming scheme might be absolutely downright ridiculous and I'll get to that in a little bit but I think I might be more excited for comet Lake than Ice Lake it feels like Intel might be pushing the new Ice Lake processors into a niche and that might sound weird but I'll get to that in just a bit what Intel is doing here is basically using the same existing technology and creating a whole new lineup of products that are supposed to offer better performance fourth in inline notebooks so these new CPUs are gonna be replacements for previous gen whiskey Lake and amber Lake processors so that means you're going to be getting more cores higher frequencies and they consume about the same amount of power so what's the difference between Comet Lake and Ice Lake check this out even though Ice Lake is based on ten nanometers it actually consumes more power on average comes with less cores and operate at much lower frequencies seeing a 6-quart well threaded Comet Lake processor coming to thin and light notebooks is pretty cool but man the fact that a previous gen architecture is being brought in now seems like a bitter pill to swallow for Intel fans doesn't it but ice Lake does come with integrated gen eleven hours plus graphics in some variants while comet Lake will still use the old gen 9 GPUs both natively support Wi-Fi 6 - nice lake will also have integrated Thunderbolt 3 which is optional on comet Lake and significantly higher speeds as well as for performance yeah it's pretty incremental over the previous gen with cubic processors but from what we've seen this is pretty much aligned with what ice Lake will offer - when directly comparing fork or a thread parts and that brings me to the real problem with this launch the way how intel is naming these new CPUs and I know that I might sound like a broken record from the last video but if you take a look at this you'll see what I'm saying this is just freaking ridiculous it's like intel needs flowcharts to explain their names now but I'll try my best to explain it on both processor series the i7 I five and I three names will stick around after that isolate gets a four-digit number showing it's in the 10th gen with a ten before two numbers that show this skew or relative performance in this case it's a 65 the final two characters show what type of tension graphics will be inside so in this case of vg7 g4 and g1 comet Lake on the other hand is where things get a bit crazy since it has a five digit number that sort of follows current CPUs instead of a seven eight or nine there's ten in front of the product number they're even keeping the uny product lines so the comet Lake series actually makes sense sorta the problem is that comet Lake isn't being launched into a vacuum remember both these cpu families will be sold at the same time and are basically targeting the same market while having very similar product names Intel has given them identical branding the only real difference is that some but not all eyesight processors feature Intel iris plus graphics indication so here's the full comment Lake lineup and you know what guys it's pretty straightforward and there are some pretty exciting CPUs in it but you might notice all the you series lower tvp's have been increased to 15 watts from whiskey Lakes 10 watts I'm guessing that's to compensate for the increased frequencies but here's my problem with all of this comet Lake is being sold as 10 gen but it clearly isn't because as I mentioned earlier these are just updated whiskey Lake notebook CPUs with more cores higher frequencies and Wi-Fi 6 slapped onto them they're still on 40 nanometer still use gen 9 graphics cores they still don't have native Thunderbolt 3 support and there are on ancient skylake core architecture I mean come on so you might be asking well Eber why isn't Intel selling PS as 9,000 you and why Series since whiskey Lake used the 8000 series names wouldn't that make more sense look this isn't about putting the well-being of customers like you guys first in fact this whole brining BS is to help Intel's partners sell as many notebooks as they can to make it look like they all have a brand new architecture so yeah I think we all should be pissed now according to Intel they're focused on launching workload optimized platforms that means they'll use whatever architecture suits a products best case scenario and yes they'll even reuse older designs like comet Lake to make that happen so what does that mean for ice Lake well it's targeted buyers are likely the ones who want to leverage upcoming AI deep learning algorithms and increased graphics horsepower and hey that's Intel story and they're sticking to it meanwhile the commonly Q&Y series offer higher levels of productivity and multi-turret workloads I guess we'll have to see how this all plays out but I'm thinking there's still going to be a ton of overlap I'm gonna wrap this up here with a bit of very honest spec since I'm tired of a shenanigans and frustrated I think I get what happened it feels like Intel can't get enough production from their 10 a meter process or ice Lake isn't performing up to their expectations maybe it's a combination of both I'm sure Intel would love a top-to-bottom ice Lake line up instead of relaunching 40 nanometer but that's not what's happening here instead we get this weird transition where two different architectures are being marketed as tension it sucks for us since we have to make sense of it for you guys and it sucks even more for buyers either way this all feels like Intel's throwing everything that they can at the wall to see what sticks out it's a bit of a panic so here's what I'm gonna do game D hi there I'm looking at you we're all looking at you you know Intel's opening the door you just gotta walk right through it and don't screw up",

    "transcript": "- Today, we're gonna answer the question, is the Zaunkoenig M1K i the world's lightest mouse? Spoiler, the answer is yes. All right, this comes in a box that honestly feels lighter than a lot of mice that I've held. So that's a good sign. This is a crowdfund and nice, and the whole purpose was to make the world's lightest mouse. It's very specific. It's not an all purpose mouse. In fact, as you can see right here no scroll wheel, no side buttons. All it is, is sensor two buttons. So for some games, it's gonna be fine, for others it's gonna be bad, but as I play mostly FPS, I am the target audience for this. So I'm excited to see how this does. Like the mouse is no frills this box is very no-frills. It's literally a mouse, some foam, that's it. It's a nice box though. You can put some stuff in there. That's a pretty long cable. That's not bad. As you can see part of how they reduce the weight as instead of having plastic it's actually the world's first carbon fiber mouse you can see the kind of texture underneath. They also accomplish it by having a honeycomb plastic underneath. The creators don't like honeycomb on the hand, I get it just like Logitech, it kind of feels weird if it gets dirty but underneath, as you can see they have done that to shed some weight. And man, look how tiny this little PCB is. So it doesn't even extend past here. It's really just tiny little PCB, sensor and buttons. And then they're Omron ones, I think they're rated for 2 million made in Japan. These are pretty good switches, very common, they feel fine, there's no side buttons and there's no scroll wheel. Some people think that's a contentious issue but honestly I think the perfect gaming mouse would have no scroll wheel. For all the games I play, I select my weapons using the numbers. So I don't ever use the scroll. And if as a third button it's kind of the (beep) button of the three. And so I'm into the idea of no scroll wheel. However, I want a third button and the side buttons and really on the body in terms of lightness there's not much to comment on. Because they're trying to shed weight there's not much glide pad. So I'm excited to see if that is a less smooth experience. It might be and lightness isn't everything, as we're about to discover, there's other factors that make a good mouse like shape. As you can see, this looks like one of those tiny little Microsoft mice you could buy in the 2000s or little wireless ones that my mom used and they were good for her, but not for gaming. This is a very particular shape. It's insanely light. Like having it here it doesn't even feel like I'm really moving something. My hand feels like more of a burden than this mouse. Honestly, it's pretty crazy. Holy smokes. And it's because it's so light. Those tiny little glide pads kind of do the job. I mean, to achieve 21 grams which is how light this mouse is, we'll measure it after, they had to make it a wired mouse. Obviously, if you put a battery in there you're gonna hit 50, 60 grams pretty quick. Even the lightest wireless mouse, G Pro X Superlight is like three times heavier than this. Batteries they're heavy. And if you're going for this title you can't have a battery. So it's 21, to 22 ish grams depending on how much of the cables there. So I'd say yeah, they definitely have accomplished their goal of 23 grams or lighter. So they have a cable it's not braided but it's a specially designed. So I don't know what the durability is like, but it's light. And like even here it doesn't really feel that hard to drag around. So I think that's the idea, is it's not gonna be the most that you're gonna have for the rest of your life, but they wanted to have the smoothest lightest experience. So I don't know if there's much else to say on the mouse itself, it's not particularly comfortable although that's the last thing I expected was to find it comfortable. I think this is the gold standard in mice. Obviously one difference is it's wireless versus wired. It's a lot heavier 61 grams versus 23 grams. Although this feels frigging, is this a Superlight? It feels heavier than mine. Maybe I'm getting spoiled by this. Now this feels like a dead weight like a dumbbell I'm pushing around. This isn't the lightest pad it's got the glide pads it's a little bit heavier, but in terms of shape I think the G pro X is clearly more designed for the average human hand. There's more buttons. It's a flawless sensor. The buttons are very similar and there's way more glide pad. And so, although this isn't a bad experience this is way smoother even though it's heavier. There's not much else to say about this mouse other than this is the no-frills of mice. This is the grocery store you go to they don't even sell plastic bags. You got to bring your own cardboard boxes. That's pretty much it let's plug it in and see how it goes but before we do that, let's talk about our sponsor PIA, private internet access is a VPN that lets you access services and websites as if you were in a different country. It encrypts all of your internet traffic and uses a safe, protected IP. You can connect up to 10 devices at once and there's clients for windows, Mac iOS, Android, iOS, and Linux. You can buy a one-year plan for 39.95 at the link in the description below. Oh yeah. So I'm trying to download the software and this mouse proves itself not to be a daily driver. 'Cause immediately I was trying to scroll as if this was like the magic mouse and then it was like a capacitive touch scroll. Nope, this is a not great. Let's try and see if this mouse really does do what it does best with the old classic Rainbow Six, it's new season, time to play. I actually haven't played the new season. I haven't had time to practice, get warmed up. And so too scared. I wanna be a winner, you know. Maybe this mouse is what makes me a winner. So first impression I can already feel my hand kind of like tensing up. At least my wrist. It's not a super comfortable shape. Like it's certainly not ergonomic. I don't know what the opposite of ergonomic is, but it is that. I can already tell I'm going to miss the side buttons but that's not a big deal, not everyone uses those side buttons for games. Okay, we're gonna compare to the G Pro X Superlight. This is the mouse I have at home, this is what I think is the best mouse money can buy right now. You can see by the shape of this mouse there's really only one way you're going to hold it. You're going to be clawing this mouse pretty hard. And as I'm kind of a hybrid person I get my palm on the mouse and then claw up little bit. It's not very comfortable to have my palm nowhere and kind of have to shape it. I think that's why my hand tensed up a little bit before. If you're a natural claw maybe this mouse would feel pretty good for you but it's not my hand shape. Immediately it feels a lot heavier, which is surprising. This felt like the lightest thing I've ever held before today. It's still a smoother experience. It's a little bit heavier, but it's still so light. There's not a big difference. I was having a pretty hard time making the firmware work on the other mouse. Whereas Logitech, it might be a little bit heavier of a software, but it's just an executable that you run and then it's working and it's super easy to configure all your Logitech devices in one place. So that's definitely a big benefit that it's kind of a more refined product. I say that I want to gain mouse without a scroll wheel but now that I've tried it I can already tell how it's annoying. You take it for granted how many times you just scroll even in a game, like just the menus. I would definitely have to get used to it or like assign like a modifier that I could press and drag or something. It's not impossible but it feels insurmountable at this moment. If I was a flake master this mouse would be frigging insane. There's no resistance, I can go like 40 inches in a second. I feel like it's pretty accurate to what I'm used to, which is surprising. I was worried that I would like overcompensate, overshoot a lot, but feels pretty frigging precise. And I mean like the sensor is a flawless sensor so I wasn't too sure worried about it being inaccurate. But I really thought that the weight would just throw me off but I'm actually liking more than I thought I would. All right. All right. Okay, okay. Maybe this mouse has something going on. Yeah, it feels like it's really precise. Like there's no momentum to your big swings, your flicks, feels like it's just kind of like my brain is connected to my hand and my hand is just moving. I will say the shape is always gonna get in the way. I think that something, this light in a slightly different shape might be better. It might not be possible. This is like such a small shape and to get something this weight, but it's more comfortable. It's probably just not feasible physically but I wanna give it another go because I'm a surprised I thought it would be pooping all over this mouse for the whole video. I think this is an incredible proof of concept and that they can make a mouse this light. But I think what I would like to see is kind of a compromise, something that uses this technology, the kind of breakthroughs they've had but then make some more complete mouse. I'm okay with no scroll wheel. I could learn to live with that but no third button, no like side buttons. It's kind of hard. The shape's a little bit off, but the precision is real. And I didn't really think I was gonna notice a huge difference, but every frigging short circuit I do I am realizing how much more I shouldn't have gotten a G Pro X Superlight between 8K which this mouse has but we weren't able to get working in this video. And the insane lightness, mice are gonna keep getting better. And that's exciting. Cause like the Kickstarter, which is over now this most cost 249 euros. So that's like 300, 350 US. That's pretty (beep) pricey, when you compare it to 150 for the G Pro X and you're gonna get a complete mouse and this would be the only mouse you need. Clearly this becomes a little less appealing but they nailed what they set out to do, make what they claim is the world's lightest mouse make it the world's first carbon fiber mouse. And now we know it's possible. Maybe that's the next era of mice the next little shaving off of weights. This is a really cool product. And I'm very glad I to try it today. So thank you for watching.

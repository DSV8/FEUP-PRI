    "transcript": "Martin it feels sometimes that the sky is falling that you know there just threats and threats and threats and threats. You've mentioned in previous videos and perhaps you can share it now top four things that companies can do to protect themselves. So um the first one patch, patch, patch, patch, patch again it's boring, it's difficult but if there's just one thing to focus on it's that. Secondly Two-Factor Authenticationmake it difficult for the bad guys to use stolen credentials. Make sure that you've got end point protection on every single system so if it does get compromised we can detect those attacks and then that last one back up your data back up your important data so that if it does get wiped or it does get encrypted you can just restore it. I say the sky falling because it feels sometimes that we losing this battle. No, absolutely it you know yes we have to take cyber security seriously it's something that we need to do, you take your life into your hands every time you cross the road we just need to accept where we are, except the threat landscape and how we respond against that.",

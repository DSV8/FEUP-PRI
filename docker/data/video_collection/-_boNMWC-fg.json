    "transcript": "Ok! You're wondering why there are so many different bottles on the table right now. *fizz* I'm wondering the same thing Every so often, Jack calls me in here and tells me we've got work to do and I'm like you know what, I don't know what you're talking about buddy. And today this is what I find. Personally, I think the man's gone off the rails a little bit. Oh! What'd he do? Oh he emptied the bottle of Gray Goose. Is that a man you can trust? Didn't think so! No, seriously. There is a reason for this setup right now. I've got product in front of me of me. Its a kickstarter right now. As I understand, they sent me an early prototype. There's not even any packaging here. This is the unit. Its called the cork. And this little guy turns any bottle into a Bluetooth speaker. Never even knew that would be something the humans would want. Apparently its interesting. In fact, their kickstarter already passed the goal, so... This unit can fit on top of, look, any bottle. Just like that. Boom! And now that bottle becomes a speaker. You're confused, I'm confused. Jack's always confused. It looks like a Bluetooth speaker to a certain extent but then, it's got these strange little adaptors on it. The speaker unit can work with various different types of bottles. So this tip here would obviously go on a bottle like this. This other one is slightly more flexible and that goes on usually taller bottles. Anyway it doesn't really matter, you don't need to worry about it because when you get the product it comes with both and they're kinda attached like this. This thing charges up the micro USB. It uses Bluetooth. It has a single button on the front. Should be good for about 12 hours of battery life. Now, why would you want this instead of a traditional Bluetooth speaker? The idea here is that this is way more portable. Right, it fits in your pocket. In most environments there's a bottle somewhere; these things, they're always in our lives. So they're calling it something... what did they call it? \"Upcycling\" instead of recycling, like you're upgrading. The functionality of a bottle. Maybe you've got a favourite bottle sitting around. But the point being is that there's also kind of a custom component in the sense that you can find a bottle that you think gives you the best sound, and the most fun. Now, you see it comes in a couple of different colors: black, white, silver. And look this this... kind of burgundy, which is perfect for the wine connoisseur in your life. I can see you already, you're at that party going \"no, no, no, no, no\" I'll be handling the music this evening... and everybody's like... \"how does it sound?\" \"Is this all worth while!?\" Find out next time on Unbo- HAHAHAHA *bleeps* Oh! Press and hold for couple seconds: It's in pairing mode. Time for some tunes. I gotta connect to this baby real quick. [tune plays] Okay... So it's a speaker on it's own! Very directional though. Grab the Great Goose. Whoa! The bottle adds the bass! Without the bottle... and then with the bottle. Somehow, what ends up happening here is that the low frequencies get amplified with the added resonance of a chamber, in this case a glass bottle. Now, I noticed on this grey goose bottle that they actually drilled a hole out a port on it so this is like DIY speaker scenario here. Now it has a little more crispiness to it. Right outta the port. It does work as advertised. It certainly gets an added kick an amplification from a bottle Plus you get to be that cool kid, that just shows everybody that you can turn their bottle into a speaker. They're sitting there, you're like \"you know I can make that a speaker\" and they're like, \"excuse me\" And you're like, \"pass it over!\" Quick rants. Booyah! Bingo! Now you've got yourself a party. *speaker, Lewis' voice* : \"You want to get a fresh, smooth nice looking new phone. But here's a thing you don't think about. You don't think about shattering that brand new device, do you? You don't think about what their screens are gonna look like when little shards of glass end up underneath your skin!\" It's going to have way more low-end than a Bluetooth speaker of comparable size that doesn't have this added functionality. For sure. Everyone's got some fresh, new ideas on what to do when they're in space. Turn any bottle into a speaker! Be the champion! Show the people what's up. When they tell you you can't do it, do it! Show moves, boss! Bottle speakers for days! Gray Goose for Jack!",

    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, it's Justine, and today, we are at the Apple Fitness Plus Studio. I absolutely love this place. I did a tour of it before, but today, I am here for something very, very special. They are launching kickboxing! (energetic techno music) I'm about to take my first kickboxing class. It's kind of crazy that I've actually never really taken one before. I'm a huge fan of martial arts, but kickboxing and boxing is something that I've never really done. I mean, it's only appropriate that I would do my first kickboxing class with Apple. The first one I'm gonna do is \"Kickboxing with Jamie-Ray.\" This is 10 minutes, and we've got some upbeat anthems. (energetic techno music) It's happening! - Yes, yes! (energetic techno music) (indistinct speech from Jaime) This 10-minute kickboxing workout! Alright, team, so. (indistinct speech from Jaime) I want you to squat down. (energetic techno music) - Whew! I gotta work on my hook. My hook is subpar. (upbeat pop music) - Oh, man! (Justine clapping) First 10-minute workout. Kickboxing, check. So, the thing that I love so much about this is, as a beginner who has never done this before, they made it super easy. So, like, I was actually able to follow through all of the moves. I definitely need to work on my hook a little bit, but I love that, in that last minute, you got to put all of that together and do an entire little routine and so this is super cool! (upbeat pop music) Jamie Ray, hello! - Hello. (Jamie laughing) - Welcome to the Fitness Plus Studio. Have you ever been here before? - I don't know. - This is my second time here and it's always just so amazing to just step into the environment. - Yeah. And just see the energy. So now, we're here because you guys have a kickboxing class! - Yes! Let's go! (Jamie chuckling) - So, tell me about this, and obviously, like, you're super into martial arts, so for you, like, what is your history with martial arts and how excited are you? - So, my history in martial arts, I actually had a career in musical theater originally, and I just wanted to try something completely different. So, I then got into Muay Thai, which is a form of martial art, and I went all over the UK training, all over, for a year, different gyms, and then I went to the best place to go and train, which was Thailand, and I had my first fight, which I won, and then that's kind of where it started. I am so excited for kickboxing to come to Fitness Plus! It's something I've been waiting for so long 'cause I've definitely been trying to sneak in some, like, combat moves into my HIIT workouts, but now, we finally have it and I'm so excited! - I think the thing that I love about martial arts is people just think that it's like this fighting which, yes, it is, but there's so much, like, work ethic that goes into these combat sports, so it's really great that you're able to bring that and kind of bring it to the masses 'cause I have never done kickboxing before. This was my first time today, (Jamie laughing) and it's interesting because, as someone who has never done that but have done previous martial arts, in this class that you guys did that I just took, it's, like, a nice introduction, like, you kind of lead people into that. So, is that all kind of intentional? - Totally. Like, when we are doing our workouts, we really like to just show the move and really go through it slowly first, and then, once we've got the move into our body, we then really pick up the pace and really go for it, especially at the end. We have, like, a one-minute final round, which is my favorite because the one-minute final round, we pick a track, we'll take the best beat drop, and when we take that beat drop, we'll put it into that minute and you are going all out punching and kicking for one minute and it is just so fun. - So now, do you have, like, a beginner kind of section? Because the one that I took, like, it was, I mean, it was still beginner, but I felt like, you know, you gotta know a little bit. - Yeah, totally. We have beginner programs which I've been so excited to do as well because it just means so much to me too that we can bring kickboxing to beginners as well because I know how intimidating it is at first and we've all been the beginner. So, we now have something for everybody who can just come in and we do teach the basics and we go really slow and you'll just feel like you're with us the whole time and we've got your back. - Yeah, and, I mean, that first, like, couple of punches, it's so nice to just kind of ease into it. - Yeah. - The one thing that I did notice that I'm not very good at is, like, my little hook here. - You're hook. - I kept doing, like, all this weird stuff and then my sister goes, \"They're gonna make fun of you.\" I'm like, \"No, no, no!\" (Jamie laughing) So, what's, like, the proper hook? Like, what do I gotta do here? - Yeah, with the hook. - [Janine] Yeah. - I always like to say, we create a nice L shape. - Okay. - So, you bring your fist. - Okay. - In line with your chin, your elbow comes up nice and high, and you've got an L shape in front of you, and this is your hook. Keep your chin down. Keep your eyes up. Big smiles. (Jamie laughing) - How's this? Is that good? Is that good? - Bring it a little bit further forward. - Okay. - Elbow a little bit higher. - A little bit higher. - There we go, and squeeze your fist nice and tight. - [Janine] Oh! - There we go! - We did it! - Come on! (Jamie laughing) (palms clapping) - So, much fun! - Chi, chi, chi, chi. - I'm so set. Like, I'm into it. (Jamie laughing) (upbeat pop music) (indistinct speech from Nez) I closed my move ring! (indistinct speech from Nez) (upbeat techno music) (upbeat techno music) - Hi, I'm Nez, and I am the new Apple Fitness Plus trainer. - I am so excited about this! This is incredible! - Thank you. - So, now you're gonna be teaching the kickboxing class. - Yes. - And you have a pretty wide range of martial arts background. - Yeah. - So, do you wanna talk a little bit about that? - Yeah, so, I actually started Muay Thai when I was at university. My background is in competitive sport. I used to swim. Totally different, but random. - Kinda like Jamie in theater. - Yeah, just did the whole U-turn, and when I got to university, I just wanted to try something new and I also wanted to learn how to defend myself. I felt like, as a woman, that was quite important, so I walked into a Muay Thai gym and just fell in love with it straight away from the first session. It was very humbling. It was physically challenging, it was mentally challenging, and, like, everyone around me, all the fighters looked incredible and I was like, I wanna look like that! From my first session, haven't stopped going back and just, I'm totally obsessed with it and it has been a massive part of me finding my passion, my purpose in life, and my confidence as well. It's done, like, so much for my mental health as well, so I'm just so excited to bring all of that to the rest of the world 'cause I think kickboxing is amazing. For me, the most important thing is that people feel welcome in my workouts. I want them to feel like they're having fun and I always want to champion the beginner because we all are beginners, and all were beginners in many things, and I think it's just important that we create spaces where people feel comfortable, they feel encouraged, they feel like the workout is challenging, but there is definitely somewhere that they can, you know, they can work with. So, whenever I'm creating the workouts, I kind of wanna make it authentic to Muay Thai, but I also want to make it a workout that someone can feel accomplished when they've done it. - What are some tips that you can give to other women who may have never tried martial arts, but might wanna try? Like, what tips can you give to them? - I just think, really, coming with an open mind, I think that is just the main thing because I think a lot of people feel like, oh, I'm not a fighter, you know, I don't wanna fight. It's like, this is exactly why we've created Apple Fitness Plus kickboxing workouts because you get to do kickboxing from the comfort of your own living room, your garage, wherever you train, and, you know, we wanted it to be like that so it was comfortable for people to do it wherever they want. So, I think just come into it with an open mind. I like to say, you know, everyone's a fighter. We all fight for different things in life and it's not because, you know, you may love kickboxing and you may also love yoga and they're quite different things and that's, you know, that's totally normal, so just have a really open mind. Just take your time and if it does feel uncomfortable at first, just know that it felt uncomfortable and difficult for all of us at first and just be patient, you will get it, and practice makes progress, as I always say in my workouts. - That's great and, I mean, obviously, with the Apple Watch too, I feel like it adds this whole other level of fun because you're able to sort of see the workouts on the screen. - [Nez] Yes. - So, for you, what was that kind of like coming in and sort of seeing this whole different kind of way of working out? - Oh, it's incredible. There's nothing like it out there, and I think for me, I was just, I was blown away by it, and to see all the work that goes into it behind the scenes is just incredible and I think it's the best thing out there. Obviously, I'm biased, but it is incredible. (upbeat music) - Thank you guys so much for watching. I am so excited about kickboxing and if you guys have done kickboxing before, I would love to hear it, so leave me some comments below, and if you do take the class, send me a tweet on Twitter or leave a comment and let me know how it went. Arm up. Okay. Mm. We're gonna work on it. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "The world of smart phones. You know I gotta cover them here. I'm always looking at the latest and greatest and a wide variety of different smart phones that are out on the market. Today, I've got something hot. As far as I know, this right here is one of the world's first unboxing videos of this actual device. It's from Honor and it's called the 6X. And the crazy part here is you're looking at top specifications for a price that's unheard of. This baby right here is going to retail for $249 These people are getting far more competitive these days. So when they asked me to help them they debut the 6X I said, \"Let's do it\" Here we go. It's a 5.5 inch form factor. A relatively large screen, as you can tell there. It's one of these trays that allows for either two SIMs or a SIM and a Micro SD card to expand the storage You guys know I'm a big fan of expandable storage. But also, the dual SIM option. If you travel a lot, you can pop in a local SIM and actually have phone calls hit that SIM so you're not getting killed on the roaming and so on. Its got the dual camera setup. And one of the cool things about this camera - it's got a huge aperture. That's gonna give you that shallow depth of field So you get artistic. It's actually f/0.95 not even f/1 So we've got the volume buttons over on the side. Power switch is in this location over here. The fingerprint sensor. This location, which is becoming more and more familiar for me, it's just a very natural place to put your hand and the phone obviously is unlocked as soon as you pick it up. The peel, listen up. Oooh. The build here is aluminum, silver aluminum. Oh my goodness. Of course, your speakers on the bottom over here. A traditional 3.5mm headphone jack. Pop this baby... Nano SIM in this location, and then your secondary SIM or your Micro SD in that location. Micro USB cable to charge it up. And of course your power brick as well. Powered by Android. What is this- this is running Marshmellow, right Jack? One thing I like about this device is the built-in screensaver images. Look at these- look at these things! This reminds me of a Bob Ross painting. You guys know Bob Ross? Unbelievable! All right, we're gonna enroll the fingerprint real quick. Now let's see how quickly it wakes up. OOOHH! You've seen a lot of phones, Jack, That's pretty quick. Look at that... I mean, that's something right there. I'm gonna come in... BOOM! Can also launch straight into the camera from the lock screen if you choose to. Speaking of the camera, you looking at me looking at you. Kaboom. Magic. Of course, the picture of Jack, the usual picture of Jack. Hard at work as usual. There he is. Taking wide aperture photos can produce images with a shallow depth of field. Recommended for photos of people or objects within two meters. I'm gonna snap a photo of this. Even after I've taken the photo. See how the Bokeh on the back, can you make that out? It hyper-focuses you in on a particular element in the image. Kind of like the way we see things. Like I focus in on you on the lens, and the surroundings are, by nature of how the human eye works, a little bit more blurry. It's not done after you took the photo. If you change your mind afterwards. Box is in focus, logo on top of the box, and then back to the monitor where I'm seeing myself over there. This is a very cool way of sort of stepping your game creatively with the photos on your device. Can change your f/ that being the shallowest depth of field at f/0.95 and then if I drag it down all the way to, say, f/16 you can see that the entire frame then, comes into focus. That's pretty cool. Right, Jack? The rear one is 12 megapixels. The front one is 8 megapixels. Perfect selfie or standard beauty. I believe I deserve the perfect selfie. Look, there's a beauty slider here, so... Who's that over there? Is that Tom? Tom, what are you doing? Can you step in the room, please? Get in here! You can't be halfway. Tom! WOW! Look at that beauty right there! That's a different man. I don't think me. I'm about to- I'm gonna have to hop on the dating sites. Lew on video in the phone:\"Alright, so today I'm pumped up. Seriously, literally, and figuratively. A Kickstarter or what, I know it's on Amazon Launchpad now, though.\" So this device has the EMUI (2.0) launcher on it. And that's what's giving you this kind of appearance that you're looking at here. But it is full-fledged Android, so go ahead and put whatever launcher you want on there. Quick spec recap; this thing has a 5.5'', 1080p display, 12 megapixel camera on the back, 8 megapixels on the front, 32GB of storage, 3GB of RAM, and a 3340 mA battery. Alright, you get all that and what would you pay for something like that, huh? Oh, I don't know Jack tell 'em, tell the people. Tell 'em! $249! The smartphone game has changed. No contract, no nothing. It's just- that's your phone now. I'm just here to show you guys what's going on in the marketplace. And that's the kind of stuff that's available now. This is the new world, the new age, the future. $249 you get a new one every year. $249 Jack gets a new one every month. Let me know in the comments, what else could you get for $249. Not much!",

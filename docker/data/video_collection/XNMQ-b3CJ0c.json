    "transcript": "Both the Nvidia GTX 1070 and 1080 have been stealing the show no doubt for these past few weeks. 1080 performance blows any current single GPU card out of the water and 1070 performance rivels Nvidia's own Titan X and GTX 980 Ti for about 200 dollars less than the latter. Well, that's what I believe to be the case. I promised you all I'll be purchasing a GTX 1070 to review and use as my daily driver. And believe me, when I get my hands on one I will but that's kind of the problem. I can't. They've been sold out for weeks. I'm not interested in placing my order now and waiting 2 to 3 more weeks either. When I pay for it I want it in my hands within the next few days. I also don't feel like paying a 200 dollar premium to any of these self-righteous pricks on eBay either. I mean come on. Now also unlike AMD Nvidia hasn't asked me to review either of their cards. So needless to say, we are all on the same boat here. The GTX 1070 is ridiculously difficult to come across at this current time. But what about the GTX 980 Ti? We're talking nearly identical performance to the 1070 and here's the catch nearly identical price in a few instances. I'm maxing everything out in every single game I play on ultra wide 1080p, also just fine in 1440p with high presets, and even squaking by with moderate settings on 4K in current Triple-A titles. And at a price that rivals the 1070 - a card with very similar performance numbers - . The 980 Ti has been the powerhouse for Nvidia for the past year. For a price of around 600 US dollars you could own a card that more often than not outperformed by it's Titan X counterpart thanks to third party coolers and thus a higher overclocking threshold. And that brings us to the MSI GTX 980 Ti Gold Edition. If you follow me on Twitter you're already familiar with what's going on here so thanks for watching a second time. I purchased this card on NewEgg on June 15th of this year for a minuscule 450 US dollars plus a 30 dollar mail in rebate which I already mailed out. I understand many rebates are iffy but as long as you follow through you can count on to this free cash in a month or two. And from a trusted brand like MSI it's not gonna just disappear into the nether. So how did I come across this? Well this is gonna sound a bit nerdy but I typically scavenge NewEgg and Amazon everyday or so in search of fairly stellar deals and components that I can purchase and showcase here on the channel for you. When I saw the MSI braided Ti selling at this price I couldn not pass it out. If you're someone who's desperately in need of a powerful 1440p and like 4K gaming card, who is not willing to wait for any of there 1070's to just magicly pop into existence - I mean come on Nvidia, where are they? - then these 980 Ti's will do just fine. Misty, you can come up here by now. I kicked her of off my laps so I could pick that box up. Come here baby. Ohh it's okay.. It's okay.. Now sure, there are a few disadvantages for opting for high-end Maxwell vs Pascal. The most obvious is problably efficency. This 980 Ti requires 2x 8 pin power connectors and consumes about 350 watts under full load. The 1070 consumes much less power and features a lower thermal output as well. 150 watts vs 350. You're also getting only 6 gigs of VRAM with the Ti instead of 8. And only Display Port 1.2 rather than 1.4 as featured in the 1070. Though these will be subjective as to whether not they're deal breakers for you. There are few things going for 980 Ti than the 1070 either doesn't have going for it currently or will ever have because it's hardware based. The Ti features a 384 bit memory bus for a theoratical 337 gigabits per second vs a 1070 256 gigabits per second all though frankly you won't notice a difference in most cases. The 980 Ti is also more widely available in it's current state with brands like MSI, Gigabyte, ASUS and others already on board. The 1070 is being rebranded and sold by it's manufacturers as well but good luck finding any that you can currently buy. And that's the overall theme here. Well I would under every single circumstance except for this one Recommend the 1070 over the 980 Ti simply for it's newer architecture, lower thermal output, and just the fact that it's newer. If you want something similar now and willing to compromise on the things after mentioned, The 980 Ti is never a bad choice for this price I mean come on, 450 bucks? In several instances that's actually cheaper than what the 1070's currently going for I mean if it was available. Now unfortunately the MSI Gold Edition has since gone back up in price and the non-GE is currently out of stock. No doubt thanks to it's stellar price. But I expect other variants of the 980 Ti to creep down in price as time progresses. This Gigabyte card is already appearing to do so. Just keep your eyes peeled and check sites like these everyday or so to stay in the loop. Look, these cards are gonna have no choice but to decline in value The 1070 is averaging around 420 to 430 bucks at this very moment. The 980 Ti will not sell - here in the states at least - unless it's asking price drops to a more competitive level. Yay! Capitalism!

    "transcript": "our second meeting of the day feeling chill deepcool here we come what a view but first huge thanks to our sponsors thermaltake Razer MSI Corsair and Phateks for making CES possible alright good people so this is the deepcool Macube 550 why Macube you might ask I have the same thing because well maybe it's magical you know on the front it's all minimalist but there's some magic on the back side panel the ventilation design that they've implemented there I would say really good stuff there but the Macube 550 is all about minimalism so in terms are like branding you know it's not visible it's not in-your-face and this is part of game or storm division so not deepcool gamer storm and it's really interesting to see you know their logo in the front for example it's white on white so it's discrete the same thing with this handle on a TG panel that is black on black so it's again not in-your-face and I definitely appreciated that and you guys will too so there are no lighting effects it's just plain either white frame or a black frame we have a TG panel over here with this chrome accent handle for a magnetic TG panel so this we we've seen that with the quad stellar the magnets are super strong and I was actually personally worried about let's say what if you're carrying the system and accidentally tip over something but no the magnets on here are strong enough so you don't have to worry about this thing popping out to me the Macube 550 is kind of a combination between like the H700 from NZXT in terms of this like almost unibody front panel and on the interior taking a little bit elements from let's say the case of the year the olam dynamic because let me remove the front panel on the interior we have dual sort of intake and fan configuration so you're a traditional 360 rather the front you can do or now the side installation of the fans so you can do either three one 20s or three one 40s and up to a 360 rather than there and there's a little bit of spacing behind the frame so you can still install a radiator or a fan behind the frame so that it clears up all the space on the front so you could do fans on the front and fans on the side without them interfering with each other and that's for the interior there are many cool elements starting off with a power supply shroud we have a tempered glass side panel over here to reveal what's inside so they're still not finalized with the actual design hopefully they'll carry over from the ventilation of the rear pen something over here so the design is cohesive and over here this front section of the shroud is open but they'll close it maybe with another TG panel so it reflects any illumination that you might have on the front here which is cool as for the standard ATX motherboard support EATX is not here rubber grommets and because of the side ventilation you can do like 360 and 3 140 Miller fans the frame is quite tall but since there are no fans about the frame its it gives you a little bit extra space to breathe but then this all that space is a little bit wasted if you are not populating a really tall radiator on the side as for storage we have one SSD mount on the power supply strap we have two more in the back and we have two of these hard drives included so you can install two three and a half inch on each caddy and the cool thing is you can install this guy on to any of the fans thoughts on the on the side or the front and you can either rotate them whichever you see fit for cable management or the way you are trying to display your hard drives so I find that really awesome and so this is that really cool ventilation pattern that I was talking about it's got multiple angular elements and depending on how light hits it it creates the shadow on that internal structure has a little ventilation pattern on the opening spaces so I find that quite unique and hopefully we can find this pattern somewhere else inside the case for a little consistency and the one minor concern for us would be of course airflow since the front panel is so close to the frame but depending on our based on their own testing they say there's about 25 percent difference in air flow with the panel completely removed versus the panel installed so I really want to see this whole thing slightly expanded for better airflow but of course once we get the Macube 550 info review will do all the air flow testing and this thing is going to be a hundred and nineteen dollars for the white edition and 110 dollars for the black one so I think it's a pretty good price territory and only one fan is included for the rear and it will be black and now let's talk about the gamer storm assassin three of what they call within the company in the king of air coolers so it's going to be competing with the Noctua NH-D15 so it's got this whole 140 member form but the assassin 3 has an advantage in size because it is 165 millimeters in height but it is much thinner at the only 140 millimeters so the actual thickness of the fence aligns with that of 140 the more fan making it a slimmer package that would you know allow you to you have just generally more clearance above the motherboard and below the sockets ah now visually I love what they've done with the assassin iii and so it's a black design with chrome accents and you can see these top plates that actually have functionality behind them they're like these air channels that make sure that air flow flows directly from the top of this fan all the way to the back of this fan you can actually feel that and a little extra Tim bit for us Canadians is that you can remove the gamer store logo from this black portion if you want to go all black and go a little bit you know more low-key now what about actual performance of this thing so we have 2 140 Miller fans that have been specifically designed for this type of heatsink so they go from 500 to 1,400 rpm and right now they're spinning at full speed and the noise profile is quite pleasant it's not too loud it's not too frequency and that's for the heat pipes themselves they're using groove center structures so the heat transfer is 15 percent better than your traditional heat pipes which is awesome and they have solder flow through so the heat pipes make that makes direct contact with the heatsink which again improves the overall cooling efficiency I would say for 99 bucks the assassin 3 is going to be a really good contender from a visual perspective from a purse for performance perspective and the noise profile - one more thing is that and one more thing a screwdriver is included for installation I love this thing be quiet actually includes them and they're amazing now Ram compatibility is usually an issue with such big air to air coolers so right now we have 30 millimeters so your standard low-profile Ram will fit in the full configuration but of course you can move the 140 Miller fan slightly up so to make up more room or you can remove it completely for that whole clearance to be completely open that's hot and that's high mean that's high the coolness the the temperature is cool you did you know I don't know why I do that and lastly the matrix 70 it's a $69 a case from deep cool now and I find some really interesting elements inside this budget and closure like a temper glass ceiling on the power supply shroud so it has many cool elements like if you have a graphics card that has some LED illumination now you can have that reflection element and actually see those lonely LEDs that otherwise don't see any eyes and number two I find this a graphics holder a pretty unique addition so it is going to be sold separately for $15 it has its own cable routing channel on the internal now internally because it's light a little bit thick of course addressable are jovial nation too so let me know if this is something that you buy for your next case alright guys so that is all the things that we saw today deep cool and gamer storm let me know what you think about the Macube 550 the titled maybe has to change me signing off and these guys right here",

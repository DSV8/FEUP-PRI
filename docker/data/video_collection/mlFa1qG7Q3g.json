    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, it's Justine, and today's unboxing is going to be really fun. I have a bunch of Logitech Designed for Mac products and as you guys know, I'm a huge Mac fan, so I'm really excited to check these out. We're gonna unbox, and then set them up at my new desk set-up. So here's the things that we're gonna be checking out today, this is the MX Master 3S for Mac. It has a Magspeed scroll wheel for hyper-fast, pixel-precise scrolling. It has the perfect ergonomical shape and its ideally-placed thumb controls. This comes in two colors, the space gray and pale gray. These are also both optimized for macOS and iPadOS. This is the Logitech Pebble M350. This has an 18-month battery life. It's also got dual connectivity via Bluetooth with silent productivity, 90% noise reduction with the same click feel. It's also small and portable, so it's the perfect mouse for on the go. This is the Lift for Mac and I really like this mouse a lot. It gives you that natural handshake position for all-day comfort. It's a great fit for small to medium hands. It has a smart wheel, so you can scroll line by line, or you can fly through some TikToks at record pace. It's super quiet and it's also optimized for macOS and compatible with iPad. This is a nice compliment to the Pebble, this is the multi-device K380 for Mac. You can type on multiple devices. You can connect up to three compatible devices and switch typing between them at the touch of a button, macOS, iPadOS, or even iOS. It's ultra quiet with laptop-like typing. And this is the MX Mechanical Mini for Mac. This is a minimalist mechanical keyboard, of course, with Bluetooth, it has the ultimate typing tactility and next-level precision. It has tactile quiet keys, long-lasting comfort with a balanced design, metal-top case, MAC optimized layout. and an adjustable typing angle. This is also compatible with the iPad. It has easy switching so you can connect up to three devices and easily switch between them. USB-C rechargeable so you can get up to 15 days or up to 10 months with backlighting off. With two color options of space gray and pale gray, you can match these with one of your MX Master 3Ss for Mac. So let's open up these two matching ones first. This is the K380 and this is the Pebble mouse. I think we'll go with the keyboard first. (upbeat music) (gasps) This blue color is so pretty. Wow, look at that. This is so nice. So here's the three selection buttons so you can pair multiple devices to this. And when you wanna switch to them, one, two, three, easy is that. This is gonna be great for my desk set-up 'cause I actually have two computers set up and I also have an iPad, so with this I can just switch between them and easily type away. (gasps) This is a nice type, I like the round keys also. Got two little AAA batteries in there. Let's open up this matching Pebble mouse. This is so cute, I just love this color blue. This knife is so sharp. Oh, I love this, it's so small. This is the perfect travel mouse. (upbeat music) This is also great. This is where you can store the USB connector. like this has the little USB receiver hidden away inside of the mouse. This is great because I've had some mice previous to this and I've actually lost the receiver because it somehow just got misplaced. But I like that this has a nice, little, secret, hidden little spot for it. So this will also connect to Bluetooth or if you have a device that isn't Bluetooth compatible, you can use this receiver and you'll be able to connect to it. Look, look how good these look next to each other. They're so beautiful. Next up, we have the Lift for Mac mouse. Look at this one, it's a vertical ergonomic mouse. It's a part of the Ergo series by Logitech. (upbeat music) Whoa, look at this little dude! It looks like a little mountain! I like that the buttons are on the side. We've got little clickies here, scroll wheel. Oh, this is awesome. I'm just visualizing myself working. I'm really excited to try this actually, because I've been editing a lot over the past couple of days and like my arm, I've already had some issues, obviously, you guys may know with this shoulder, and when I was like editing a lot in the way that I kind of was sitting, like my arms started feeling weird and I got a little nervous. So I also feel like the way that this is, like I'm not, like my hand isn't like this in like a normal mouse position, it feels great. Like it's just feels so comfy. This could be life changing. Like actually I've said things before are life changing, but this actually feels like this could be life changing. I can't wait to try it. You stay tuned, 'cause we're gonna be trying you out very soon. But we have two other mice that we need to unbox. These are both the MX Master 3S for Mac and we have them in both colors. We're gonna check those out. This also looks like I kind of have a nice ergonomical feel. Not the same kind of side style as this one. (upbeat music) (gasps) Wow, that looks good too. Oh, these are exciting. (upbeat music) Also feels nice. Like my wrist is elevated, my thumb is very comfortably placed over here on the other side. Oh, we've also got with these ones, some cables, we've got a USB-C cable. So you can see on the bottom, we've got a little, shiny metallic so they each match the color. So we've got this more silver and one's a little bit darker of a silver. These have a very similar color to the MacBook colors, so these match kind of like the space gray and the silver to the MacBooks. Even though they're calling this the pale gray, it looks a little silver to me. Like you can't even hear me clicking. The click is very silent, but there is enough tactile feedback so it actually feels like you're clicking, but you can't hear it. The center scroll wheel is also a click, which is nice. And we've got two buttons on the side in addition to this little scroll wheel, which I'm quite hyped about this because I want to use that to scroll my timeline left and right in Final Cut, love that. (scroll wheel whirring) I can't stop doing that. All right, I can't wait to try these keyboards out. Got the two MX Mechanical Minis. Now I love mechanical keyboards, but sometimes they're so loud. So I'm really excited to try this out, because it's a mechanical keyboard with a quiet comfort of a not-mechanical keyboard and still that tactile feedback. So let's open them up and see what they look like and type like. (upbeat music) Let's open them both at the same time! (heavenly music) (gasps) Okay, well there's paper on them, so let's remove the paper. Oh. These look so good. Oh yeah, that's a nice type. I can't wait to get my little fingers on that. Look at you, look at you, and look how nice you look matched with your little friend there. And then, if we want to swap them out, the pale gray, look at that. Wow, this is a nice keyboard. I like it a lot, oh, that's a very nice type. We've even got the emoji key, which is very important. And we've got the three keys right here to switch from different devices. So you pair three different Bluetooth devices right there, one, two, three, nice. (keys clacking) So everything is now unboxed. Now we're gonna take these over to my desk and get them all set up and connected to Bluetooth, and test them out on multiple devices and see how they type. So it's now time to test these out. So I'm gonna start with the MX Mechanical Mini and the MX Master 3S mouse. Now I already have these all paired up. We're set, we're ready to go. And so far I started doing a little editing before we started rolling and I am so excited about this. So let me show you how great this is for scrolling in the timeline. So here's all of our footage. Like I can just go like this. Look at this, I'm still scrolling. Look, hands off and I can just go, ploop, stop. I wish that I would've had this mouse when I was editing this video, because I can scroll so fast through so much footage. (gasps) Oh, this is incredible. I also like that they have programmable buttons so I can actually set these up to be shortcut keys in Final Cut Pro. Another thing that I like is it has this horizontal scroll. So when I'm scrolling my timeline, I like to be able to scroll left and right. So not only can I do that, but I can also scroll up and down. My hand feels very chill, very relaxed. This is a very comfortable fit. It fits on my palm perfectly. I also like that it has a little area for my thumb so I can kind of just rest it here. So a lot of times when you're using a mouse, like this is just dragging. This, it has a little armrest, but for your thumb. I started working on this document and I opened it up and I, (gasps) I was so sad. It's a novel, \"Three Tales.\" I didn't write this, but I'm gonna change a few things. A novel, \"The Story of CBTL Hummingbird Babies.\" So if you guys miss this, I had a hummingbird nest. And the hummingbird babies, we were watching them on a live stream and they unfortunately didn't make it, and it was so incredibly traumatizing. So this is me writing the novel about their life. (keys clacking) The fact that this is mechanical, but it's not loud like a normal mechanical keyboard. \"I had to film them. I got my camera out and I set up a live stream.\" I also like that this is formatted for Mac. It has the Command Apple key, so we kind of know where we are, we feel it home with this keyboard, Designed for Mac, we love to see it. Incoming Lift, now this one is so interesting to me 'cause it's so not traditional of a mouse shape. And this can also be connected to three different Bluetooth items, we've got one, two, and three. So that will change depending upon which device you have it connected to. So I'm gonna set up number one and we're gonna have that. Wow, this is such a unique feel, like I've never used mouse like this before and I love that it has the track wheel right here on the side, and we've got the two left and right buttons and the other two configurable buttons. It's such a comfortable feel. Oh, look at this one. So here's our Pebble M350 and our K380 keyboard. Now something that I didn't test out on the previous ones, but they also have this capability, is you have this one, two, and three, and up here you can use those to switch between different devices. So I'm gonna connect my iPhone, my iPad, and my computer, and show you how easy it is to switch between the three. So I have the keyboard all hooked up to three different devices. So number one is, I'm just gonna make a new document here, just a blank document. Now number one is hooked up to my computer. Look at that, I'm typing. \"Hello, I am typing. It is a nice type.\" Okay, great, now I'm gonna switch to my iPhone. Here we go, \"Hello, I am now typing on my iPhone\"! Okay, number three, get ready, get ready! \"Now I am typing on my iPad.\" And if we wanna go back to our Mac, click number one, and guess what? We're back on the MacBook. I really like this keyboard and mouse combination because it is so small and portable, so this is something that I could easily throw into my suitcase, take it with me, even put it in my backpack because it is so small and thin. I also really like these keys, like they're little round circles, but it's such a fun type. This is very similar to some of the previous ones that they've had, so I'm really glad to see that they have this new color and the mouse to match. Thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I'll put a link in the description to all of the keyboards and the mice that I talked about today. If you guys have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments, and I will see you in my next video. If you haven't already, please subscribe. Also, hit the bell to be notified when I post new videos, and I'll see you guys in the next one, bye. (mellow music)",

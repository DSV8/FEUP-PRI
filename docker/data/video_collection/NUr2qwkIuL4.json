They represented a lot of firsts for me, actually: they were the first ANC headphones Id ever owned; the first that convinced me I could have enough to say about headphones to actually review them  and the first ones Id ever spent (what I considered to be) real money on.  The Bose QC35s cost $350. So when I heard that Apples first self-branded headphones, the Airpods Max, cost $200 more than those  I was so incensed I almost skipped them. But then I thought about how many headphones Id covered in the years since those QC35s, and how few of them truly wowed me anymore. So I bought a pair of Airpods Max in the hopes that maybe they did indeed bring something new to the table that I could talk about in a review.

    "transcript": "- [Narrator] This video is sponsored by Hello Fresh, America's number one meal kit. - One of the first reviews I ever made as Mr. Mobile was for the Bose QC35, and they actually represented a list of firsts, that they were my first noise canceling headphones, they were the first to convince me that I had enough to say about headphones, to make reviews about them, and they were the first headphones that I'd actually spent, what I considered to be, real money on. They cost $349. So when I heard that Apple's first self branded headphones were gonna cost 549, I was so incensed that I almost skipped them. But then I thought about just how many headphones I had covered in the years since those Bose QC35s, and you know, how few of them truly wowed me anymore. So, I bought a pair, and after seven days testing the AirPods Max, I have never been more deeply disheartened to say, (gentle music) wow. (gentle music) I'll discuss why I'm so dejected about that proclamation of preeminence when I cover these cans cons, but let's start with the pros, and let's begin those with comfort. When I first picked these up, I thought there was no way I was gonna be able to wear them full time. At 395 grams, the stainless steel and aluminum AirPods Max are 35% heavier than the B&O H9is that I've been wearing for a while, 64% heavier than the Bose QC35s. But there is indeed some magic lurking somewhere between the knit canopy headband and the mesh textile ear cups. Because on my head the weight just kind of evaporates. With most headphones, if I wear 'em too long, I'll start to get that top of the skull spike of pressure and pain, and that's what I was worried about with these. So I kept 'em on for as many hours as I could, every day for almost a full week. And you know what? No spikes, no headaches, and incidentally no sweat rings around my ears either, which were as common with the leather padded competition as the flaking that would inevitably plague them. Another reason I can wear 'em all day, Apple's transparency mode is the best I've ever heard. This is a very common feature with noise canceling headphones. You can not only mute inbound noise, but if you want you, can reverse that and actually amplify the sounds of the outside world, so that you don't get hit by a vehicle, or jumped for your headphones. But with most headphones, that background amplification has a harsh artificial quality. It's good enough to listen to something quick, like an airport announcement, but you wouldn't wanna hold a conversation through it. By contrast, Apple's transparency mode sounds exactly like the outside world. It's like you're not even wearing headphones. (presenter laughs) Ah, it's amazing. The difference is made all the more apparent when you talk. You can hear your own voice through transparency on the AirPods Max in a way that you just can't through any other noise canceling headphones, that I've tested anyway. And when you do wanna shut the world out, well these also boast the best noise canceling I've used. I have a great way to test it too. My fourth roommate is the noisiest washer dryer LG has ever exported. Even sitting right next to that calamitous train wreck, the AirPods almost completely cancel it. (AirPods beep) (AirPods beep) (washer dryer whirring in the background) The muting effect is so complete that it is almost disorienting at first. The only time these gave me trouble was when one of those lovely backup alarms sounded on a truck about 15 feet away. One of the cups muted itself temporarily, presumably because of the amplitude of that stupid beeper was just too loud. (truck beeping) Now a lot of folks have already mentioned that pressurization effect, that kind of feeling that your head is in a vacuum of sorts when you wear the AirPods. And yeah, it is more pronounced on these than on other ANC headphones. That's because that sensation of wanting to pop your ears is a psychosomatic response that comes from the lack of low frequency noise. And it's more dramatic on the AirPods because they're so effective at silencing. So I can't exactly deduct points for that. They're just doing a great job at what they say they're gonna do. To break it down to distinctly, the ANC is like YouTube's shadow ban feature, almost completely effective in shutting out noise. - Another biased Apple lover. Have you tried surface headphones? You need your ears cleaned iSheep. - And what the AirPods do with that silence is also impressive. To my ear, the soundstage has all the spaciousness of the B&O H9i, with none of the murky heaviness that drove some to call Bose's QC35 overrated. It may not be the perfectly authentic sound meant for audio engineers to work with, that's more the domain of the Pandas studio headphones that Drop produced in collaboration with THX. But the most relevant point to me is that the sound was good enough on the AirPods to stand toe to toe with everything else in my current loan locker. (gentle music) Rounding out the positives are the buttons and the battery. Yeah, I thought it a little strange at first just to see scaled up Apple Watch controls here, when most of the competition has transitioned to touch pads, but I quickly came to love turning the knob for volume. And the big mushy button is a satisfying way to toggle between noise canceling and transparency. (gentle music) And the battery life is on par with the competition, about 20 hours in my testing, while constantly switching between MacBook Pro and iPhone 12, and between transparency and ANC. Also, yeah, I did a phone call or two through these. The callers reported that I sounded excellent. It's better over the Max than the iPhone? What about the pitfalls of the pods? Well they're coming up after a word from a sponsor that brought a ton of fun to my kitchen this week, check 'em out. (upbeat music) I used to think I didn't like cooking. It turns out I was just doing it the hard way. Before today's sponsor, my kitchen efforts were limited to mac and cheese, my dad's chili, and whatever this was. (laughs) Hello Fresh helped me break out of that recipe rut. Hello Fresh delivers to my door the exact ingredients and portions I need. So there's less prep and less wasted food. And normally I ask my girlfriend for help in the kitchen, translation, she cooks and I do the dishes. But not this time. Among many others, Hello Fresh taught me how to make beef ragu spaghetti with zucchini and sesame soy pork bowls. And it all came out delicious. But not that I'm bragging, my technique is still blunt, and I spill stuff all over the place. My cutting board is so small. I'm getting misty-eyed. But it is cool to be able to say, hey, I fed my three person household in less than an hour, and it was pretty healthy stuff. With flexible options for portion size and timing, the decision of when to cook and how much is entirely up to you.

Thanks to Hello Fresh for sponsoring this. (gentle music) (gentle music) Back on the AirPods, the bummers boil down to the case, the cord, and the cost. (gentle music) Now the Smart Case isn't bad in and of itself, as much as it is an amplifier for the AirPods other annoyances, namely, they're huge and they don't fold. So they're not very portable compared to most of the competition. Also in the most Apple move ever, there's no power button. The headphones only know you wanna put them in standby if you put them into the case. If you don't wanna use the case, 'cause it looks goofy, you have to be content with the headphones losing between a 0.5% to 1% charge per hour in their low power state, at least until three days go by, after which they drift into a deeper sleep. Moving on to the cord complaint, it's simple, it's all about the connector. Look, the lightening port makes sense if you own an iPhone, I guess, but even here Apple is moving onto USBC on the Mac book and the iPad. The iPhone has the mag safe alternative now. We're coming to a point where some folks will have to keep a lightning cable around just for the AirPods, which is great until you forget it at home on a trip, or you lose that cable, and you need to cough up 19 bucks for a new one, or 35 if you want an audio version you can plug in, because of course there's no 3.5 millimeter headphone Jack either. (scoffs) And those are inconveniences you just shouldn't have to put up with for $550. I mean, that's really the heart of why I hate how great these things are. They really are just too expensive. (gentle music) That might sound pretty rich coming from the guy whose favorite phone of the year costs $2,000 and favorite laptop costs twice that, but each of those products redefines its category in a profound and useful way. The AirPods Max, as incredible as they are, they're just a very nice set of noise canceling headphones. And I fear that pricing them the way Apple has will drive headphone prices up in much of the same way the iPhone 10 normalized thousand dollars smartphones. In most cases, without much justification. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods are in many ways exquisite. And if I'd created a product like this, I'd wanna charge top dollar too, but I'm just not ready to sit here and say, most folks should spend as much as it would cost to get an iPhone SE and a set of classic AirPods, for a headset. Especially when headphones like Sony's XM4s offer their own brand of excellence, for less than half the price. (gentle music) Folks, long as this video was, there are still a few things I left out, and here's where I tell you where to find 'em. In addition to the Aforementioned Snazzy Q and El Jefe reviews, allow me to point you to Christine Chan's review at imore, and David Cogans real-world test at the unlockr. All of which are linked below. This review is produced following seven days with retail AirPods Max purchased by Mr. Mobile. As always no manufacturer compensation nor copy approval was involved. These are my own opinions and Apple is seeing them for the first time, right alongside you. Until next time, thanks for watching, and unless like me, you couldn't get anyone to join you on those cold holiday walkabouts, remember to stay safe when you're around others and mask up while you stay mobile, my friends.

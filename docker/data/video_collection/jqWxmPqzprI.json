    "transcript": "I think it's time for a rant video guys get ready what's up everyone Eber here with Hardware Canucks and I just want to make this quick video regarding the LG G7 One now if you recall I did take a look at this device a few weeks ago and I had a lot of great things talk about the smart phone particularly the design it's a subtle shift from the g7 thank you but I really liked the Satan black finish on the rear side of the phone you aren't missing on a few key features for example you don't get the wide-angle camera you also don't get wireless charging and a few other things but I mean when you look from an overall perspective I think it looks very similar to the g7 the best of all is actually a software that's running on a smart phone so Google so LG actually did partner up with Google to enlist the G7 One under their Android one program so it is running a clean stock version of Android which I really appreciate in fact it's probably one of the first reasons or one of the reasons why I really wanted to recommend this device until I started taking a look at the pricing here in Canada the whole situation is a complete mess so I want to talk about that alright so let's get to the bread-and-butter this video and that is pricing for the G sound one so I live here in Toronto Ontario Canada and my primary cell phone carrier is Fido so I was just curious enough to test or just check out the pricing for the GCM one-off contract and I was just trying to pick the jaws off my floor here so off contract this thing costs $7.99 with Fido and $8.99 with bail which is also another carrier and I'm just trying to process that over my head just because if you look at the conversion rates 899 Canadian is roughly six hundred and eighty six hundred and eighty five dollars let's just say seven hundred dollars with all the included with all the taxes and all that kind of stuff that's a complete ripoff I mean if you look at the whole market situation right now at smartphones there are so much better options in the market so for example one of the things that this pops into my head isn't recently-announced one plus sixty that costs 549 USD that's a lot cheaper than the Jesus and one if you just do the conversion rates now when you analyze it from a specs perspective the oneplus sixty comes to the latest processor so in this case snapdragon 845 it's got six gigs of RAM as the base start model and it comes with 120 gigabytes at 549 which is insane when you compare that to something like the g7 that offers a slightly older CPU like the Snapdragon 835 and you know 32 gigs of storage with four gigs of RAM it really questions these insane markups with these Canadian carriers you also have other great options like the Nokia 7.1 that costs around three hundred and fifty dollars u.s. and a whole lot more because you know these phones are all targeted towards the Android one program and Google initially started this program to sort of create this mid-range smartphone category without really compromising on a lot of Android or I guess the features that the Android operating system offers and I was really expecting the g7 one to be priced around you know four hundred to four hundred fifty dollars u.s. but when I look to the Canadian pricing it just I can't believe it I just can't believe it now interestingly enough the g7 one is expected to launch in India for around 30 thousand rupees and when you do the math it's roughly equivalent to five hundred and forty Canadian dollars or if you do the math - if you do the conversion to American it's gonna be a lot less so this tells us something here the communication between LG and the majority of the Canadian you know service providers is a little bit complicated or I think the whole communication is a little messed up I think they're trying to rip off their customers can eating customers to be more specific and I'm not exactly sure if this is going to follow along when the phone eventually launches in the United States or other countries around the world specifically in the Europe so I'm concerned I'm angry I'm lost I don't at this point I really can't recommend the jisun one to anyone out there because as I mentioned earlier there are far better options for a lot less and I just yeah so that about wraps up this rant video I hope you guys enjoyed and let me know what you guys think about the whole pricing situation in Canada specifically if you're a Canadian follower I want to hear your thoughts on this whole pricing situation with the gcn one what do you guys think about it left in your tops in the comments I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our new boot sequence channel for the latest tech news and rumors and we'll see you in the next one",

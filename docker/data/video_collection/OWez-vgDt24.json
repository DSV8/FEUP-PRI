    "transcript": "Wireless headphones ! Everybody's talking about them ! But, what is this mumbo jumbo about fully wireless headphones or as this company's calling it entirely wireless headset. No wire between each one of the earbuds. Now, this is not the first time i have tackled a product claiming to do this thing: to be \"fully wireless\". And to this point it's been an absolute disaster. Pair the earbud to that earbud, pair it back to you, get yourself a pear to eat. Force me to re-evaluate my entire life in fact. So that's the kind of pressure I'm gonna apply to this new company that says they got it right What are they called ? K'asq ? Full wireless, full freedom, 13 hours, anti-fall, rainproof. Look at these people on the front ! I'm here to let you know if something is good... or something sucks... Let's jump inside the box and find out ! Look at this guy ! Look at those little guys, tiny little things. These things... OH ! Change the style ! It's all about your tech lifestyle ! Some kind of... Some kind of... Some kind of cool looking charge case, extra ear tips, depending on the size of your ear canal, very important to get a good seal. How does this little charg-? Oh! It's a little home for your guys here, you know? One goes there, right? Yeah, and they're charging and then this comes out and that goes to, obviously, a USB connection. So, it's easy to travel with, right ? All right guys, it's time for the moment of truth because the pairing fiasco begins... Press and hold the play button on both earphones for 6 seconds to turn them on. Alright, here we go. 1..2..3..4..5 Yeah there's a little tiny, it's a faint light but you can see it there flashing blue and red. Let me see if I can pick it up on my phone. Yes, got it. Okay. Access to Bluetooth. Is that it ?! Is there no weird pairing between each one ? If that's true, we might be on to something here folks. If we are in business right now, this could be our entrance into the fully wireless promised land. They're not loud! I think they're maxed out. The phone is maxed out, and these guys... I mean I have the plus button... Could it be that track? Maybe. Let me try something else. I mean it's about freedom! No wires! I'm lifting weights! Unh! I'm shadowboxing. I'm on the electric skateboard. It's about freedom! Who doesn't like freedom? Pros, of course: These things are super easy to set up. I held the button, they paired right away. Sound quality? Eeh. I'm not jumping out of my socks, so to speak. I don't know what it is - I feel like i want a little bit more volume at least? It's about, uh... convenience. As much as it's about sound quality. If you're looking for sound quality, I think, for now, go with something wired. If you need the ultimate freedom, if you're trying to do the body pump, if you're trying to benchpress 3,000 pounds this might be the way to go.",

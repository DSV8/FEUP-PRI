    "transcript": "Alright, I just need everybody to see this. Look at this. Look at this thing! so this thing is Samsung's new galaxy tab s 9 Ultra. It's pretty similar to the s8 ultra from last year, but I mean, it's just so ridiculous. I just needed to show it to you. Fourteen point six-inch 120-hertzOLED display best-in-class snapdragon 8 gen 2 for galaxy, which is an overclocked chip, 16 gigs of ram up to a terabyte of storage, quad speakers, and a pair of front-facing cameras, one regular and one ultra-wide and it's all just so stupid thin. Like, I feel like if I brought this piece of hardware back in time long enough, it would just look ridiculous and just feel like I'm carrying a monitor around, and there's some other Android tablets out there having a moment right now. You know, the affordable one with the 1 + tab and the dockable one with the pixel tablet. This one is just the crazy one which is why it's $1,200 bucks. I feel like it's tempting to call this an iPad Pro killer, but I also feel like they're just really different, even though they're both super capable. Also, one tiny small request Samsung, please add 5 g to the ultra thank you.",

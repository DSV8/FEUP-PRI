    "transcript": "- I've been using Samsung's Galaxy Note smartphones on and off for the better part of eight years. So a few weeks ago when the new Galaxy Note 10 first appeared on the horizon, I moved back into last year's Note 9 and started a running list of everything I wanted changed, the things I wanted kept and at least one old feature I wanted it back. Well, the day is finally here and Samsung's not just showing one new Galaxy Note, but two. So let's see how much of this wish list the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Note 10+ check off. (upbeat music) Let's start with the easy ones, using the Note 9 for the past few weeks has reminded me just how confining it can be to go without a wide-angle camera. Well Samsung thankfully solved for this by bringing over the entire camera array from the Galaxy S10, from telephoto to wide to ultra wide. Also ported from the S10 is another of my requests, reverse wireless charging, so you can top up your Galaxy Buds or watch on-the-go. And Samsung gave us faster charging in both wired and wireless modes, more details on just how fast when I get to the box contents at the end of the video. For now it suffice it to say we're off to a good start. One thing I didn't think to ask for was two sizes of Galaxy Note, but here we are. The bigger Note 10 plus comes with the biggest screen ever on a Note, at 6.8 inches, while its sibling uses the smallest chassis since the Note 5 to accommodate the screen size of 6.3 inches. Now that little nano Note is intriguing because it kinda breaks the trend of endless inflation we've seen in the line until now, but it makes enough spec sacrifices that I'm mostly gonna focus on the big one. Do me a favor, let me know in the comments if you'd like me to cover the smaller Note 10. And please subscribe to the channel too. Whichever size you select of course the Note 10 packs the S Pen that gives the phone its name. And while more S Pen features is on my list, these are not necessarily the ones I meant. More ergonomic. Rounded corners. I was hoping maybe Samsung had figured out a way to make it feel less like you were writing on glass, instead it put a gyroscope in the pen so you can do this. Up, details. Down, get out of here. Oh, back. Just click for back. Got it. Okay. Interesting with a capital I. Look, gesturing in midair to control software might be useful to some and maybe developers will even use the SDK to make something cool out of this, but I gotta say that Harry Pottering my way through photos in the gallery did little to enchant me. It was a lot more fun to get myself made into a Klingon using the new AR doodle features. Yes, justice. Ah, yes of course. They make love at the drop of a hat. The end of the day I'm still an S Pen fan, it's a very useful tool that literally no other phone has, I guess I just expected innovations that further expanded that usefulness on the first double-digit Note. Sticking with things I didn't get, that a prominent selfie camera has a field of view that tops out at just 80 degrees, not wide enough for the vloggers I'll talk about in a second. And on a more particular point, I was really hoping for a backplate made of anything other than glass. Look, I get it, this is where the industry is at and it gives us beautiful designs like the Aura Glow here, but unless you etch it like OnePlus does, it picks up fingerprints like a crime scene and after a while it just feels gross to use. Why call out the Note for this, when nearly every phone is glass? Well because the Note used to be among the most adventurous in terms of alternative finishes. I'd love to see a stitched leather backplate again. Maybe you agree, maybe you don't, but I bet our minds meet when it comes to another omission, the 3.5 millimeter jack is gone. Personally, I don't care about the headphone jack, since I've been using Bluetooth headphones for years, but one of the ways Samsung is trying to push this Note is by appealing to creators. The Note 10 ships with its own video editor, with better video and audio capture and a new screen recording mode that lets you float your face in a bubble on top your content, for live commentary. Given how useful the 3.5 millimeter jack remains for things like lav microphones and selfie sticks, and how the Note has always been Samsung's kitchen sink phone, its removal here doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Of course, the Note 10 plus is still the overpowered super phone it's forerunners were. The battery is huge, the storage is fast and the RAM is prodigious. All great assets to have, even if your phone can't spread itself onto a computer desktop, like this one can. Samsung even granted one of my most important wishes by finally giving us the option to ditch that stupid Bixby button. So on the whole the things you gain with the Note 10 far outweighed the things you lose. As for how many of those gains are worth the price, I'll need more time with the phone in the real world because from live PC game streaming to that new video stabilization, there's a ton I didn't get to try in my first hour with the phone. Pre-orders are live August 8th starting at about 950 for the Note 10 and $1,100 for the +. The 5G version will be exclusive to Verizon at first, with pricing announced later. In the box you get USBC headphones and a 25 watt charger, with a 45 watt charger available for purchase, if you get the +. Pre-order customers get between a $100 and $150 in samsung.com credit, in case you want one of those new 15 watt wireless chargers or the Galaxy Watch Active 2. Which I'm hoping to see at the launch event. If I do you'll see it on my Instagram first, follow me at themrmobile for some early impressions. And if you agree with my objections to glass smartphones, be sure to hit up my sponsor dbrand. For years these guys have sold the best vinyl smartphone skins in the business. So click the link in the description to protect your Note with coatings from subtle to showy. A special thanks to Android central for help shooting this one, along with the other publications listed here whose first look videos you absolutely should check out. I'll link them below. Until next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends.",

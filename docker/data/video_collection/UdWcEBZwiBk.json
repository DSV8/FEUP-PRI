    "transcript": "- All right, we ready to do this? - I am so ready to take a look at- (Matt laughs) - Uh. - This is my show. (children cheering) - Welcome to \"This Is\". - Hello and welcome. - Not even the intro. - Hello and welcome, sorry. - [Matt] Ah. - Oh, well. - So the great thing about this video is that not only is it sponsored by ASUS, but also it's sponsored by not having Matt here, because Justine has replaced him permanently. Sorry, Matt. - Oh my goodness. - But- The channel has just gotten a lot better now. - I can't wait to unbox. - I can't either. (air whooshing) So this my friends, is the brand new Vivobook 16x sent over by a friends at ASUS. Now it's, already been opened. - Oh. This is why he's fired. - [Matt] Ah. - He already unboxed your computer. - Have you looked at this computer? - I heard stories of some people getting phones and then they didn't have phones in there. (Justine laughs) - So while don't we take a look at this brand new Vivobook 16x and to determine, not only how much better Justine is than Matt, but also to see who is the superior laptop performer. Let's crack this open to see. - Okay. Ooh. - Okay. This is outfitted with an OLED display. Incredible performance, amazingly compact. That's what they call me. - Oh, that's cute. - I know. We also have, woo-hoo hoo. - Ah, look at that display. - That's a nice looking display. And it's got the lay flat hinge. - That's so nice. - That actually is really nice. - Like this looks like a photo that's been printed out like that doesn't even actually look real. - So it's one of the nice things about the Vivobook lines that you can outfit them with these OLED displays which give you a ton of contrast, a ton of vibrance, a ton of saturation. Some of the things that are nice about this you do have a dedicated camera cover that's built in, so you can cover up your webcam. Also, you have an antibacterial coating. So basically, everyone knows that laptops get gross, and if you don't know that, news flash, laptops get gross. So the fact that ASUS have loaded this up already, straight outta the box with a coating that will help to prevent a lot of bacteria and germs and whatnot, is a big win. - It's really cool. And they're calling it the antibacterial guard which makes me feel super safe. - I don't think anyone here would be shocked if you end up licking this laptop. Oh God. (bell rings) Mm. - Oh, yep, yep. - I think it might works- - It tastes fresh and clean. - I just, I dunno how I- - [Matt] Mm. - Do you want your job back? (graphic blips) - So the difference here is that this has the Intel Xe graphics. It is a core i7 equipped model, so it's 12th gen. But we've got enough graphics performance for most tasks, including a little bit of light gaming. But this laptop is definitely meant more so for productivity, for graphics work, especially with that high resolution 4K plus OLED display. Also, shout out to this track pad. This track pad is really huge and it tracks super well. Like, that feels really nice. - Can I? - Please. That's the pride in the likes here. Yeah, oh yeah, and I was like, I know where you looked. (giggles) And so this is the fingerprint sensor. - Yeah. - That's great. That's cool, I like that it's built-in right there. So basically we're gonna be doing, I wanna call it like laptop Olympics. - I like it. - So we're gonna be doing- - I don't think we can legally say that. Games. - We didn't get the rights, it's... - Chat laptop challenge? - Laptop games that have lots of skill and require a global competition to perform. - So basically what's gonna happen is we're gonna be doing a bunch of competitions with this laptop: typing, gaming. And we're gonna see who's better at them. - You can see Justine's video to see her creative edit to make it look like she won or something. But clearly, you're here on \"This Is\", you know, you've already subscribed, you're already ring-a-ling, the dang-a-ling bell. And you already are well familiar with how Erin's gonna make this look great. (farting noise) - (nervous laugh) I just want my show back. (graphic blips) - So the competition isn't really about, like, which laptop you should choose. The competition is really happening, to see who can type faster. Who's a better gamer? - Are you nervous? - Am I nervous? - Yeah. - Well, I wasn't until you asked me the question. - Good. - Now I'm a little bit nervous. - Mind games have begun. - Oh no. (air whooshing) - The first challenge is a simple one. How fast can we type the alphabet from A to Z? If you've watched Justine's video you'll know that she's really good at typing. - [Matt] She wrecked you. - I didn't, and I didn't even try. - Okay. you don't have to rub it in. - Well, I mean, I had, I just wanna let them know that I'm better than what I presented on camera. - I would've gotten a better score had you not kicked me out. - Nah, that's a lie. I'm still faster than you. All right. - Sorry. So three tries. Best score out of all, doesn't matter. - Okay. You know, my biggest hurdle with this test. - What? I gotta be like A, B, C. - [Crew Member] It shows it to you on the screen. - Yeah, but it's faster for me to think it. What's the letter after H? (graphic blips) - I. - I. - [Matt] You wanna give another one for us or? - What's after N? - [Matt] M. (buzzer rings) - Oh! - I had to pause on that one. (Justine laughs) - See, the alphabet's hard. There's like 20- - It's not about being right it's about being confident. Three, two. (horn blares) - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it? Are you- - Ah. - Was it a practice, or are we actually doing it? - Was it a practice or are we actually doing it practice. - [Matt] No, we're going. - Okay we're going, just making sure. - Okay, all right. - Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on okay. - Three, two, one. (horn blaring) Go. (bell chimes) (suspenseful electronic music) (success alarm rings) - Oh, no. (laughs) (buzzer rings) - I wasn't looking at the screen. Okay. I will just forfeit that one. - I might be good at typing. (laughs) - [Matt] I bet you were one of those prodigy kids that just like, is successful at everything. - No, I played Mario Teaches Typing, that's how I learned. - [Mario] Hoo. (Crew member laughs) - It was the best game, did you ever play that? - No. - Oh my God. - Clearly I haven't. - Maybe you might need to. - Ready for round two? - Yep. - Okay. - All right, three, two, one, (horn blaring) Go. (bell chimes) (suspenseful electronic music) - Ah, ah. (success alarm rings) That wasn't good. (buzzer rings) - I got 8.5, that was, okay, that was not horrible. (children cheering) - [Matt] Last chance for all the, and we don't really have marbles. - M&M points. - We didn't stop 'em. - Okay. - Get 'em. Three, two, one. (horn blaring) Go. (bell chimes) (suspenseful electronic music) (success alarm rings) (buzzer rings) (hands thud) - [Matt] Did you just get a six flat? - Yeah. I mean, but my other one was still was better. I'm so sorry. (children cheering) - I'm like... - I didn't mean to come here and make you feel bad. - You did. And I hope you are proud of yourself. - It's okay, we still have more challenges, so there's still time to redeem yourself. - There's- Thanks for making me feel like there's still hope. - [Matt] It makes it so much, like worse, that you're so nice about it. - Yeah. (Justine laughs) - I'm sorry you suck. - Do we wanna hate you? - Now I'm just bad. (Austin laughs) I'll get you a license to a typing game, for your birthday. (graphic blips) - So, as we all know, ASUS are the fine purveyors of many high quality laptops, specifically designed for creative professionals. Justine, would you describe yourself as a creative professional? - I would say so. I mean, I was a graphic designer. I mean, I edit video. - Yeah. I mean, a little bit of illustrating. - You check all the boxes. - Yeah. - So how better could we test the performance and the color accuracy of these various laptops that we have, than with the most demanding workload you could possibly throw at a system? - The suspense is killing me. What are we gonna be doing? - MS Paint. - Oh, I mean, this was like the go-to because it's on every computer. - Yeah. - You have it, it's here. - Yes. - So why not use it? - So here's the thing, right? What are we going to paint? No, No. - What, do you wanna- - Do you want- - guess what we should? Do you wanna make up a? - No, he's saying that we should paint him. - Oh, like one of your French girls. - [Austin] But here's the thing Matt. - Oh no. - Oh no. - Oh no. - No, no. - No, no. (Austin laughs) - Oh, good lord. - Oh, okay - Good Lord. - All right. - Okay. All right. Okay. - Okay. - I don't think I have the skills for this one. We're gonna do this. This is uh, I don't think this is gonna be accurate. I'm just gonna say for the record. All right, let me just mental image, just hmm, okay. So just mm. - I'll give you three minutes. - Three minutes. - [Matt] All right, ready? - Yes. - Three, two, one. (horn blares) Go. (bell chimes) - So Matt's a happy little buddy who's got a hat of hair. - [Matt] Life is definitely not imitating art on that one. (Justine laughs) - All right, I'll give you a sad face 'cause you're not happy. And then I'll give you a nice big body here. You got short stubby arms. I'm sorry, Matt. (laughs) - Oh my God, this is so bad. (Austin laughs) - Wow. - Matt, you're wearing jeans. So I'll cut you down the middle here. (Matt blows raspberry) So... - What? - And wait, I need my brush and I need a size. Size is massive. (crew member laughing) Okay. (Matt laughs) (Austin and Justine laugh) - Bro! - No, the brush of the brush. Okay? (crew member laughs) What color are your eyes, Matt? Quick, tell me what color your eyes are. - [Matt] I know what color your eyes are. - Green. Got it. Do you have a nose, Matt? - What? I'm not Voldemort. Five, four, three- - Brush. - [Matt] two, one, done. (graphic beeps) (hands clap) (Austin exhales) (Austin and Justine laugh) - Wow, we've took very different approaches to this. - Okay, but look, I even tried to get the detail of your shirt. - [Matt] Oh, you did. You got the little signs on it - I ran out of time. - I'm noticing a little bit of a difference here. And the body shape, one's a little bit more flatter (laughs) than the other, we we're just... - I was doing it realistic, what I saw. - Yeah, mine was a little round and I. (laughs) - The amount of things that you were describing, you were describing so much, and then did so- - [Austin] You got two feet, you've got pants, which I filled in. - [Matt] I don't have green eyes. - You don't have green eyes. - No. (Austin laughs) - Wow. - I knew that. - I will tell you that self-esteem, all time low at the moment. - Matt's maybe a little more like Golem than I initially expect... (object thuds) Yeah, you know, you're like this, you're like tiny hands, tiny feet, little head, big round stony body. - I mean, I just think like, if you hung this up in an art museum, and someone would be like, \"Wow, it's beautiful.\" (air whooshing) - I have no hope in this video whatsoever. No shot at all. (Justine exhales) All right. So while these may not be gaming laptops with integrated Intel Xe graphics and core i7 12th generation processors. We've got the Intel power. - So we're gonna play some Fortnite. Now we wanted this to be a competition, but the problem is we're gonna be on the same team. - If we try to go 1v1 forever, we'll be here all day long before we finally actually see each other. So in duos, I think this is not only a great game to play on these systems, because I think it will be plenty powerful enough to handle, but also we can showcase our gaming skills as a team and Matt can tell us which one of us are better. - Yeah, so we're in the lobby. We're pretty much ready to go. - So Justine, you are a professional gamer. Austin is not. We don't care about watching what he's doing. - What is this? - Through the power of the ASUS ZenScreen, we have a little portable monitor here for ye. Plug that in, one cable. - We've also got the ASUS ZenScreen which uses a single USB-C cable to power this portable monitor with this beautiful IPS display. It's really easy to set up. You've got yourself not only a built-in kickstand as well as tripod socket, but on top of that, it even has the antibacterial treatment on the front bezels. Let's get some Ws. Let's floss. What do the kids do these days? - I'm not sure. Okay, where you wanna drop? - [Austin] I don't know this, I haven't played this map. - Okay. - This map is very different than what I'm used to. I hear something. - Ooh, ooh, what's that? - Oh, I see, I see you. Okay, I'm here, I'm here. - Something's getting me. Get outta, what? Get out of here. Oh, I'm in this car. Where'd you go? Get in. - Ah, okay hold up, hold up, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. - Oh my God, okay. - All right, let's go. Oh, we're getting shot, we're getting shot. - Really? - Yep. - Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah. Run away, run away! (air roaring) - No, I was, I was going after him. What do you wanna do? - I play to play pacifist. Who wants to shoot people? I just wanna run away from them. Okay, should we go up on top of this tower and maybe camp out for a little bit? - [Justine] Check it out. - Let's just, let's just camp. I'm a big fan of camping. Ah. - Oh no. - What is that? Where's it coming from? - Somebody is shooting at us? - Where's it coming from? Where's it coming from? - Well, get out of there. What are you doing? - Uh, yes, I got one. I got one. (guns shooting) - Oh, no, oh, no, no we gotta go. We gotta go, we gotta go. - Ah! Uh, oh, no, no. - Plow through, plow through. - Oh no, that was bad. Can you please help me? - Where are you? - At some point. I'm in the middle of a fight. - Oh no. - I'm about to die. Oh, I got him. (hands clap) - Woo. - Yes. Yes. Okay, okay, okay. Gimme all your stuff. Okay, I'm gonna, yep. - We gotta run away from the storm. I'm running into the storm. Okay, I'm gonna just- - Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, they're not dead yet. - Hey, stuff. - Nice, nice, nice, okay. - Thanks to the power of our Vivobooks, nothing can stop us. There's only nine people left and we're two of them, so. - Okay. - Someone's hiding behind the rock. I'm gonna go for 'em. Are you behind me? Ah, got 'em, got 'em, got 'em, got 'em. - I'm impressed with your skills. - Thank you, appreciate it. - This may be a win for you. - Ah, behind me. Behind me, behind me, behind me. Ah, ah. - Are you upstairs? - Okay, no, no, no, no. They're coming, they're coming, they're coming, here. (hands clap) (victory horn blares) Yes! - Oh my God, we won! - Who's the winner? We're the winners. - Yes! - Yes. We're the best. The Vivobook champs, right here. Make sure to subscribe to This Is and go check out Justine's video. All about the wonderful S14 and how we definitely won a bunch of challenges together, and not Justine completely crushed me in every single possible thing. I feel, Victory Royale. New boast level wins. - [Matt] I will say, that's the best that Austin has literally ever done in a- - I did pretty good, right? Our superior skill, paired with the unrivaled power of our 12th gen Intel core processors inside our Vivobooks powered us to victory, success, and unbelievable gratitude. To ASUS, for sponsoring this video, and allowing us to use the power of friendship to kick Matt out of a video. Thanks ASUS. - [Justine] Sorry. - Can I have my channel back now? - And your Fortnite account? - [Matt] Yeh, then you can have that one. (laughs) That wasn't getting a whole lot of use. - [Announcer] Game over, yeah! (lively drum music) (cymbal crashes)",

    "transcript": "- It has been two years since the first episode of Broke vs Pro. So today Ken and I are taking it old school with a simple challenge. We're each going to build a gaming PC setup and the one who does the best in price to performance, in creativity and in raw gaming skills, will be crowned the BROKE vs PRO champion. Today's video is in this box. - Oh my, that's not a box, that's a crate dude. - I think this is probably going to be the most beautiful part of my entire setup, which I actually have no idea how to open this. (laughing) I think you were supposed to use a crowbar, not a hammer for this. - Well, we don't have a crowbar. So this is the next best thing. (hammer banging) - What are you doing? Oh my goodness. That is ridiculous. Look at that. - This is quite the curve. It's very aggressive. - Wait, is there a space for my setup? - Nope. - Can we split the monitor? - Nope. - Like you have this half and I have this half. - Nope, real estate isn't free, sorry. - So, my plan is simple. I want to build the cheapest gaming PC I can. And then with the money I save, I'm going to try to make it look vaguely presentable. But most of all, win the price to performance, and if I can spend 300 bucks, 250 bucks, something like that, I'll be feeling good. Probably the more difficult thing for me to find is going to be a graphics card. So let me start with that. Okay, so 750 bucks for 3060 gonna be slightly outside of my price range. Wow a 4870 for $170. Okay. That's bad. That's 42 3060, all right. Well, if you're wondering where the GPU shortage came from, it's this guy, let me get it out your hand. Let me stop looking for game PCs. Let me just look for office or just computer, you know, desktop computer Athlon X2 and two gigs of Ram. I can't go too low end. I need to be able to run Valorant. Wait, what's the minimum spec for Valorant? It is a core i3-370M and HD 3000 graphics. Oh, oh, okay, actually that's fine. That's gonna belay, basically anything I look for. So this is something that actually has potential. $200, okay. It is a HP computer with a core i5-2500, which is old, but still it's a quad core chip. There's still performance there. 16 gigs of Ram and importantly, a GTX 1050. And it comes with a Samsung monitor. I'm gonna text the dude. It's still available, all right. Do you think we can go out, like pick it up right now? - Let's do it. - So we should be in pretty good shape here. I think if I'm actually able to get this PC and the dude's actually there, this will give me a huge advantage in the price to performance category. Now I'm gonna have to do something to actually get this thing to look nice and actually try to get some kind of creativity out of it. But I mean, other than that, I think it's a lay up. I think you're in trouble my friends. - A lay up, you've been watching basketball. - Yeah (laughing) - You've not watch basketball. - So, we've got ourselves the beginning of my broke set up. And by the beginning, I mean, I'm pretty much done. So inside the system, we actually have some pretty decent components. So not only do we have a low profile 1050, which actually might be good, slight problem if I try to move this out of the case. I only have the regular hard drive, which I can pull out pretty easily. And the power supply is 240 Watts. So not incredibly powerful, but I think it will do the job. With my broke rig coming together nicely. Now it's time for Ken to start work on his overkill pro setup. All right, so now we are at Micro Center and Jared, I need computer parts. - Well luckily you're at a Micro Center. - Yeah, fortunately for me. - We have plenty of computer parts for you - Look at this Ken, you're getting the white glove treatment right now. - I know. - How Broke vs Pro are we getting today? - So I do need to account for a price to performance scenario here and I think Austin - You already know my bill. You've seen my bill. You know, I spent $160 on my system so far. - I think like Ryzen 7, - We're on the 5800X? - 5800 X is probably where I should land. - There you are. - Thank you. Thank you. Oh, wait, whoa, wait, what? (group laughing) - You don't see them in the wild very often, do you? You will lose with the 6900 XT. - Yes, I would. I'm gonna pass on that. That is a great deal. Look at this B550 Aorus Pro. - Yo with WiFi - For 117. - Look at you. - Wow! - I thought you're a pro, you actually care about saving money. You should buy full price version to show that you're a pro, and to give me an advantage. I mean to show that you're a pro. - Hey you guess what Ken, while you do that, I'm going to go get the only thing I need. Oh, look, a 21.99 SSD. Don't mind if I do. I'm done. - So we're going to use this CPU cooler, the U12S. - Look at that you have a cart now too. - Your trusty steed. Thank you. I need to grab LL120s. Oh, whoa. (group laughing) Can I buy them all? - No, no, no! All right, let's go. Come on, come on, it's broke vs pro, not broke vs slow. - I need an affordable set of RAM. If we can get the 16 gig, 3200 megahertz. - 32, wow that doesn't sound very pro. That sounds pretty broke to me. - Ken, I'm hearing a lot of trash talk from Austin, but you're not really throwing anything back. I don't think that's what a pro would do. - Yeah! Ken, you're not feeling too confident over here anymore, are ya? - I never think that I'm gonna win, but it always just happens. (Austin laughs) So we'll just go under that assumption. - So it's clear that Ken is feeling pretty confident, but I don't think he realizes what he's getting himself into. Hello and welcome to broke vs pro the episode where Austin crushes Ken with his excellent value system. Thankfully, he actually did give me a super high quality keyboard (keyboard clattering) and a very clean small mouse, which I will have to use. Supposedly the monitor works. I assume it's probably going to be like 720p, that would be my guess. I have a lot of USB ports though. That's good and I have a DVD player. So can you watch DVDs? I can watch Netflix? - Okay, so very happy to report. We are up and running. Now, I'm pretty sure that this display is 1366 by 768. It actually doesn't look bad though, right? This looks totally fine. I wouldn't realize that this thing is 12 years old. I probably am not going to get a lot of creativity points with Matt judge. With buying a system off Craigslist and calling it a day. So what can I do with this? That's going to actually give me some points. I need to modify the chassis that it's in right now. How can I do that? So not too long ago, we did a video, buying a bunch of tech from pawn shops. And as part of that video, I painted a 2DS red. I'm gonna now use the exact same paint that has already been paid for to paint this system red. (spray can rattling) Time for some painting action doesn't that fill you with confidence. I have done no cleaning, sanding, priming. This is paint and primer. So I'm just gonna assume that it just works. Oh God. That is not going to show up. It's so dark. Ooh! - That's not a - That's not great, but I'm going to do a couple coats. So we'll just use that as base don't mind is a little thick and sticky here. That'll be fine. Look, I'm going for an artistic look. I'm not going just for a red PC. 'Cause it's that really exciting? I don't think so. I'm going for my own artistic interpretation of what a gaming PC should look like. I'm gonna challenge you to reinvent your own thoughts on how the aesthetics of a gaming PC are supposed to work. Enjoy my artistic vision. Matt, you gotta admit right now you're looking at this and you're struggling not to share how many points you're going to give me for my artistic vision. - There's some trees falling on your painting. - I like to incorporate nature in my artistic vision. Hey, this looks great. I don't think I need to do anything else. I think I'm done. - Or I can. Ooh! Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you just paint on my side panel? - It's a smiley face. - You know what, I vibe with that artistic vision. - Oh, thank you. But no more, that's enough artistic vision. - The hell is this, innovative tempered glass gaming case. Are you just building an Illuminati thing right now? - I'm building a pyramid. It's a PC pyramid. And here are all my parts. - You got to fill me in on why there's an RTX 3070 in your parts list. I didn't see an RTX 3070 when you left Micro Center. Where'd that come from? - The office. - All right and how much are you supposedly spending on your RTX 3070? - How much are they going for on eBay? - $3,000. - Hell no, they're not. - I'll be generous. (upbeat music) And say 900. - What! That's all for 3070! - Oh my God. Oh my God. (Austin laughs) - It's a whole frame, whoa. All right. I did not expect that to actually be the whole interior. - Austin - Competition aside that's actually really cool. - It is. This might be one of the coolest PC cases I've ever used. - I don't think this is going to be an easy build, but it will certainly be one of the more interesting ones. (upbeat music) And so my setup is finally complete. We have the huge centerpiece here, my monitor, and of course next to it is my completed PC build with the Ryzen 7 5800X. - Tell me about your PC. - It's our judge, Matt Ansini. - So what, why, why? - Why not? - That's fair, that is fair. - I agree. Why is a great question. - Here's the thing. Here's the thing like when we're talking about PC builds, what does a PC look like? I mean, I'm going to walk over here. Let me just, not that, I'm going to walk over here. You see all these PCs, what do they all have in common? - They look functional. - Yeah. - They're rectangles. - This seems just wildly impractical. It looks cool. - It's very impressive. - It definitely looks cool. But like. - I like to put stuff on my PC. - I in all my eloquent language have determined that it is time for me to share my creation with you and with you dear judge. So this is the Austin gaming budget special. Okay. So we can take it old school. - The first thing I'm going to notice about this, is this is probably the best thing that you've made. - Wait, no, I don't think that's a compliment. - It is. But when your bar is down here. - I have done some TLC. So I have not only re-pasted did the CPU, taken the entire thing apart and cleaned it and dusted it. I've also upgraded with a modern SSD for the low, low price of $22. Which brings the grand total, including my led black lights strip on the bottom of this entire setup, the system, the graphics card, SSD, lighting, my mouse, keyboard and the monitor of $192. Yes, yes. Ah, amazement and shock $192. And unlike Ken who's cheating and using this table, I didn't steal anything from the office. This is literally what the monitor came in. I'm reusing the garbage to continue my up-cycling - Do we have the shipping manifests? - How much does it cost to actually ship with lumber prices? This literally was going straight to the dumpster and I took it. So in the most appropriate name for a test ever, we're going to do price to performance with the 3DMark Time Spy. - So this is a pretty comprehensive benchmark to show not only your graphics performance, your gaming performance, also your CPU. Generally speaking, this is a good sort of stand in for a lot of modern DirectX 12 titles. So if you do well in Time Spy, you're probably going to do well in most games. - So for this what we're going to do is we'll take the benchmark score and divide that by the cost of the system. So yes, Ken is going to beat the benchmark score, but his score is going to be a much lower price to performance than $190 in theory. - Oh, I got my score. - What is it? All right, what is your score? - 13,536. - Oh, that's bad. - No, it's not bad. It's great. - No, that's bad for me. I didn't think he'd give you that high. All right, well mine just finishing up. I think I'll be okay. - I think you need to get at least 1,500. - 1,925. - 1,925 okay. - Oh, okay. - So, I'm well, within 10% of your score. Now, I guess, are we gonna find out later when. - We'll hold it judging for the end, let's not call it right now. - Welcome to the real challenge of Broke vs Pro, which is a point which I'm going to destroy Ken with inferior gear. Ken, are you ready to be destroyed? - I'm ready for stuff. I don't know about being destroyed. - That sounds really sus, look you ready for stuff. - All I need is to beat you, while watching a Linus Tech Tips video. - You're watching Linus Tech Tips right now. - Yeah, while playing Valorant. - Are you using your PC as a mousepad? - I am. I am. Because the mouse kept getting stuck on all the rough wood here. So this is the smoothest surface I have. My freshly painted surface. - Can we do the aesthetic portion of this bill after? - I've made notes. I've made notes, don't worry. - Okay, okay, thanks judge. I trust you. - Ooh, look at this. Look at this 130 FPS. - Wow. - 130! - 360 FPS. That's okay, I've got a 60 Hertz display to really show me. Oh God. Wow! - I have all 240 Hertz. - Hey yo, for real, can I have a little bit of practice time? 'Cause this mouse is very bad and I have not gotten used to it at all. Okay, okay. (gunshots) There we go. - Wow. - One for Mr. Austin that is. - Ooh, ooh oh, wow. I definitely want him to have that one, oops. - Ken, how you doing over there? Leaderboard. - I am right now four and five. - I am 12 something. - 12 what? - 12 and 6. Oh, okay that's bad. That's not great for me. - I have not killed Austin yet. - I actually seen you at all. Ah, no, no! - Oh, that's Austin. Wow. - You shot me in the back, you coward. - Like that. Okay, that. - Oh, that was just Austin. - Yeah, I saw you have with sniper, I should have just stepped away. It went too slow. - What? Oh, the message. Oh, I got the last kill. I mean, I didn't win. - That wasn't the last kill then. So I killed Austin a total of like three or four times, I think, which doesn't hugely matter, but I got 33 and 19. - Two out of three? - No. What you talking about. You said one round. I mean you could do more and I don't think it's going to help you, but. - I think we should do one more. I mean two more 'cause I'm gonna win the next two. - I don't think you will, but if you want to, I mean. - It's been a long, hard fought battle, this episode of Broke vs Pro. But at the end it always comes down to the opinion of our fine handsome and well-established judge Matthew Ansini. Matt, please tell us how I won Broke vs Pro. - Okay, so obviously Ken whooped your butt in Valorant that's pretty common. Obviously the point goes to him there. Let's talk about price to performance. Your system costs $192 and you got a benchmark of 1,925, which means your price or performance score is at 10.4. - 10.4. That's above 10. That's a double digit number more than my FPS. So I'll take it. - So Ken spent $2,320 on his system and he got a score of 13,536, which means your price to performance score was a five, 5.8. - Whew. So I could have spent twice as much. I could've actually afforded a mouse pad and I still would've won. - You could've afforded a gamer to play the game for you. - So here we go to a aesthetic. - Is that really what it comes down to it? - This is the first time, I think it's ever come down to aesthetic. I can't believe I'm gonna say this. - No, yes. - So obviously Ken's looks better. - Yeah. - Wait. - But. - It's happening, it's happening. - I have to admit that yours doesn't look that bad because normally when you build something, it looks horrible. I'm giving this one to Austin. - Yes Broke vs Pro Champion of the world, Austin Evans in the house. - I (Austin grunting) - Creativity and artistic vision wins the day. Thank you very much for watching this episode of Broke vs Pro. I'm going to celebrate with my glorious gaming PC and above all remember who is the winner Broke vs Pro today? - Not you anymore because after that gloating, act like you've been there before. I'm giving this one to Ken now.",

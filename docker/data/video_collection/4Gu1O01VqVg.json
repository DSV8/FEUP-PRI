    "transcript": "for months my Valiant and totally reasonable goal of gaming on a NAS using an external graphics card has eluded me but a new Contender promises to fulfill the prophecy but first speaking of computers if you want to learn more about them than just celleronplus fast Graphics SC equals bad, then today's video sponsor brilliant.org is the app for you. I've been enjoying their 'how large language models work' course, which starts off by teaching you how to identify AI generated content. Nice! Congratulations you're now prepared for the AI apocalypse. You can try any of the thousands of lessons Brilliant has to offer, free for 30 days just visit the link brilliant.org Dawid or click the link below and the first 200 of you will get 20% off of brilliant's annual premium subscription now according to Asustor, this NAS definitely supports GPUs being plugged into it and they would know because well they made it. Woah, that's a lot of accessories. So we get two cat 5e cables and you get a bunch of Drive screws and a little bracket that you can use for cable routing the power supply cable that's a nice addition and then we get quite a beefy 90 W power brick and a cable fac set power brick and that's it okay this is the asustor as 6704 T and it looks like a network attached storage with its four Drive Bays on the front. and then on the back we've got this huge fan to cool all of the hard drives inside and we've got dual 2.5 gigabit ethernet with one USB 3 Port which will be enough we can use a dongle and then the HDMI port and power now this HDMI port is a rare and B very important for our use case of gaming on the nas cuz it lets us plug a monitor into it and install an operating system other than the nas operating system on it that's just designed to store your pirate movies and highly embarrassing photos of you as a teenager on we've got like a little screen on the front that we can control with these buttons so that we don't need a monitor to operate it facade blackmail picture storage now this new Nas for our second attempt of GPU plugging into Nas action that was very kindly sent over by a sou store by the way gets a healthy spec bump the previous one had a lowly Celeron j4105 in it whereas this has the much more power powerful Celeron n5105 which is like a slightly better version of the same one but it does have a better igpu in it which means we'll probably get better gaming performance just straight out of the box from this Nas which I think we should try now so let's install Windows on it and see what kind of oomph we've got with this one oh this poor little bastard has no idea what Terrible Things are about to befall us but let's see do just now to convert the NAS from a powerful piece of network storage to a terrible little computer I just dropped an SSD in spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to get into the BIOS by hitting Escape hey they just arbitrarily changed the button from Escape to F2 between the two generations very nice but what I found in the Bios more than made up for the Betrayal oh you can turn reiz bar on that's a very good sign then all I had to do was update the boot priorities and I was is ready to defile the nas with Windows o now say what you will about this generous frame rate this is 1080p gaming on an ass it's kind of like going on an Arctic Expedition with a 90-year-old it's not really its comfort zone you know and it's a very smooth 12 frames per second interestingly as is often the case with these cerons the CPU is bottlenecking its own igpu which seems to happen quite a lot on this channel uh but hopefully if we add some more RAM into this system than the 4 gigs that we have now if we can do that it should give us a bit more CPU Headroom for when we drop in the big boy Graphics scard oh that comes off nice and easily oh that's pretty cool on the top here we've got this little daughter board with space for four m.2 drives on top of the four 3.5 mm drives hopefully it's not too annoying for us to get access to the Ram oh I see so I think you just lift that up and then you can add another stick of ram oh and aside from the one ram slot I think it's going to be pretty easy to use the m.2 slots and an adapter to add a graphics card to this system but before we tear it down more and have a look at these options let's just drop in some more RAM and see how much of a performance difference that makes adding an 8 gig stick has made a pretty big difference to the performance it's not running at 24 frames per second yet but it's it's getting closer and currently it seems like the igpu and the CPU are pretty balanced in terms of bottlenecking situation but yeah look at that you can kind of play GTA 5 at 1080p on a Nas If you have low enough standards you know I'm curious I wonder if we can play like Crisis on it a 1080p low settings that is surprisingly good back when crisis came out people would sell off their Gra grandchildren to get this kind of gaming experience in this game and now it's running on a Nas and as is always the case halflife 2 is playable yay very good so yeah just cuz your PC has the specs of an ass doesn't mean you can't have some good gaming action happening on it and now that we've established that it's time to drown the little Nas in more Graphics God than it could ever have imagined now before we plug a graphics card into it I'm going to disassemble it more than I need to because I can't help but break every piece of tech that I interact with yeah so there's our little daughter board for a whole bunch of m.2 expansion next I think we're going to remove this back panel oh that's where the rest of the screws were hiding and then that just pops off that's a cool looking interior there is quite a lot going on in here we've got the the bit of I/O that's connected to what I guess we can call the main motherboard and then this daughter board connects the storage to the main motherboard via a 4X pcie slot but I think now that we have it open like this we can turn it around and we should be able to get this main board out okay oh would you look at that the 4 gigs actually isn't solder down it's just here I'm going to remove this and replace it with another 8 gig stick and here is our main board with the two 4X pcie slots for connecting the two Banks of storage to it or Graphics Cod and under this tiny little heat sink is our seller on which I don't think is quite enough for gaming considering the mild heat stroke the CPU gets oh I don't like this why do I always insist on doing this to myself oh oh there we go that's why cuz it always looks cool under the thing wo this thing is so modular even the LCD with the little buttons is its own replaceable little daughter board and this is the board for a couple more buttons and the front USB 3.2 so I think this is the kind of thing that theoretically is very repairable with that itch scratched I reassembled the system and went to grab the graphics card for this dumb experiment and obviously we have to use the Wu yes RX 7800 XD now in order to get this Behemoth working with the little Nas we have to use our trusty m.2 to PCI Express adapter kit now as far as I remember it this is the one of the 18 that I bought that actually worked now the idea is pretty simple you just plug this end into an m.2 slot you plug your graphics card into this end with a little bit of supplemental power and you're Off to the Races let's see if if it turns out that simple this time just like that our wfu is nestled in blue tentacles ready to go and I'm really excited to see if this works because this is the culmination of like 4 months of trying various configurations wow I mean that's a good sign things are spinning lights are going going on wo this may legitimately be the first time in like 500 videos that I just plugged a thing in and it worked the way I wanted it to maybe I'm celebrating too soon I was celebrating too soon because the driver install when it finished prompted the system to restart and once it switched off it it just didn't post again um I think the driver install corrupted the windows cuz if you click on Windows the dis manager or what it look I just had to tempt fate didn't I I couldn't wait for it to actually work before saying anything infuriatingly long story short when I reassembled the system I put the SSD back in the second slot which on first boot it didn't seem to mind but after the restart it suddenly was too good for the second slot for some reason and when I moved the SSD back into the first slot it booted again for some reason oh thank louder that fixed it we're using the graphics card now and we're posting back into Windows this is a fresh install though so I do need to reset everything up which kind of sucks but you know it's better than nothing and it even survived the driver install restart which meant we were ready to game it's finally happening a waifu graphics card and Nas operating in perfect symbiosis this is some real Cutting Edge GPU bottleneck cocking about wait a minute why is it running more weirdly than it was with just the igpu but wait a minute even with most of the stuff loading in this is quite a good gaming experience 10 oh yeah never mind um oh I just crashed into a thing that I can't see in fact this is the worst I think I've seen this happen where like the game just doesn't load oh it's so bad the thing is it's kind of weird weird because normally when this happens it's paired with a really low frame rate but we're actually getting where like none of the game is rendering with a high frame rate now with Battlefield 5 after I've found somewhere to spawn uh everything's rendering we can see the game things are happening uh but at 1080p medium settings we're sitting around 40 frames per second when we're lucky this is an RX 6800 XT we're using here I'm pretty sure this is not the correct amount of frame rates we're we're expecting from this Graphics gun and another thing is you can see that we very much don't have a consistent frame time happening it's it's all over the place and you can really feel that in the game this is a pretty bad feeling 40ish frames per second however when I finished playing Battlefield 5 something bad happened uh while I was waiting for cyberpunk to download its fifth 10 gig patch of the week the system shut down and it never turned on again I don't know what's wrong with it or what happened I just can't get it to post again so we may have been able to game on it with a graphics card for a brief beautiful moment but I'm pretty sure that it killed it which brings me to the end of another video ending in destruction thank you very much for watching and until the next one bye-bye w",

    "transcript": "- Hello welcome to \"This Is\". Last week Microsoft showed off some of our most comprehensive Xbox Series X gameplay yet, and the reaction was I would say slightly underwhelming. Whereas this week Sony countered with their own PlayStation 5 gameplay. However it's not strictly gameplay as well, yes it's running on PlayStation 5 hardware but it's more a tech demo for the very, very popular Unreal Engine, now running on it's fifth iteration. So Matt I think the real question here is now that we've seen a good glimpse at what both the PS5 and the Xbox Series X are capable of, it's easy to say that PlayStation is looking really good. - I mean first thing to point out is that yeah the Unreal demo is running on PS5 hardware, but this was not Sony showing off the capability of the PS5. So there's nothing really saying that Unreal demo could have been run on the Series X. Part of when we had the Series X revealed, it was a pretty crappy, compressed, YouTube stream. - These are a lot of titles that are cross gen, right. And obviously the first games of a generation are usually sort of shared with previous. It's not necessarily the best representation of what the Xbox Series X gameplay would ultimately look like. On the flip side, while yes the tech demo on PS4, sorry PS5 is very impressive, but the thing is, Epic straight up said that it is also going to be ported to the Xbox Series X. You're still gonna see of course, Unreal Engine 5, and because we know the Xbox Series X is slightly more powerful, it is going to look just as good if not slightly better. So yes, we obviously have this tech demo, and that's great, but the thing is tech demos are very rarely indicative of what we're actually going to see with real games. If you remember, first of all a couple years ago when ray tracing was first sort of really showing off and announced, there was this incredible ray tracing demo I believe EA did, that looked great, but have we seen a game that looks that good yet? Not necessarily. This Unreal Engine 5 demo is very much like a best case scenario for what we could see with the PS5 and the Series X. But the thing that they actually announced here is that it is also moving over to an Unreal Engine 5 background, which means that with that more powerful engine and of course the much more powerful consoles, we're looking at a game like Fortnite, which really is going to be leading with a lot of these very cool new features. Is it going to be photo realistic? Absolutely not, that's not the start style. But what does it go to show, is that we have some major leaps in technology, not only on the engine side with Unreal Engine, but also on the hardware side, with these new generation consoles. That's the gameplay I wish we would have seen. Not necessarily just a simple tech demo. - Yeah, because you know it's nice that we have the higher graphics but you said it yourself in your video last week, graphics are not making these leaps and bounds, like they did in previous generations and so a lot of people looked at some of this gameplay and said well that doesn't look that much better than the Xbox One, or a PS4. And I feel like people are missing the point with how powerful these consoles are this coming up generation, because graphics are only part of the what is gonna take advantage of that power. - Absolutely, and honestly I feel like we can go a lot more in depth on the differences between the console generations, and in the expectations of what this next generation is really gonna provide. - When we do videos like these the number one comment we always get is, LOL just joined PC master race or whatever. There's no one arguing that a console is more powerful than a PC. - Well I will say, these new consoles, specifically the Series X, is basically equivalent to a very high-end game PC today. But you're right, it's easy to go from bad to okay, and it's not that hard to go from okay to good, the problem is once you hit that sort of good level, let's say like Xbox 360, PS3. To go from good to great, and especially to go from good to like realistic. - I also wonder though, do we want a person to look better in a game? Let's talk ethics for a second. Do you remember Modern Warfare 2, No Russian, where you go through the airport. - Yeah. - How would you feel if the people were more realistic in that? If it was photo realistic, if you're looking at an indistinguishable human-- - All right, Matt Black Mirror Ansini. - That's my point, that's creepy. So there has to be a level of separation. - Take a step back for a second though. There's obviously more advantages and better looking graphics than just purely the negative side of things. So obviously with these new consoles we're getting more power. We're getting better processors, which can handle bigger worlds, more detailed simulations with physics and what not, we have more graphics horsepower to render not only the bigger worlds by themselves, but also to have more detail in those worlds and then we have the ability to support things like ray tracing, which especially with the lighting really is one of the last keys to unlocking a much more realistic looking visual experience. But it doesn't all have to be the negatives of, oh no you're Call of Duty 35 is gonna look too realistic and your mom's gonna yell at you for playing it or something. There's certainly advantages to improving beyond just people getting mad at video games for looking better, right. - I agree, and that's not my point either. What everyone is complaining about is this doesn't look that munch better. The next console generation is crap, because it doesn't look that much better. - It's a fair criticism when you consider that these consoles are likely going to be 500 perhaps even $600. And if you're looking at that, and you're looking at your old PS4, or your Xbox One, which obviously you've had for years, or you could pick up for 100 bucks on eBay, you might really question, why am I spending this money, or you also might question why shouldn't I just go and build myself a gaming computer and have the many benefits of a PC. So I get that to some degree, for sure. - So I'm gonna use Final Fantasy VII again, and that's my bench mark. I looked at that game and I said, these graphics are good enough for me for the foreseeable future. Like visually, the way that people look in that game, the way that textures on weapons, or on the enemies, on Cloud, and Aerith, and especially Barret. Barret looked amazing in that game. And that was enough for me for a character where I want that power that's coming with the Series X and the PS5, is not in better graphics for the characters and what not, it's I want it in the everything else about the game. With all this power you can have these massive, massive open-world games. Something like a Skyrim type game. - Let's actually talk GTA VI for a second, because I think that's a good idea of a game that GTA V is easily one of the most popular games of all time right now, right. They have sold so many copies, it's seven years old and they're still selling it like hotcakes every day. So this is a game that was originally designed for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. Now that was obviously, by the time GTA V came out those consoles were old, but one thing they still had going for them was really quite powerful processors. One of the things I talked about in my video on the main channel was that the PS4 specifically, actually was almost like a side grade it wasn't actually a big processor jump going from PS3 to PS4, which limited some of the open-world games that we saw going forward into the new generations. However, that with PS5 and Series X. So we're looking at about a four times performance improvement on the processors, which really will open up things like GTA VI to look much more realistic not on the graphics side. But you could have better looking rag doll physics, you could crash through city skylines with your vehicle and the entire building could fall down. There's the processing power to pull off something which really does look a lot better not only on the experience side, but also of course on the visual side. - Like everyone saying, oh it's more powerful, it just has to look more amazing, more amazing, more amazing. I don't think it does, because I think a game would be so much more immersive if you suddenly have all this, if the environment is say 100% interactive. If you could actually shoot a building and a bullet hole is a permanent thing, or if you could actually crash a building because the physics are built into every aspect of it, that is so much more immersive than looking slightly better, or slightly more realistic. When we showed the ray tracing Minecraft in the Xbox Series X reveal video everyone was like wow that doesn't look that good, well you're not watching it on, we didn't shoot it in HDR. You're not watching in HDR. Of course it doesn't look that good, it's limited by what you're watching it on. Let's face it, a console is meant to hook up to a T.V. That's always been the case for those. It's one thing to say, I'm gonna go get a $1,000, $1,500 gaming monitor, which has HDR, and 144 Hz, or 244 Hz frame rate, whatever, that's not what a console is meant, a console is meant to go in a living room with your 55 inch T.V. - I think the thing is, there's always a chicken and egg style situation, where if you look at T.V.s and consoles being developed together, which obviously they are, I feel like fairly few PC gamers use a T.V., fairly few console gamers use a monitor. It's kind of separate. It makes sense that you would see the consoles trying to take the lead on a lot of the stuff, and in fact we actually have seen that. So for example, the Xbox One, for several years now has supported FreeSync, which is variable refresh rate, something similar to what Nvidia has with G-Sync, on T.V.s or obviously on any device. But they've lead the way and companies like Samsung adopting FreeSync and Adaptive Sync for their T.V.s and obviously we've seen specifically on the LG side some of their OLEDs actually supporting full G-Sync, which is really impressive. So there's definitely been some movement there and honestly in talking with some of the Microsoft guys it does seem like some of the things like that they put inside the Xbox One really were a proof of concept to push the T.V. industry forward, to have better support for things like when you plug a console in, or when you start playing a game, automatically switching over to game mode for example. - I agree with you there. We're both saying the same thing, in different voices. Everyone always says just get a PC and that will solve all your problems. Again, yeah your PC looks better, and it has better frame rate, but at the end of the day your character can only do the same things on the console versus the PC. - If you look at the PC, a PC will allow you to play game at low, medium, high, ultra, and will allow you to turn on and off graphics features but it still has to be the same game across the board. And we're seeing the same thing if you look at PS4 versus the PS4 Pro, versus a PC, versus a PS5, all of these games, the games are gonna be the same across all of these platforms. And until we get to a point where either you've got the crazy exclusives like the Naughty Dogs and the 343s of the world who are developing specifically for these new consoles and put everything into we're gonna juice absolutely everything we can out of the PS5 and the Series X, what we're really waiting for is for everyone to catch up to where the consoles really arguably are leading right now. - One of the biggest memes with game logic is, I can't go down this path or I can't enter this room, because they put a one foot shrub in front of me. So to me until you can say, on PC I'm allowed to enter that room because my PC is so much better, but on console I still can't because I can't render that. Until you can give me that kind of distinction between the two, the whole PC master race argument is invalid to me. - Matt, you are just asking for it. You're asking for it in the comments, you're asking for it. - I know, but this is how I feel about it. Yes your PC looks better. No one is arguing that. But at the end of the day, we are still playing the same game. - I mean I can't argue with that. Thank you very much, for watching this episode of \"This Is\". Feel free to let Matt know your very eloquently thought thoughts in the comments. I'm sure he's going to read every one, and really appreciate your very insightful feedback. And of course make sure to subscribe here on \"This Is\" for lots more gaming, and I don't know what's our next video Matt? Do we have any more videos or is this is it? I think I got myself canceled, but we do have some cool videos coming up so check 'em out.",

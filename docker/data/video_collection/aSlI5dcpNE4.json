    "transcript": "- As everybody knows, the human body needs just three things to survive. Clean water, chicken tenders and fresh tech news. We can only give you one of those things here. So, drink up special child. - [Riley] Wait. How do you drink... - Nvidia, you are so sneaky. You thought we wouldn't notice that you're reducing the cryptocurrency mining efficiency of the RTX 3060, and announcing a new product line of GPUs dedicated specifically to mining. But we did notice. See, Nvidia? Your big mistake was publishing a blog post, announcing those two things. Big (indistinct) These new CMPs or Cryptocurrency Mining Processors don't support graphics output, and are essentially meant to be a piece of bait dangled out in front, so the crypto miners bite at it while sparing the tender, young gaming GPU's for the rest of us. - [Riley] Not the babies. - But the miners won't want those gaming ones anyway, because of that mining efficiency limiter that is apparently so robust that Nvidia claims it cannot be hacked. (laughing) You see, it's a secure handshake between the driver, the silicon and the BIOS and walls like those, have frankly speaking, never been breached. (wall explodes) So, we've got miners upset that Nvidia is dictating what you can or can't do with your own hardware. We've got gamers upset that this probably won't do anything to help the GPU stock shortage. And we've got Jensen who's upset because he's all like sitting on his motorbike with his leather jacket, flipping his shades like, \"You're welcome.\" - [Riley] Whoa. He's so cool. - And you'll never believe this, but Chrome OS has overtaken macOS as the second most used operating system in the PC space after Windows, despite being worse than both of the other ones. This news comes from Mike Shirer, an analyst for the market research firm, IDC who confirmed the findings to GeekWire. While Chrome OS devices have outsold Mac's in single quarters before, 2020 is the first full year where Chromebooks consistently took second place. Interestingly, while you could see this as a loss for Apple, it's actually a bigger blow for Microsoft. In 2020 market share for Chrome OS grew from 6.4 to 10.8% with macOS actually also growing slightly from 6.7 to 7.5. Windows meanwhile, dropped from 85.4 to 80.5. So, it looks like Google's strategy of brainwashing students with free access to Chromebooks is working. I wish I had thought of it. (indistinct) Linus OS. We could call it Linux. (laughing) And Canada may join Australia in facing off against Facebook. Canadian Heritage Minister, Steven Guilbeault told reporters that he is working on legislation that would require giant platforms like Google and Facebook to pay news publishers, to link to their content. Now, because of the... Wait, why... These laws are apparently a heritage thing? - [Riley] Yeah. Totally. - Now, we Canadians don't traditionally insert ourselves into conflicts unless someone insults the village moose. But, Guilbeault said that Canada is at the forefront of this battle. Right behind Australia, that is. - [Riley] Oh, yeah. - Where Facebook has already blocked all news posts in an attempt to deter the country from passing their Link Tax legislation. For that matter, France is deeply embroiled in this too. - [Riley] We gotta let them go first. We're polite. - Right and hold the door. Facebook's move has been heavily criticized for being unreasonably heavy handed. The news ban ended up also blocking some government health pages, for example, which users depend on for information about COVID-19. Great. And now we've signed up for this. The prospect of using Bing was funny when we were talking about Australia where their internet barely works anyway, but now it's not. - [Riley] Don't be... That's mean. - Now Riley's got something to tell you guys. - Now it's time for Quick bits brought to you by PDFelement. The affordable app that stops you from smashing a hole in your desk because signing PDFs is so frustratingly difficult. You see, PDFelement makes it super simple to sign, edit, annotate, and make notes on any PDF. You can also combine, crop and easily compress big PDFs to a smaller size or if you just hate PDFs period, you can convert them into Word, Excel or JPEG files. PDFelement is available on Windows, Mac, iPhone, and iPad, and supports Google Drive and Dropbox. So you don't even have to keep those nasty files on your local device. Wow! Plus you can get 50% off by using our link. So check it out down below. - Splits splats, it's what you call Quick bits when you don't want to say quack bots. Wait, damn it. I said it. Well, it doesn't matter. - [Riley] We're using it. - Apple has subpoenaed Valve with a request for years of data pertaining to Steam's game library and sales numbers in an attempt to show that there is plenty of competition in the market and therefore Epic Games' antitrust claims against Apple are totally invalid. And Apple almost got away with it too, if it weren't for Valve being not complete idiots and outright refusing to give them any of that data, mostly because Valve doesn't even (beep) compete in the mobile app market. Which is the focus of Epic and Apple's fight. And by the way, just to be clear, this has nothing to do with Valve and Epic and some kind of secret PC gamer alliance. I'm not convinced there's any love lost between those two. It's just that Apple's request was overreaching at best. - [Riley] Did you work for weeks on this? - French hardware site, Cowcotland, claims to have inside information that AMD will launch the Radeon RX 6700 XT, on March 18th. The card is supposed to have 12 gigabytes of memory, 40 Ray Accelerators, and be available in limited quantities. Oh, AMD. You should really talk to Nvidia about throwing an unhackable crypto limiter on there. I heard they're unhackable. - [Riley] Oh, can you not hack them? - And there's some more leaks. Chinese language site, HKEPC claims that they know that Intel's 11th Gen Rocket Lake desktop processors will launch on March 15th and that it'll be a hardware launch. That's the kind with availability in store. That won't be bad. I think it'll be fine. Yeah. It's 14 nanometers, so... Lots of that going around. (indistinct) Hey, got them. LTT store processor pillows. Go buy them. I went off script. So that didn't really work. NASA successfully landed the Perseverance Rover on Mars yesterday with a rocket powered platform that looks, more than a little like Green Goblins glider from Spiderman. - [Riley] Cool. - But you know what's even cooler than Spiderman? Pictures of the Martian surface. And you know, what's better than that? This thing. Which is the latest entry in the category of fabric-covered robots designed to remind you of a cat. Except this one called the Nicobo, doesn't just make purring sounds a wag its tail. It also farts. - [Riley] Yes. - Whenever it wants. It just lets them rip. You think there's like an app where you can control how often it farts? You fool. It's a cat anolog. It does as it pleases. It's descended from the noble hunters of the plane. It's fart impulses cannot be contained. It is $360. - [Riley] Take my money. - Why don't you just get a cat? They are no work at all unlike this show, which is a lot of work, which is why we won't have another one for you until Monday. But I promise there will be more stories about farts. - [Riley] Wait, no. I said less. - Less. - [Riley] I actually didn't like that I put that. Take it up. - There will be more.",

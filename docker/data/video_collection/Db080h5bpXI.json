    "transcript": "- If you've never heard of a system integrator called Ironside Computers, they helped us out previously with the Splave PC. They make some pretty sick stuff, and when we saw the Yggdrasil, known also as like the World Tree or the Tree of Life, Norse mythology, we couldn't say no to unboxing it. It's got a stained glass side panel. I'm so stoked. I just got it. Whoa, that's a lot of packing foam. So this is gonna suck to clean up. We should get a bin instead of just putting the peanuts all over the floor. Man, it's got a nice texture though. Now I want to eat one. Anyway we do this, there's gonna get some on the floor. - [Bell] Forbidden Cheetos. - Forbidden Cheetos. Pure base 500. What a case. Oh, they sent us more shirts! So we've worked these with these guys before in the past a little bit and they've sent us shirts. If you've ever watched any videos and there's any of us walking around with like Ironside shirts on. I like 'em. I've got a couple of 'em actually in a couple different colors. I'm just gonna like hide these somewhere. I gotta maybe take them, keep 'em for myself. Here's the real box. - [Bell] There's still something in the box. - Oh, there's a box! Hey, oh it's like a checklist of stuff. So, it's a system. If you don't know what a system integrator is, they basically build a computer for you. Usually there's a bit of a markup, so you're paying a more premium price. Don't get me wrong, I could probably build this computer, whatever parts are in it for $200 to $500 cheaper or something. But that's not what you're doing this for. You're doing this so you don't have to build it. And with a company like Ironside, you're doing it so that you get a really cool product out of it. Something that you don't have to do yourself. Hey Ed, what's up? It's got stained glass on it. - [Edzel] Did you say stained glass? - Yeah. Well, that's the thing is the pictures look like stained glass but it's pretty easy to kind of fake that with just like vinyl or anything else that's just a colored film, if you do it well enough. I think that it's maybe actual stained glass. No one else seems to think so. Everyone thinks I'm crazy but I saw this one with a stained glass in it so we gotta open this one. Oh. Okay, it's the moment of truth. Is it real stained glass? Even if it's not real stained glass, it's still super pretty looking. I don't think it is. It's really pretty and I like it still, but I think everyone else was right and I was wrong. 'Cause if it was real stained glass, these would all be individual pieces. If you've never done any like mosaics or stained glass, you actually soften the edges and like put them all together, and then you glue it or grout it together. I actually had a not stained glass, but I had a mosaics class in high school. I gonna need a screwdriver. I hadn't even thought about this. - [Bell] Behind you on the desk. - Oh, wow! Bell thought of this. Oh my god, lttstore.com. I still don't have one. I'm still jealous. Wow! That screw's almost out. Crazy, the back force. It's all true. It's clean. Props to Ironside, 'cause this is a really nice job with the cable management. Do not power this computer on without removing the foam. And if it wasn't clear what the foam is, it's right there. Little build list they've got here, gets a manager check off for everything. So you know they actually QC their stuff, which is is great. Things like all fans were plugged in with the motherboard first, and no fans are plugged into the AO header. No wires are stuck in fans, like sleaving is fully seated and no pins have popped out. They really check a lot of stuff. A stress test, quality control. Oh, that's great. They tell you like what the CPU temps and what the GPU temps got to and if it passes the test. We got our wifi range extender here. Ooh, what's in this red bag? And it's just a C 13. Okay. For anyone who doesn't know, we refer to C 13's all the time. It's just a standard power plug like this. One of those three prongy guys that's for all your PC power supplies, for a lot of monitors, a lot of TVs. Power connectors for our power supply that aren't being used. So if you ever want to hook up more SATA stuff later on, or what's this that's not being used more? PCIE power. I don't know what GPU is in here. We'll take a look. This is either for like the inside of the case or it's for on top here. I'm actually not sure. It fits here, like perfectly. Our extra PCIE slot covers. So this has gotta be an AMD chip then. So these are the mounting things for an AMD CPU. So this is our box. Oh, and EVGA. This is just all our manuals for all the different products we have, like our power supply and motherboard case, et cetera. Basically just the extra accessories. You probably won't need almost any of these, except for this guy. That's probably why they label it red actually, to make sure you don't miss it. All right, let's take a look at what's inside here. Oh! It's hefty so you know it's got some beefiness inside. One thing I don't like is this is kind of an older style for putting on the glass front panels and it's these screws. My Meshify C does this, and that's like a five year old case or something. It always makes me a little uneasy. You gotta just unscrew them like this. You could probably let go of the panel and it would stick there, but with all of those shots on Reddit that you see of people breaking their panels, I'd rather not. It is something though, like it's a film or something, but it's not like proper, proper stained glass. It's still super pretty. It is textured. So there's like a film or something that's on there. You know it's just another vinyl sticker or something, but man is it ever pretty. Okay, I'm gonna put this somewhere very safe for now, and then let's take out this foam that they're so consistent that I remove. I don't know. I kind of wanna leave it. Doesn't this look great? No, please don't do that. You'll choke your system. Oh, my god. Okay, there's the foam. What'd they send us? We've got our very beautiful 3080 right here. I actually love this version. It's got the nice rounded corners on it and stuff. And then underneath this Ironside branded CPU cooler, we have got a 5800x3d. And if you've been paying any attention to the news recently, you know that even with AMD 7,000 and even with Intel 13th Gen coming out, this thing is still like basically the king of gaming. Do the other chips beat it in a few cases by a little bit? Yeah. But is this already out? Yeah. Just get the 5800x3d if you could find one. Otherwise, we've got some Arctic fans. We got a 240 ml AIO. I hadn't even noticed, I was too excited about the 3080, but our RGB strip looks like it kind of got un-magnetized when I pulled out the foam. So just be aware when you're pulling out that foam, it gets caught on stuff, so be a little careful. This is an easy fix, though. Otherwise, this thing is pretty hot. I actually really like it. I can't see if we've got... Yeah, it looks like there's an M.2 drive down there for storage. We're trying to figure out the motherboard because our listing says something about an Asus board, but this is an MSI wifi range extender and it usually comes with the motherboard. So unless they bought that separately? Here we go. Tell me your secrets. Oh, they had to swap the motherboard, that's why. So apparently they tried this, they tested it. Some of the RGB didn't work, so they swapped the whole motherboard. That's actually a really handy thing though. I personally experienced almost the exact same thing when I did my intel upgrade. I couldn't get the RGB to work. It all powered up, but no matter what I tried, and I tried like signal RGB, I tried open RGB, I tried MSI software, I tried other brand softwares just in case. Nothing worked. I went out and bought Asus board, like a tough series board, hooked it all up, boom. First try, no problem. I can confirm that we've got a 5800X3D. Yeah, Asus Prime X570-Pro. So I don't know where this MSI extender is coming from, but whatever. Kingston Fury beast, 32 gigs. So, 2X16, DDR4 3200. 3600 would've been nicer, but I'm sure it's fine. We've got a Samsung 980 Pro, only 500 gig. Again terabyte would've been nice, but it's fine. And then we've got a 3080 10 gig. - [Bell] Terabyte. - Yeah. - [Bell] You said terabit. - Oh, did I? - [Brandon] No, he didn't. - Could've sworn I said terabyte. Brandon's got the cans on. - [Bell] I am pretty sure you said terabit. - I'll take it again. Editor, let me know what I said. - [Bell] Editor, if he said \"terabit\", leave it in. (All laugh) (tape rewinds) - Terabyte would have been nice. Terabyte would have have been nice. Terabyte would have been nice, but that's okay. And then we've got our 3080 10 gig. We've got a 750 watt 80 Plus Gold EVGA power supply. You know they make good stuff. And Windows 10 already installed. So cool. Oh, and then for our pump. Yeah, it is a 240 mil rad, and we've got Asetek 670LS high performance liquid cooler with five Ironside RGB fans. And it's all in this nice ATX form factor case. It's pretty midsize case. Something I didn't notice before is this a really sweet Ironside logo on the front. I don't think it's quite Norse runes or Norse knots or anything, but it's a pretty cool little pattern that's close enough to Norse mythology that... I don't know. Maybe a tryhard's really gonna hate it and be like \"You're wrong!\" But most people are gonna be totally fine with it and think it looks cool. And you know what else is gonna look cool? This thing fired up with that glass panel on and everything, with the stained glass and all that with the RGB. And we're gonna check it out soon, but not before a word from our sponsor, Viewsonic. Viewsonic's X2000B short throw projector offers a 4K HDR experience. Its point 22 throw ratio allows for our 100 inch screen from 23 centimeters away. It can easily connect to your devices via wifi or Bluetooth. The projector offers Harman Kardon audio, enabling Dolby DTS support. And its second generation laser phosphor technology has a 20,000 hour lifespan. Check it out in the link below. And now we're gonna check out this bad boy, the Yggdrasil. There's gonna be two moments of truth. The first moment of truth is just turning it on, like it is now, so that we can see that all the fans are spinning, everything's working. I trust that they did their QC stuff, but I also don't trust anyone. Oh, my god. It works. Wait for the LED. It might have to do a couple reboots. That's okay. Especially with AMD, they're like particularly bad for having to reboot systems on first boot. It's a really nice color on the fans that they've already got preset up. It's a nice kind of like light green that's... Oh, and look at this! The desktop is the Yggdrasil. It's the Iron side logo in like stained glass. I'm gonna just check out the specs real quick on the inside. See what it's all running at, make sure XMP is enabled and all that. Looks like it is 'cause our memory's going at 3,200 megahertz. We've got... Yep, 5800x3d, baby! And then what's our video? RTX 3080 10 gig. Cool, yeah. It seems to work. It's got it so as soon as you open, I mean we opened Edge 'cause there's no other browsers installed 'cause it comes with Windows set up, but there's like nothing done to it really except for the wallpaper and maybe a few other settings. But look, they've already got it set to go to their page, which has got a Y2K computer. Looks really cool. That's sweet. But I don't want that. I want store.steampowered.com, so that we can install steam, play some super cool games. Now here's the real moment of truth. I'm so excited for this. I think it's gonna look really cool. Wow. Our World tree looks stunning. I would also like the option to go with a black case. So you do like a black case and then this is all black accent instead of white accent. I think that could look really cool. Yeah, I do love. Like try, come and get this, Brandon. This is so cool. It's dumb because obviously, yeah it's glass, but when you start looking at this, you forget that there's normal glass parts and it's nice 'cause you can actually still see inside your system from different angles and stuff. But then when you're kind of front on, you barely see that. It's just like church window and RGB, and I think it looks pretty sick. - Are they trying to kind of sell it as a Lord of the Rings looking thing? - Ah, it's Yggdrasil. So it's like the Norse World tree and stuff. - Oh, yeah. I see. I see. - Yeah, yeah. And the color that they've gone with, with the RGB pre-set up to. - Yeah. - This like, light green. - It glows through well. - Yeah, it's really nice. - I almost feel like the non-stained glass bits are ugly. - Really? - Seeing the computer, I'm kind of like eh. - So, okay, sure. The inside parts could look a little nicer. - Yeah. - But I actually really like these tiny little windows that you can still see through it if you wanna like peer through and look around and stuff. - I almost think that... You're right, it's nice to see them, but I wish that to computer was just a little prettier. - Sure. The motherboard is nice, but they could have done, RGB RAM would have been nice. Maybe RGB on the pump or something. - Yeah, like one of those displays on the CPU cooler. - Yeah. - That's cool though. - It's still pretty nice. Yeah, it's great. Cool. We've got our resident Norseman, Adam Sondergard, in case there was any doubt. Look at the PC. How close is that to the real World Tree? How close is it to Yggdrasil? - Well you see, I haven't gone back to the Homeland in many years. - You've never visited the World Tree? - Uh, no. So, I haven't seen the World Tree, but I always imagined it a bit bigger. - Yeah, that's fair. Well maybe this is supposed to depict like- - But this is a gorgeous panel. - Yeah, it's beautiful. It's not stained glass. - I know. I just thought that. - Everyone was right. - I was like, how come no one has ever done a stained glass side panel? - Yeah, right? - That's be so cool. - Probably really fragile. - Yeah. (Nicholas laughs) What is this supposed to be a canyon? It's like the fjord? - I guess so, yeah. I wouldn't know. I'm not Norse. I've never been to Denmark. - Well, spoiler alert. Neither have I. (Both laugh) It's nice if they were able to get more of the lighting. - Yeah, I mean there's a lot of RGB in here already. There's like two or three light strips and then like five RGB fans. - I feel like a light strip along the GPU, just so it can really kind of glow outwardly from the side panel. - Yeah. You can do that. - But it's really good looking. - Yeah, it's nice. Thanks, Ironside. - You've made my country proud. (Nicholas chuckles) - There you go. Straight from the Norseman's mouth, seal of approval. It looks super pretty. Let's game on it, though. We're gonna play some Dying Light Two. If you just skip almost every cut scene and all the story stuff, it's really good. The story stuff is just way too long. You gotta talk to a single NPC, and it's like tell me your entire life story, please. Let me check settings. 4K, 16x9, DLSS quality, sure. Vsync, always off. Sharpness, yeah, whatever, whatever. Field of view, no, no, no. Crank this field of view to like 10 at least. Chromatic aberration, off. Motion blur, a hundred? Get outta here. Nice. So, we're playing 4k. We've got everything cranked up to at least high. Rate tracing's on, DLSS is on, and we're seeing like 88, 90 frames per second. It's pretty good. And I've got the field of view cranked as well, so there's more stuff on screen. To be clear, it's a really pretty game. Oh no, that's bad. Oh no. Okay, I fell down. It's pretty sweet and it's definitely handling a game at 4k, which is phenomenal these days. As for the Yggdrasil itself, it's a little expensive. Like you're definitely paying a premium price for a premium quality product, particularly the aesthetic portion of it. Me personally, because I'm a bit crafty and I kind of like to do this sort of thing myself, I wouldn't get it. But I know that there's definitely, like a bunch of my friends would be all over this thing because I mean they have some money and they'd be totally down to just throw money at a problem and to solve it. They come in a bunch of ranges of performance as well. So if you're on a bit of a budget and you still want something this nice, you can start with the bronze version and maybe upgrade it yourself later. That starts around $1,200. We've got the gold version with a few minor tweaks, and so the gold version starts at around $2,500. So there is a major price difference. I think they've also got a platinum tier and that's probably got like a 3090 in it or something. $2,500 is a lot of money, and you could do this yourself and save a buck or two. So it all depends on how much you value your own time, how much you think that your skills are up to par, how much you actually wanna learn, that sort of thing. It's not for me personally, but I do think it's very pretty, and I would be stoked to see this in someone's house. This is Short Circuit. This is the Yggdrasil PC from Ironside. Thanks for watching.

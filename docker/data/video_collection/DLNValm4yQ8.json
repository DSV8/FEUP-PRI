    "transcript": "- Hello, welcome to our wonderful sponsor, Micro Center where we have a Broke versus Pro challenge. Obviously as a professional at Broke versus Pro, I've invited a broke person BitWit Kyle, I apologize for calling you broke. However, today we have free reign of Micro Center, we're here before it opens to the way that it works today is that we each have two minutes to walk through the store and get, well, I should say, run through the store and get all of the components for our PC built. So Micro Center are giving us both the exact same MSI RTX 3060Ti graphics cards but the rest of the video is up to us. - These are hard to get. - Well, you've got one in your hand. - I feel like I already won. (Austin laughing) - Now, we do get the opportunity to walk the store beforehand to take closer look at any of the deals that they have any of the parts that they have in store without spoiling their strategy. What are you thinking? Are you thinking of going bigger, higher end? Are you gonna try to go for the aesthetic side? Are you gonna go, try to go for the budget? - You know what? I'm still casing out the place. I gotta look over the inventory and I also don't want to give you too much too many crumbs here and how manipulative you are Austin. I've never watched Broke versus Poor before so I'm not exactly sure what to expect. - [Austin] I like how you called it, Broke versus Poor. - Oh, did I wait did I say Broke versus Poor? Damn it, I meant. - [Austin] Lol, it is up to you if you wanna do it again. - No I do, broke versus pro, right? - Yeah. - Okay sorry. (beeping) I've actually never watched Broke versus Poor (groans) I said it again. Why do I keep saying that? It's the same thing. They're synonyms Kyle, come on. (beeping) I've actually never watched Broke versus Pro before but the way I think this is gonna go is that one of us is gonna build a really high end system and spend a lot of money. The other person's gonna go the budget route and we're just gonna have to see if the extra money spent on the high end rig is worth the performance game. The Micro Center prices are so good too, but they are good yes oh, wow. Yeah, look at that, damn. The original sticker on this is 250 and they've got it for 139. - That's ridiculous. - Be a great idea to use in a build wouldn't it? Good selection of power supplies. - Since we're only gonna be shooting this video for one day I could just buy the absolute crappiest PSU that's here. - I gotta say we shot a lot of videos in Micro Center. How cool is it to have free range? - It's kind of awesome. - It's pretty good. - I was like, I own the place, I feel important. - Okay, well, calm down, calm down, let's not go that far. - All right, memory options. The GSkills are always safe here. - Hang on, here's the problem. They all look the same from the front. I can't wait (beeping) This feels wrong. I'm feel like I'm not supposed to do this right now. - They unlocked their stuff. They do, we're in their store, they unlocked everything for us. - That's amazing. - Another aspect here of course is the aesthetic, it is the creativity, but you know, its RGB you can spend a lot of money very quickly. - That is true. - You're gonna have to choose between your budget versus the aesthetics. - Exactly. - So these ones are gonna be cheaper because they're out of a box secondhand it looks like. - No - No, okay. - Look at these are the display don't steal, don't steal. So how do we want to decide to go first? Rock paper, scissors. - Rock, paper you (laughs) Yes, rock paper scissors. - All right, all right. - All right let's do it. I've been practicing my rock paper scissors for this and practicing this. - I know that you were family friendly channel. - I know you had it that up. - Ready? - [Both] Rock, paper, scissors. - Dang it. - You go first. - All right, oh God. - Here we go, three, two, one. - One down, we're almost done. I really should have grabbed the case last 'cause it's slowing me down. - Okay, so while Kyle is shopping, I have a secret weapon. So Micro Center has a build your own PC configurator on their site. Now I take advantage of that. I can see all the stock in the store. So if I find something that we missed while we were walking, I've got it. - I've got the GPU, computer we want, what are we going with? We're going with a Ryzen, they're all sevens. Where are the fives? I thought there was a five in here. What are you? Five, 3600X. For how much? For how much? It doesn't say the price is blocked out. Awesome, awesome, you know what? We're gonna roll with it. We're just gonna roll with it. I think we're going to go to the performance route now, we need storage. All right, I'm gonna go cheap as possible, 500 gigs. All right, I think 500 is the move. - So I saw an i3, that was really cheap. I think that's maybe what I go for. Look at that, see, that's what I need the cheating right now. I'm literally just using this configure it right now to do all my work for me. Micro Center also are still running their promo where you can get not only a free 32 gig micro SD card but also a 32 gig USB drive completely free of charge and no purchase necessary. So what are you waiting for? Check out the link in the description and head over to your local friendly Micro Center today. - [Matt] You got one minute. - Okay, one minute, thank you, $20 power supply, done. I gotta, I gotta make my margins somewhere. Hang out for the memory. - [Matt] 30 seconds. - Okay, okay, 30 seconds. Where's the cheapest? What is the speed? - [Matt] 15. - No, stop it. Okay, here we go. How many more do I have? Is that it? Did I get everything? I think I got everything I'm done. (exhales sharply) Oh my God. That was, that was a challenge, that was definitely challenging. - [Ken] That's like studying before the test, like the second before. - I know which has never done well for me. - Yeah, that sounds good right here. - Cool what we might want to do be like while we're at the video, - That is Austin, Austin is looking at my parts. You cheater, Austin I'm gonna kill you you come here. - You can't catch me. I think I saw what he was doing. - If he wins, it doesn't count. And if I win, it was to a great disadvantage on me. So I'm just that much better, than him. - What are you doing? - Go away, what a cheater? (air whooshing) - Three, two, one, go. - All right let's go, okay let's go. 100 there. - [Matt] Is that what you wanna go for? - Yep, that's what I wanna go for. Now I grew up watching these things on TV. When you would run through the toy store and load up your car and that was always my dream. It's the ability for us to go into say a Micro Center and essentially do that same thing is great. If only there was a fun element of it and not as stressful. Oh no, I think I forgot my RAM. Where's my PSU. We're going for it. Wait, no, we're not we're not, there'll be a mistake, it doesn't have enough PCI. Oh, no, I didn't think about this one minute. - [Matt] Hey, one minute. - Oh, okay okay okay. It's not here, it's not here. That'd be great, it gives us just go around. Oh, I need a cheap power supply. Oh, wait here, 650 too much. Why is it nothing between 430 and 650? - [Matt] 30 seconds. - No, no (groans) fine, spending way too much money on my power supply. Definitely going to go for, I want the speed. I want the speed, yeah, 500 gig, there we go. What do I have? What do I have? (groans) - Well, what do we have here? - Oh, interesting. Oh, okay, B365. - This is what I'm most worried about. Is this, this memory kit I picked it not because of the price. But look at the back, it doesn't actually say a speed, it lists all the SKUs, 3000. So I have no idea if I got a 4000 kit or a 3000 kit. - Well, this could very well be the end of me. - Unlike that, I got the highest quality G.Skill RipJaws V that came in at $58. - Oh, you were so much better at casing the place than I was when we were doing that run through oh my gosh. What about your power supply? - So power supply. I almost went for the 430 watt that we were talking about. I literally put my hand on it. Then I realized it doesn't have the eight pens to run the 3060Ti. So I panic bought a PowerSpec. - Oh, you got one. Is this gonna work? - Obviously, it'll work. - Wait, it has a four pin. Oh, well wait, hold on. - CPU - For the GPU, you have no GPU. - Oh God, this is horrible. You know, in my mind I was I was so rushed and so pressed for time. So the only thing I was thinking in that moment was don't overspend don't spend too much. So I didn't even consider the fact that the unit might not have the proper amount of cables or connectors to actually power the build. We can go to the register and find out what the final price totals are. - I'm, incredibly curious. - Okay, so it was pretty close. - Really? - Yes, way close than I thought it was gonna be. - Okay. - Oh my God. - So Kyle, you were 1075. - Okay. - So $1075. - Yes, Austin you were 1030. - Oh shoot. - That is really close, that's way closer than I thought. - Let's head back to the office, let's go build some PCs. - You're on. Mine will actually turn on unlike yours so it's fine. - [Matt] His will turn on, it just won't have a GPU. - Yeah, exactly. Where's your integrated graphics bro, how you gonna POST huh? - It's all in your imagination. - That's what I thought. - Okay, I'm gonna think outside the box all right. (air whooshing) - All right, so we've gotten back from Micro Center with our haul of PC components. Now you may notice something that wasn't here with us at the store, this AGON AOC 32 by 9 monitor. Originally they offered to give us two of these so we could each have one, but we thought it'd be more hilarious if we both game on the same monitor. - Picture by picture time. - Plus we probably couldn't fit two of these monitors in here anyway. - [Ken] Yeah, we're using this desk. (Austin laughing) - I'm just going to leave that right there. This is just this is gonna be a constant reminder of my utter failure today. - [Ken] Are you looking for this. - Ken, did you guys really take pity on him? - Is this - Well kind of, okay. - Oh my gosh. - [Ken] So, take that out. - Okay, so I have this as mine, but at what cost. - [Ken] You are not allowed to keep it in your case. (Austin laughing) - All right. - [Ken] You have to use it as an external PSU. - Wait, wait does that mean I can work with this. I was inside the case and this goes out to the case. - Wait, do I have to use this? - [Ken] Yes, and we'll give that to you for free, to be fair - Okay. - So dual power supplies. - You can use it, yes. - I can work with that, you know what? This is only gonna add to my creativity score. - Oh, creative is definitely the word I have in mind right now. I can mess with it. So I've gotten my Meshify C which I am opening up. I think these are both gonna be pretty simple builds really. - Oh yeah. I mean we're only getting the basic, we only got the basic most basic components to get a booting system. Look at how pretty my motherboard is. - Oh wait, wait, wait no, I've got mine. - It's beautiful. - I'm sure mine will be okay. I just noticed it's my Micro ATX. (Austin laughing) It's fine it's fine it's good. It was more, more room for breathability and stuff more. - [Ken] More room for your power supply. - There you go. - So I'm really happy about this i5-9400. - Are you? - I am. - It really helps you with the price - Exactly. - the budgeting - And like seriously, I mean the i5 is not gonna hold me back in any way real way. - No, probably not. - Like how much cheaper- - Not the 360, 3060Ti. - Yeah, exactly. - I just, oh wow. So I thought this was a 16 gig kit, it's a 32 gig kit, which the other thing I wasn't sure about with this kit is, the memory speed because they're all listed on the back of the box which is very unhelpful, it's 3200. - Okay, - Perfect. Perfect for 3000 series, that was the sweet spot. - [Ken] How much did you spend again? - This was 120, but 32 gigs - Not bad. - Not bad at all. - It's not bad because I got six. No, I got eight gigs for about half that price with no RGB. - Right? - Yeah I do have a sliver of RGB on the sticks as well. - All right so getting ready to install my power supply, I'm actually making pretty decent progress here. I've got my board already. Oh, wow okay well you've already got your board installed. - Yup. - But I think- - [Ken] Here's what happens when we bring a professional into the studio. - But the real question here, how are you gonna do the dual power supplies right now? - So my thought was to try to find a way to strap the big unit to the back of the case. - Look do it real literally. - Or it could strap it to the side. - Right here, right on top. - I mean, that's the bold shameless move right? I mean, I could do that. - I definitely have never done that before ever. - Or maybe even on the, something tells me you have. - Scrapyard Wars. - Oh yes, that's right how could I forget? So here's what I'm thinking now that I relocated the top exhaust fan, there's no fan here anymore. I could put the PSU up here, fan facing up and it doesn't look all that bad especially if like, Ken you were saying, we're going for like a Cyberpunk theme or something like that. I do have the cables coming out the back, it looks a bit industrial and get this, on the front you now have an accessible kill switch button. Take that Austin, how do you like them apples? - I'm pretty handy, huh, that actually is pretty... I'm curious why you chose to go for the nicer power supply. Oh actually, I know you wanted to hide the cheap one, right? - Exactly. - Okay fair enough. - It's kind of a eyesore. - You're just flexing your 80 Plus Gold I see. - I'm gonna take the sticker off. (energetic music) (air whooshing) - All right, so for Broke versus Pro which is quickly turned into not really broke versus slightly less, not really broke, our systems are complete. You know, my PC is not, the masterpiece is not the Mona Lisa or the Michael Angelo, of gaming PCs, but you know what? That's fine because all that matters that I think got a good shot at it right? I already know I won value, right? That's one category, I can check that off right. Josh make a graphic, I check that one off, it's gone, right, Austin has that one. Next creativity, ah, but you know what? Is it really creative to put a power supply on top of a case? I don't think so. In fact, I would say that's counterfeit. I would say that's a stolen idea that you need to pay royalties 'cause I came up with that. So Ken, do you want to weigh in a little bit on the creativity side of things? - [Ken] I am surprised at how good yours looks. - Oh thank you. - I am too, actually. - [Ken] Yeah, I thought it was gonna look way worse. - But you know why it looks so good, is because you can hardly see it (laughs) - [Ken] Well, that's part of it. His cables actually came out pretty nice though for them being green and his color scheme being a little mixed. - Definitely. - [Ken] I am more impressed about your ability to make that power apply on the top look really good. - It does kind of look awesome doesn't it? - It's very clean. - [Ken] I mean, it matches all of the angles of the PC which is just square. - Very true. - [Ken] I think style points would go to Kyle. I like your CPU choice though, considering the value. I'm super impressed by that. We'll see what it's like in the benchmark. - Yeah, so we're gonna run through three tests. We're gonna do a Time Spy benchmark. We're going to do a Cyberpunk benchmark and then we're gonna do the real test, CS:GO head to head. - How good are you at CS:GO? - I'm not great at CS:GO, but you've got a Ryzen 5. I've got a Core i5. You also got 32 gigs of RAM, I've got eight. So you should have this beat. So we have obviously identical displays we have 1440p at 120 FPS. We have the same Logitech mouse and keyboard combination. Everything else should be identical. Are you ready? - Yes, sir. - Three, two, one launch. - That was perfectly in sync. - That was very, very, oh no look at that 31 versus 37. - Oh wow. - That's where you're getting the, yeah, you got you got me on this one. - The overall score is gonna blow you away. - Oh, you toasted me on that one. 10,773 versus 9,802 for my system. - That's a pretty good game. CPU score, 74 versus 53. That's where you got me, that's a big slap. - Yeah. - So as we're recording this video today Cyberpunk has just come out right? So I don't think Kyle or I have had any time to develop benchmarks for it or anything like that. So going into it, I don't really know what to expect. I know it's a very demanding game and so we're gonna do a really informal Cyberpunk benchmark, which is to stare at the same thing, point in the environment. So let's look up at, let's put it right in the middle of the white on, oh, you got a different sign. Oh, all right something that's constant. But what if we stand like right let's look, look close to these dudes closer as this is about as close. - Yeah. - Where's your white dots? - Right out there, huh? - Yep yep yep okay. So right now I'm 49, 50 and you're at 50. That is like a small, - It's pretty negligible right? - I think we can call this a draw. - I think we can, I think you're right. - So does it come down to CS:GO? - It does. - Let's go boys, let's go. - Let's CS:GO. Hey my hope today was that I would clench the win before we got to CS:GO so that it would matter that I would lose. But as long as I look calm, polished, distinguished and like a complete gentleman on the outside, - We have to use the same gun as well. - Sure. - Right that makes sense. - Yeah, I gotta win right? What do you think, the little gazelle is afraid of the lion? Yeah yeah the Gazelle is afraid of the Lion. Could a hundred Gazelles attack that Lion and win, no, but if the lion thinks he might lose then you might lose the thread on this analogy. - [Ken] What are you talking about dude? (laughs) - It's been a long day okay, been a long day. Okay so, oh, we have 10 minutes. So let's just go for it. - Okay okay let's go all right. - Oh oh, nicely done nicely done. - In the head. - All right all right. We're good we're good. - Oh shoot. - Oh, there we go. - Dang it. - All right, one on one. - For some reason I thought you were gonna spot it CT spawn but I forgot that that's not how it works. I got myself in a corner here. - Okay oh, nice. - We've got about six and a half minutes on the clock. I've got to pick it up a little bit. - I don't know if I fall too much farther behind, it might be over for me. - Come on. - There we go all right four three, four three. - You're still in the game. - I'm still in it. Two minutes, can I catch up? I don't think I can I say, I say I got you. I got you I got you. - Yes that so clutch, (laughs) you got a minute left. Where we at? - You got all your done man. - 10, six, - 10, six. - There's no way you could. Alright, well played. - Gonna call it. - Can't believe it. This is my show, \"Broke versus Pro\" it's on the Austin Evans channel. I'm the hero of the story. You know what I should do, I just have Josh, Josh, when you're editing this, can you just edit it now? Can we just cut the video now? And then can we fast forward to a montage of how I won? Just making it look like I won Josh, you can do that. Thank you. - This was definitely an awesome experience. I had a total blast today from start to finish. There was never a dull moment and it was adrenaline pumping the whole way through. Austin's an okay guy, I guess and I guess I should start watching more episodes of Broke versus Poor oh no, pro broke. - You don't have to it's fine. (laughter) - Why can I not get that?",

Get your iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR skins here:    [5 IPHONE FEATURES APPLE JUST KILLED]  Today, as you may have heard, Apple announced three new iPhones: the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR, along with a brand-new wearable in the Apple Watch Series 4. That's a lot to get excited about for iOS fans, and I'm eager to review them all. But in releasing this new wave of devices, Apple has also killed off a handful of features that made owning an iPhone so great. Join me for a look at 5 of these features, then join me on the dock of the Bay as I pour out a little Anchor Steam for the iPhone SE.   [SUBSCRIBE TO MRMOBILE]     [ABOUT THIS VIDEO]  This video was produced on the day of Apple's iPhone XS event using footage from previous MrMobile iPhone reviews, Apple event footage and hands-on coverage from iMore's visit to the Apple campus.

    "transcript": "- San Francisco, I came out here to check out what was new from Qualcomm, from Audi, from June and a couple other companies and I thought, while I'm here why don't I just cruise on down the road to Cupertino, see what Apple's cooking up. Well that didn't really happen. But that's okay because if you're a fan of a lot of iPhone features like I am, well today was kind of a bloodbath. (upbeat pop music) See Apple announced three new iPhones and a new watch today, so there's plenty for you iOS fans to get excited about. But the company also killed off a handful of things that made owning an iPhone just a little more convenient, starting with the home button. All three iPhones announced today use the swipe gesture to get you home instead of the button. Like last years iPhone 10. That's actually okay by me. Once you've gotten used to the gestures it feels pretty primitive going back to a button. But on the iPhone, it's more than just a home key, it's also the fingerprint sensor. The new iPhone 10S, 10S Max and 10R all use an improved version of face ID instead, which isn't always as convenient as unlocking with your thumb. Get used to using your pen if for example you wanna unlock your phone without picking it up off a charging pad. That's actually the least of my complaints though. Apple has what it thinks is a superior authentication scheme and it's decided to go all in on it. I can respect that. What I can't get behind is the decision to kill the third thing, the included headphone dongle. See when Apple decided to eliminate the headphone jack on the iPhone seven, eight and 10, it bundled an adapter in the box so you could still plug in your own headphones to the lightning connector. Well, not with the new iPhones. There are two ways to look at this, from one perspective if you can afford any of the new iPhones you're probably not gonna balk at spending another nine bucks to get an adapter, or you'll just go whole hog and get yourself some AirPods while you're shelling out. The other viewpoint is, hey these are some of the most expensive phones in the world and the least Apple could do would be to keep on including this little accessory. You can probably tell my feeling on this, let me know yours down in the comments, and while you're at it subscribe so you don't miss it when I review these phones in a few weeks. Apple's last victim today was a twofer and it's got me pouring out some of my anchor steam, because this one hurts. See amid all the excitement of the new iPhones it was announced that the iPhone SE would be discontinued. That model was the last iPhone, heck one of the last smartphones period that offered a high end experience in a small size. This is anecdotal I know, but I've talked to several iPhone SE owners who bought it late in it's life specifically because they didn't want something as large as an iPhone eight or iPhone 10. And now that option for a one handed flagship is just gone. Ready for the last one? The iPhone SE was also the most affordable iPhone. It launched at just 399. Well the cheapest option announced today is the iPhone 10R, which starts at nearly double that price. I'm not saying that's a surprise. Apple's been repositioning itself as a luxury brand for quite a while and this is a natural extension of that. Also of course you can buy last year's iPhone and get in that way. I know a great many people who always buy last year's model to save money. It's just that, well when you look across the aisle at the Android options and see phones with some impressive experiences selling for a couple hundred bucks less, well it just becomes harder to see the iPhone's evolution without also seeing the D in front of it. And for me it becomes tougher and tougher to see the excitement around days like today as justified. One thing Apple didn't kill today was the all glass construction of it's iPhones. So if you do pick one of these up or you just wanna keep your iPhone from looking like mine after a year, pick up a skin from today's sponsor, dbrand. Premium vinyl skins in almost any flavor you can dream up, served up for a fair price by some sarcastic robots. Hit the link in the description and let me know what you think of the new iPhones.

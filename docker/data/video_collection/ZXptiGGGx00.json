    "transcript": "- Hey friends, what's up? I thought I'd try a new intro today, I'm not sure how I feel about it. (laughs) Anyway, we're going to be doing iOS, we're going to be doing, we're gonna be talking, what? We're going to be talking about iOS 15 today. And I've been using my new iPhone 13 for quite a while now. And I just wanted to go over some of my favorite features. And honestly, the number one feature that is my absolute favorite is when someone sends you like, a freaking handful of photos, you click one single button; and all of those photos are automatically downloaded into your camera roll. Before, that would drive me absolutely insane that I would just have people be like, look, put this in Frame.IO, Dropbox this make me an iCloud link. Don't send me 500 pictures in one iMessage. There's also an option that you can now have it set up so that these will automatically be downloaded into your camera roll with the shared- with you, shared with you? Shared to you? Shared for you? Share with you? In that feature. (laughs) Shared? What was it? Shared with you? Why do I feel so silly? \"Shared with You\", this also works with links and it's been so helpful to have this because, my sister and I have been working on setting up a new studio space and we're constantly sending links back and forth. So just to be able to go in and look at the links and look at photos separately and automatically have the stuff downloaded into my camera roll. Why did it have to take until iOS 15 for this to be a feature? I don't know, but I'm here for it, and so excited that it is finally a thing. The next one that is kind of cool is using FaceTime links. This will allow you to FaceTime with anybody outside of the apple ecosystem, whether they're on an Android phone, a PC on a Mac, it doesn't matter. You freaking send them this link, they can join in on your FaceTime call. The only thing that you can't do with this is use Share Play, which actually isn't even out yet at the time of making this video, but still the fact that we can now extend outside of the apple ecosystem and send a FaceTime link is pretty cool. Focus modes. Now this is something that I have not yet actually kind of really dove into and kind of set up, but it is such a cool feature because you can set up various modes for if you're working, or if you're at home, and it'll basically turn your phone into a completely different phone. So you can actually set this up. So if I have do not disturb on, I can see the people that are allowed to notify me when this do not disturb is on. You can also have it change the applications on your home screens so that you won't be distracted if you're in work mode... to go scroll on Tik Tok like I probably would be. So if I do have this, \"do not disturb\" on, people will also be notified that I don't want to be disturbed, and those set notifications that I've allowed will come through. Everything else, nope! There's also some new updates to Memoji. So you can update your avatar with 40 different outfit choices, there's two different eye colors, there's new glasses, there's nine new stickers, and there's multi-colored head wear, as well as new accessibility options. Oh, they even have two different types of masks that you can wear now. But here's the clothing, like this is an aggressive amount of clothing options that you can choose from. I can barely figure out what to wear every single day on my own body, now I have to worry about my Memoji body? Do not disturb! Oh! The notification summary. Okay, so this is interesting. Earlier today, I set up the notification summary, because Tyler's like, \"man, you got to check this out. It's super cool!\" Normally, notifications come in one by one as they happen, and it's pretty aggressive and overwhelming, especially if you get a lot of notifications, or if you're on social media. But with notification summary, you can set it up to take all of those notifications over the past couple of hours and combine them all into one so that you get a summary. most people would probably set it up to be like once or twice a day, well I, I did four of them. I set my first summary at 8:00 AM, so it was like, when I'm up, awake, after I've had my coffee, I'll get my summary from the morning, my second summary at 11:00 AM, my third at 2:00 PM, and my fourth at 9:00 PM, right before I got to bed. I feel like that's pretty good. Like, that's not bad at all. I do think that the Instagram DMs, and Twitter DMs, and things like that will automatically be pushed through because those are kind of timely, but sort of the everyday updates of like, \"so-and-so liked your photo\". \"Oh, so-and-so is sharing something on Tik-Tok with you\". Those will all be kind of grouped into one little, kind of section, so you don't have to be obsessively like, \"Hmm, what's happening? What's happening?\" (intense tapping) This next thing is by far- well I was going to say it's one of my favorite, but I also have said every single feature has been my favorite... Live text in your photos. This is now making your entire camera library searchable. So if there's text that is featured on a menu, like I can go in here and search for grilled cheese, and if I've ever taken a picture of a menu that has grilled cheese on it, I can go back to that very photo. But I've also been using it a lot like this, let me show you, let me get a book or something. So if there's like a piece of text or something, I go and I can take a picture of it, and you'll see that this automatically is popping up and recognizing that that's text, take a picture. This is now selectable! Look at this, this is the freaking future! Like, that's so cool. And so useful. There's even been things that I've had to do, like on my computer that I've taken a picture of my freaking monitor and then selected it because it's actually quicker to do that than to copy and paste it on the keyboard, and then paste it on. It's honestly, it's just the use cases for this are endless. I've seen phone numbers that I've needed to call. I just take a picture, copy, paste it into the phone app, make the call. So this is another little thing that I actually did not even know about until Tyler brought this to my attention. 5G preferred over wifi. My internet at home is, it's not good. I have the best internet that I possibly can. And it's still is not as good as the 5G service that I get on my phone. So, this is kind of cool because it will automatically be able to detect which is the better network, and it'll switch to that. So, if my 5G data is fast within my wifi, we're in business. So there's still a few features to come that aren't actually in iOS 15 yet like the Share Play features, so you'll be able to share music, movies, TV shows, all of those things, I can't wait to try that out. And you can just do that right over FaceTime. Another thing, this is state-by-state, but digital identification in the Apple Wallet. I personally can't wait for this because I know you guys have heard this story already, when I got my wallet stolen, lost my ID, and this wouldn't have been a problem had it been digital, unless my phone got stolen, then, well, that's a whole 'nother story. But the good thing about that is, everything is linked to me personally with my apple iCloud accounts. So even if I lost my phone, everything is always constantly being backed up. As long as you have that setting turned on, which I do recommend. I could go get another phone, and I would be able to recover all of my information, all of my data, and I would have my driver's license back. I love the fact that companies are working on things like this do not disturb mode, the focus mode. To kind of allow us to have a better relationship with technology, setting limits, setting times that you'll be able to be notified and not completely just inundated with notification, notification, notification, after notification. Anyway, I'll see you guys in the next video. I hope you guys have a great day. I'm working on trying to figure out a better sign off. Okay, bye. (upbeat music) Do you wanna give me a line? - [Director] Yeah, I'll give you a couple. - Okay - You're you, I'm Justine, and we got to go. - You're you, I- iJustine? No, I've got to go. - I'm Justine - I'm Justine (laughs) - The video's over, but the fun has just begun. - The videos over, but the fun has just begun. What does that- what fun? Is there fun after this? but the fun- but they have already had the fun? The video is over. Now you're not going to have any more fun. Hmm. Peace. That's good, look at that. - Well, that's Marques. - That's good. Look that peace, peace, love and peace. - That's just copying Marques. - Shoot. (upbeat music)",

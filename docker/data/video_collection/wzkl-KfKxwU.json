    "transcript": "- What's up, gamers? Today's video's gonna be a little different because I have not seen any of the items that I'm going to be unboxing and putting into my body. That's right, we are gonna be taste-testing the top gamer drinks, and I'll be selecting, as someone who has probably never consumed any of them, I do not drink gamer drinks. - [David] How much caffeine do you consume on a daily basis, Linus? - I do not consume caffeine. - [David] Okay, it's gonna be fun seeing you run around all day. - Yeah. (melancholy music) There's a crash, right? I will actually feel a caffeine rush sometimes just from like eating a chocolate bar. Yeah, this is me not caffeinated by the way. What are we looking at first, Mr. Bellavance? - [Bell] Our first category is traditional gamer drinks. - Traditional gamer drinks. You haven't done a very good job of covering them. I can see them. So are they supposed to be covered up from me or from them? - [Bell] It's the theatrics, Linus. - It's the theatrics. Rockstar. Never tried it. Monster. Never tried it. Red Bull. Never tried it. And Mountain Dew. This I've tried. It's awful. Were you planning to give me a cup or am I just- I mean, I don't go, I don't mean to go full diva. Ooh, this is classi with an I. Drink water. Who was it, Ronaldo? One of the big soccer players was like sitting at a press conference next to like some coke can or some (beep) and he was like, \"Drink water.\" What a (beep) Chad. Let's go with familiarity first. This ought to be enough Mountain Dew for anyone. Okay, that's a low bar. Mountain Dew's a four. People drink this on purpose? I mean, it's better than Mountain Dew. Like it's a- Got like a weird aftertaste. I'll give it like a five. Monster. Fun colors though. That smells bad. Yeah, that's a four. Like, I wanna know from you guys though, like which one do you think is probably the best on this table? - [Bell] I only drink exclusively whatever the Rock makes. - You drink whatever the Rock makes. - Oh, that tastes like (beep). Oh well, it's got ginseng in it, that's probably why. Okay, that's a three. Maybe my standards are just too high. Just to make sure we're not giving Red Bull an unfair advantage, we're also going to try their traditional non-pomegranate flavored one. Oh, I'd go pomegranate for sure. It's like a three or a four. - [Arthur] What would you consider a 10 drink? - Oh god, like a Thai iced tea. That's a (beep) delicious drink. Get that milk in there. Oh, so good. Pomegranate Red Bull is my winner from this round. This comes out ahead just because it's so bland. Okay, here's my loser. In the wall of fame already by default is of course good old fashioned pure water in an LTT Store water bottle. I get a lot of compliments, every time I go to like a new dentist or like dental professional, they're like, \"Wow, for your age your teeth are like in amazing shape.\" I don't drink coffee, don't smoke. - [Bell] For your age. - For your age. - [Bell] Your teeth don't look a day over 28. - Go (beep) yourself. For your age. - [Bell] Up next we have traditional Gone Gamer. - Traditional Gone Gamer. Oh my god. I can tell you already this is gonna be (beep). Any zero sugar thing sucks. The only thing worse than sweetening with corn syrup is sweetening with not corn syrup or cane sugar. That aspartame taste. I know some people apparently can't taste it. It's like a genetic thing. I can (beep) taste it. This is just Coke, but with that awful aspartame aftertaste. You're (beep) done, bud. I dunno how to describe it, other than it tastes like aspartame. Oh wow, that's a cool pop top. What, is the- You drink it from here? They've reinvented the wheel. Am I doing this wrong or is the hole so you can like shotgun it and it opens up on the other side? Okay, I have to be doing this wrong. There is no way that that's right. You gotta rip off the whole thing or something. Pull tab up. Slide back. Classic definition of over-engineered. How much does this (beep) cost? That is not very good. Yeah, it's got Red 40 in it. That explains it. Sorry, I shouldn't declare a loser until I've tried all the other losers. Anything with aspartame in it can't get over like a two or a three for me 'cause it's just awful. I don't think this one has aspartame in it. This one does, but this one has Red 40 in it, which is just, it's hitting me now. Nevermind, it's got a fair bit in it. Three, two. This just looks like poison. Oh, this one stinks. I don't wanna cheat, but this might have aspartame in it too. No, that must just be like a weird dye taste. Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. When Yellow 5 is not enough, you need more yellow, you turn to Yellow 6. I'd say this one started out as a four or a five, actually quite nice and then just had a wicked aftertaste that puts it down to a two. Charged Original Dew. So what, this is just Mountain Dew? - [Bell] Probably with extra caffeine. - Oh, 'cause that's what Mountain Dew needs, more caffeine. How'd they make Mountain Dew worse? Can I add the regular Mountain Dew back? Sorry, I know this is not the format of the video, but like, God, that's disgusting. Oh yeah, they put a whole bunch of other (beep) in this. Yellow 5 makes another appearance. You know I wasn't, I know I hate Red dye number 40, but I wonder if Yellow 5 is another problematic one for me. Oh, yeah, this is way better. I mean, this can still go to (beep), but that tastes downright good by comparison. Let's try Charged Berry Blast. I do like berry-flavored drinks so this one has a chance at least. As long as it doesn't have Yellow 5 or Red 40 in it. Ooh, blue. Unoffensive. I'm picking Game Fuel Charged Berry Blast for the wall of fame. And for the wall of shame, it's truly difficult for me to decide between these. I'm gonna go with Charged Original Dew for my wall of shame, not because it tastes that much worse than the other ones on the table, but because I feel it's so misleading. Calling this Original Dew when it tastes so much worse than Original Dew is just offensive to me. Before we go to our next round of drinks though, we have a surprise from our sponsor, apparently. - [Bell] dbrand. - (beep) hole. Height Increased Insoles. What is the point of this, dbrand? Literally all you're doing is insulting me. This doesn't even help them sell their product. I mean... An extra inch couldn't hurt, right? Yvonne could wear something other than flats next to me. - 67 and a half inches. - Why do I do these things? - [David] Oh, you're definitely taller. - You are now five foot nine. - [David] Put the other ones in! - This can't work. That is basically- Come on. I don't know if I'm gonna get my foot in there. Imagine showing up for a first date in these. - [Bell] Oh my God. - Ooh, that's very off-kilter right now. Don't forget, tall people before you look down on me, I'll probably live longer than you. And I can sit comfortably in economy. - Not that he does. - I've flown first class twice in my life, you know that. - You are now 70 inches or five foot 10. - [David] Wow. - Really? I only got one inch from all of that? Maybe my mother-in-law will accept me now. You know, that's one of the first things she said to Yvonne. \"Seems nice, good-looking. It's too bad he's not a little taller.\" I'm comfortable in my skin. Speaking of skins, check out shortlinus.com where you can get your own dbrand skins. When the checks stop clearing, dbrand, we're done. You knew what this was. - [Bell] Up next, we got Bawls. - We got Bawls. Aye. Here they are. Well, I'm obviously gonna have to start with the original. Actually, as far as energy drinks go, not that much garbage in it. Corn syrup, so it can't be that good, but. Ew. Maybe that's why they put all that garbage in the other ones. It's a solid two. Let's make our way down the line here. We've got ginger ale. Not a big ginger ale fan. Bawls is the first one to manage to physically hurt me. That's not bad. If all it took to turn Bawls from that to this is a little bit of natural and artificial flavors, guess they're doing all right. Either my standards are lowered or this is a pretty decent beverage. I'll give it a five. Cherry Cola. You got an uphill battle ahead of ya. Sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, all of them, but none of them are super sweet. That's a plus in my book. Three. Kind of bitter. Cherry. I'm really not looking forward to drinking these anymore. Maybe I was wrong about the lack of sweetness being a plus. The best thing I can say about it is it's bland. Four. This is a contender. I do like orange drinks. Oh, we're about to find out if Yellow 6 is the gross one or Yellow 5, 'cause this has got 6 in it. Not bad, actually. It's like a not overly sweet orange soda. I give that one a five too. So it's between the ginger ale and the orange. This is garbage. That can go on the wall of shame. That's pretty good. Bawls Ginger Ale. Going on the wall. Ooh, the aftertaste though. That's how they get you to keep drinking it. I swear, snack companies do not care about a bad aftertaste. That's a feature for them. Ginger Ale's got the better initial flavor, but I gotta take away the win based on that aftertaste. I'm giving it to the orange. Have we had anything over a five yet? - [David] The pomegranate I think you gave it. - Oh yeah, the pomegranate. Let's just see if- - [David] No, no, no, you can't taste it again. You can't taste again, you have to wait till playoffs. - I can't taste it again yet? - [David] You're gonna choose a very favorite at the very end. - What's coming next? - [Bell] This is our video game and influencer. - Warheads drink, so this is a collaboration with Ghost? G Fuel Pewdiepie Edition. Can your drink do this? That's an old one. Inspired by Tetris. What the actual ever-loving (beep) would a drink inspired by Tetris taste like? Guess we're about to see. And then we've got G Fuel Sour Chug Rug. Who's this guy? Oh, oh, oh, Rug. Sorry, I don't, I don't know FaZe. I don't know FaZe Clan. So do we want, we want Tetris, Rug? I'm gonna leave the Warheads one for the end. I'm a sour freak. All right, subtle pink color. Actually not bad until the awful aftertaste. That's gotta have aspartame in it. Nope, you managed to achieve that level of awful aftertaste without it. That one is great out of the gate. That's like our first seven out of the gate. But then it quickly shifts to just an atrocious aftertaste. Ew. Well, man, this one's hard to grade. It goes from a six to a two, so I guess we'll average it. We'll call it a four. All right, Tetris, what does Tetris taste like? I expected it to be multicolored. Bland. Almost like a hint of kind of like a bubble gum at the end. What a weird flavor. I feel like this is one of those products that's more of a collectible. Maybe that was what they thought too. I give it a three. What does the world's former number one YouTuber taste like? Oh, it's kind of weird. It's like a short flavor and then it just disappears. (triumphant music) That's not too bad. I think this is the best one yet. I give it a four. I have high hopes for the Warhead Ghost collaboration. High hopes that are tempered by the concern that there might be a nasty aftertaste. Well, that's sour, but it's a boring kind of sour. I want like a sour apple kind of sour, like a sour blue raspberry kind of sour. It's just sour. I could see this being a great addition to something else. If I could combine these. - [Bell] They say don't do that! - They say not to do that? Wait, that's illegal. I did not improve either of them. I'm giving it to the lingonberry. All right, way to go, Pewds, you won. As for the worst, probably my mixture. I'm gonna give it to Tetris for being across the board meh. At least this one starts good. Oh, man. How is it even possible that I've been burping this much? I've consumed so little, actually. Oh, it's coming up the other end too. - [David] Oh, geez! - Last set of drinks. - [Bell] These are professional wrestlers. We have the Rock's ZOA, and PRIME by Logan Paul. - I'm gonna save the Rock for last. I trust Dwayne Johnson. He's not gonna let me down. This is gonna be the best one. Name a bad movie Dwayne Johnson's been in. - [Bell] \"Scorpion King\"? There's a lot. - Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right. I do not like coconut so that's a bad sign. That's actually not (beep). I might already know who the winner is. That's a seven. - Yes, yes, yes! The coconut water's actually nice. I'm settling on a six though. - No, no, no! - Mr. Johnson. This is my trust. I'd like, to be clear, I, you know, respect the guy. He's done an amazing job, built an amazing career, but. I'm experiencing some regret. That's gonna be three, bud. That's unfortunate. There's no Red 40, there's no aspartame. It doesn't even really have a bad aftertaste. It's just not good. See you later, buddy. Oh, God, do I have to pick the worst of the worst? I have to drink all of those again. Excuse me. Here we go. That is disgusting. A bit flacid. Looks like there's stuff growing in it. I'm not throwing up. Why the did they add breadsticks to an Oh Henry? Now, we're gonna go back to our winners and our losers of each round to determine who is the best of the best and who is the worst of the worst. Rather than try to score them out of 10 this time though, we're just gonna be focused on which one tastes the best. (upbeat music) Charged Berry Blast Game Fuel. All right, Pomegranate Red Bull, let's go. It's gonna be down to Orange and PRIME. You know, I think part of it is that they're not as cold anymore. Yeah, I'm giving it to PRIME. - [David] Logan Paul! - Yeah. It's not quite something I would actually consider buying, but it's the closest by a long shot. Given how hard it was to get through the winners, I'm really not looking forward to drinking all the losers again. Start with Bawls. Best thing I can say about it is it really doesn't taste like much. Oh, ZOA again. Not very good. Tetris. Tetris might be worse than ZOA actually. Rockstar. Oh, all right. Yellow number 5 and number 6. Cheers. Well, you're not the worst. Mountain Dew, but worse. Oh, that was really, truly very bad. I can't decide, but I really don't wanna drink them again. Okay, we're going playoff style. These two, these two, then the losers. (upbeat music) ZOA starts out better, but gets worse. Yeah, ZOA, you're truly awful. Come on. I keep expecting Mountain Dew, and then it tastes so much worse than I'm expecting. I think if I'm being objective or at least trying to, the Tetris one is ever so slightly worse. Tetris G Fuel versus ZOA for the worst gamer drink. At least with ZOA, I can kind of see what they're going for. Like, it has kind of like a flavor to it. This is just crap. G Fuel, you win. Best. Worst. - [Bell] So if you have to guess how much everything costs. - This is gonna be really tough, and this is not like, you know, Bill Gates guessing how much a banana costs. I literally just do not drink these beverages. It's not because I don't set foot in a grocery store. I stopped buying drinks out of vending machines when they went over a dollar. I was like, more than a dollar for a can of pop? Forget it. So I was like 2001, to give you guys some idea. It's been 20 years since I've bought a canned drink. I would say this is probably not cheap. This is probably like an $8 drink just with the YouTuber tax plus it being, as far as I can tell, legitimately kind of a a small company. Like, it's not just, you know, another Coke brand or whatever, so I'm guessing eight US dollars. - [Bell] That one was about $6 Canadian. - Six Canadian. - [Bell] We actually found it at a Canadian store. - Really? Wow. Tetris co-branding. I'm going to say this is another $6 drink then. Sure. - [Bell] That one is $4 Canadian, $3 US. - All right. I mean, I wouldn't even maybe begin to consider buying it, but, sure. - [Bell] So in total we spent about 250 US dollars. - $250? What was the most expensive drink? Was it ZOA? - [Bell] No, that was the same price as the PRIME. - Really? Same as the PRIME, six bucks. I guess six bucks is a lot for a drink. - [Bell] The four pack cost 57 US dollars. - Wait, what? Was that only 'cause we had to import it though? - [Bell] Yeah. - Okay. Well, what was it in like US dollars? - [Bell] It's a limited edition, so I don't have pricing outside of that. - What was even limited edition about that Coke? - [David] Show him the box! - [Bell] It came in a fancy box. - Oh, fancy box you say. - [Bell] So the cans also have like an AR game on it, if you scan. - There's an augmented reality game. So this was the most expensive drink. That was a lot of gross garbage to drink on an empty stomach, I need to go pee. Subscribe to Short Circuit.",

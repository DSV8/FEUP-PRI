    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is, you've heard of mystery tech, now let me introduce you to mystery flavors. So we went down a weird rabbit hole, where we found a bunch of cotton candies and sodas that are flavored like things that shouldn't be flavored like that. So we're gonna try these out, we're gonna blind fold the entire time and we're gonna have to guess, you, okay, you're just starting already. Okay. - Hmm, that's quite delightful. - Wow, way to start - You like some? - Let's find out number one. - That was delightful, I want more - I'm not gonna lie, that actually wasn't that bad. - I have not had a cotton candy. - Can I? - Since like 1999. - All right. - Hmm (murmurs) - The forbidden insulation. - So what flavor is it? - I think grape. - I'm gonna go with lavender. What? - Yeah. - Wait, wait, I want one more. - So, if you are familiar with the Harry Potter Betsy be boops babopies, every flavor beans. - Bertie Bott's, you muggle. - So if you're familiar with those this is along the same lines where these cotton candies are supposed to be flavored like things that shouldn't be flavored like these things. I'll be honest that this isn't bad. - That's quite delicious. I've had like three or four bites. I'm just little... - This is actually really good. I'm going with lavender though. This was, okay. This was peanut butter and jelly cotton candy. - [Austin] What? - I'm gonna be the bigger man here and can say that you get the point for this one because you... - Fruity. - You said grape. - Fruit adjacent. Oh wait, I just looked at it, there's like the jelly one and there's like the brown which is the peanut butter one. Let get a little bit of the peanut butter one. - I definitely think... - Peanut butter, I only got the jelly part of the peanut butter and jelly. - All right, okay. - Round two activate. - This is great. (upbeat music) - Whoa, that smells like cappuccino or something, hmm. - Ooh, that is strong. - Hmm, coffee, wait. - Oh. - That's a dirt. - Oh. - I started at coffee and I quickly I've gone to dirt, oh. - This is dirt, this is a dirty fart. - It smells earthy. Dirt or motor oil, I'm not sure which. I will just say dirt. Sure, dirt - Drywall. I feel like it's slightly spicy. It's not spicy. - Oh, I didn't taste that. - But I do feel something in the back. - Spicy dirt. It's the dirt that you use plant chilies in. - Bacon. That was awful. - I'm gonna stop eating pork if that's what bacon tastes like. (upbeat music) I always smell it before I actually try to taste it. The last one smelled bad this one smells fine. - I don't smell anything. Oh, it went up my nose, it went up my nose - It's spicy, it's spicy. - Oh, oh. - It's spicy. - That was jalapeno. Why, (coughing loudly) Why? - It hits like sugar at first, and then as the sugar starts to dissolve it's like cinnamon or something. Oh. (coughing loudly) - And you are eating more it. - Jalapeno. - I'm gonna be a try hard at this game. - I'm not, I'm trying hard to never eat that again. - Cinnamon, cinnamon, cinnamon, cinnamon. - All right. Let's open it up. - Jalapeno. (buzzer ringing) Jalapeno. - For those of you who've never tried this disgusting food and I would not recommend it, I mean it's still cotton candy, it's still sugar. So you always get a lot of sweet there. And it's just like, one of the flavor on top of the sugar is. And so for that one it's like, okay, sugar, sugar, spice, spice, spice, sugar is kinda like the notes. - That was awful, that was so bad. - I like it more than the bacon. At least there's like some novelty to this. - All right, there's at least flavor. I'll give it that. There's at least flavor. Bacon straight up tasted just like someone farted. - Can I just disclaim that I have never been nor do I plan on eating any farts. - Why would you, they give no nourishment. (upbeat music) That's, that is my boob. All right. - It smells like pickles. I don't like this. It smells like a dill pickle. - Oh. - Did you eat it yet? - Yeah. (laughing loudly) - Its pickle. - It smells like a pickle - It's pickle. - No, no. That ain't it. - There's no way this is not pickles. - I mean, it tastes like, pickles with a side of toe jam, I don't know. Yeah, it's something pickle, I don't know. - I mean, here's the thing, is I could believe the toe jam part of that. - Whoa. - This was absolutely awful. - Makes the bacon taste like a delicious fart instead of a nasty one. - This is like a wet angry fart. How can you do it man? - I'm gonna open it. Pickle cotton candy. We earned that one. - We did, we did. We both got points, but really we're the losers on this one. - It was not worth it. - It was not worth the point. Oh my God. - We were the winners, but at what cost. (upbeat music) My stomach not a happy camper right now. I'm gonna smell it. It doesn't smell like much. (coughing loudly) I haven't even tried mine yet. - I think I know. But that's horrible. I was gonna say like ribs. - Yeah, like a barbecue or barbecue chip or something? - Yeah, I'm gonna be more specific, I'm gonna say like rib or like pulled pork. - I'm almost say like barbecue, like potato chip more than anything. - All right, we taking them off. - Yeah. So it's pink, I don't know if that's a good sign or not. Oh God, Matt. - No, that was my second choice. - Pizza. - That's the first time that this has ever happened to me where I don't want the pizza. (upbeat music) That smells actually lovely. - It's a trap man. - Yeah. - It's a trap. - It's definitely, there's no way. - This one feels extra sticky. Not immediately terrible. - Yeah, and like this one, like I don't know whether my standards are just so low. - Yeah. I'm getting like fruity vibes from this. It's so spicy that's weird, yeah. This is not the worst, it's better than bacon. - I have a weird guess for this one. And I'm gonna say cereal. I feel like this is like fruit loops. - I think I know what this is, it's pancakes with syrup. - Oh. - That's what it is. - Oh, yeah, okay. - Yeah, that's what it is. - Yeah, I think you're right. This would make an interesting breakfast, so we're both on. (laughing loudly) - It's beer. - No wonder I liked it so much. I'm gonna take this one. Here take some extra. (upbeat music) Austin and I are all tied up, so now we need a tiebreaker round. So same premise except now we have some sodas. - I'm ready, hit me with your best shot. - All right. - Got it. - Ready? Cheers. - Cheers. There we go. All right, all right. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - No, no, I didn't even taste it yet. - No, no, no. I don't do the smell test for nothing. (coughing loudly) - That smells awful. - That's dirt. That is dirt, that someone went out in our backyard and dug up some dirt and then said, that's a drink. - Why are we making this video right now Matt? I'm gonna take another sip. I'm doing this so that I can earn your subscription and earn your ringling of the dingling bell. - Oh my God. All right, what do we got? What's your guess? - My guess is... - I'm saying dirt. - I'm gonna say, this is, go a little outside the box, cough syrup - Dirt versus cough syrup. Let's see it. - Bacon. - Why, why? Bro this ain't it. - Lester's Fixins bacon Soda - Lester, y'all need to chill the fuck out. My lips are sticking out with fake bacon soda. (upbeat music) - Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh. - Oh, that smells cinnamony. I think actually I might like this one. - The scent of this one is much more pungent than the taste. - Yeah. - It's actually quite pleasant, I'm not gonna lie. - Yeah. No, that's a 100% cinnamon. - I don't think it's cinnamon. - Really? - It smells like Christmas, I don't know. - The tree? - It smells like the Christmas season. I'm going with just like winter themed scent. - I'm sticking with cinnamon. - All right, what do we got? Pumpkin pie. Isn't there cinnamon in pumpkin pie? I'm gonna give us both 1/2 a point. - I'll give you both 1/2 a point on that. - I'll say this is actually quite delicious. I would maybe sit down and drink a whole bottle of it. - It's weird though, cause like when I first take a sip of it it almost tastes like orange soda. - It definitely the spices there, which is not cinnamon. - Yeah. - It's more nutmegs. (upbeat music) Oh no, no, no, no, no. I smell it and I don't like it. - That's liquid fart. - It smells bad. It smells like sludge. - No, that's dirt, that's dirt - Tire, it tastes like a tire. - I was thinking black liquorish, which tastes pretty bad. - I'm gonna say tire. You gotta say tire? - Yeah. - I'm going with mud. - It's all also red. Why is this red? - So far that's probably been the worst thing that we've tasted. - What did you say your answer was Matt? - Mud. It's dirt. It's dirt. - I gonna give Matt a point for that. - Matt gets two points for that, I feel that was pretty good. That was close. - To be fair I've been guessing mud several times, oh, dirt several times. That was the worst thing that we've tasted so far. - Definitely the worst of the sodas. Yeah, that was pretty bad. To be fair though, if I bought a dirt soda, that's kinda what I'd expect. (upbeat music) - Give me the sodas. - Can you say, (both conversing) - Is he just leaving me hanging? What? - Matt this one smells good. This one smells good. - I've been waiting for us to gingerly tip clanks. - Wonderful. Cheers to me, I'm trying to cheers you. - Ah, yeah. - There we go. This smells like, oh, what is that? Cherry? - It smells way better than it tastes. - It's definitely fruity, right? Bubble gum. - Yeah, that's bubble gum. Like... - [Austin] I think so. - Big league chew. - Yeah, I'll go with bubble gum on that one. - Bubble gum. - It's the breakfast of Austin's. - Oh, peanut butter and jelly. (buzzer ringing) - This does not taste anything like peanut butter and jelly. I'm pretty sure that like when I had strep throat as a child, this is the exact medicine that I got. - That's not peanut butter and jelly. - There's a couple of these that like, when we taste it and you're like, oh, it's dirt flavor and like, oh yeah, okay, I get that. This is not peanut butter and jelly. There's just no way. There's no way. Before we start this next one. - Yeah, yeah, go ahead Matt. - Can I just tell you that, I just, I don't feel good. I really regret this video. - How many minutes of our lives do you think have come off with what we've done today? (upbeat music) okay, cheers Matt. Okay. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - It smells awful. - Is there a fart flavored soda in this episode? - Oh. - Oh. - You get, you get the... How does it taste? - Pepper. Is pepper the answer? - I'm gonna say yard clippings. No. I wanna apologize. - What is it Matt? - To all of Western New York. It's Buffalo wing soda. - I at least called it was spicy. - When you live in upstate New York, around Buffalo from where I grew up, you're basically born with a chicken wing in your mouth. I couldn't taste this at all. (buzzer ringing) And I'm really sad. (upbeat music) - Cheers friend. - I haven't found it yet. Cheers. - All right. That smell like shoes, like leather shoes. Drinking it Matt. (murmurs) You know, it actually does it tastes bad. That's actually tastes way better than it smells. - I know exactly what this is, buttered popcorn. - I mean, it smells awful, but actually I can get on board with that. It's a little buttery. It reminds me a little bit of a butter beer, but not quite. I'm gonna go with butter as well. - But it's awful. - Actually tastes pretty good to me. - No I can't, I need this way from me. - Might go well with your Buffalo wings. - [Austin] It's ranch, it's ranch. - I wanna argue my case here. Buttermilk is a key ingredient to ranch. I think I get the win on this one. Why wouldn't I? - And we also were both very wrong. - I was very right. - You, just because it's in the refrigerator doesn't mean it's the same thing, Matt. - Butter milk is what you squeeze out of the butter. - You squeeze a lot of butter? - Have you never made your own butter? - [Woman] No. - Who makes their own butter, Matt? - You get heavy whipping cream and then you churn it, you just... All right, you churn it. - Like I sincerely apologize to the audience... - You wash it. - For the graphic depiction that you've witnessed today. But please just let us know if you need counseling, it's available. Just email Matt and he'll pay personally for your bill. - I am a chef. (upbeat music) All right, we're all tied up. This next one is for all the marbles. - Wait are we? - I don't know what the actual score is, cause it doesn't matter because we're all tied up. - Okay, okay. - But whoever gets this one wins the title, best taste tester of all time. - And the loser has to chug the bacon soda. All right, cheers friend. - All right. This one is for all the marbles. - Oh, it smells delightful. - Oh boy. It smells like butter beer from like Harry Potter world. - Woo, woo. That's delightful. Nah, this is the best thing I've tasted all day. - Is this just butterscotch? That's too easy. - It's too easy, yeah. I'm getting a candy kind of vibe from it. I almost wanna say like bubble gum. Caramel actually might be it. - You say caramel or caramel? - Caramel. - What's it like being so wrong? - What's like... - Caramel. - Being Matt and see me all day? - It sucks, it sucks. Let's be real, it sucks. - I'm gonna say caramel. I'm gonna lock that in. - I'm gonna say candy corn. Let's see it. I don't like that this is like atomic urine. This looks like someone who hasn't drank water in four days just had to pee. - Sweet corn soda boys. Who gets a point on that one? - I think Matt gets 1/2 a point for candy corn. - Candy corn. - Sweet corn, I think it's 1/2 a point. - You don't get points because you're, oh my God. - I win this round. Thank you for watching. Let us know in the comments what other weird flavored things we should drink, eat and consume. - No, don't actually, we're not doing this ever again. - Someone else will do it. Like and subscribe, follow us everywhere, and we will catch you in the next one. (upbeat music) - Aaron, I appreciate you, and you're doing God's work son.",

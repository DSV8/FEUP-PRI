    "transcript": "- Xiaomi 13 Pro, what a phone. It was announced at MWC and we've got our hands on it late, but guess what? This video's gonna be way better than all those other ones. Don't watch 'em. Don't fact check me. But, we have something special which is obviously a gift box and we love those. We had the sweet Poco shirt last time that I'm not wearing today. Was told that I'm not allowed to wear that anymore. (dramatic music) We'll bring it back someday. But in the box today, whoa, we got some, oh, we got like mountaineering gear. I don't know. I'm guessing this is a phone carrying thing. It's got a nice card holder on the back and everything too. [James] How's it on the neck? Scratchy? - No, surprisingly not. It's a solid rope. It is. I don't know. Do I look cool? We got a key ring that is a little piece of rope that has like on it. So this phone, like past Xiaomi phones, has a partnership with Leica. I wouldn't necessarily be like Leica hardcore heavy duty like something you would take with you on a rock climbing trip. Bu,t what do I know? I trust Xiaomi. Take your Leica with you on big hikes. We also have a nice water bottle, that's again, like this satin feel, which the box has. I'm not a huge fan of that feel, but luckily that's not what we're focusing on today. The Xiaomi 13 pro, like I said, it comes in the same kind of like satin feel box that I'm not a fan of 'cause I have sweaty, greasy gamer hands. So, the box is already kinda gross looking, but otherwise very, very minimal. Designed by Xiaomi. Okay, we got this here, got the phone. What's in this? We got a case, this is already a winner. Also in the box we have the phone itself that we'll come back to and we have a 120 watt charger. So, this will be the kinda super fast charger that can charge from zero to 100% in 19 minutes using a boost mode or zero to 124 minutes in normal mode. I don't know why you would use one or the other, if you're already charging your phone that fast it's not good on the battery regardless. You may as well save that five minutes. But, who knows? You have the option, but luckily if you don't wanna use something that's this fast and kind of wears down on your battery, you can't do wireless charging which does up to 50 watts and then it does reverse wireless charging of 10 watts as well, which is nice. I assume that's better for your battery. Correct me if I'm wrong. All right, let's get down to the phone 'cause that's all there is in the box. No cable or anything like that. The camera bump is the other very noticeable thing with this phone. Oh, it's already fingerprinty. Very fingerprinting. So, we had labs take a look so which is why someone else has gotten their grubby little hands on it as well. But, as you can see this is big. So, Xiaomi is actually no stranger to having massive camera bumps on their phones. The last one, the 12 Pro, also had this big circular camera on it. So, I actually kind of prefer this look. It's a little bit more, I don't wanna say subdued 'cause it's still very in your face, but I guess it kind of looks better especially when you put a case on it. It's just really thick at the camera bump. Otherwise, we have it in this nice black color. I do like just kind of a black phone to keep it looking sleek. On the front we have the camera cutout and the 6.73 inch screen. This is a WQHD plus OLED with the obviously LTPO 1 hertz to 120 hertz that most flagships have now. Going around the sides, we have our volume rocker and power button and I gotta say they feel good, this doesn't feel mushy and you can't push in the center of the volume rocker either. On the top we have two speaker holes, a mic hole, and an IR blaster. I'm loving Chinese phones, IR blasters, again, hardly ever useful, but when they are, it is nice to have. And on the bottom we have our dual nano sim tray, USBC, mic hole, and the other speakers. This does have dual speakers which we we'll take a listen to later with Dolby Atmos, but come on. They say the back glass is made of a medical grade bioceramic. I don't know what that means, but it feels good in the hand. It doesn't feel too slippery or anything like that. On the front here, we do have the curved screen. I'm notably not a fan of curved screens. I feel like you get some accidental touches, but we'll see if that's an issue when we turn it on. And it is Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. There is Victus 2 now, so I'm surprised he didn't use that. But Victus is only a year old, so it's not that big of a deal and I believe most flagships are using that as well. And as for weight, it's 229 grams. So, what is that? Six pieces of bread? What are the odds, it actually is six pieces of bread. So clearly, I eat a lot a bread. All right, I love eating plain bread. All right, let's try on the case. I feel like this one's a little too rubbery, like it feels gummy, especially again with clammy hands. It does not feel nice in the hand, but all right, well the last thing to do is get it turned on and see how it actually runs. But first, let me tell you about our sponsor, Ridge. Simple yet elegant, the Ridge Wallet holds up to 12 cards and still has room for cash with a money clip or elastic band. Its low profile means that the Ridge wallet will fit in most pockets and bag compartments. There's no need to worry about durability or theft either. The Ridge wallet is made with premium RFID blocking materials and they even offer a lifetime warranty. Still on the fence? Just try it out. The team over at the Ridge are so confident you'll love their product, they offer a 45-day test drive period. If you're unsatisfied, simply send the wallet back for a full refund. Visit the link below and check out the products that Ridge has to offer. Make sure to use code circuit for 10% off your order and free worldwide shipping. Ooh. The WAN show. Oh, this is so big. It's beautiful. Alright, we're in. So, this is running MIUI 14 which is based on Android 13, which is nice to see. Some people have a bit of a love-hate relationship with MIUI, but I feel like this newest MIUI 14 from what I saw online seems to just be a performance boost. It uses up less storage, less RAM, minimizes things a bit so it should be less intrusive on your experience. That might kind of sway some people over, but it is obviously not just base Android. They are putting skins on it. There's quite a bit going on. Again, not all of the apps on here are the ones that come standard. I know Labs has taken a look, so they would have installed \"Call of Duty\" mobile and stuff like that. But for example, we did not install QEEQ car rental, which I've never heard of. Or Unhappy Raccoon, which again sounds like a banger, but stuff that comes to default on the phone that I don't really think should. All right, for specs on this guy, we do have 12 gigs of RAM and then it either comes in 256 or 512 gigabytes of storage which is nice to see. 12 gigs of RAM is plenty for most and this does have the RAM expansion that we're seeing a lot of Chinese phones add that I again probably wouldn't use which is where it uses the system storage as flash memory, but could degrade your storage over time and you probably won't see a huge performance difference especially when 12 should be plenty for anything unless you're doing some crazy stuff on your phone that I don't wanna know about. And for SSC, we have this Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which we're seeing in most of the flagships, like the S23s, the OnePlus 11. For fingerprint scanner, it is an in-screen one which again I know some people don't like, but I seem to have good luck with from my little baby hands that don't have any calluses. So, let's try it out and see how fast it is. It feels pretty good. What you can't see is that underneath my finger on the screen actually brightens up which means it is an optical fingerprint scanner so it's taking pretty much a picture of your thumb. Samsung uses an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner so what it does is it vibrates the screen to get a map of your finger and so that kind of works better for a lot of people because it doesn't matter if your finger is scarred or wet or dirty because it seems to just not be affected by that versus an optical one will be tricked because it doesn't match the image it has originally. Let's do some \"Crab Rave.\" So, like I said it's the WQHD screen OLED. So far it's looking good and I'm sure it will continue to look good. Let's take a look and see to make sure though. (upbeat music) It sounds good. So, the speakers do seem like genuine dual speakers, like one side's not way quieter than the other. It's not clipping or anything like that. I wouldn't say it's getting especially loud, but we've had it before where again, phones will get so loud that it just sounds distorted and bad and I'd rather have it be limited, but sound good consistently across that spectrum of volume. I do have an iPhone 14 here as well, so we'll see how it compares. (upbeat music) I think I still prefer the iPhone. The Xiaomi 13 Pro definitely feels wider, like the sound stage feels a bit wider, but I feel like the iPhone's a bit kind of warmer, more full, and the screen looks great either way. What is interesting here is that because of the higher incline of the camera bump here we're getting a little bit more glare on the Xiaomi, but in person it does look really good. And speaking of the screen the does have a pretty darn bright one. So, on high brightness mode, which is like when you're in auto mode and it sensors you're outside or something like that, it can get up to 1,200 nits and then what I assume is peak, or maybe speculator brightness can get up to 1,900. Also with that, it does have HDR 10 plus, Dolby vision, all that kind of stuff as well. I don't feel like there's still a ton of content that you can view that with.\\, but if you are, you know, watching a ton of Netflix on your phone or you watch a lot of kind of artist creators maybe that will be beneficial to you. All right, now let's talk cameras. It feels like that's kind of the main selling point for most people with their phones now is the cameras. So, inside is a one inch sensor which I'm not gonna explain because it's been explained on this channel a lot by Brandon. You can watch one of his videos or there's a great one by MKBHD, but don't watch his, stay right here on our channel. What is also really cool is that all three cameras on this guy are 50 megapixel. I don't know what order the cameras in, but I'm gonna say this is the 50 megapixel main camera. We have our 50 megapixel telephoto camera which is 3x or about 75 millimeter equivalent for those people who use actual cameras. And then we have our 50 megapixel ultrawide. The main and telephoto do have optical image stabilization, so if you've got shaky hands when you're taking photos you don't have to worry about it being super blurry. But, the ultrawide unfortunately does not. What's also interesting and we'll have to try out was that the main camera doesn't have your grandpa's old optical image stabilization. It has HyperOIS. I don't know what that means, but they say that you can take videos while running and it'll still be very, very smooth. All right, right first launch of the camera here. We can see we get to select our style. So, with this partnership with Leica you can kinda change the look of your photos. Maybe it'd be more punchy and contrasty, cooler, warmer, whatever your kind of feel is to match that like a film style. So, we have fresh and vibrant is the first one to more natural and realistic. I am more of a believer of the kind of more natural looking photos that you then edit to be vibrant. Sometimes it can be hard to reduce the amount of punch and contrast photos have if it's baked into the photo. So I'd rather add it in later, but it's nice to have the option on this first launch here. All right, taking photos here you can see the fan club watching. This is the telephoto. We've got 2x which would be just punching in from the main camera, the main camera itself. And the ultrawide. Interesting to see the differences just in the viewfinder here. If the photos look anything like the viewfinder did, these photos are gonna look pretty darn good. This is the ultrawide. Yeah, it looks fine. Not a huge amount of distortion on the edges. You can see a little bit, but I wouldn't say anything that's hurting the photo. The main camera, again, looks great. We can zoom in pretty far and have things look great. For video mode it's pretty standard compared to flagships. It can do AK at 24 FPS or 4K up to 60. And then obviously it can do 1080p video and slow motion up to 1,920 FPS, but I'm sure at 540p or some other awful quality. So, I doubt you'll actually use it. But just again, right out of the box let's see how this does. This is me taking a video and talking. Wow, panning, jiggling a little, going up and down, going a little side to side, rotating, I don't know, tilt pan, whatever it's called. I'm gonna try punching in here, see how the zoom does. Wow, dramatic. Oh, and you can see the switch over to the 3x camera where again, it gained some quality back and it can go pretty far. This is 15x. And then zooming back out. Can we go all the way to the six camera? You can see it switch to the main camera there. The color tone's changed. All the way out to the six or 0.6x ultrawide camera. Wow, that looks really good. The stabilization worked great. Again, I wasn't jiggling my hands like a ton, but I was going up and down and side to side and you can barely tell. As for the video quality, looks great. I am wishing that the main camera had the same tone as the telephoto. So, when it actually made the switch over to telephoto, James all of a sudden gained life and was a lot more colorful than compared to the main camera. And then you lose even more of that color and quality as you go to the ultrawide, which is disappointing. It seems like that telephoto, they're using it for their portrait mode as well. Looks really good. Alright, now we have the selfie camera. Doesn't look like there's a whole lot of smoothing or anything going on. I can see all of my pores and beard hairs and everything looks fine. Rotating around the room, keeps me exposed well. I assume it sounds okay, we'll take a listen, but I also wanna see and make 100% sure if there are any AI modes on as I believe it was the POCO video, even when he said no effects, it had smoothing and stuff on which was really disappointing to see. Oh, okay, so once you click on the effects button it comes up as showing that you are on original. And then if you click onto these, it will start to do the effects. So, from smooth to slendering your face, to making your head smaller, to enlarging your eyes. Don't use these, I mean do what you want, but you're beautiful the way you are. And what's interesting, I went to check the settings here and I see there is a teleprompter mode as well. So, if you are somebody who's actually using this to read scripts or like me, where \"Short Circuit's\" fully scripted, usually I have to look ahead, but I can just do it right on my phone. It's a joke, \"Short Circuit's\" not fully scripted. Another thing I wanna try is portrait mode. Interesting, so when I was actually holding it up and taking photos, the live view did not look good, like it was missing all of the edges. Like this is obviously a very tricky subject, but after it's taken the photo and I'm assuming AI or machine learning or blast processing, it's done its work, it does look quite a bit better. It's still obviously misses a little bit of the edges, but this is very, very complicated. And so, it could be hard for it to kind of work out what's going on, but I would still be pretty darn satisfied if this was my new Tinder photo. Now for the part you've all been waiting for, gaming. I sent this over to labs to take a look and they gave it a quick once over to see what's going on. And no surprise the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 does great. like the OnePlus 11, a solid 60 lock on every gameplay, 62 frames per second median on \"Call of Duty\" mobile, and through all the gameplay, temperatures for the CPU stayed around 47 degrees, which 100 degrees is like where things would start to get real hot and it'd start to throttle itself. So, 47's good and it stays that cool, thanks to the 3,400 millimeter squared vapor chamber. So, it disperses heat away from the CPU to help disperse that through the back of the phone and into your hands. We haven't been playing super long, like I've been kind of loading up games and obviously taking a picture of the camera, it's a little warm. I feel my hands getting a little moist, but it's nothing too crazy. And again, with the performance you're getting it's probably worth that trade off. For the last few kind of important things about the phone, it does have a 4,820 milliamp hour battery which is a little bit less than this new standard of 5,000 milliamp hour battery, but they claim it still gets 37 hours of calling, 19 hours of video playback, and 7 hours of gaming which seem pretty darn reasonable. Doesn't seem like they're making any lofty claims. It's also IP68 water resistant, which again, is pretty standard for flagship phones. Wi-Fi 7, which is nice and not available, but again, makes it more accessible. 5G, like I said, Bluetooth 5.3, and of course, it comes in fun colors like black, white, green and light blue. All this sounds great, right? Applaud for Xiaomi. (hands clapping) But, and there is a major but, two major buts. The first being the price. This isn't scheduled for a full release in the States, but it costs 1,300 Euros, which is a lot. That is more than an iPhone 14 Pro Max. It's more than the S23 Ultra. Whew, if you wanna stay away from Samsung and you don't like iPhone and the Pixel, you know, they've got their own issues and you really, really want something flagship. This seems like it could be a solid choice. But then, there's the second big oof which is privacy concerns. Obviously Xiaomi is a Chinese company which means they're obligated to share data and they've been caught sharing and selling data before. They say in MIUI 14, they've moved a lot of processes that were done in cloud or online to being local on the phone, but you're gonna have to trust that. Again, they are still legally obligated to share information when requested and though they've created servers offshore, it's a big trust if you're somebody who does have issues with that. You might be somebody who's like, \"I have nothing to hide, I don't worry about it.\" In which case, good on ya. But for me, that would be almost a stopping point. I do see the irony when I do use an OPPO phone, but I've got nothing to hide, right? - [James] That's not how it works. - It's not how it works. But if you are still interested, this does have its European and wide Asian release on March 8th, though it has released in China since early last year. So, you can look up reviews and more in depth looks at this phone than our quick unboxing, not a review, but if you liked this quick unboxing, not a review, make sure to like, comment, and subscribe. Why don't you check out the video on the OnePlus 11 5G. I said no one has 5G and people got mad, but it's a great phone.",

    "transcript": "Hey guys, this is Austin. I'm standing here in my home theater setup. So a few months ago you might remember we did a video going all over how we built this, including the massive 120-inch LG projector behind me. With a 120-inch screen, we're pushing our ProBeam to its absolute limit. Now, it definitely will work, however, as with any projector, the larger the display area that you're projecting on the less light you have to spread across it. So that on top of the fact that this is going to be only 1080 means that it's time for an upgrade. That's where this comes in, the LG CineBeam Laser 4K, and, of course, huge shout out to LG for sponsoring our setup yet again. So one of the cool things about this is that not only is it going to give us a full 4K resolution, but also can go all the way up to a 150-inch screen, more than enough power to handle our 120-inch display. One of the main criticisms you guys had of our last setup had to do with audio. So right now we're using the SJ9 Sound Bar. Don't get me wrong, it actually does sound pretty good, especially considering how small it is, but for a full home theater setup we need to up the game just a little bit. What's cool about this guy is that it's in a very unusual shape. It's definitely not going to come cheap, but what you're getting here is something that's going to be pretty portable if you wanna actually move it around. So I'm actually curious, I was able to take a look at this guy at CES ah, there you go. So if you wanna walk around with it, not only does it have the built-in handle, but it also has a power cable built in, I think, right? Oh, yeah, look at that. So the power cable just winds out, so you don't even need to worry about anything. If you wanna take this on like a, I don't know, what do you do? Go outside to a pool party or something? So what's interesting about this guy is that it actually is going to be in a really unique shape and that's because they actually completely reoriented it compared to most standard laser projectors. I say standard as if laser projectors are all over the place, but basically what they've done is they flipped the entire thing up on its side. So what you're actually doing is you're going to be shooting everything off of this mirror so everything can be much more compact, and you're also going to be getting something that is going to be handheld, somewhat. I'm a little afraid that it's going to be too tall for this setup. We may actually have to move everything back. - [Ken] Oh, that's depressing. - Okay, so, it turns out that this projector not exactly short-throw like the other one or not as we expected, so. - [Wes] It don't work right. - It won't fill the screen like we thought. - [Austin] The room's too small. - The room's way too small, buy a bigger house. - [Austin] Is this really the solution? - [Wes] I think so. - Yeah, this is, yeah, this is pretty comfortable. - So it is day two and we have a little bit of a better plan than yesterday. So as opposed to doing the entire setup at my house instead we're going to be doing it here at the office where, you know, we have a room that's larger than seven-feet wide. So unlike with a ultra short-throw projector, the CineBeam actually needs some space to be able to give you the full size. So technically we could have it a couple feet away, but then the screen size would be like this big. To actually get a full 100, 120, or even 150 inches, you need to have this thing several feet away. So, with that, I think it's time to repurpose our old set, which we actually, if you guys remember, this is where we used to shoot all of our videos, and get ourselves a proper office home theater setup that's actually functional unlike what we did yesterday. - So we just got the projector screen up, we lowered the screen itself, and I think the placement looks pretty good right now. We have this console table that we've had from our old setup. We're gonna use it to hold all of our components. - Okay, so, the AC is not currently working. It's over 90 degrees in the office and yet work continues. - [Austin] So what are we doing as far as audio goes? - Okay, so basically we have a 5.1 setup right now. So we have this Yamaha receiver. It'll take all of our speakers, our subwoofer. We got basically all Klipsch just to kind of match everything. And we also have this thing that'll hook up to our PC. So it is a desktop DAC and headphone amp. Really, what's interesting about this is that it comes with a Blu-ray player, which is really weird. I've never seen something like this before. - [Austin] The real answer here is that you picked a bunch of stuff that you want for your own set up, you're gonna steal as soon as this video's over, right? - Shh. - One of the nice things about the CineBeam is that we do have multiple options of setting it up. So what I think I'm going to do is put it behind me here on this table and just shoot across the couch, but if you want to get a little bit more of a compact setup, instead of using it with a mirror like this you can actually just swivel the whole thing out of the way and using the included stand just adjust it and kinda angle it just about the way you wanna look at it on the display. One of the things I'm excited for is this Corsair Lapboard. So we actually have a full wireless mechanical keyboard with this weird trackball mouse. This is actually really cool though. So the whole thing is gonna be padded on the bottom. So it's really meant more for actual gaming than any kind of home theater use, but the nice thing is you do still have a full-size keyboard so you can pretty much do whatever you want. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the trackball mouse just 'cause it's weird, but I think, especially considering that I don't wanna have to be moving all around here, it's a little bit easier to use. So this is just the first version of this setup. So right now we're going to be using the latest Intel Skull Canyon NUC to power everything. Now, with Radeon graphics inside we're gonna have more than enough power to, of course, handle any kind of 4K projection that we want, but, importantly, it also is going to be capable of some gaming, 'cause it's not exactly going to be a dedicated gaming setup with a full projector, but it is possible, and this PC will run everything we need in a nice small package. It is finally time to test the setup. So the projector is fully up and running. You can see it actually looks pretty decent even though it is very bright in the room right now. So the only thing left to do is to press play and hope that everything works. So a great test is going to be watching one of our very first 4K HDR videos right off of YouTube. Oh, man, it's so good. (video playing in background) So I've watched this video I don't know how many times, but I've actually never watched it at full 4K HDR on a projector, oh, man. Nope, nope, nope, nope. Yup. (laughing) Dude, this is so great. I'm so happy with this right now. Dude, it looks so good, especially considering it's 4K. So we've got a pretty large screen here. It'll go up to 150 inches, but right now we've got it at around 120 inches with this display. But, I mean, it is so sharp even when you get right up close to it. And something that's really surprising to me is how bright it is. So, I mean, it is not dark in here at all. We've got the windows, we've got the top light, and yet you can still see it is super, super bright. This is great. So, of course, if you guys wanna check out any of this stuff the link will be in the description, but if you excuse me, I'm gonna go watch some videos on our super-cool new setup. I'm just gonna crank the volume now.",

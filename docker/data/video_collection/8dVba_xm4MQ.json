    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - [Alex] Mark, we just tried Orion together. - Yeah. What'd you think? - We're fresh off of it. It feels like true AR glasses are finally getting closer. Orion is a product that you all have been working on for five plus years. - Yeah, almost 10. - Almost 10? - Yeah. - So take me back to the beginning when you started the project, when it started in research. Like, what were you thinking about? What was the goal for it? - Well, I think a lot of it goes all the way back to our relationship with mobile platforms and all that, right? So, you know, we have lived through one major platform transition already because we started on web, right, not on mobile. And mobile phones and smartphones kind of got started around the same time as Facebook and early social media was getting started. So it didn't really get to play any role in that platform transition but going through it. We weren't born on mobile. We had this awareness that, okay, web was a thing, mobile is a thing, it is different. There are strengths and weaknesses of it. There's this continuum of computing where now you have a mobile device that you can take with you all the time, and that's amazing, but it's small, pulls you away from other interactions. Those things are not great. But there was this recognition that just like there was the transition from computers to mobile, mobile was not gonna be the end of the line. So as soon as we started becoming, like, a more, I don't know, I guess I'd say stable company, like, once we found our footing on mobile, and, you know, we weren't clearly gonna go out of business or something like that, I was like, \"Okay, let's start planting some seeds for what we think could be the future,\" right? It's like mobile is already getting defined. You know by 2012, 2014-ish, it was generally too late to really shape that platform in a meaningful way. I mean, we had some experiments. I mean, they didn't succeed or go anywhere. So pretty quickly I was like, \"Okay, we should focus on the future, because just like there's the shift from desktop to mobile, new things are gonna be possible in the future.\" So what is that? I think the simplest version of it is basically what you started seeing with Orion, right? It's like the vision is a normal pair of glasses that can do two really fundamental things. One is put holograms in the world to deliver this realistic sense of presence like you were there with another person or in another place, or maybe you're physically with a person, but just like we did, you can pull up a virtual pong game or, you know, whatever. You can work on things together, you can sit at a coffee shop, pull up your whole workstation of different monitors. You know, you can be on a flight or in the backseat of a car and pull up a full screen movie theater, and, like, okay, all these things. Like, great computing, full sense of presence like you're there with people no matter where they are. Thing two is it's the ideal device for AI. And the reason for that is because glasses are uniquely positioned for you to be able to let them see what you see and hear what you hear and give you very subtle feedback back to you where they can speak in your ear, or they can have silent input that shows up on the glasses that other people can't see and doesn't take you away from the world around you. And I think that that is all gonna be really profound. Now, when we got started with this, I had thought that the hologram part of this was gonna be possible before AI, so it's an interesting twist of fate that the AI part is actually possible before the holograms are really able to be mass produced at an affordable price. But that was the vision. I think that it's pretty easy to wrap your head around. You know, there's already, you know, a billion to 2 billion people who wear glasses on a daily basis. Just like, you know, everyone who didn't have smartphones were the first people to upgrade to smartphones, I think everyone who has glasses is pretty quickly gonna upgrade to smart glasses over the next decade. And then I think it's gonna start being really valuable, and a lot of other people who aren't wearing glasses today are going to end up wearing them too. That's the simple version. And then I think, as we've developed this out, there are all these more nuanced directions that have emerged too. So we've started, you know, while that was the full version of what we wanted to build, there were all these things that we said, \"Okay, well, maybe it's really hard to build normal-looking glasses that can do holograms at an affordable price point, so what parts of that can we take on?\" And that's where we did the partnership with EssilorLuxottica. So it's like, \"Okay, before you have a display, you can get normal-looking glasses that can have a camera, that can have a microphone, great audio, can capture content, and you can stream video at this point, but the most important feature at this point is the ability to access Meta AI and just have a full AI there, multimodal because it has camera.\" And I mean that product is starting at $300. And initially I thought, \"Hey, this is on the technology path to building full holographic glasses.\" At this point, I actually just think both are gonna exist long term, right? I think that there are gonna be people who want the full holographic glasses, and I think that there are gonna be people who prefer the superior form factor or lower price of a device where they are primarily optimizing for getting AI. I also think there's gonna be a range of things in between, right? So there's the full field of view that you just saw, right, 70 degrees, really wide field of view for glasses, but I think that there are other products in between that too. There's, like, a heads up display version, which, you know, for that, you probably just need, you know, 20, 30 degrees. You can't do the full world holograms where you're interacting with things, like, you're not gonna play ping pong in a 30-degree field of view, but you can communicate with AI, you can text your friends, you can get directions, you can see the content that you're capturing. So I think that there's a lot there that's gonna be compelling. And at each step along this continuum from display-less to small display to full holographic, you're packing more technology in, so each step up is gonna be a little more expensive, is gonna have a little more constraints on the form factor, even though I think we'll get them all to be attractive. You'll be able to do the simpler ones in much smaller form factors permanently. And then of course there's the mixed reality headsets, which took a different direction, which is going towards the same vision, but on that we said, \"Okay, well, we're not gonna try to fit into a glasses form factor.\" For that one, we're going to say, \"Okay, we're gonna really go for all the compute that we want.\" And we're gonna say, \"Okay, this is gonna be more of, like, a headset or goggles form factor.\" And my guess is that that's gonna be a thing long term too, because there are a bunch of uses where people want the full immersion, and, you know, if you're sitting at your desk and working for a long period of time, you might want the more computing power than you're gonna be able to get. But I think that there's no doubt that what you saw with Orion is the, I think, quintessential vision of what people, what at least I thought and continue to think is going to be the next multi-billion-person major computing platform, and then all these other things are gonna get built out around it. - It's my understanding that you originally hoped Orion would be a consumer product when you first set out to build it. - Yeah, yeah. Orion was meant to be our first consumer product, and we weren't sure if we were gonna be able to pull it off. I mean, in general, it's probably turned out significantly better than our 50-50 estimates of what it would be, but we didn't get there on everything that we wanted to. I think we still want it to be a little smaller, a little brighter, a little bit higher resolution, and a lot more affordable before we've put it out there as a product. And look, we have a line of sight to all those things. So I think, so I think we'll probably have the thing that was gonna be the V2 end up being the consumer product, and we're gonna use Orion with developers to basically cultivate the software experience. That way, by the time we're ready to ship something, it's gonna be much more dialed in. - But to be clear, you're not selling Orion at all. - No. - I guess what I'm wondering is, when you made the call, I think it was, around 2022, to say Orion is gonna just be internal dev kit, how did you feel about making that call? Was there any part of you that was like, \"Man, I really wish this could have just been the consumer product we had built- - Yeah, I mean- - you know, took years to make\"? - I always wanna ship stuff quickly and all that, but I think it was the right thing. I mean, I think on this product, I think that there is a, there's a pretty clear set of constraints that I think you want to hit, especially around the form factor, right? I mean, it is very helpful for us that chunkier glasses are ascendant in the fashion world because that allows us to build glasses that are gonna be fashionable but also tech forward. But even so, I'd say, you know, these are unmistakably glasses, they're reasonably comfortable, they're, you know, under 100 grams. - I wore them for two hours, and I couldn't really tell. - Yeah. But I mean, I think we aspire to building things that, like, look really good, right? And I think this is, like, good glasses, but I wanted it to be a little smaller so it can fit within, like, really fashionable, right? When people see the Ray-Bans, there's no compromise on fashion. It's like, like, part of why I think people like them is, yeah, you get all this functionality, but even when you're not using it, they're great glasses. And I think for the future version of Orion, that's the target too. We wanna make it so that, you know, most of the time you're going through your day, you're not computing, right? Or something is happening in the background or something. So it just needs to be good in order for you to want to keep it on your face. And I feel like we're almost there. I think we've made more progress than anyone else in the world that I'm aware of, but it didn't quite hit my bar. And similarly on price, these are gonna be more expensive than the Ray-Bans, right? I mean, there's just a lot more tech that's going in them, but, you know, we do want to have it be within a consumer price point, and this was outside that range, so I wanted to wait until we could get to that range in order to have something that we ship. - Are you imagining that the first commercial version, whenever it is in the next couple, few years, will it be a developer-focused product that you're selling publicly? - No. - You want it to be a consumer-ready- - Consumer. - and that's why I'm asking about the strategy because Apple, Snap, others have decided to do developer-focus plays and get the hardware going with developers early, but you're kind of, are you saying you're skipping that and you just going straight to consumer? - We are using this as a developer kit, and just primarily internally and maybe with a handful of partners. - Okay. - But I mean, I think at this point, Meta is by far the premier developer of augmented reality and virtual and mixed reality software and hardware in the world, so you can think about it as a developer kit, but we just have a lot of that talent in-house, and then we also have well-developed partnerships with a lot of folks externally who we can go to and work with them as well. I don't think we need to go announce a dev kit that arbitrary developers can go buy to get access to the talent that we need to go build out the platform. I think we're in a place where we can work with partners and do that, but that's absolutely what we're gonna do over the next few years, we're gonna hone the experience and figure out what we need to do to really nail it when it's ready to ship. - A lot has been written about how much you're spending on Reality Labs, and I know you probably can't have an exact number, but if you were to guesstimate the cost of just building Orion over the last 10 years, are we talking five plus billion? More than that? - Yeah, probably. - Yeah. - Yeah. But I mean, overall for Reality Labs, for a while, a lot of people thought of all of that budget is going towards virtual and mixed reality. And I actually think we've said publicly that our glasses programs are a bigger budget than our virtual and mixed reality programs. But that goes across all of them, right? So that's the full AR, that's the display-less glasses, like, all the work we're gonna do on Ray-Ban, and we just announced the expanded partnership with Luxottica, EssilorLuxottica, great company. We've had a great experience working with them. They designed so many great glasses, and I think, you know, working with them to do even more is gonna be really exciting. So there's a lot more to do there on all of these things. - How does this partnership work, and this renew that you just did with them, how is it structured? What does this deal look like? - You know, I think it was more of just a commitment from the companies that we're feeling pretty good about how this is going, and we're gonna build a lot more glasses together. And part of the way it works is, you know, rather than doing one generation and then design the next generation, I think by having a longer-term partnership, it allows the teams to not just have to worry about one thing at a time, then like, \"Okay, is this one gonna be good? And then how do we build on that for the next one?\" Now we can start, like, a multi-year roadmap of many different devices knowing that we're gonna be working together for a long time. So I'm optimistic about that. That's how we work internally, right, we don't just, I mean, sometimes when you're early on, you definitely wanna learn from each device launch, but when there are things that you're committed to, I don't think you want the team to feel like, \"Okay, if we don't get the short-term milestone, then, like, we're gonna cancel the whole thing,\" right? So- - Are you buying a stake in EssilorLuxottica? - Yeah, I think we've talked about investing in them. It's not gonna be a major thing. I'd say it's more of a symbolic thing. I mean, we want to have this be a long-term partnership, and as part of that, I thought that this would be a nice gesture. And I fundamentally believe in them a lot. I mean, I think that they're gonna go from being the premier glasses company in the world to, I think, one of the major technology companies in the world. I mean, my vision for them and how I think about it is that if you think about, like, how Samsung in Korea made it so that Samsung, that Korea became one of the main hubs of building phones in the world, I mean, I think that this is probably one of the best shots for Europe and Italy in particular to become a major hub for manufacturing and building and designing the next major category of smart glasses, oh, sorry, of computing platforms overall, so. And I think that they're all-in on that now. And it's been this interesting question because, you know, they have such a good business and such deep competence in the areas, and I've gotten more of an appreciation of how strong of a technology company they are in their own way, right? Designing lenses, designing the materials that you need to make fashionable glasses that can be light enough but also, like, feel good. They bring a huge amount that I think people in our world, the tech world, probably don't necessarily see, but I think that they're really well set up for the future. So I believe in the partnership, I'm really excited about the work that we're doing together. And fundamentally, I think that that's just gonna be a massively successful company in the future. - Is it set up to where they control the designs and you provide the tech stack? Or do you collaborate on the design? - I think we collaborate on everything. - Okay. - It's actually, I mean, part of working together is you build a joint culture over time. And there are a lot of really sharp people over there, who, I think, it took maybe a couple versions for us really to gain an appreciation for how each of us approach things because, you know, they really think about things from this, like, fashion, manufacturing, lens, selling optical devices perspective, and we obviously come at it from a consumer electronics, AI, software perspective. But I think over time we just appreciate each other's perspectives on things a lot more. And I mean, I'm, like, constantly talking to them about things to get their ideas on different things. I mean, you know when partnerships are working well when you reach out to them to get their opinion on things that are not actually currently in the scope of what you're working on together. And because I do that frequently with Rocco who runs their wearables and Francesco who's their CEO, and our team does that too with, like, a large part of the working group over there. It's a good crew. They share good values, they're really sharp, and like I said, I believe in them a lot, and I think it's gonna be a very successful partnership and company. - How many Ray-Ban Metas have you sold so far? - I don't know if we've given a number on that, but- - I know, that's why I'm asking. - Yeah. It's going very well. You know, one of the things that I think is interesting is we underestimated demand. So part of, you know, one thing that is very different in the world of consumer electronics than software is there are fewer supply constraints in software. There are some, I mean, like some of the stuff that we're rolling out, like, voice on Meta AI, we need to meter it as we're rolling it out because we need to make sure we have enough inference capacity to handle it. But fundamentally, we'll resolve that in weeks, right? But for manufacturing, it's like you make these concrete decisions, like, \"Okay, are we setting up four manufacturing lines or six?\" And, you know, each one is a big upfront CapEx investment, and you're basically deciding upfront the velocity at which you're gonna be able to generate supply before you know what the demand is. So on this one, we thought that Ray-Ban Meta was probably going to sell three or five times more than the first version did. And we just dramatically underestimated what the, so now we're in this position where it's actually been somewhat hard for us to gauge what the real demand is because they're sold out. You can't get them. So if you can't get them, like, then how do you know where the actual curve is? We're basically getting to the point where that's resolved. Now we adjusted, we made the decision to build more manufacturing lines. They took some time to do it. They're online now. You know, it's not just about being able to make them, you need to get them into all the stores and get the distribution right. We feel like that's in a pretty good place now. So I'd say over the rest of this year, we're gonna start getting a real sense of the demand, but while that's going on, the glasses keep getting better because of over-the-air AI updates. So the hardware doesn't necessarily change, even though we keep shipping new frames and new type of, they're adding more transitions lenses because people wanna wear them indoors. And that's an interesting thing because I mean, people, sunglasses are a little more discretionary, so I think a lot more people early on were thinking, \"Hey, yeah, I'll experiment with this with sunglasses. I'm not gonna make these my primary glasses.\" Now we're seeing a lot more people say, \"Hey, this is actually really useful. I wanna be able to wear them inside. I want them to be my primary glasses.\" So whether that's working with them through the optical channel or the transitions, that's an important part. But the AI part of this is also, it just keeps getting better. I mean, we talked about it at Connect, I mean, basically, the ability to now, you know, for the next few months when we roll this out, real-time translations. You're traveling abroad, someone's speaking Spanish to you, you just get it translated into English in your ear or just roll out to more and more languages over time. I think we're starting with a few. We'll hit more over time. - I tried that, well, actually I didn't try real time, but I tried looking at a menu in French, and it translated into English. And then I was like, at the end I was like, \"What is Euro in Dollar actually?\" And it did that too. And then I'm also starting to see the continuum of this to Orion in the sense of the utility aspects. You could say, \"Look at this and remind me about it at 8:00 PM tonight,\" and then it syncs with the companion app. - Yeah, reminders is a new big thing. - So I guess, it's not replacing the phone, but it's augmenting what I would do with my phone. Like, how are these glasses going to be more deeply tied to Meta AI over time? It seems like they're getting closer and closer all the time, but- - Yeah. Well, I think Meta AI is becoming a more and more prominent feature of the glasses, right? There's more stuff that you can do. So you just mentioned reminders is another example. It's like now that is just gonna work, and now your glasses can remind you of things. And so, okay, that's awesome. - So you can look at a phone number and say, \"Call this phone number,\" and then it calls on the phone. - We'll just add more capabilities over time. And some of that are model updates, right? So, like, okay, now it has Llama 3.2, but some of it is software development around it. Like, reminders you don't get for free just because we updated the model. That's can we have this big software development effort? And we're adding features continuously and developing the ecosystem, right? So you get more apps. So, you know, Spotify and all these different things can work more natively. So the glasses just get more and more useful, which, I think, is also gonna create increased demand over time. And how does it interact with phones? I mean, like you said, I don't think people are getting rid of phones anytime soon. The way I think about this is that when phones became the primary computing platform, we didn't get rid of computers, we just shifted, right? So I don't know if you have this experience, but at some point in the early 2010s, I noticed that I'd be sitting at my desk in front of my computer and I'd just pull out my phone to do things. And I think what's gonna happen, it's not like we're gonna throw away our phones, but I think slowly we're just gonna start doing more things with our glasses and leaving our phones in our pockets more. And it's not like we're done with our computers, and I don't think we're gonna be done with our phones for a while, but there's a pretty clear path where you're just gonna use your glasses for more and more things. And over time, I think the glasses are also gonna be able to be powered by wrist-based wearables or other wearables. So you're gonna wake up one day 10 years from now, and you're not even gonna need to bring your phone with you. Now, you're still gonna have a phone, but I think, like, more of the time people are gonna leave it in their pocket or leave it in their bag or eventually even some of the time leave it at home. And I think there will just be this gradual shift to glasses becoming the main way that we do computing. - It's interesting that we're talking about this right now because I feel like phones are becoming boring and stale. You know, like, I just was, like, looking at the new iPhone, and it's basically the same as the year before. People are doing foldables, but, like, it feels like people have run out of ideas on phones and that they're at their natural end state, and I wonder, you know, when you see something like the Ray-Bans and how people have really gravitated to them in a way that's surprised you guys and I think surprised all of us, but it's also just, like, people want to interact with technology in different ways now. And I think AI, - Yeah. - like you said at the beginning, like, the way that AI is intersected with this is just like a aha thing for people that, honestly, for me, I didn't expect it to click as quickly as it did. But, like, when I got whitelisted for the AI, I was, like, walking around in my backyard and, like, using it, and I was like, \"Oh, like, it's obvious now where this is going.\" So it feels like we're, like I was saying at the beginning, it feels like things are finally, you can see it where it's going, whereas before, it's been a lot of, like, R and D and talking about it, but, like, these, the Ray-Bans are a signifier of that. And I'm wondering if you agree with that. - I agree. I mean, I still think it's early. I think you really want to be able to not just ask the AI questions, but ask it to do things and know that it's going to reliably go do it. And we're starting with simple things, right? So voice control of your glasses, although you can do that on phones too, things like reminders, although you can generally do that on phones too, but I think as the model capabilities grow over the next couple of generations and you get more of, you know, what people call these agentic capabilities, I think it's gonna start to get pretty exciting. For what it's worth, I also think that all the AI work is gonna make phones a lot more exciting. It's the most exciting thing I think that has happened to our family of apps roadmap in a long time, is all of the, all of the different AI things that we're building, so. You know, If I were trying to design what, you know, the next few versions of iPhone or Google's phone should be, I mean, I think that there's a long and interesting roadmap of things that they can go do with AI that, as an app developer, we can't. So I think that that's, like, a pretty exciting and interesting thing for them to go do, which I assume that they will. - On the AI social media piece, one of the wilder things that your team told me you guys are gonna start doing is showing people AI-generated imagery personalized to them in feed. I think it's starting as an experiment, but, like, if you're a photographer, you would see Meta AI generating content that's maybe personalized for you alongside content from the people you follow. - Yeah. - And it's this idea that I've been thinking about of AI and invading social media, so to speak, I mean, maybe you don't like the word invading, but you know what I mean. And what does that, what does that do to (chuckles) how we relate to each other as humans? Like, how much AI stuff and AI-generated stuff is going to be filling feeds in the near future in your view? - Well, here's how I come at this. So in the history of running the company, where we've been building these apps for 20 years, every, call it, three to five years, there's some new major format that comes along that is typically additive to the experience, right? So, you know, initially people updated their profiles, then they were able to post statuses, there were texts then links, and you got photos early on, then you added videos, then with mobile, basically, you know, Snap invented stories, the first version of that, and that became a pretty widely-used format. The whole version of short-form videos I think is a still ascendant format, but you basically, at each step along the way you want to, right, it's like you keep on making the system richer by having more different types of content that people can share and different ways to express themselves. And when you look out for the next 10 years of, okay, if this trend seems to happen where every three, five years, whatever the pace is, that there are new formats, I think given the pace of change in the tech industry, I think you'd bet that that continues or accelerates, and I think you'd bet that probably most of the new formats are going to be AI-connected in some way, given that that's the driving theme for the industry at this point. So given that set of assumptions, we're trying to understand what are the things that are most useful to people within that. There's one vein of this, which is helping people and creators make better content using AI, right? That, I think, is gonna be pretty clear, right? Just make it, like, super easy for, like, aspiring creators or advanced creators to make much better stuff than they would be able to otherwise. That can take the form out of, like, all right, like, my daughter is writing a book, and she wants it illustrated, and, like, we sit down together and work with Meta AI and Imagine to help her come up with images to illustrate it. It's like, okay, that's, like, a thing, that's, like, she didn't have the capability to do that before, she's not a graphic designer, but now she has that ability. I think that that's gonna be pretty cool. Then I think that there's a version where you have just this great diversity of AI agents that are as part of this system. And this I think is a big difference between our vision of AI and most of the other companies, is, yeah, we're building Meta AI as the main assistant that you can build that's equivalent to, you know, the singular assistant that may be, like, a Google or an open AI or different folks are building, but it's not really the main thing that we're doing. You know, our main vision is that we think that there are gonna be a lot of these, right? It's every business, all the hundreds of millions of small businesses. You know, just like they have a website and an email address and a social media account today, I think that they're all gonna have an AI that helps them interact with their customers in the future that does some combination of sales and customer support and all that. I think all the creators are basically gonna want some version of this that basically helps them interact with their community when they're just limited by they don't have enough hours in the day to interact with all the messages that are coming in, and they wanna make sure that they can show some love to people in their community. And those, I think, are just the two most obvious ones that even if we just did those, that's many hundreds of millions, but then there's gonna be all this more creative stuff that's UGC that people create for better, wilder use cases that they want. And our view is, okay, these are all gonna, like, live across these social networks and beyond. And I don't think that they should just be constrained to waiting until someone messages them, right? I think that they're gonna have their own profiles, they're gonna be creating content, people will be able to follow them if they want, you'll be able to comment on their stuff, they may be able to comment on your stuff if you're connected with them. I mean, there will obviously be different logic and rules, but that's one way that there's gonna be just a lot more AI participants in the broader social construct that we have. And then I think you get to the test that you mentioned, which is maybe the most abstract, which is just having the central Meta AI system directly generate content for you based on what we think is gonna be interesting to you and putting that in your feed. And on that, you know, I think that there's been this trend over time where the feeds started off as primarily and exclusively content from people you followed, friends. I guess it was friends early on, then it broadened out to, okay, you followed a set of friends and creators, and then it got to a point where the algorithm was good enough where we're actually showing you a lot of stuff that you're not following directly because, in some ways, that's a better way to show you more interesting stuff than only constraining it to things that you've chosen to follow. And I think the next logical jump on that is like, okay, we're showing you content from your friends and creators that you're following and creators that you're not following that are generating interesting things, and you just add onto that a layer of, okay, and we're also gonna show you content that's generated by an AI system that might be something that you're interested in. Now, how big do any of these segments get? I think it's really hard to know until you build them out over time. But it feels like it is a category in the world that's going to exist. And how big it gets is dependent on the execution and how good it is. - Why do you think it needs to exist as a new category? I'm still wrestling with why people wants this. I get the companionship stuff that Character AI and some startups have already shown there's, like, a market for, and you've talked about how Meta AI is already being used for role playing, but the big idea is that AI has been used to intermediate in feed how humans reach each other, and now all of a sudden AIs are gonna be in feeds with us. - Well, I think the main difference- - And that feels big. - Yeah, but in a lot of ways, the big change already happened, which is people getting content that they weren't following. And the definition of feeds and social interaction has changed very fundamentally in the last 10 years. Now in social systems, most of the direct interaction is happening in more private forums in messaging our groups. And this is one of the reasons, I think, why we were late with reels initially to competing with TikTok, is 'cause we hadn't made this mental shift where we felt like no feed is where you interact with people. Actually, increasingly, feed is becoming a place where you discover content that you then take to your private forums and interact with people there. So a lot of the way that I interact with people, it's like, yeah, I'll still have the thing where a friend will post something and I'll comment on it and engage directly in feed, again, this is additive, you're adding more over time, but the main way that you engage with reels isn't necessarily that, you know, you go into the reels comments and comment and talk to people you don't know, it's like you see something funny and you send it to friends in a group chat. And I think that that paradigm will absolutely continue with AI in all kinds of interesting content. So it is facilitating connections with people, but I think already we're in this mode where our connections through social media are shifting to more private places, and the role of feed in the ecosystem is more as a, you know, I call it a discovery engine of content, you know, of icebreakers or interesting topic starters for the conversations that you're having across this, like, broader spectrum of places where you're interacting. - Do you worry about people interacting with AIs like this making people less likely to talk to other people? Like it reducing the engagement that we have with humans? - The sociology that I've seen on this is that most people have way fewer friends physically than they would like to have. I think people cherish the human connection that they have, and the more we can do to make that feel more real and give you more reasons to connect, whether it's through something funny that shows up so you can message someone or a pair of glasses that lets, like, you know, your sister show up as a hologram in your living room when, you know, she lives across the country and you wouldn't be able to see her otherwise. Like, that's always our main bread and butter in the thing that we're doing, but, you know, in addition to that, I mean, if the, you know, the average person, I think, you know, maybe they'd like to have 10 friends, and I mean there's this stat that it's like, it's sad, but I think the average American feels like they have fewer than three, like, real close friends. So does this take away from that? My guess is no. I think that what's gonna happen is it's going to help give people more of the support that they need and give people more reasons and ability to connect with either a broader range of people or more deeply with the people that they care about. - Well, how are you feeling about how Threads is doing these days? - I mean, Threads' on fire, it's great. I mean, these things, it's like there's only so quickly that something can get to a billion people, so it's gonna, you know, we'll on pushing on it over, - I've heard it's still using Instagram a lot for growth. Like, I guess I'm wondering when do you see it getting to, like a standalone growth driver on its own? - I mean, I think that these things all connect to each other. So I don't, I mean, I think Threads helps Instagram, I think Instagram helps Threads. I don't know that we have some strategic goal, which is, like, make it so that Threads is completely disconnected from Instagram or Facebook. I actually think we're going the other direction. It started off just connected to Instagram and now we also connected it so that the content can show up. You know, taking a step back, I mean, we just talked about how, for most people, they're interacting in more private forums. If you're a creator, what you want to do is have your content show up everywhere, right, because you're trying to build the biggest community that you can in these different places. So it's this huge value for people if they can generate a reel or a video or some text-based content, and now you can post it in Threads, Instagram, Facebook, and more places over time. So I think the direction there is generally more flow, not less, and more interoperability. And that's why I've been pushing on that as a theme over time. - I'm not even sure what X is anymore, but I think what it used to be and what Twitter used to be was a place where you went when news was happening. I know you and the company seem to be distancing yourself from recommending news, but with Threads, it feels like that's what people want and people thought Threads might be, but it seems like you all are intentionally saying, \"We don't want Threads to actually be that.\" - Yeah, I mean it's interesting. There are different ways to look at this. I always looked at Twitter not as primarily about realtime news, but as a short form, primarily text-discussion-oriented app. To me, the fundamental defining aspect of that format is that when you make a post, the comments aren't subordinate to the post. The comments are at a peer level, and that is a very different architecture than every other type of social network that's out there. And it's a subtle difference, but within these systems, these subtle differences lead to a very different emerging behavior. So because of that, people can take, they can fork discussions, and it makes it a very good discussion-oriented platform. Now, news is one thing that people like discussing, but it's not the only thing. And I always looked at Twitter, and I was like, \"Hey, this is such a wasted opportunity.\" Like, \"This is clearly a billion-person app. You know, maybe in the modern day when you have multiple, like, many billions of people using social apps, it should be multiple billions of people.\" And for whatever reason, I mean, there were a lot of things that have been complicated about Twitter and the corporate structure and all that, but they just weren't quite getting there, and eventually, you know, I thought, \"Hey, I think we can do this,\" right? \"I think we can get this, like, build out the discussion platform in a way that can get to a billion people and be more of a ubiquitous social platform that I think achieves the fullness of what it, like, its full potential,\" but our version of this is we want it to be a kinder place, right? We don't want it to start with the, like, direct head-to-head combat of news and especially politics. And- - Do you feel like that constrains the growth of the product at all? - I mean, I think we'll see. We'll run the experiment. - That needs to exist in the world 'cause I feel like with X's seeming implosion, it's not really existing anymore. Maybe I'm biased as someone in the media, but I do think, I do think people want, when something big happens in the world, they want an app that they can go to and see everyone that they follow talking about it immediately. - Yeah, well- - There's not an immediacy. - We're not the only company. I mean, there are, like, a ton of different competitors and different companies doing things, and I mean, I think that there's a talented team over at Twitter and X, so I wouldn't write them off. You know, now, obviously, there's all these other folks. There's a lot of startups that are doing stuff. So I don't feel like we have to go at that first. I think that, like, maybe we get there over time or maybe we decide that it's enough of a zero sum trade or maybe even a negative sum trade, where, like, that use case should exist somewhere, but maybe that use case prevents a lot more usage and a lot more value in other places because it makes it a somewhat less friendly place. And I don't think we know the answer to that yet, but I do think the last 10 years, 8 years of our experience has been that the political discourse, it's tricky, right? It's, on the one hand, it's obviously a very important thing in society, and on the other hand, I don't think it leaves people feeling good. So I'm torn between these two values. On the one hand, I think, like, people should be able to have this open discourse, and that's good, on the other hand, I don't wanna design a product that makes people angry, right? It's like, I mean, is, like, there's an informational lens for looking at this and there's a you're designing a product and, like, what's the feel of the product, right? It's like I think anyone who's designing a product cares a lot about how the thing feels, and, - But you recognize the importance of that discussion happening in the world. - I think it's useful. And look, we don't block it, you know, we just make it so that, you know, for the content where you're following people, if you wanna talk to your friends about it, if you wanna talk to them about it in messaging, there can be groups about it, if you follow people, it can show up in your feed, but we don't go out of our way to recommend that content when you're not following it. And I think that that has been a healthy balance for us and for getting our products to generally feel the way that we want. And, you know, culture changes over time. Maybe the stuff will be, like, a little bit less polarized and anger-inducing at some point, and maybe it'll be possible to have more of that while also at the same time having a product where we're proud of how it feels. But until then, I think we wanna design a product that, yeah, people can get the things that they want, but, you know, fundamentally, I care a lot about how people feel coming away from the products. - Do you see this decision to down rank political content for people who aren't being followed in feed as a political decision, I guess? Because I don't know. You're also, at the same time, you know, not really saying much about the election this year, you're not donating, you've said you wanna stay out of it now. And I see the way the company's acting, and it reflects your personal way you're operating right now. And I'm wondering, like, how much more of it is also about what you and the company have gone through and the political environment and not necessarily just what users are telling you? - Sure. - [Alex] Like, is there a through line there? - I mean, I'm sure it's all connected. I think in this case it wasn't a trade off between those two things because this actually was what our community was telling us. And people were saying, generally, \"We don't want so much politics.\" Like, you know, like, \"We don't feel good.\" Like, \"We want,\" like, \"We want content, we want more stuff from our friends and family, we want more stuff from our interests.\" So that was the primary driver. But I think it's definitely the case that our corporate experience on this shape this. And there's a big difference between something being political and being partisan. And the main thing that I care about is making sure that we can be seen as a non-partisan, and, you know, as much as something can in the world in 2024, be like a trusted institution by as many people as possible. And I just think that the partisan politics is so tough in the world right now that I've made the decision that I feel like for me and for the company, best thing to do is to try to be as non-partisan as possible in all of this and be as neutral and distance ourselves as much as possible. And it's not just the substance, I also think the perception matters. So I think, so that's why, you know, and maybe, it doesn't matter on our platforms whether I endorse a candidate or not, but, like, I don't even, I don't want to go anywhere near that. And yeah, sure, I mean, you could say that's a political strategy, but I think it's, I think for where we are in the world today, it's very hard. Almost every institution has become partisan in some way, and we are just trying to resist that. And maybe I am too naive and maybe that's impossible, but we're gonna try to do that. - On the Acquired podcast recently you said that the political miscalculation was a 20 year mistake- - Yeah, from a brand- - from a brand perspective, and it was gonna take another 10 or so for you to fully work through that cycle. - [Mark] Yeah. Yeah. - What makes you think it's such a lasting thing? 'Cause you look at, like, how you, personally, have evolved over the last couple years, and I think perception of the company has evolved, and I'm wondering, like, what you meant by saying, \"It's gonna take another 10 years.\" - I'm just talking about where our brand is and our reputation are compared to where I think they would've been. I mean, there's no doubt that even now here in, okay, yeah, sure, maybe things have improved somewhat over the last few years, you can feel the trend, but it's still significantly worse than it was in 2016. You know, it's, I mean, the internet industry overall, and I think our company in particular just were seen way more positively. And now look, there were real issues, right? So I think that it's always very difficult to talk about this stuff in a nuanced way because I think to some degree before 2016 everyone was too rosy about the internet overall and didn't talk enough about the issues, and then the pendulum swung and people only talked about the issues and didn't talk about the stuff that was positive, and it was all both there the whole time. So when I talk about this, I don't mean to, you know, come across as simplistic or- - Like you guys didn't do anything wrong or anything like that. - Or that there weren't issues with the internet or things like that. I mean, obviously every year, you know, whether it's politics or other things, there are always things that you look back at, and you're like, \"Hey, yeah, like, if I were playing this perfectly, I would've done these things differently.\" But I do think it's the case that I didn't really know how to react to something as big of a shift in the world as what happened. And it took me a while to find my footing. And I do think that it's tricky when you're caught up in these kind of big debates and you're not experienced or sophisticated in engaging with that. I think you can make some big missteps. And I do think that some of the things that we were accused of over time, you know, I think it's just been pretty clear at this point, you know, now that all the investigations have been done, that, like, they weren't true. - You're talking about, like, Cambridge Analytica, all that. - I think Cambridge Analytica is a good example of something that it's, like, people thought that, like, all this data had been taken and that it had been used in this campaign and- - It turns out it wasn't used. - it turned out that, like, it wasn't and, like, yeah. So it's, like, all the stuff, okay? And, like, the data wasn't even, you know, accessible to the developer and we'd fix the issue, like, five years ago, so. But in the moment, it was, like, really hard for us to have a rational discussion about that. And part of the challenge is that, you know, for the general population, I think a lot of people, they read the initial headlines, and they don't necessarily read the, and frankly, you know, a lot of the media I don't think was, like, as loud to write about when all the investigations concluded that said that there weren't, that, like, a lot of the initial allegations were just completely wrong. So I think that that's, like, a, that's a real thing. So, okay, so you take these hits, and I didn't really know how to push back on that, and maybe some of it you can't, but I like to think that, I think we could have played some of this stuff differently. And I do think it was certainly the case that when you take responsibility for things that are not your fault, you become a weak target for people who are looking to blame other things and find a target for them. And it's like, this is a different part of, it's somewhere related to this, but when you think about, like, like, litigation strategy for the company, one of the reason why I hate settling lawsuits is that it basically sends a signal to people that, \"Hey, this is a company that settles lawsuits, so maybe, like, we can sue them and they'll settle lawsuits,\" so. - So you wouldn't write a blank check to the government like Google did for its antitrust case? - No, I think, I think the right kind of way to approach this is when you believe in something, you fight really hard for it. And I think this is a repeat game. This isn't like, it's not like there's a single issue, and we're gonna be around for a long time. And I think it's really important that people know that we're a company that has conviction and that we believe in what we're doing and we're gonna back that up and defend ourselves. And I think that that sets the right tone. Now, I think over the next 10 years, I think we're digging ourselves back to neutral on this, but I like to think that if we hadn't had a lot of these issues, we would've made progress over the last 10 years too. So I give it this timeframe. Maybe 20 years is too long, maybe it's 15. But it's hard to know with politics. - It feels like mental health and youth mental health may be the next wave of this. - That, I think, is the next big fight. And on that, you know, I think a lot of the data on this I think is just not where the narrative is. - Really? - The narrative, yeah. I think the narrative is a lot of people take it as if it's, like, an assumed thing that there's some link and, like, I think the majority of the high-quality research that's out there suggests that there's no causal connection at, like, a broad scale between these things, so. Now look, I mean, I think that that's different from saying like, in any given issue, like is someone bullied? Should we try to stop bullying? Yeah, of course. But yeah, overall, I think that this is one where there are a bunch of these cases. I think that there will be a lot of litigation around them. And it's one where we are trying to make sure that the academic research that shows something that I think is, you know, you know, to me it foots more with what I've seen of how the platforms operate, but it's counter to what a lot of people think. And I think that that's gonna be a reckoning that we'll have to have, is, basically, when as the majority of the high-quality academic research gets shown is like, \"Okay, can people accept this?\" And I think that's gonna be a really important set of debates over the next few years. - At the same time, you guys have acknowledged there's affordances in the product like the teen rollout with Instagram recently- - Oh yeah. Yeah. - that you can make to make the product a better experience for young people. - Yeah, and I think this is an interesting part of the balance, is you can play a role in trying to make something better even if the thing wasn't caused by you in the first place. Like, there's no doubt that being a parent is really hard. And there's a big question of in this internet age where we have phones, what are the right tools that parents need in order to be able to raise their kids? And, like, I think that we can play a role in giving people controls over, parental controls over the apps. I think the parental controls are also really important because parents have different ways that they wanna raise their kids. Or just like schooling and education, people have, like, very significantly different local preferences for how they wanna raise their kids. I don't think that most people want some internet company setting all the rules for this either. So obviously, you know, when there are laws passed, we'll follow the government's direction and the laws on that, but I actually think the right approach for us is to primarily align with parents to give them the tools that they want to be able to raise their kids in the way that they want. And some people are gonna think that more technology use is good. That's how my parents, you know, raised me growing up. I think it worked pretty well. Some people are gonna be more, you know, want to limit it more, and we wanna give them the tools to be able to do that. But I don't think that this is, you know, primarily or only a social media thing. Even the parts of this that are technology- - Age verification? - I think phones, like, the phone platforms have a huge part of this. I mean, it's, yeah, I mean, there's this big question of how do you do age verification? And I mean, I can tell you what the easiest way is, which is, like, all right, like, every time you go do a payment on your phone, I mean, there already is child, you know, basically, like, child age verification. So I don't really understand, well, I guess I understand, but I think it's not very, you know, excusable from my perspective, why Apple and, I guess, to some extent Google don't wanna just extend the age verification that they already have on their phones to be a parental control for parents to, basically, be able to say, you know, \"What apps can my kids use,\" right? - It's hard for me to not see the logic in it either. - Well- - I don't really- - I think they don't- understand it. - wanna take responsibility, - But maybe that's on congress then to pass who has to take responsibility. - Yeah. - Yeah. - And we're gonna do our part, and we're gonna build the tools that we can for parents and for teens, but at the end of the day, and look, I'm not saying it's all the phone's fault either, although I would say that, like, the ability to get push notifications and get distracted is, from my perspective, seems like a much greater contributor to mental health issues than a lot of the specific apps. But there are things that I think everyone should try to improve and work on. But yeah, I mean, that's my view on all that. - On the regulation piece, as it relates to AI, you've been very vocal about what's happening in the EU, and you recently signed an open letter, and I believe it was saying, basically, that you guys just don't have clarity on consent for training, how it's supposed to work, and I'm wondering what you think needs to happen there for things to move forward. 'Cause, like, Meta AI is not available in Europe, new Llama models or not. Is that something you see getting resolved at all (chuckles) I guess, and what would it take? - Yeah. I don't know. It's a little hard for me to parse the European politics. I have a hard time enough with American politics. I mean, I'm American, but so in theory, my understanding of the way this is supposed to work is they passed this GDPR regulation, and you're supposed to have this idea of a one-stop-shop, like, home regulator who can, basically, on behalf of the whole EU, interpret and enforce the rules. And we have our European headquarters, and we work with that regulator, and, you know, I think they're, like, okay, they're pretty tough on us and pretty firm, but at least when you're working with one regulator, you can understand how are they thinking about things and you can make progress. And the thing that I think has been tricky is there have been, from my perspective, a little bit of a backslide, where now you get all these other DPAs across the continent also intervening and trying to do things, and it just seems like more of an internal EU political thing, which is like, okay, do they want to have this one-stop-shop and have clarity for companies so companies can execute, or do they just want it to be this very complicated regulatory system? And look, I think that's for them to sort out. But I think that there's no doubt that when you have, like, dozens of different regulators that can ask you the same questions about different things, it makes it a much more difficult environment to build things. I don't think that's just us, I think that that's all the companies. - But do you understand the concern people have about training data and creators even? And this idea that their data is being used for these models, they're not getting compensated and the models are creating a lot of value. And I know you're away Llama, but you've got Meta AI, and I understand the frustration that people have about that. I think it's a naturally bad feeling to be like, \"Oh, my data is now being used in a new way that I have no control or compensation over.\" Do you sympathize with that? - Yeah. I mean, I think that there, in any new medium in technology, there's, like, the concepts around fair use and, like, where are the boundaries between what you have control over, right? When you put something out in the world, to what degree do you still get to control it and own it and license it? And I think that all these things are basically gonna need to get, you know, re-litigated and re-discussed in the AI era. So I mean, I get it. I think that these are important questions. I think this is not like a completely novel thing to AI in the grand scheme of things. I think it was, you know, a lot of them, there were questions about it with the internet overall too and with different technologies over time. But I think getting to clarity on that is gonna be important so that way the things that society wants people to build, they can go build. - What does clarity look like to you there? - I mean, I think it starts with having some framework of, like, okay, what's the process gonna be for working through that? - Mm. - Yeah. - But you don't see a scenario where creators get, like, directly compensated for the use of their content and models? - I think that there's a lot of different possibilities for how stuff goes in the future. Now, I do think that there's this issue, which is a lot, like, while psychologically I understand what you're saying, I think individual creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content, right? So it's, like, okay, maybe, like, like, in the grand scheme of this, right? - [Alex] Yeah, that's fair. - So we have this set of challenges with, you know, news publishers around the world, which is, like, okay, like, a lot of folks are constantly asking to be paid for the content, and on the other hand, we have our community which is asking us to show less news because it makes them feel bad, right? And I mean, we talked about that. So it's, like, there's this issue which is, okay, it's, like, actually we're showing some amount of the news that we're showing because we think it's socially important against what our community wants. Like, if we were actually just following what our community wants, we'd show even less than we're showing. - And you see that in the data, that people just don't like to engage with this stuff. - Yeah, yeah. And we've had these issues where sometimes we, like, publishers say, \"Okay, if you're not gonna pay us, then pull our content down.\" And it's just like, \"Yeah, sure, fine. Pull your content down.\" I mean, that sucks. I'd rather people be able to share it, but I think to some degree, some of these questions have to get tested by, they're negotiations, and they have to get tested by people walking. And then at the end, once people walk, you figure out where the value really is, right? If it really is the case that news was a big thing that the community wanted, then, I mean, look, we're a big company. We could, you know, we could probably, you know, we pay for content when it's valuable to people, we're just not gonna pay for content when it's not valuable to people. So I think that you'll probably see a similar dynamic with AI, which is my guess is that there are gonna be certain partnerships that get made when content is really important and valuable. And I guess that there's probably a lot of people who have a concern about, like, the feel of it, like you're saying, but then when push comes to shove, like, if they demanded that we take, that we don't use their content, then we just wouldn't use their content. And it's not like, you know, that's gonna change the outcome of this stuff that much. - I guess to bring this full circle where we started, as you're building augmented reality glasses and what you've learned over just the societal implications of the stuff you've built over the last decade, how are you thinking about this as it relates to glasses at scale? Because you're literally gonna be augmenting reality, which is a, it's a responsibility. - I think that's gonna be another platform too. And you're gonna have a lot of these questions as well. I mean, I think the interesting thing about holograms and augmented reality is it's gonna be this intermingling of the physical and digital much more than we've had in other platforms, where on your phone it's like, okay, yeah, we live a primarily physical world, but then you have this small window into this digital world, and I think we're gonna basically have this world in the future that is increasingly, you know, call it half physical, half digital, or, I don't know, 60% physical, 40% digital. And it's like, and it's gonna be blended together. And I think that there are gonna be a lot of interesting governance questions around that, right, in terms of, like, is all of the digital stuff that's overlayed physically gonna fit within a physical national regulation perspective? Or is it, is it actually coming from a different world or something, you know? And I think that these will all be very interesting questions that we will have a perspective. I'm sure we're not gonna be right about every single thing. I think, like, the world will need to sort out where it wants to be. Different countries will have different values and take somewhat different approaches on things. And I think that that's, it's part of the interesting process of this, that the tapestry of how it all gets built is you need to work through so that it ends up being positive for, you know, as many of the possible stakeholders as possible. - More to come, yeah. - A lot to come. - Yeah, thanks Mark. - Yeah. Pretty cool. - Nice. Good game. - Good game. You have an unfair advantage, but that's alright. - [Mark] I played a few more. (Alex laughs) - Cool. Are we good?",

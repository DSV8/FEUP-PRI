We ended up doing a quick and fun little experiment before the RX 5700 review by using AMD's own public performance numbers to see how things MIGHT line up.  But we'll know how accurate these projections are in a few days.  ;)    Buy items in this video from Amazon at the links below:  Dark Rock Slim:    Subscribe    Review unit provided free of charge by NVIDIA and AMD.

    "transcript": "so just yesterday we published our rtx super review and if you're interested in learning more you can check it out right over here but in it we actually have a difficult time coming up with a conclusion because we didn't know how good the AMD rx 5700 series would compete against invidious new GPUs but with all of yesterday's benchmarks done could we accurately predict where the RX 5700 XT and the RX 5700 would land in comparison to the RTX 2070 super and the RTX 2060 super did Nvidia get their older GPUs out of trouble just in time or does AMD now have a serious problem well it turns out Aimee did publish some pretty specific performance numbers at e3 and that might lead to some interesting comparison but more on that right after a quick message from our sponsor the newbie quiet dark rock slim cooler offers high physical clearance for any memory module thanks to its slim heatsink and the low profile 120 mil airflow optimized fan so you get great cooling low noise easy installation and no issues for high profile Ram check it out below alright so I'm gonna start things off by making something very very clear you should not take this as a scientifically accurate video and you should definitely not use this for any purchasing decisions in fact this whole video started as a pretty interesting test or pretty fun little test to see how accurate and easy three presentation was but now with the new RTX super cards around we might be able to use Amy's own numbers to estimate how well the RX 5700 series would compete when they finally launch next week so let's start with what AMD showed it was this chart for the rx 5700 which showed a two to 21% advantage over the founders Edition RTX 2060 and this one had everything from a three percent loss to a 22 percent gain when the RX 3700 XT was compared against the founders edition RTX 2070 those are pretty impressive numbers too I want to pause here for a bit because thought these ten games are the ones we use in our own benchmarking process while Far Cry New Dawn has nearly identical performance results s55 since it uses the same game engine now that got Mike and I thinking about how they would line up against the benchmarks we used in the super series video from yesterday so basically use those percentages and extrapolate from our results right well you guys can hate as much as you want on this but it would be really cool to see how the numbers would line up when we post our full reviews of the RX 3700 series so before we get into what we came up with let me explain to you why this is a you know quick and fun alone comparison that we wanted to try rather than being super serious get it super serious I don't know I don't know if that was a bad joke but first of all according to AMD's testing notes they used a stock 9900 can and we used an overclocked 9900 ex to eliminate any CPU bottlenecks but luckily these games on CPU limited at 1440p resolution we also have no idea which scenes AMD chose to benchmark with yet improvements are usually seen across the entire game and not just a single scene but then there's this which mysteriously says best performing API for both GPUs and to us that means each game comparison could have been mixed DX 90 X 11 or DX 12 results which is super odd and a bit misleading finally we decided to include the RTX 2070 founders Edition but not the RTX 2060 founders Edition and that's because the 2060 founders is in pre overclocked so I just used a stock RTX 2060 in this place plus we know how AMD used founders edition GPUs since they mentioned it in a PC world live stream last week but let's get into what we found starting with assassin's creed the supers actually do improve quite a bit and adding D 2% improvements for the 5700 and the XT doesn't really change things by all that much then again moving to Battlefield 5 tells a whole different story here Nvidia shows some pretty good improvements with the super cards but add in the 5700 series and o amd's claiming 22% and 21% improvements for the XT and the non XT cards over the founders editions and that's huge especially since these two cards cost less than it is Super Series on the surface of things the supers do well in Far Cry 5 but add the five and twelve percent stated by Amy's presentation and they're still trailing the rtx 2070 and 2060 Super but really not by all that much which is likely why Nvidia price their GPUs so close metro Exodus is a pretty interesting title too since it is an Nvidia friendly title but man AMD claims of between 15 to 16 percent improvements over the original rtx 2070 and 2060 and that seems really impressive right here shadow the Tomb Raider is actually an interesting one here since AMD was pretty open about showing the RX 5700 XT losing by 3% and the 5700 winning by 6% pop in those into our chart and this is what you get I won't make any conclusions but like I said it's nice to see a company admitting where some up improvements are needed finally there's Witcher 3 which hasn't been a really kind title for AMD since the beginning but it's still an awesome game and again the AMD cards slide right in between the Super Series but imagine if those cards wouldn't have launched Nvidia could have been in some trouble so looking at the results they should give you at least a vague idea on how md claims there RX 5700 Series GPUs would stack up against the RTX super cards now as I mentioned at the very beginning of this video please do take these unscientific results with a grain of salt and I'm completely aware that will get hate from both sides but heck I think that this was a pretty cool comparison either way now what I'm really looking forward to seeing is how these numbers would turn out into reality when the 5700 XT and the 5700 reviews get published next week some stoked for that but based on all of this it's possible that Nvidia may have been a bit too conservative with the super series pricing maybe all they did was to avoid the rx 5700 series rather than competing with it but that could also mean that AMD is in a pretty good position personally I think the most important aspect is the way T online app has finally been able to achieve good results against the RTX series at similar power consumption numbers remember the RTX 5700 XT has a board power of 2 25 watts and the 5700 has 185 however Nvidia needed to really push their 12 nanometer process here with the RTX 2070 super at 215 watts and the 2060 super at 175 watts so should AMD be worried well if we use their benchmark numbers absolutely not but we're just have to wait or hold our breath for just a bit longer so that we could paint the whole picture as to what both teams are offering especially for the price points and we'll have scientific results to prove that so let me know what you guys think about this little quick comparison a pretty fun one actually in the comments I'm curious to know I'm me both harken acts thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe for some cool content coming the pipeline and I'll see you guys in the next one",

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video and today I'm checking out something that I've been looking for in life for a very long time. A simple, easy, fast way to get quality images and video off of one of these guys, a DSLR. And I got all this camera gear here, I get like... ...got these kind of things, lying around, and yet I'm like sizing it up with my phone. Why? Just because it's easier to share from there. Only thing holding back, snapping a quick frame with something of a completely different caliber is getting that data off. Well that is what the CS100 from Canon is meant to do. They got in touch with me, they're like \"Hey Lou, we got this thing called the Connect Station, it has the ability to send and receive images, it can do photos or videos, it has NFC built-in...\" If that's what I am most excited for, plus it's got one terabyte of storage inside of it, and then at the same time this guy hooks up to your television so you can actually show people... Drop the camera on, transfer starts up... Booyah! So, power cable, power brick... Camera-related unboxing videos, these are classic. This is- I came up on this stuff... Little nighttime reading... A remote as well, a little photo-video DJ... Jack, you ever have anybody over...? You're all invited. Jack's house. You've got this directional pad, a button in the center, back, menu, home and power. Where you at... Oh... Well then... Here's the NFC spot, that's where we're going to tap and go... See, there's a little door, an SD card slot and even a CF card slot. On the back is all your I/O. You've got power, HDMI, there is a network connector if you want to go hard wired... And then a USB port. Look at that! The device is now set up... It's time for the magic, that I'm looking for. NFC, touch to transfer... just a little touch. \"This magic moment... ...when your lips are close to mine.\" Oh! Woah... Cool! Look at this, just instantly! I didn't press anything, I just enabled Wi-Fi on the camera, and then tapped it. Well, we're shooting a video... Backing it up is step one, like, get it somewhere else, but people don't look at their own photos that way. You think they're safe because they're on this single SD card - not even close. That's the quickest, easiest way I've seen to just get 'em... get 'em off your camera. Okay, look, it's done now. New images received, our images, folder over here... And again you'd just be sitting on the couch... ...showin' people what's been going on with your life. Look at that, you're taking pictures of remote controls... This is what Jack looks like... you guys have been wondering what he looks like? That's what he looks like. He's a happy guy, what can I say... You can play slide shows, you could put music to those slideshows... You can go ahead and send these to social media, directly from the device... This is the ability to attach any social media platform, or at least this list right here, and I can share directly from the unit now. I have registered a few different services now... Share images online... And from here I can pick my service of choice. I'm gonna do Google Drive... ...and send it up. I go to my drive, I see a folder. I see a picture of Jack attack! Doo doo doo! All of a sudden there is a little workflow forming. So, you snap a photo with the real camera, but it ends up in a phone world, which is something I've wanted for a very long time. You get a lot more creative with your photos, but still share them. That is the idea. DSLR, CS100, you might just become an Instagram champion. This is not boring luggage, this is the next level. This is for the tech heads, this is for you guys...",

    "transcript": "Galaxy S6 Active vs Slapshot! Whats up guys, Lew here back with another video for awesome stuff week and today we are gonna be talking about this. My Galaxy s6 Active. You've probably seen this on the channel previously. It's the phone that's been in my pocket ever since, I got my hands on it so today I wanted to step things up a little bit and do a durability test and find out just how tough it is I think I've got the perfect idea we're out here on the ice testing out the galaxy s6 active finding out just how active it is gonna beat it up a little bit start by passing it around yeah ok arrived it was test one passing no problem really we're going to take it a step further what about it water want to shoot yeah yeah got a lot more planned for this guy let's pick it up a notch ok oh it's completely fine did not expect that no way twice people twice in a row to slap shots off the blade then off the boards and not a mark on it alright i guess it's time to move on to a proper scrimmage ok see this phone has seen better days this one hit a post a lot to ask your smartphone of course we wouldn't expect it to survive in case you're wondering with a smartphone might look like after hitting a hockey post you got it right this yeah so there you have it the results hard to say i'm surprised about the devices that ended up smashed after all we're playing full on hockey they were a substitute for a puck they hit posts they got smashed the one in the middle I am impressed with this is the one that dealt with the passing tests and maybe more impressively the slap shot test twice full blast didn't expect that to happen anyways there you have it hope you enjoyed it don't try this at home thanks very much for watching check out youtube.com slash awesome stuff week for more awesome videos and also a big thanks to the entire squad out here later guys yeah",

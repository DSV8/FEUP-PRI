    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is. We Were Wrong! - Oh! My big brain can't handle it. The internet constantly, Constantly! Is trying to tell us how the PS5 Pro exists, is a real console, and to that I say, \"Ha!\" - Ha! - Ha ha! (cartoonish crashing) - The breaking news on Twitter is that the PS5 Pro is in development and it'll be out late 2024. However, it's gonna be out after the detachable disc version. - The Slim. - A.k.a. The Slim. - The way I understand this, if I were to give a semblance of credence to random Twitter rumors, which I do not, would be that this year, sometime middle or end of this year, we will see a PS5 Slim, and essentially just giving you the ability to get a slightly more efficient, slightly cheaper. PS5, a.k.a. like what PlayStation has done every single generation since the PlayStation One came out - I'm gonna say it'll 20 bucks cheaper than what it used to be. I think it's gonna be $379 for The Slim. - Or you could just 400 bucks and (beep) gamers. I think that's probably what Sony. - That does sound like Sony. - That's the rumor that that's gonna come out this year, and this new rumor is that there'll be a new upgraded PS5 Pro launching end of next year, so one year after The Slim. Do you wanna try to tell me with a straight face why this is gonna happen so I can laugh and make fun of it and explain why it's not gonna happen? - Money? (dial-up internet beeps) Dammit, okay, that's a good point. - There's so many things that we talk about like why this wouldn't happen? Why it would happen? - But why does it need to happen? - Oh, I'm not gonna, I cannot with a straight face tell you that it needs to happen, but I can tell you it's gonna happen whether you like it or not. You know the same people who went out and bought a whole bunch of PS5s, guess what? They're gonna go and buy a PS5 Pro. - Are they, though? - Yeah! - The PS5 is so new. I understand the logic that's in the 2013-2016 timeframe which is basically the difference between when the PS4 came out and the PS4 Slim and Pro came out. So naturally the internet it goes, \"Well, it's been three years. Where's my PS5 Pro, Mr. Sony?\" - I think by going with the PS5 Pro. They are not targeting the people who've got a PS5. They're targeting the holdout who are still sitting on a PS4, and when the PS5 Pro comes out that's when we officially are gonna stop seeing anything coming for PS4. - For the PS5 I completely know and believe that Sony is looking at the tens of millions of PS4 owners who have not yet upgraded to a PS5 and they go, \"Mama won.\" (dramatic booming) - So you gotta play the 5D Chess, okay? You're over here - PlayStation 5D Chess? (both laughs) - You're sitting here playing checkers, and I'm playing chess with a device. Alright? so here's what happens, So they use this as the catalyst. PS5 Pro comes out, they use this to catalyst, hard stop, no new content coming to PlayStation. Your PlayStation 4 is now officially obsolete. - Sure. - If you want to continue being a gamer, you need to get on the current generation. - All PS4s self-destruct immediately. Got it. - They're gonna have their $700 PS5 Pro. - Which it would be. Of course it would be. - It's gonna be pricey. But a lot of people are gonna say, \"I don't really care about ray tracing, and I don't wanna spend $700.\" But you know what? this regular PS5, which is suddenly looking a lot more promising, and now they have a hundred million PS4s out in the wild that need to be replaced. But the PS5 Pro is the catalyst that will get this whole thing started. - So while I'm going to state, as clearly as possible for the record, I do not think there will be a PS5 Pro this generation. I do not think it will exist. Period. Full stop. However, - Like can subscribe for when we do the Austin was wrong video - I will, no I will. - Aaron, you can write a note right now, I will make a apology video if the PS5 Pro actually comes out, But, if there is a PS5 Pro, I think there is an argument to be made, right? So if I put down my biased hat of don't think that this thing is ever gonna exist, the PS5 Pro has to be more expensive, right? I don't think there's a scenario in which we get a $500 PS5 Pro, much more expensive than the current PS5, I think is a complete no-brainer just based on what they would need to do to really make this a full step up. Normally I would say that's crazy, but guess what? Sony has two years of data of people paying way over retail for PS5s to know that people will and have paid six, seven hundred dollars for the PS5s already, right? So there's clearly an audience of people who want the best PlayStation out there. - So they got to test the market without being the bad guys because scalpers were the bad guys. - Exactly. - And now if they come back and say, \" Oh, you guys were willing to pay this, and we're giving you a better console.\" Suddenly Sony is the white knight. - So, are you familiar with the term, the halo effect? Not like Halo rings or master sheiks. It's something that's very common in the car industry. So, take Acura for example; Acura are the makers of a lot of semi-luxury vehicles that are generally okay, but, for a time, they sold the NSX, a very expensive, very high-end supercar, that lost them literally probably like billions of dollars, right? Like, it was an incredibly expensive undertaking. What they do is they create this sort of aspirational brand, this vehicle that is so much better, and you think about that, and then you go and you're buy yourself a Chevy Cobalt or whatever nonsense is there, right? Like, it's to get you in the door before you buy the regular thing. They can make a PS5 Pro at 700 bucks to make that four or five hundred dollar PS5 look like a great deal. - All the console numbers, a lot of Sony ponies are like, \"Look how many consoles they sold.\" None of that matters because they weren't making money on 'em until very recently. - And they're obviously, the larger that PS5 base is, the more games they're gonna sell, the more subscriptions, the more services. Now, I'm gonna throw another thing, and again, I know I am basically exclusively arguing against my own opinion here for the thought process for the experiment, right? I'm gonna go through it, right? The other reason why I could see Sony doing a PS5 Pro is to really stick it to Microsoft, right? Hear me out here for a second, right? - Remember last generation where Sony brought out the PS4 Pro, the PS4 was already better than the Xbox One. Like, just straight up, it was just better. You know what happened? Right after that, a year later, Microsoft brought out the Xbox One X which was more powerful, ran games at higher frame rates et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And while it did not certainly just make everyone ditch their PS4s, they made the enthusiast realize, \"Oh, you know what? The most powerful console is actually an Xbox.\" Right? And while that was not by any means a be-all, end-all, that was a major reason why Xbox was starting to claw back to, you know, some kind of semblance of their former glory. I would posit to this to you, right? The PS5 and the Xbox Series X, essentially the same. There are some games that certainly will work a little bit better on one, but like almost universally, the PS5 and the Xbox Series X are pretty interchangeable as far as performance, games and whatnot, but Xbox played a little bit of a blind draw on Sony's generation by bringing out the Series S, a lower end version, and while I'm sure that Sony probably briefly considered it, they, I don't think, can pull off a lower end version of the console, right? Like once you bring out the base level you can't start bringing games that are lower - well, it's also like the, - You bring out games are higher 'cause you that performance. - It's also the type of games that you come to expect from, Sony games are like some of the highest fidelity games on the market. - You can't make \"The Last of Us\" part three or whatever that was down-ported to the PS4 Mini, right? Microsoft were smart, they did this at the very beginning. So, if you're building a Series game, whether it's for Series S or Series X, you've gotta keep both of those in mind, right? Whereas, if they brought out a PS5 Mini today that was going head-to-head with a Series S, none of the PS5 games would be able to be compatible if they had to lower the performance, right? What Sony can do, and my real argument for why this would be an actual possibility, they would bring out a PS5 Pro to say, \"Hey, look, we now have the world's most powerful console. We've got, you know, much better ray tracing.\" 'Cause again, what we're looking at here is RDNA two based consoles. Which is still a very recent sort of GPU architecture, but the main downside to it is that this is sort of the weakest kind of ray tracing and limitation that you can get your hands on right now. If they go up a generation maybe even up two generations, you're gonna get, not only more performance and more 4K and 120 Hertz, et cetera, et cetera. - Yeah, We'll finally get like, if they're going to RDNA three? - Three or four. I would say four, if this is next year, I would say four is pretty reasonable. - So are we gonna start to see console ship with display port? I would say option, not the, like I think it'd be both display port and HDMI - Kinda like how old-school consoles had like two outputs like visual and analog. - Because we don't have an HDMI standard that can keep up with what gamers would want in 8k. - That is actually one of the biggest reasons why I don't think PS5 Pro is going to happen, right? Yes, Sony could do this, it's absolutely possible, and they may have the incentive. Honestly, I can't argue that Sony aren't looking at this and think, \"You know what? We should probably do this if nothing else, to have the halo effect and to have the world's most powerful console.\" But where I think it starts to fall apart. last generation, we had a great bit of marketing which was 4k. Previously, the Xbox One and the PS4 really only did 1080p and even sometimes below that, but with the PS4 Pro, they were able to not always hit 4k, but they were still able to go like 1440p, upscaling it to 4k. It was a very clear value proposition, but I guarantee you, PS5 Pro, even if you say let's say it's got double the GPU performance, right? Let's just throw it out there. Let's say it's twice as powerful, and say it's got four times the ray tracing capability; you throw that at a console and you call it the PS5 Pro, you can slap an 8K badge out on all you want. You can say that if you look at those two consoles side by side, I will bet you that the average person's gonna see a fairly small difference. Not to say - But they - Hold on, wait, wait hang on. - wait no, no, no. - I'm not saying. - You're thinking about this too logically. When is anyone who argues about what they like actually looked at performance? They don't. They look at the box and say, \"The PlayStation 5 is so much better than the Xbox because it can do 8k.\" It's a placebo effect. So, by coming out and saying, \"oh this can do 8k, 120 or whatever. If they put that badge on this box - No one cares, No one cares. - No, no, no, they will care because people who have never once bought the PlayStation 5 were arguing about how much better it is than the X Xbox, and it's all because Sony advertised it as an 8k which is why I think they're gonna move forward with it. I agree with you that it's dumb, it doesn't need to happen. But it's not about that. It's about being able to say, \"we had the most powerful console.\" Look at what happens if this Activision deal goes through. There is no doubt a massive shift in gaming in favor of Xbox. How can Sony compete? Alright? - Hardware, they have to powerful hardware - They have to go all in on hardware. - But, okay, but here's the thing. This is like the arms race, right? Both Microsoft and Sony source their chips from AMD, right? So we're talking about AMD, CPUs, and GPUs, and while I'm sure AMD keeps, you know, a little divide between church and state there, you better believe that if Sony start whipping up a brand new, you know PS5 Pro chip, there's gonna be a little birdie telling the Microsoft crew that that's going on, and you know that they're probably gonna do the same thing. Which is why I also think this is dumb. Like, if we live in a world where Sony can bring out a PS5 Pro, it's gonna help boost regular PS5 sales, it is going to help increase the ray tracing and make the PS5 the world's most powerful console, sweet. I do think that makes sense. But the problem is, as soon as Sony commits doing this Microsoft are gonna be right there because of course they are. They have to be competitive which to me is just like, \"Why bother?\", right? We don't need these little half steps - I don't disagree with anything that you're saying I just think you're seeing this way different than everyone else in the industry sees this. - You think people just know that there's a PS4 pro and that means that obviously just could do a PS5 Pro because they're gonna make a bunch of money? - Yes! - You, think it's that simple. - Yes! Like why wouldn't it be? - But last duration we needed it, this time we don't, right? These PS5s, the Series X. - But people think they need it because of last time. - Yeah, they probably do. - Again, I don't disagree with anything that you're saying here, but like I think you're underestimating the urge of people having to say, \"I have the best console on the market.\" - Spend $750 on a PS5 That's marginally better. - Yeah, like they have to go in on hardware because they have lost the software race. - But the thing is though, they can't really win the hardware race 'cause Microsoft already did the same thing. - How many people just, again, think that the PS5 is so much better, so much more powerful. When I say that Xbox won the software race, I don't think Xbox has better games. I think they have a better ecosystem to play games on. - Assuming the Activision deal goes forward. - Not even that. Just, again, games as in general. - Oh sure, general, yeah sure. - Like, the amount of indie titles that you have access to for one price, PS Plus is nowhere near that. - With these console cycles, right? They move in these huge waves, right? Again, let's think back to Xbox. I know I go back to the Xbox One a lot, but I think it's a really interesting sort of point, right? Xbox One started out as a complete God damn disaster, but, over basically the entire generation, they went from digging themselves into a massive hole to doing all the right things, bringing out better hardware, bringing out better software bringing out, you know, services such as Game Pass. By the end of the Xbox One generation with the One X they basically kind of clawed their way back up, but these things take a long time. Like, for someone who, obviously us, if you're watching this video odds are you're an enthusiast, odds are you are way more informed than the average gamer, right? But a lot of people just buy a console, especially console gamers, They just buy a console 'cause they just wanna play \"Call of Duty\" or whatever. They don't really think about the nuances and whatnot, and it takes years and years and years to change people's perspective, right? Most people think PlayStation better than Xbox; most people will buy a PlayStation instead of an Xbox. I do hear you that if there is a PS5 Pro that's out there it's that halo product that is a reason for Sony to do it. My main argument is that it's just a arms race. - Again, It comes back to what is the shareholder saying? We wanna bump in stock prices, and what's gonna happen when we announce a PS5 Pro? Stock price bump. That's why we get a the same TikTok year of phones every year of just like, \"Oh, this one's 2% better.\" Because you have to have an announcement. I have something that I am afraid, but I do think it's gonna happen. I don't think this is gonna be a disc drive in the - In the Pro? - PS5 Pro. - What you're proposing is that there will no longer be a PlayStation that has a disc drive built in regardless of Slim or Pro. - Ever. - It'll always be that disordered and attachable. I agree with with. - But I think what's gonna happen is this PS, the $700 PS4 Pro, a PS5 Pro five Pro, Is gonna be $800 if you want to have your disc collection. - That's an interesting thought. - Because again, - You just buy the disc drive. - if you're going all in on hardware, you look at what Xbox has, They have their software ecosystem; you can play Xbox games on this platform, this platform, but now Sony's saying, now we have our VR hardware platform, we have our disc platform here. - You know what, Matt, I can't believe I'm about to say this, you make an incredibly persuasive argument. I still am gonna stick by. I don't think PS5. - You didn't say anything, your whole arguments were in defense of me saying that it's gonna happen. - 'Cause you're persuasive, Matt. I'm still gonna stick my flag in the ground, the PS5 Pro will not exist. I will say though, before this conversation I was pretty un-confident. I'm a little shaky. What do you think? - When the PS5 Pro comes out, Austin owes me one. - No, no we're throwing it to the audience. What do you think? Will the PS5 Pro exist? Do you think Matt is right? And that Sony are going to start the next arms race, and that we're all gonna be spending a thousand dollars on consoles soon enough? Of course we are. How's that a question? More money, right? Yay money! - Like, follow, and subscribe when we cover the PS5 mechanical keyboard. (smooth jazz music)",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we are unboxing the brand new Google Pixel 3 XL. I've actually been, well, at the time of me posting this video, I've been using this for about, I guess, a few weeks at this point. But, today, you're gonna be witnessing the unboxing of said phone! Does it make sense? Does it, mm, the magic of editing. Also got the Pixel stand, which I'm already in love with. And a nice little case. Let's get started. So, this is the Clearly White version. There's two other colors as well. The pink, well, it's called Not Pink, I think is probably my favorite. And you know I'm a huge fan of rose gold and pink blush tones, so ugh, it's beautiful. But, Google sent me this one to check out. (mellow pop music) Ooh, it has a really really nice feel. So because it does have wireless charging, obviously this is a glass back. So, you can see it has a kind of a duo-tone glass. This is like a frosted glass, this is a shiny glass. You got your camera, your flash, and a perfectly placed fingerprint sensor. USB-C cable, USB-A to USB-C dongle, another dongle, USB-C to a 3.5 millimeter jack. Headphones. Look at these. So, that's everything that came in the box. Now it's time to boot this thing up. Oh, gosh, I can't get over the colored power buttons. This is something that I really love that Google does. Look at you, wow, that notch is big. So, you squeeze the edges, which is kinda cool, to get your assistant. (laughs) That's a hard squeeze. I need to lighten it up. I guess we're set up! This was quicker than I thought! Notch-freaking-city! It's definitely there. I mean, it doesn't really bother me that much. Mostly because I am so used to, I guess, my iPhone, and then the Notes. Like, all the phones that I've been using. It's just, sort of, the thing that is there. So here, you can see the notch size differences. So, it's not as long, but it is a lot taller. What I am so excited to test out is the photos, because this does have-- Whoah! So, I guess I can show you here. So, there you are, but that's the wide angle. And it goes all the way in? So, look at this. Can you see that? That's so cool. The wide angle is so wide. I look forward to testing this out a little bit more, but now, we should probably finish up unboxing this, and check out this case. We need our stand so we can charge this thing up. Ugh! Whoah! I love all of Google's accent colors. We have the charging brick, got another USB-C cable. Google loves USB-C. Especially these sleek, white cables. So, this stand will add a 10 watt charger for your Pixel, but it will also charge any other Qi-compatible devices at 5 watts. So that means, yes, it will charge your iPhone if you choose to do so. Just a little bit slower. Wow, this is a nice case. This is a very nice case. (gasps) And it's got the mint green. Oh, and it's soft?! I love this case so much. I do wish this had facial recognition though, because I'm so used to that. Look how good this looks! Actually, those are two very nice complimentary colors, hm? I agree. Well, I think I've opened everything. So now, I guess we can go outside and test this thing out with some photos. Before we get into this video, I just wanna say I'm sorry. You guys noticed this in some of my photos and videos that I posted on social. I cracked my Pixel. I'm entrusted to see some drop tests to see how durable this is, because I dropped this with a case on it, and, I don't know, it must have just fell in the most perfect way for this to happen. But it did. And it happened right after I unboxed it. Like I actually opened it, went, and I was going to do some photo tests, and it just fell, and I just, my heart, it just sank. So I think one of the things that these cases need to do is have a little bit higher of a lip. So, if you can see on some of these iPhone cases, which are just the regular Apple ones, they go a little bit higher up. It is a very very slight difference, but that little slight difference makes all the difference. So when you're dropping this thing face down, any little bit of support around those edges is going to help. But it's still working, and all things considered, it wasn't really that bad. And I know you're probably gonna say, classic Justine, you're super irresponsible. I might be. The good news is it didn't affect my phone in any way whatsoever. So, anyway. Moving on. Now that the Pixel is unboxed, we have magically been transported to Hawaii. And I've been taking a ton of photos on the Pixel 3 and on the iPhone, and I've been sharing them and it is such a polarizing reaction watching you guys react to the photos that I post. You guys are fighting with each other, saying that you love the photo because it was shot on an iPhone, or hating it because on the iPhone. Or you're debating that, no, that wasn't shot on an iPhone, that was actually shot on a Pixel, and I'm telling you, no, it was actually shot on an iPhone. Or the other way around. I'm arguing with you, telling you that it was shot on the Pixel, but you guys think it was shot on an iPhone. And I feel like that almost kind of a good thing, because the technology is getting so good in every device that we get, that it's hard to tell what it's shot with. There are very small differences that sometimes you're able to tell which was shot on which, and just by my, I guess, testing it out in the past week, I will say that the Pixel definitely wins in low light situations. So, a lot of photos that I've taken, and compared them to the iPhone. When it's a little bit darker out, they do tend to let in a lot more light, and they do look a little bit more crisp. So, I definitely feel like that is one of the places that the Pixel has excelled at. Something that gets me super fired up though, is after using this thing for like the past week, there's absolutely no way that this is accurate. This is so far from the truth, most of the photos that you take on the Pixel are way darker then the photos that they take on the iPhone. The Smart HDR brings out the shadows so much in the iPhone that it sometimes does have that over-processed look. So, I don't know where they got this photo at, because this is just absurd. Almost every time that I took a picture with the Pixel and comparing it to the iPhone, the Pixel was significantly darker. But, moving on. The bottom line is that a lot of people have differing opinions, and that's what makes art and photography so incredible. Everyone has different tastes, and some people may see a painting or a photo and say, I don't like that. Whereas somebody else is just beyond impressed, and it could be their most favorite thing ever. So, with that in mind, while you're watching this video and maybe even carrying on with the rest of your day, or the rest of your week, or the month, or the rest of your life, just because someone doesn't like something that you like, you don't have to criticize them for it. Because, guess what, they probably don't like what you like. Which is obvious. 'Cause if you don't like what they like, then they don't like what you like, so. Just be kind. But let's jump into one of the things that I have really really been enjoying the most about the Pixel 3, is the wide angle selfies. The selfie camera on the iPhone, here's a little comparison. You can see that there is no wide-angle option on the iPhone. I do hope that that is something that they plan to integrate in the future, because it would be incredible. So, here's some of the wide-angle selfies that I took. My sister was so confused because I had both of my phones kind of connected together taking the same photos. And she's like, wait, which one do I look at? But you can tell, you can get so much more in the frame. It is a little bit distorted around the edges, but it's not as bad as some wide-angle lenses that I've seen before. The wide-angle selfie mode also carries over to video, which is incredible. The only gripe that I have is the audio on the Pixel is not as good as that of the iPhone. It's not terrible, it's just definitely not as good. This is the wide angle on the Pixel 3. I'm also gonna show you what it looks like on the iPhone XS. So, as you can see, you get a much wider field of view, which is pretty awesome. So, on the back camera on the Pixel, it only shoots up to 4K 30 frames, whereas the iPhone does 4k 60. I definitely thought that the Pixel would have a little bit higher of frame rate. So, taking that into consideration, here is some test footage from both of the back cameras from both of the phones. (peaceful, uplifting music) So, here's the zoom test. I just zoomed as much as I could in. Bri, Brianne, how cool do I look with these cameras and phones? - [Brianne] Pretty cool. (laughs) So, one of the things that I do like about the front facing camera here on the Pixel, is you can zoom in or out. So, one of the trends of the past couple of years has been gimbals. So, a gimbal is something that you use to stabilize your phone, or your camera, but the latest trend is how do you get those gimbal-like shots without actually using a gimbal? I did a review recently of the GoPro HERO7, and the stabilization on that thing is so amazing. The Pixel 3 uses something that Google is calling Fused Video Stabilization. Now, the stabilization only works on the back camera, and if you're shooting in 1080p, you will actually get a much better stabilized shot. So, whatever the Fused Video Stabilization is, it probably shoots the video in 4K, and then downgrades to 1080p. And because it was shot in 4k, it has so much more data to work with to digitally stabilize that video. Now, I tested the Pixel 3 against the iPhone XS, but I also tested the Pixel 3 against the HERO7. Now, the HERO7, like I said before, is just, it just blew my mind at how great it was at stabilizing. So, it will be interesting to see those two side-by-side. But first up, let's see what the stabilization is like on the Pixel 3 compared to the iPhone XS. (electronic dance music) Let's try a stabilization test from running. (electronic dance music) Now, let's test out the pixel 3 versus the GoPro HERO7. Running to catch up to them again. Did I just-- - [Woman] You dropped your phone! - [Justine] I did! Oh my gosh! No! My phone just fell out of my pocket. Back to my brisk run. So, both phones obviously have slow-mo mode. The Pixel shoots at 240 frames a second, at 720p, whereas the iPhone shoots 1080p, 240 frames a second. What a beautiful segue into a slow-mo demonstration. (mellow electronic music) One of the interesting things is the Pixel still only has one camera, whereas the iPhone XS has two. So, this has a regular lens and a telephoto lens. So, with that telephoto lens, that allows the iPhone 10s to do portrait mode photos, and this also does portrait mode photos, but it uses machine learning to try to figure out what should be blurred, and what shouldn't. So, it is super impressive what this can do with just one lens. It will do portrait mode on the front and the back. All in all, I was pretty impressed with some of the portrait mode photos that the Pixel took. It really is such a difficult thing, because there are so many variables when you're taking these photos. Especially because I have blond hair, and a lot of these photos were taken sort of, in very windy situations. It was really difficult for both of these phones to try to figure out what should be in focus and what shouldn't. So, we've been talking a lot about photos and video, because that's one of the main things I feel like most people use their phones for. Other than making phone calls, I guess. Or texting, which, I do a lot of that. But phone calls, not so much. This is leading me into something called Call Assist, which I'm super fascinated by. Using the Google Assistant, if somebody calls, you don't wanna talk to them, you can send it to your assistant. Your assistant will then say, hey, what's up, this isn't a real person. I'm not real. But talk to me anyway. Hello, I'm trying to talk to Justine. Oh, I gotta click something. Okay, so, this is me taking an action. - [Call Assistant] Just so it's clear, go ahead and say more about why you're calling. - [Justine] I wanna talk to Justine! - [Call Assistant] Do you need to get ahold of them urgently? - [Justine] Yes, it is very important that I speak to Justine. (laughs) I think that you should subscribe to my YouTube channel. That says \"I think you should describe sweaty two channels.\" Oh my gosh. What is happening? - [Call Assistant] They can't talk right now, but they'll give you a call later. - Your assistant will transcribe in real-time what that person is saying, so, if you decide that, hey, I wanna take this call, you can click answer and you can then take it. Or, you can just let your assistant keep chatting with them. Google Lens is also pretty cool. You can copy and paste text, you can search directly with inside of your camera. You just do a one long hold press, and as you hover your camera over top of things, it's automatically doing searches. You can copy dates, you can copy times, you can add things to your calendar. You can also shop directly from your camera, which is, hoo! Super dangerous. Let's try it here on the Smartwater. It knew that this was Smartwater. Let's try a plant identifier. It's showing me the freaking plant. It's called cronton, crontons? What are you? Oh boy. Oh my gosh, it's the same plant. Although, this one, it says it's a California Cronton. It's called a croton. I've been reading it wrong. Although, I think cronton sounds way cooler. People are always asking me which phone that they should get, and honestly, I don't have an answer for that, because all of the stuff is personal opinion. Whereas my personal opinion is I love my iPhone. It works for what I need it to do. Granted, there are some things that I feel like they could also improve on. I love the pixel 3. I love the Note9. Probably the one Android phone that I use the most out of this past year was the OnePlus 6. That Sandstone white was so beautiful. Then after that, I went into the Note9, and being someone who does review technology and get a chance to use a lot of these phones, it's hard to say, because they are all really great devices. So my best advice is to watch everyone's videos. Take bits and pieces from everyone, and go in to stores and actually test them out for yourself. It's great because Best Buy always has all of the Samsung phones, the Apple store has all of the iPhones, and any other retail store like AT&T, or Verizon, or T-Mobile, or anything, you can go in, try the phones, test them out, and see what works for you. So, there just are so many things. There's so many variables. What makes you happy is what should matter. So, with that, it doesn't have to be applied to just your phone. Whatever it is, whatever it is that makes you happy, don't let anyone tell you that that isn't something that you should like, because they don't know you. They aren't you. And they're probably just trying to bring you down. So, live your best life. I'm gonna go and edit this video right now and I am dreading it. 'Cause there's a lot of photos and a lot of videos, but thank you for watching. If you made it this far, do subscribe, if you'd like. I've got a lot of fun videos coming out from Hawaii, so. Stay tuned. It's like Tech Christmas. (upbeat electronic music)",

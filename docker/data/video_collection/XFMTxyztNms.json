    "transcript": "If you going to play the game... you should play at the highest level. I've been saying for years Jack is finally catching up! You may notice things are a little different than usual around here. Above me there's the cameras been it's hanging there we rigged it up is it going to fall down and destroy me it's quite possible alright i hope not but I might have to upgrade the insurance policy this is a c500 this is like a cinema camera in there is at least 25 pounds up there today I've got an important video to make and it's especially relevant with me moving into the new space and potentially having a new set up a new above computer setup. You guys probably know I've been using the new Macbook Pro. This guy over here alright. This one with the touch bar and just USB type-c ports Now. Man have I been immersing myself in the world of USB-C it's not all created equal last night I was trying to connect various peripherals to realize how many of these USB-C cables that are out there aren't actually 3.1 compatible so now you're not getting video display of them incompatible and so on. I paid how much money for that laptop and the USB type-c cable that connects that comes in the box that powers it up is USB 2.0 ? What is going on here man? Ok I don't know, am I nitpicking? I don't think so I'm just saying they should have given up a better variety cables 'cause really this is a cable issue. I like having that much throughput alright. Each one of those is a thunderbolt three capable port but this whole cable situation requires some kind of conversation so this video right here I'm going to show you what are your options when it comes to diversifying the USB-C port whether it's on this macbook pro or other devices other laptops that strictly have type-c connectors. Now in front of me, I have a product this is a hub it's called HooToo. HooToo. Now if you had a judge a product strictly by its name you might be a little bit concerned at this point but this thing it takes a single USB type-c hopefully 3.1 cable and it gives you the variety of outputs that you would have had on the old macbook pro pretty much i think it's i think it's identical now they're not the only ones in the game I got another one over here as well this is called the chocolate hub it looks like a piece of chocolate but this one goes a step further because it actually adds Qi wireless charging to the top part of the hub so I'm going to be comparing the two of these right here this one here is going to add an SD card reader it's going to add an hdmi port traditional USBs your old peripherals audio interfaces things like that you take advantage of those now let's crack this one open and see what it offers up comparative to the chocolate hub you know what i like about this too is this another type-c connector on here so I like this has an in-and-out so this one it comes in a few different colors silver gray gold graphite rose gold they're hoping that you match it up to finish you chose on your on your macbook pro no Qi wireless charging on this guy but this one does have the cable three USB traditional USB ports here is the one of them is super speed for faster charging you've got that SD card slot listen a lot of people who shoot video on SD card this is very important to them so that's there and then you've also got hdmi port I mean x4 video output right you want to be on a TV something like this your DC in.. in case you need a little bit more juice i'm assuming this guy just plugs in over here oh look at lights up Jack can you pick that up look at that flashing have you at this point solved have you at this point solved the biggest problem with the new macbook simply by adding this dongle i guess so i mean i guess in some ways it's more versatile than then adding a bunch of different cables and adapters and so on like an independent dongle for each peripheral this is kind of nice in that sense it's all in one place but at the same time these kind of large like look at that I don't know you got this super slim laptop is this really what you want to carry around a lot of people would probably be better served by just picking up the adapter cable i know a lot of people don't want to go out and read by all these cables but in the long run if you think about it it saves you from having to remember a dongle and a cable you just go into the cable universe so the most complained about thing when it comes to these laptops beyond the fact that they're just incredibly expensive is the fact that you're giving up some of the port's you had on the previous version so here's a couple of devices I'll link them down in the description to bring back and potentially fix what some would consider to be the biggest problem with the new Macbook if you want Qi wireless charging you got it here in the chocolate version or maybe you're just maybe you just get hungry you don't care about that you can get something a little bit smaller with the cable already built-in from HooToo is the HooToo like a tribe in Africa or something probably not spelled like that it also can I complain about something else is that ok Jack do i have to stage here do I have the microphone let me complain about one other this is happening to me all the time recently I'm like this alright the hands are up on here you know you're taking away maybe you're in an email maybe you're writing something you're about your getting deep whatev.. whatever it is and I just be thinking I lean back a little bit and the finger will slip up onto the touchpad and in the email client the send button is right there you don't have any emails i sent it just like end at a particular word and i'm not even done yet that's happening to me lately so I mean that's my issue i suppose i could turn that off in particular apps and so on but it's something to think about you never know you might end up sending the wrong email to the right person and who knows where you go from there.",

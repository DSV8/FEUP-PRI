    "transcript": "iPhone 14. Apple watch Ultra airpods 2 that's old news man expand your horizon look to the Future the rumor mill has not stopped about the things yet to come and it's looking all but certain that we will get our fourth October event of the last five years after all Apple has promised us a few things by Year's End do you remember what those promises are if you don't we'll get into it but first let's chat about the thing that is most frequently seen refreshed in October the iPad so Mark German who's the Bloomberg reporter that holds a chart-topping 87 League accuracy according to Apple track says that we can expect a pretty boring iPad Pro refresh this year and I mean boring now the tablet is slated to inherit the new M2 processor that was introduced on the MacBook Air a few months ago but beyond that the changes are few and it's like okay cool because the last thing that the iPad Pro is is underpowered but I digress where are our Pro apps Garmin and reliable analyst Ross young and Ming Chi kuo they all agree that the 11 inch iPad Pro the smaller model will not inherit the mini LED Tech that the bigger model got last year despite early rumors to the contrary quote even go so far as to say that Apple will never put their mini LED Tech into smaller displays and that Apple's groundwork on mini LED will be exclusive to laptops and desktop displays going forward so then what gives well the elect which has an admittedly spotty track record suggests that the iPad Pro is waiting to move to a hybrid OLED display but things aren't ready that'll happen in 2023 or 2024. what does a hybrid OLED you ask why the same question your smartphone almost certainly has a flexible plastic backed OLED panel they are lighter they are thinner more shatter resistant and well more flexible than the rigid amoleds of the 2010s but their lack of rigidity can cause a wrinkling effect now this isn't very noticeable on small smartphone displays where we typically see oleds or on large televisions that you're sitting perfectly perpendicular to a dozen plus feet away but Apple has reportedly been very unhappy with the way that flexible oleds look on mid-size displays like laptops and tablets so a new hybridized design using ultra thin glass as a substrate rather than polyamide is being developed by both LG and Samsung and it's expected to be ready for production with within two years so it's at that point that we might see the iPad Pro Line reach display parity on both sizes when they switch to OLED so will anything be new this year beyond the M2 SOC maybe a wacky rumor from Mac odacara has recently cited supply chain leaks indicating two new four pin connectors at the top and bottom of the iPad their purpose too and this is translated from Japanese quote be a terminal to assist in powering peripherals that connect to the Thunderbolt port on the iPad end quote this makes absolutely no sense Thunderbolt supports 100 watts of power delivery which is enormous so if this 4 pin connector is real there's got to be another reason for it because it's not bad personally I find the rumor that Apple will be placing the iPhone's flavor of magsafe behind the glass Apple logo on the device's rear to be more likely but even that seems kind of meh partially because of how unstable the Behemoth iPad would be balanced on that tiny little puck and because of all the incompatibility that there would be with hopefully backwards compatible keyboard cases and let's not forget that the iPhone magsafe is limited to 18 watts of charging speed versus the iPad Pro's third current 36 watt Max Speed over USBC so yeah who knows on the iPad Pro boring probably what isn't likely to be boring is the new base model iPad Apple's cheapest tablet is expected to get its first form factor change in a decade if my smart price is to be believed now the outlet has only had about five leaks total in the last two years but they have all been dead on so I put a fair bit of weight in this they are reporting that the new iPad will adopt the flat sides and the camera hump of the air and pro siblings while retaining some of the old form factors specifically the touch ID button found on Old iPads of your now Mac odacara disagrees they say that they are going all screen with the new iPad and that they will be adopting a touch ID power button like on the air but at that point what's the point of the air I just I don't buy this and I expect that it will be more in line with what my smart price has alleged home button and all there also doesn't seem to be consensus about lightning versus USBC given the new iPhones and airpods pro it's clear that Apple isn't quite done with the shamefully outdated connector but there is a reason that I am voting and hoping for USBC on the base model iPad Not only would it bring parity to the iPad lineup and permit external device usage via the files app without having to use that hokey camera kit adapter but it also means that the original apple pencil can finally die reducing skus is always nice and I hope that this is their move the tablet is also expected to get the 2020 A14 bionic if Mark German is to be believed and frankly I think that makes sense the A14 is the chip upon which the M1 is built so it's in remarkably High Supply but it still segments it from the more expensive M1 capable iPad Air there are also rumors of the base model iPad inheriting 5G support which sounds great but it does cause me to worry slightly the entry level iPad's greatest asset has always been its price at 329 dollars I don't think there's a better value in the entirety of Apple's product portfolio and I hope that all of these new features Don't Put It Out Of Reach for its intended audience like the education market and Casual consumers which

the Mac let's talk about some smaller stuff that we may see before a Year's end but probably won't see at the October event first up we've got the rumored model j255 Apple TV now you'll recall the Apple TV got an update just last year it received a new remote but the device only received a dated a12 SOC bump now for its intended use as a TV media player that's not such a a big deal but if the idea that Apple has is to streamline production and it really seems to be the Apple TV may just get the bump to the A14 bionic like the entry level iPad German states that this change will also be accompanied by an extra gig of RAM over what the Apple TV ships with today which is three gigs this could help the Apple TV with apple arcade titles which if you don't know are required to support all of Apple's platforms TV included on the subject of gaming we might see yet another change to the remote an increasing number of Apple TV games just straight up require a Gamepad but a large majority of the catalog still supports the old Apple TV remote that remote had a gyroscope built-in and that's not found in the new Siri remote on my Apple TV I literally don't play games because I I don't have a controller to do it adding a gyro to the refresh design would bring back compatibility for much of the game catalog and including find my support to that new refresh remote would frankly be a nice addition too remember the homepod that speaker that sounded nice but was sandbagged by Siri being garbage and with a high 350 dollar price tag to boot yeah well it might be making a return the homepod mini has sold like hotcakes likely even surpassing Apple's wildest expectations it has been the best selling smart speaker period two quarters in a row this year it's outsold Amazon it's outsold Google incredible Apple's market share has tripled since early last year so both Ming Chi quo and German say that apple is returning with a big daddy homepod they've suggested that the new device will ship with a new S8 chip and will come in a size similar to the original homepod with comparable audio performance German also suggests that the new home pod will have an updated display on the top with the potential for multi-tucks functionality and for that I'd like to say hang on just a second okay the original homepod failed because of its price 350 was too expensive for you know your run-of-the-mill smart speaker and so Apple lowered the price point which they never do to 299 it was still too expensive it wasn't selling so if we're to believe that apple is going to ship a device with comparable audio performance and more features several years later with all this inflation how is Apple going to hit a price point that targets Mass adoption it can't I think that Apple needs to Target a 150 to 200 price point if they want to see high attachment rates now this might mean that it doesn't sound as good as the original homepod and doesn't have that fancy pants uh you know spatial room processing but that's fine because the homepod mini sounds horrible and it's selling like hotcakes at a hundred dollars so attack 50 100 under the price tag for a good speaker and Bob's your uncle we're in business furthermore last year German alluded to the fact that Apple might be working on a homepod with a screen one that he said quote combines an Apple TV set-top box with a homepod speaker with a camera for video conferencing through a connected TV and other smart home functions now to me this sounds like two things a fancy pants sound bar for your home theater with a camera and an Apple TV built in and it also sounds like well just a homepod with an iPad slap to it frankly I think both of these things should exist imagine a nice e-arc sound bar with an Apple TV built in support for HDMI CEC for everything else connected to your TV Etc oh look Steve Jobs always wanted to make a TV Apple was working on it and this could be that without actually making and selling the TV more exciting though in my opinion is the idea of an Echo Show competitor imagine being able to watch a show with great audio in your kitchen while you cook and have the ability to switch to a FaceTime call without having to do a thing or imagine a fancy photo frame for Grandma where the entire family can upload photos right from their phone to an iCloud shared photo library that will appear in her house without you having to do anything a device where you could control your entire smart home and see your phone notifications at a glance I want one it sounds amazing but rumors of such a device have decreased over time not increased so we're probably just going to get another simpler basic homepod all right let's talk the Mac right now the most likely to be seen at an October event is a plop and drop version of the Mac Mini now rumors of a redesigned Mac Mini they have all but died since the Mac Studio was released and honestly Fair we demonstrated that Apple could shrink the form factor earlier this year but most clients buying that machine they're in education an Enterprise and they actually actively don't want a form factor change besides if they keep the larger design that they've got right now they could have additional thermal Headroom for both M2 and M2 Pro Models remember the Mac Studio it starts with a Max configuration so there is a hole in the market on the desktop side that the Mac Mini could fill so let's talk chips for a second because rumors are all over the place the M1 and the M2 they're both very similar chips they're both effectively based on the A14 both the M1 and the M2 run the same five nanometer process size process iteration be darned and the M3 the new Big Daddy that's slated to be based on tsmc's brand spanking new third nanometer process and apple is first in line for those chips so first in line in fact that AMD was so pissed off that they defected the Samsung's fav Apple has bought up almost all of tsmc's supply for the first year in a tsmc recent earnings call they issued High half one 2023 Revenue guidance and directly stated that three nanometer was the reason for that so Apple will start buying millions of three nanometer chips in the next few months so then what becomes of M2 because it just came out well rumors are literally all over the place completely contradictory and they're changing by the week so I'm going to make my own predictions so I suspect that come October we'll see both a new Mac Mini and refreshed MacBook Pros now the former will come offered with the M2 and M2 Pro and the laptops well they're going to get the M2 Pro and M2 Max just as they did last year these chips should be frankly pretty easy to produce because they're very similar in production and design to the M1 Pro and M1 Max I'm also going to predict against the Green I might add that we will see a refreshed Mac Pro offering the M2 Ultra and M2 extreme this year now the M2 extreme will be the Jade Force see chiplet design that's been rumored for over two years it'll just be based on M2 it'll be a huge chip physically at around 600 millimeters squared and it'll be hot with maximum power consumption of around 600 watts it'll be bloody friggin fast so then the logical question becomes well if the M3 is on a new process size that can achieve a much higher transistor density and in a lower power envelope why would Apple not hold the Mac Pro until early next year well I think that there's two reasons number one apple said that the transition would be completed in two years nearly two years ago the clock has run out and while it wouldn't be the first time Apple has broken promises it's not typical Tim Cook's road maps are pretty Loctite and the Mac Pro has been expected ready to ship for several months now reason number two is that chip yields are a real issue in early production and it's not typically until later in the production cycle that the high bin chips become dependably available now considering the scale lid which TS SMC will be making these chips for apple and the comparably low volume of Mac Pro Sales that there are May well mean that Apple could feasibly hold off on a Mac Pro until M3 but I wouldn't expect them uh two because frankly they've demonstrated thus far that they start at the entry level and work up and I think that they'll continue that now there are a lot of rumors for the M3 gurman says that next year we're going to see a new 15-inch MacBook Air potentially the return of an ultralight 12-inch MacBook please be true please be true please be true that sounds amazing we're expected to get a pro level iMac and a refreshed Mac Studio if all of that is true I think that it would be late 2023 or early 2024 before Apple was ready to release an M3 based Mac Pro so I think they're just gonna do it now but let's say potentially that's not true that leaves us a decent iPad refresh a boring iPad Pro boring MacBook Pro updates maybe a new Apple TV big whoop I mean is that it is that worthy of a keynote probably not which is why we might just not get one all of these updates are frankly in my opinion press release worthy and after all Apple has only held an October event three of the last five years so then maybe our next keynote just comes in January January there's never Keynotes in January you're right there hasn't been January events since 2010 when Steve Jobs announced the iPad but Ming Chi quo says quote Apple AR Mr will likely be announced in January 2023. that's a pretty ative statement from a pretty uh uh trustworthy leaker German has also suggested that Apple's long-awaited VR R mixed reality headset will launch in the first half of next year so then what the frick is it okay we have no idea and that's what in my opinion makes it so fascinating normally we see leaks out of the Wazoo for stuff like this but there has been so little that we were basically just throwing darts at a wall with a blindfold on but here's what we do know no apple is working on three new headsets n301 and 602 and n421 now the first headset and 301 that's expected to be called Apple reality Pro Apple just filed trademarks for a bunch of reality related names a couple of weeks ago under one of their shell companies in a bunch of countries now this device has been in development for years and is expected to blend augmented reality with virtual reality AKA that's called mixed reality it's expected to run two processors and M2 SOC designed to handle primary operations and then a co-processor designed for sensor related operations the device is expected to be a standalone device operable without an iPhone or anything else and it will have more than a dozen sensors and cameras around the device to track hand movements and gestures potentially including eye tracking and it's expected to run a fork of iOS called Ros or reality OS rumors are suggesting as you might expect a very high retail price like get ready potentially over two thousand dollars to start and that's in part due to the fact that well it's Apple but also because they're rumored to be using brand new micro OLED display technology and extremely expensive low Distortion Optical pancake lenses at a unit cost to Apple of about forty dollars each that's insane by contrast the fresnel lenses that are found in say the valve index those have an estimated unit cost of about four dollars if this newfangle device is successful it's expected that a lower end model will launch in 2024 to a more budget conscious broader Market this is just so bizarre to me because nobody has made AR cool including apple and frankly no one's really made it even useful outside of a very Niche industrial applications and in the VR World well it's exclusive use pretty much has been gaming so to imagine that Apple wants to create a hybrid system but one that leans more on head mounted existing goggle-based VR Tech than something like say Google Glass is both fascinating and perplexing but if anyone can pull off ushering this Tech into the mainstream it's Apple that said Bowl am I still super skeptical so while the end of 2022 may seem a bit boring it seems the 2023 has some absolute Insanity from start to finish you can bet that we will be covering and reviewing everything here including the recently released iPhone watch Ultra and airpods pro 2.

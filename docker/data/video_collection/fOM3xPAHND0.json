    "description": "Why is he wearing those glasses?  DiamondBoxx Model M (USA Link) -  DiamondBoxx Model M (International) -   It may be time to upgrade your wireless bluetooth speaker. This thing puts out some serious sounds.  From the manufacturer -  Take the party with you! To the beach, basketball court, the locker room, the tailgating party, the house party, the BBQ, the classroom, or use it in your home or apartment. With unparalleled bass and loudness, a 20-hour battery, and 320 watts of bi-amplified power, it's a portable that can replace your primary stereo. The 2 carat man made Diamond indicates the battery level by changing colors. The enclosure is made from MDF, the front panel is aircraft grade aluminum; which also serves as the amplifier's heatsink to keep the amplifer cool and weight down. This ensures it will play full volume for hours without overheating or shutting off. All speakers use neodymium magnets for high performance and light weight. The amplifer is all analog and uses optical analog distortion limiters so you can turn it all the way up without the losing sound quality!!! The front panel has 3.5mm input for highest sound quality connection. The backpanel contains the charging port for the included fast charger. Charges fully dead DiamondBoxx to 100% in 3 hours. Hand built in Arizona, USA. 2 year warranty on parts and labor.  FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

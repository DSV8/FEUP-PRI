    "transcript": "Do you know this time-saving Linux command if I type history who's history I can see a history of commands that I've typed and if I scroll up here I can see I used this command previously it's got number 217 so if I type exclamation mark 2017 it allows me to run that command again the matrix now this is obviously a very simple command but if I had a very long command that could save me a lot of time. So history shows me a list of commands so I could push that to more as an example and I can see a list of commands here and then I can use as an example exclamation 69 to run that command to install the software. It's already installed here but I can rerun commands from history using exclamation mark.",

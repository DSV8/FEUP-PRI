    "transcript": "today's video is one of those stupid ideas I have after a severe brain injury and I don't know if it's gonna work but if it does it should lead to some properly terrible gaming but before we get into that today's video is sponsored by the Corsair shift series of power supplies I really had to concentrate to not say Swift to there for some reason what Corsair did with the shift series was move the standard modular power supply connectors to the side of the power supply so it more evenly uses your case basement and as I found out in my previous video it works great it really clears up your case's stuffing cavities so if this sounds good to you check out the Corsair shift series of power supplies using the link in the description below thank you Corsair for sponsoring today's video [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] oh now not meaning to to throw shade here but I do feel like this is a bit of a brave way to ship something like a Nas I don't know if that feels like reasonable play for Packaging [Music] now the terrible idea behind today's video is I'm gonna try and game on this Nas and by that I don't mean using a NASA's external storage I'm actually going to try and install Windows on this Nas and use the hardware in it to run some games which should be spectacularly bad oh it's the camera is falling over isn't it no I'm not 100 sure this is actually gonna work but I did do a very brief Google on the subject and apparently all you need is a Nas that has a video out which is surprisingly rare but which luckily this or store has other than that I don't know why it wouldn't work because this Nas does have Hardware in it that should support Windows not very well granted but that doesn't matter it should support it so let's open it up and have a closer look at the Usos door now in case it hasn't been clear up until this point I don't know a lot about network storage it's less in interest of mine and more a keyword in fifty percent of my nightmares but I'm bit of an expert when it comes to installing Windows on crappy hardware and then having a terrible gaming experience so this should work out I'm confident [Music] foreign which was very kindly sent over by Micro Center in fact Micro Center plug Micro Center is your One-Stop shop for PCs and the shopping thereof and they're opening a new store in Indianapolis we account monitor Madness see what kind of accessories a Nas comes with uh there's an external power brick ooh 90 Watts so this is a serious performance Nas I guess I don't know what kind of power draw nasas normally have and then we also get a power cable we also get a lan cable oh it's kind of a loserycat 5 cable and then we also get a manual on how to upgrade the memory in this Nas which could be very useful for our use case we may have to do that at some point and then finally we get a quick installation guide what does it say about installing Windows on it okay in fact it does not say anything about using this as a Windows device cool [Music] oh there is our very inspiring looking plastic box we do have a fan on the back which kind of cools the hard drives and stuff in here we have our two ethernet ports on the back with our very important HDMI port this is the whole reason we may potentially be able to game onto this thing and then we have two USB 2 ports so at least we have bare minimum gaming i o it's a good start and other than that there's very little to say about it so let's open it up and have a closer look inside okay that did not go as expected I don't want to touch it because it's piano black plastic which as everyone knows is the costiest material that is a very easy way to get access to it and you can see that here we have our hot swappable hard drive base so you okay you open it like that oh they really sit in there next I'm just gonna undo these screws on the back and see what happens and then it should just slide off I think I have to remove all of the cages first [Music] so there we go there we go so in here you can see our Ram slots it comes with a single four gig stick and as we all know single Channel Ram is the best for gaming performance but it's nice that we can we can upgrade that a bit later on and then in here we have our heatsink with I'm assuming the CPU under there and this kind of top caddy bit actually seems quite easy to remove so let's remove it and have a closer look at what's going on under here thank you cool so we've undone all eight million screws so now hopefully we can just kind of lift this bit off yes we can and it was pretty easy to remove because this daughter board with all of the hot swappable uh hard drive connectors connects to the main motherboard with what looks like a 4X pcie connector so it means that it just slots right out and then down on the motherboard we have the Forex pcie slot now I was thinking of trying to connect a graphics card to that slot for some proper Nas gaming the problem is that's the only way to connect storage to this motherboard and the microscopic four gigs of internal emmc storage isn't close to enough for a Windows install but yeah that is a closer look at the hardware that we're gonna use for gaming and as you can tell by the kind of heatsinks and power delivery that we have around here it looks like the kind of thing that would give a 40-90 night terrors so I'm sure the gaming will be spectacular with that it's reassembled open SSD in here and see if we can install Windows on it [Music] foreign [Music] like Press buttons apparently blindly smashing delete wasn't the play because with this Nas you use escape to get into the BIOS yes we've got a video out okay very good this is the very dossy looking bios of the of the old store but I'm gonna quickly see what happens when I try and boot off the windows that's installed on the SSD just out of curiosity was it that easy just plug a hard drive that has Windows on it in there and you're good to go it seems like it's all that needs to happen here did you look at that it's just worked and after being impressed with the power we now easily have available it was time to see how it handles some gaming no way GTA 5 at 1080p is actually running on the nas okay running may be a bit of a strong word but it's a Nast interestingly the color output of this Nas is horribly oversaturated I don't know if you can see it on camera but it looks pretty rough it was the same thing in Windows and the BIOS now that the excitement of it just launching his past this is some properly terrible gaming performance although again as is usually the case with nine ish frames per second while gaming is we do have pretty good frame pacing oh it is it is a real eyesore the way in which this is refreshing this is not oh this is not this is not great yeah this is pretty seasick inducing let's drop the resolution to 720p wow that's a lot better we've almost doubled our frame rate which shows that we don't quite have a CPU bottleneck here which is pretty cool that's unexpected for one of these low-end celerons but the RAM configuration is horrendous so so we may be able to get even more performance than this Immaculate showing once we upgrade the RAM at 800 by 400 oh oh oh oh actually never mind that worked out pretty well uh anyway whenever there's something reasonable happening on screen we dip down to about 14 frames per second so 800 by 400 is not helped much ah it's always lovely to see menus struggling that's when you know this is getting me off this is exactly what I'm looking for when it comes to to bad gaming the combination of the drops to like six frames per second and the weird color output makes this some pretty good bad gaming although honestly it's not quite as terrible as I was expecting it to be this is still relatively usable like I took a bot down there there's another bot here oh I'm not sure what was happening there I was clicking like crazy but no shooting happened for some reason okay so at 720p we're getting a decently better frame rate although there's still quite a bit of input lag and it's still not running well [Applause] um I think it's safe to say that I found this system on which DOTA is not playable maybe with a bit more RAM we'll get something that approaches playability because this is not that it really isn't but let's try a game that may run on it oh that feels very weird lots of input lag although promisingly we do have quite low CPU utilization which I guess is because it's a quad core but that means that if we drop it down from 1080p we should get a better frame rate wow we've actually got a game approaching playability this this is at 720p and the game is older than time itself but still you can you can game on an ass apparently it does cost 460 US dollars from Microcenter and for that price I'd hope you can get a hell of a lot more PC so I I wouldn't recommend going out and buying an ass for gaming but you know if you already happen to own an ass with an HDMI port you can game on it no way okay there has to be like v-sync on or solid right that's the only explanation at this point yeah vsync's on okay okay that explains it it's still not great though oh let me oh why why is my clicking not what is happening uh um and after my very reasonable response to not being able to click I realized that for some reason I couldn't both move and attack at the same time so when I stand still I can consistently attack but the moment that I move around I can't attack anymore so I need to walk up stand still and then fight them that's even if I'm not pressing move but my like the inertia is still carrying me like this look clicks still don't register what that is very weird so with Half-Life 2 not only are we getting about 50 frames per second out in the wild we also can't click and move at the same time except for every now and then randomly for some reason which was a great point to try and upgrade the RAM [Music] foreign foreign [Music] oh no the nas isn't happy with the ram upgrade and after a whole bunch of fingering in various Ram configurations the best I could get working was adding an additional 8 gig on top of the 4 Gig that was already in there the Dual Channel 16 gig kit just refused to work but I guess 12 gigs is much better than four even if it's not technically in dual Channel okay so with GTA 5 at 1080p it has made basically no difference again with cs go we continue the trend of it it not helping oh I can't shoot it's doing the the thing when I stand still I can shoot but I can't when I move oh yes check item Graphics it's still not playable but it is significantly better than it was before it clearly just wanted some extra Ram but the Improvement didn't last long okay very good that didn't last very long well wow Half-Life has benefited a huge amount we now have over a hundred frames per second the game looks good it feels good we still have the movement bug though I have to wait for him to come down the stairs because I can't shoot while I'm moving so at the end of the day weird niggles aside I guess you can kind of game on an ass which is very impressive Until you realize that this Nas cost about 500 US Dollars and for that amount surely you can buy a gaming PC that'll let you both attack and move at the same time on that note for next week's video I built a gaming PC using Amazon for less than what this Nas cost so subscribe to the channel if you want to see that Madness and until the next video bye-bye [Music] really",

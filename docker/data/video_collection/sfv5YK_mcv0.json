    "transcript": "oh The Humble laptop is Gamers it's normal life cycle involves the price being set at Birth which holds all the way through the life of the adult males until right before their deaths where they see a sharp price drop however this generation is different various factors including low demand due to poor genetics and inbreeding has led to Sharp price drops during the male's adolescent phase and in today's video we'll examine one of the victims foreign [Music] there it is oh yeah don't you just love seeing Micro Center plastered on stuff Center now as you can tell Micro Center sent over a Lenovo lag iron which despite just being about four months old you can already buy for 500 off which is just bizarre and it's not the only one current gen laptops are already on sale all over the place it's almost like someone really screwed up the pricing [Music] oh there it is that's already a good sign you can see we've got some io on the back of the laptop which is a very good place to have it and we've got some jet engine exhausts oh the power Brick's not compact is it it looks like the kind of thing you used to jump start an aircraft carrier even for a 300 watt power brick I feel like it's pretty big interestingly Lenovo laptops have their own power connector they don't use that like Roundy one that other laptops use for some reason contains 30 ocean-bound plastic by weight wow dude oh yeah Lenovo really nails that pre frostbite gray with their products it's a very specific Pacific tone whoa where I O on the back that I thought look at all of it and then we have even more USB on the left hand side again on the correct uh oh oh things are falling out and then on the other side we have another USB port with oh that little switch closes the webcam that's pretty cool and then we have a headphone microphone Jack so this laptop has four square USB ports that's really impressive oh that's quite the vent on the bottom with some reasonably tall footies to keep it off the desk so it doesn't completely choke out and in terms of rear panel removability it looks very promising because we've got just a couple screws and you can see that this back panel doesn't encroach on the i o so it's not gonna feel as destructive to open up potentially we'll have to try that out and there's still no glory hole so it's still not going to be great okay and now comes the Moment of Truth does it one hand open test pass whoa it very much does oh that's quite a plasticky top plate it's sturdy plastic it doesn't feel like garbage plastic but this laptop was supposed to cost two thousand dollars and I feel like that is not the nicest material for that price we've got nice thin bezels on the display and I think this is quite a high resolution display actually but we'll talk about that when we get to the specs and then we've got our webcam up here so it's not a nose cam okay let's give the keyboard a try is just like a decent laptop keyboard with a numpad got nothing more to say about that a nice sized trackpad and we've got full sized proper arrow keys I like that I just wish it had front-facing speakers although I guess side firing is better than down now when it comes to price again Micro Center very kindly sent this laptop over they're a great source for gaming laptops like this one that they had listed for over 500 off now in terms of specs it's a real beefy boy we've got a 13700 HX with a whole bunch of RAM and storage and an RTX 4070 but I am curious to see how it performs in gaming because it does have a higher than 1080p resolution display but on that note let's fire it up and see how it runs [Music] oh yeah honestly I'm not going to stop complaining about it until they stop putting it on laptops so I guess I'm gonna spend the rest of my life shouting about mcgaby other than that though we have pretty standard Windows 11 stuff aside from the leg ion over here here is our 13 700 HX a beast of a CPU we've gone 32 gigs of ddr5 and you can see here that it's it's two sticks very nice straight off the bat Battlefield 5 running at 2560 by 1600 because it's a 16 by 10 display at high settings the game's running really well we've got a nice display it's actually a 240 hertz display and it's looking real smooth despite the game being quite stuttery even for Battlefield V it's also not performing nearly as well as a desktop 4070 which I know because I recently tested one although a lot of that can be down to power profiles which I'll change in a second the GPU is kind of maxing out at around oh wait it just jumped up to 90 Watts there temperatures are also great and that is with not a huge amount of noise for a gaming laptop oh a whole lot more stuttering there damn it took me a while to find the power profiles in the legion software but when I did it made a difference oh there we go the power on both the CPU and the GPU is a decent bit higher now which has led to a bit more performance it's not earth-shattering but it's made a difference and you can see that the core frequency on the GPU is also a decent bit higher than it was before but so is the temperatures so it's a pretty standard given tank foreign wow cyberpunk makes this laptop work hard the fans were going to town just now although the temperatures are still pretty good for a laptop we don't have 8 000 degrees on both the graphics card and the CPU and at 2560 by 1600 High settings we're getting about 60 frames per second I then decided to see how the laptop handles Ray tracing oh no the laptop doesn't like that at all that's less than half the frame rate we were getting before Oh wait but this is a 40 series GPU right so it should be able to handle frame generation let's give that a try whoa the fake frames have made a big difference to the performance and in terms of input lag kind of feel it maybe but to be fair cyberpunk is quite a heavy feeling game on the best of days on a side note we're pretty close to maxing out our video memory which remember on a laptop 4070 is only 8 gigs and not only that it's got a memory bus of just a 128 bits which is pathetically tiny even compared to the last generation laptop 3070. so let's try again that pushes that to the Limit so this is The Last of Us running at the same resolution with high preset and we're sitting about 60 ish frames per second if we're being uh if we're being generous with it ironically this is a as I start to regain so far um it's not running with blazing High frame rates but it's pretty smooth gameplay on a side note this laptop has a great display in it the measurements won't set your prostate on fire but it's got some of the best motion rendering I've seen in a laptop display on that note let's rip it open to see how upgradeable it is like I said before I think this is going to be quite easy to open but it usually isn't so let's see how it goes [Music] oh yeah hey almost there oh yeah just just go to town apparently there you go that is quite a serious looking piece of cooling we've got going we've got some of the theokest heat pipes I've seen in a laptop around these Oh serious looking fans although it does look like we had a bit of a mod slide or a summon in here not quite sure what happened there uh but then other than that we have two m.2 Cavalry slots so let's open those up okay so then under there we have what looks like a CMOS battery and a just an empty m.2 slot for us to drop another SSD in there and we've got a cute little bit of thermal pad on the bottom of this very insignificant bit of heatsink we don't really need to interact with the ram because we have a dual channel 32 gig kit in here but I'm still interested to see if we can in fact upgrade it can it yeah yes we can so the ram isn't solder down and then we have a bunch of m.2 slots that we have available to us editors note here I wanted to be more enthusiastic about the upgrade ability it's pretty good so at the end of the day I like the legion and a thousand five hundred dollars is a lot more appealing than two thousand dollars for the same laptop which is the kind of mind-blowing Revelation you wouldn't get anywhere else and until the next video thank you for watching bye [Music] all right",

    "transcript": "you know what I feel like it's about time we do something stupid on the channel it's been a while so in today's video we're going to try and cool some CPUs with a tiny little phone cooler the phone cooler we're going to use for our terrible experiment today is this S6 I guess which I bought off temu for a recent video now the reason why you probably don't want to use a phone cooler to cool a desktop CPU is because phone chips need to be extremely efficient Apple's a15 bionic for example tops out at just over 8 watts whereas even desktops cerons and athlons use several times as much but I do have some hope for this because this cooler managed to cool the living crap out of my iPhone 13 while gaming so maybe it'll be fine and in today's video I'm going to start with an uncharacteristically reasonable use case for it first we're going to use it to cool a latte Panda which is like a big boy raspberry piie the M3 8100 y Apu in here only draws about 5 to six watts of power which is very much in line with what most phones use now I know this doesn't count as a desktop chip like I've been saying but we'll get to it so the first use case may actually not be a complete disaster but let's see let's give it a try a it's so cute and little it should be relatively straightforward to swap out coolers here and if you look on the other side if anything the S6 seems a little bit more Hefty and I'm pretty sure the S6 has a secret weapon up its sleeve but before the torture begins I think we need a baseline reading wow it's so light that the HDMI cable dominates it and once I finally figured out how the power button works on it I got my control reading and with the latte Panda just updating Windows were're already in the high 60s so it seems like the phone cooler doesn't have that much competition here now this little system I'm using halflife 2 because that's kind of the peak of what it can handle and handle is maybe a strong word but with the stock cooler and the system drawing just about 10 wats we're hovering around 65 C occasionally jumping up into 70 so let's drop this little cooler on there and see what it [Music] does oh that is adorable but I do immediately foresee an issue the CPU we're trying to make contact with is lower than a lot of the surface mounted stuff on the PCB around it so I don't know how we're going to get the cooler to make contact with it my first idea was to remove the fan and shroud of the existing in cooler so we could use that heat sink as a way to interface the phone cooler with the S so oh never mind the fan in the heat sink have very much been pair bonded for life and I don't really want to separate them so that's not going to work the only other thing I can think of is using a thick thermal pad so that we can make contact although that does feel very Savage but what we're doing is already very Savage so why not just step it up a notch you know I don't know this feels really stupid so I'm just going to stick that onto the thermal pad now to trick The Latte Panda into thinking that something terrible isn't happening to it I have left the original fan plugged in hopefully this doesn't go terribly after a quick boot it was initially looking very promising it did spike a little bit there but 50c a few moments later oh oh yeah no it's real unhappy the moment we started the moment we started half lifee 2 ooh that's really not good at this point it feels a little bit like torturing a small animal a small Panda if you will okay so that went about as poorly as expected although I am super happy to blame the thermal pad for the failure and considering that our proof of concept was a complete failure I think it makes complete sense for the next step to be upping the anti sign ific anly our next victim is a ryzen 3 5300 G TDP wise this is a huge step up from the little latte Panda but it's got a nice flat surface on the top which should give us very even mounting with the little phone cooler which may make up for the huge difference in power [Music] maybe and then in terms of reference cooler we're using this wraith stealth because it comes with a 5300 G and I think it makes sense and this significant disparity in endowment does really put the size of the challenge into perspective let's see how it goes whoa the little wraith stealth is holding up very well with the CPU topping out at about 42 watts of power drill which isn't a huge amount but we're getting 56c on the CPU after a while of gaming on what is essentially a free cooler that's pretty good which finally makes a time for our borderline criminal negligence now this feels wildly stupid but I want to initially use it in the same way that it's used on the back of a phone so I'm just going to stick this down onto the the CPU I'm not going to use a thermal interface because that's not how it works on a phone so no Tim just bear back so I guess this just goes like that well if that doesn't look like it's going to cause a small fire I don't know what does I guess I just quickly boot it and hope that the 3 mg of copper doesn't heat soak by the time we're by the time we're playing Battlefield 5 let's see well good news and bad news the bad news is that we're not even in the game yet and we're basically at 100 C but the good news is that the little AMD CPU does have quite a will to live because it's reduced its power draw quite a lot already uh we have lost about 30 frames per second going from the normal cooler to this and uh but other than that the fact that it hasn't exploded yet is kind of impressive considering that it basically couldn't deal with that 8ish watt latte Panda CPU so I'm I'm kind of impressed I'm not going to lie this is a very playable gaming experience I wouldn't say that this is a sustain stainable performance we're getting here but it it is actually working and remember this is still without thermal paste so yeah let's add that and see how much it helps okay so we're at 96 pretty much immediately after we've loaded in but we're above 30 WT it then immediately started creeping down to about 24 Watts where it stabilized dude it's actually kind of taking it we're getting 100 frames per second on Battlefield 5 p pound for pound this little phone cooler is a complete Beast which I think means we should quickly open it up and see what magic it employs for this very impressive [Music] performance yep there's a little Pelt here this phone cooler has a Thermal electric element in it for some reason and that's why despite its size it's remarkably powerful and in this is the ring of magnets that makes it stick to the plate that you glue to the back of your phone it is surprisingly effective at this scale and it makes me really want to play around with some pel let me know if you want to see videos on that uh in the comments down below and with that thank you very much for watching and until the next video [Music] bye-bye",

    "transcript": "- Yo guys, so second generation air pods are officially out. I've compared them against Galaxy buds but today, we are going in the complete opposite direction and stacking them up against these 18 dollar air pod clones that come in multiple colors, space gray and matte black included. And honestly, my thoughts on these have been all over the place. (upbeat percussion music) Now I've seen these as cheap as 16 dollars in change. This though is the exact model that I ordered for 18 dollars and 80 cents. And surprisingly, you can actually score free shipping on these. It takes a while, they smack it to a raven, three to four weeks later you get your i88 Tws, but hey at least it's free. Hands down though, my favorite thing about these clones is gotta be the promo video on the website. It's all kinds of ridiculous. It looks like your traditional top down how-to tack video with a twist though. The soundtrack honestly sounds like the trailer to Air buds 17. The only thing missing is a voice over. Are you tired of wired headsets always dropping off during sports? With biceps rivaling Austin Evans, clearly this chick is. That's not mean, right? She's got some vascularity. Wanna enjoy music when driving? I'm not sure if wearing two air pods in your ears is legal, but I don't think the rules apply to this cool entrepreneurial dude with the wind flying through his hair in that car. He's probably listening to Gary V. In one ear and a Ted Talk in the other. Have you tried of many earphones and failed to meet your music require- This guy sure has. Get i88 Tws true wireless earbuds, bring a full new music experience. If you don't wanna pick these up after that, I don't know what else will sell you. Back to my thoughts, kinda getting all over the place though. First off, you get these in and the build quality feels like they are 18 dollars worth. It's really, really cheap plastic. Honestly the flip cap, I'm not sure how long this is going to last. Like if you're Austin Evans with that bicep or that chick, you snap this open, that thing might fly off. - That doesn't sound good. Alright, here we go. Oh wow, that was really easy. That was getting much harder. Actually, you know what? With the magnet, it totally works like that. See I just improved your air pods. Don't you wish the real air pods were like- Nah, no one wishes this, this is dumb. - Honestly the plastic is so cheap and light, that it almost feels like the air pod clones aren't in the case even while they're there. Which is a mind trip and you don't wanna lose these things and put that kind of work load on that poor raven. Now, one of the beautiful things with air pods going back to the original, is how easy it is to connect to your phone. Flip open the cap, couple of taps and you're good to go. With these, it's not quite as simple but still really easy. Just flip open the cap, assuming you don't break it, you're gonna see flashing lights that's gonna let you know it's in pairing mode, you then head into blue tooth settings, tap connect, and what's awesome is it's going to automatically connect both earbuds at the same time because with certain clones you have to deal with pairing one then the other, then the first comes unpaired, and you're pissed and you break 'em. With these though, you don't have to out yourself through that frustration it's just a really simple process. - Oh that works really quickly actually. Surprisingly fast. - By far, in expectations with these honestly weren't that high especially because they're 18 dollars, like what would you expect for 18 dollar air pod clones. And my immediate reaction when I popped these in my ears, listened to music was, these kinda sound like those cheap earbuds they give you on airplanes, where you're like, \"nah I'm good, I'd rather listen to the engine. Then I kinda came back to reality and was like, yo dummy stop judging these so harshly, they are 18 dollars, what do you actually expect. And when I listened to 'em a little bit more, again, they're not great, they don't sound amazing, honestly I think the review on the website kinda sounds (unclear). The colors are red. And I would have to agree with them, sound quality for listening to music is acceptable. It kinda feel like air pods and I never thought I would say this but like, air pods without low-end because we know air pods, they don't have a ton of low-end to begin with, but with this, it kinda feels like air pods and someone just sucked out all the bass. - There's definitely no bass though. Like guitars are distorting a little bit even. But, um, I mean for 18 bucks, I guess they're not bad. - I mean, they're loud, um, there's not a lot of bass is probably my main criticism but, eh, they're not that bad. - It's like when you hear the P.A. radio in like a department store or something, like, it's exactly what it sounds like. But, I guess, for convenience sake it might actually not be that bad. Now in the website, they list so many features, just like completely off the map. But apparently the i88 clone hates the iw10 because they had this boxing dude just Batman style powing the i10 clones, which is just weird. But if you look on that list, it does state that there is wireless charging with these clones, and I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, I've tried pretty much every pair that I order, and could not get wireless charging to work. So, what's going on guys? Future John checking in, you could also hold tap to activate hey Siri. - But I did that and it sucked. - But we're telling a story. - I mean, it works it just sucks. - I know Evans but I didn't talk about it. - Oh, okay. - How to make YouTube videos. - Yeah. - [John] The other weird thing is in the manual it shows that it charges through USB C. Clearly though, this is our old friend Mr. Micro USB. Which is a little weird to see on an air pod case but again it comes back to the mindset that hey, these are 18 dollar clones, with free raven shipping, you can't judge these things too hard. Over all, I've kinda come full circle on these, they're not a lot of money so maybe if you don't wanna drop 200 bucks on a pair of air pods for your kids , then they're a great option. You might have someone who's clumsy or loses things, you might have like five kids (inaudible) style. And hey, I kinda like the fact that they come in different colors, so that way if Billy loses his matte black pair he's not gonna try and switch it with Kens blue pair, no Billy, those were yours, you lost them, I'm not waiting for a raven again. So if you're sold on these or you got a kid named Billy, links to these are down below along with coverage on the Galaxy Fold, got a chance to check it out before they pulled it away from us. So drop a like for Billy and his long lost matte black air pod clones. Thank you guys for watching, this is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later. Uh, let's take one of John's bull (bleep) video, bull (bleep).",

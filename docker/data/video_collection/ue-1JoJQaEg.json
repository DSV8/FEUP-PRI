    "transcript": "[click] intense music [Welcome to the Theatre of Magic!] I love pinball. The sights, the sounds, the physical nature of actual stuff happeningin front of you and not just on a video screen have long appealed to me. In fact, foras long as I can remember. Of course, a big draw to me is that these machines are... well,machines. And wondrous machines at that! A pinball machine is a fascinating tribute to humanity - artists, musicians, game designers and even voice actors work alongside machinists, fabricators,craftspeople, and engineers to manufacture these elaborate contraptions made purely for ouramusement. Well, and to gobble up our quarters. [dramatic organ music] With so much going on inside one of these, even just siding idle, you might have wonderedhow they work. Luckily, somebody gave me the keys to this machine so we can take lookinside. [music stops] Its its a computer. Theres a computer in here. It keeps track of where the ball is, shows you your score on this display, playsmusic and sound effects through speakers, and lights up all the various light bulbs theyneed to be lit. How very modern. But pinball goes much further back than this. Andnot even twenty years prior to this machine leaving the factory, pinball machines didntfeature any integrated circuits of any kind. This is Aztec by Williams. Built in 1976,this machine hails from the tail end of the electromechanical era. It wouldnt be long beforemanufacturers started tinkering with electronic controls, in fact 10 copies of this very gamewere built as prototypes for the Williams System 2 microprocessor unit. This one, though, well itsa little more old-school. And today, Im gonna show you what makes it tick. [ticking sounds,five-at-a-time] Seriously, why is it ticking? To find out, well have to look inside. This timeit opens from the back, and once you remove this panel you wont see anything that looks like acomputer - in fact youll find an unholy mess of wires linking quite the assortment of oddballassemblies together. And this isnt even the half of it! Inside the main cabinet under the playfieldtheres even more. We get in there by opening the coin door, pulling this lever which releases thelockdown bar (thats this large metal piece at the front edge of the cabinet), then once we removethe lockdown bar by lifting up on it, we can slide the glass out and the playfield will simplylift right up. Theres even a handy prop rod! Now that were in, we see even more wires and evenmore stuff. And thats not even the whole of it! Some of the control mechanisms are attached tothe underside of the playfield. Each and every one of these devices is critical for the functionand logic of this game. While this is nowhere near as complex as Theatre of Magic, theres still alot going on. Theres a full-on ruleset and series of goals in this game: different targets lightthe letters A, Z, T, E, and C. Light them all up and theres a chance for an extra ball. Theresa bonus added for hitting certain targets which is awarded at the end of each ball. And if you hitthe right targets you can double the bonus value. Theres more, too. If you complete AZTEC andfill the bonus ladder up to 50,000 points, that lights a Special which awards a freegame. And which outlane is lit will flip back and forth as you hit other targets. Youcan also win replays based on your score, and thats configurable. Some of the rulescan even be changed - winning a special can award an extra ball instead of a replay, andthere are even three difficulty settings which change how many targets need to be hitbefore other opportunities are awarded. But aside from rules and features, the machinealso needs to keep track of which ball is in play and thus how far you are along the game (ohand by the way you can choose whether you want three balls per game or five). It has to end thegame when its over and disable the playfield, and when a new one is started it needsto reset the scores to zero. Plus, up to four people can play this game. Itsfun to compete! So it needs to keep track of which player is up, and only change thatplayers score when its their turn. Somehow thats all being accomplished with this rats nest of wires and stuff! How? Why, its easy - just look at this schematic. Im sure you can figure it out! Im kidding, of course - and even if you studied thisfor hours, its not gonna make any sense unless you understand what these partsare doing and how they work together. So, since youre all watching, I supposeits my job to explain what these parts are doing and how they work together. Wellstart with the basics and work our way up. And were gonna go way back to basics with a bitof history. But just a bit, I promise. Pinball is called \"pinball\" because in the earliest days it was a simple game of balls and pins. An evolution of the French game bagatelle, early games werevery simple. Marbles rolled down a board set at an angle with pins nailed into the face. Those pinswould create obstacles that deflected the motion of the rolling balls and would often form goalsworth points. Games like this were made going back to the 18th century, but they would remainobscure toys for the wealthy for many years. Then, some time around the great depression, some clever folks devised ways to automate the game and turn it into a machine (albeit avery simple one). David Gottlieb designed Baffle Ball in 1931 which is widely regarded as the firstcommercially-successful pinball game. I dont have one to show you but I do have Microsoft PinballArcade! Baffle Ball was a simple baseball-themed (I guess) marble game with the twist of beingcoin-operated. When the coin slide was pushed in, trap-doors in the goals would open allowing theballs to fall down into the machine and collect at the ball shooter. Then the player had theirfun. These early games were purely mechanical, featured manual scoring, were meant togo atop a table or other such surface, and started showing up in bars and parlors allacross the country. And plenty of gambling based on your score occurred, too, butthats a story for a different time. Baffle Ball was so successful that it spawnedplenty of imitators such as Ballyhoo - which, by the way, was so successful the company that produced it would rename itself Bally. With a variety of games for players to choose from, companies making pinball machines scrambled to add new features in order to make theirs standout. Features like bumpers, electric lights, automatic scoring, and eventually moveablebumpers in the players control. It was none other than D. Gottlieb & Company thatintroduced electromechanical flippers in 1947s Humpty Dumpty. While the arrangementof the flippers on the playfield is certainly odd by modern tastes, this machine set newand enduring standards for pinball. And, 29 years later, one of Gottliebs mainrivals, Williams, would release this machine. Aztec. The one Im standing behind andthat this video is principally about. That one. First, lets look at what the player sees. Theplayfield is still just a wooden board with things attached to it that a ball rolls aroundon. But now a variety of targets, obstacles, bumpers, plenty of lights, and lets notforget flippers make the game fast-paced, visually interesting, and addictive. As with most pinball machines, the playfield is slightly off-center as theright hand side of the machine is taken up by the shooter lane. That sends the ball up tothe top of the playfield using a player-operated plunger, just like the earliest games. Asimple gauge is printed on the shooter to help the player hit the ball with consistent force. Depending on the games design, the strength of the initial plunge may be important, and manygames feature a deliberate element known as a skill shot where extra points are awardedif you get the plunge strength just right. Now youll notice that there are fairly largeobstacles which block off parts of the playfield. This is done mainly to define paths the ball mightor, in some cases, must take. These can be created in a number of ways but the most common is plasticposts fastened to the playfield which are then fitted with rubber rings. Large rings may be stretchedacross two or more posts to create a linear barrier, but youll find plenty of individualposts with their own rings, too. The rubber rings make the ball bounce off these obstacles, often unpredictably, and some of the larger barriers will award 10 points when hit. To fill theotherwise blank areas of the playfield created by the obstacles, decorative plastic pieces printedwith graphics matching the games theme are placed atop the posts. This also helps visually definethe shape of the off-limits areas. Underneath the plastics youll find small incandescent lightbulbs. This is the only safe place to put em since the ball cant hit them, and they illuminatethe playfield to allow for play in a dark room. All things considered, this is a pretty simplelayout with a small number and variety of targets. Aside from the various 10 point bumpers, thisgame features three rollover buttons, eight rollover lanes, six stand-up targets, one spinningtarget, one kickback lane, two slingshot kickers, and three pop bumpers (though Williams wouldprefer you call them Jet Bumpers for trademark reasons). All of these award points whentheyre hit, but they often do something else, too - or change how many points they award. But for now, lets just focus on the points. The game shows you your score on the backglass with these mechanical readouts called score reels. Oh, by the way, this backglass isnt in very goodshape but Ive got a reproduction replacement. Ive just not gotten around to ordering the rightpiece of glass for it yet. Anyway, see if you can spot a fun little trick manufacturers were doinground this time. Look at the front. And now the back. Do you see whats off? Look at the frontagain. There are six digits in the score. But look at the back and there are only five score reelsper player. The last digit of the readout is, in fact, fake and is there only to inflate thescore. But! Williams went through the trouble of printing the bottom of the 9 and the top of the 1on the dummy reel which makes it quite convincing. Heres a spare score reel, or drum unit asWilliams calls it, we can look at up close. Its a fairly simple device: just a large plastic drumwith the digits zero through nine printed on its edge and a ratcheting mechanism to advance the position of the drum by one tenth of a rotation. A small solenoid (a type of electromagnet) pulls ona plunger when electric current runs through it, and that advances the mechanism by one step. Bythe way, I hope you like electromagnets cause this machine is chock full of em. The gamescircuitry runs on 24 volts AC produced by this lump of a transformer sitting in the bottomwhich also produces 6 volts for all the lamps. All of the targets the ball can hit that awardpoints are merely simple switches. When the game is on and in-play, those switches become wiredto the scoring mechanism. Take these 100 point rollover buttons for example. They literally arebuttons and beneath the playfield two electrical contacts become pressed together when the buttonis depressed by the weight of the ball. You might guess that these 100 point buttons are wired to the score reel in the hundreds position, and sure enough when I press it [clack/ding] that reel advances by one step. But thats not all that happened. A bell rang at the same time. Sitting in the cabinet near the coin door is the chime unit. This is a unit with chimes. Each of its three chimes has a solenoid sitting below it and when power is sent to the coil itflings a plunger up into the chime which gives it a right smack. [Three dings, a la the NBCtheme] That certainly rings a bell. Since two solenoids were fired with one switch - solenoidsthat draw a lot of current and are located in two very different places - the switch on theplayfield isnt whats powering them. Instead, the playfield switch powers a relay. Specifically,the 100 point relay which lives in the backbox. Relays are switches that are actuatedwith - wait for it - an electromagnet! A coil of wire creates a magnetic field whenits energized which pulls on an armature, and that in turn actuates a series ofswitches. Sometimes relays are simple, and sometimes theyre not. In pinball machineslike this, ** theyre not ** Pinball pushes relays to their conceptual limit using them to createthe game logic and do countless other tasks, but thats a big part of why I like these machines so much. Notice that some of these switches are normally open and the contacts close when therelay is energized, but some of them are just the opposite. Theres even a third option - make/breakswitches. Well see some of those later. In this case, the switch on the playfield, since it was worth 100 points, completed a circuit to energize the 100 point relay. Whenthat pulled on its armature, these two switch contacts closed which completed a circuit bothto the hundreds position score reel and the small chime. All of the targets worth 100 points havetheir switches wired in parallel so that theyll all activate this relay when hit. And all thatarcing we see is precisely why the game uses a relay and not the switches on the playfield. Seemssimple enough, but there are many more switches on this relay than just the two that bump thescore reel and chime. In fact there are six. One of these additional switches is there toensure the score reel actually moves. Solenoids are fast, but theyre not instantaneous. Ifthe ball just brushes up against a target, the contact time may have been too brief for thesolenoid in the score reel to pull completely on the plunger and actually advance it to the nextnumber. So, these two contacts actually provide a way for the relay to power itself. If I bridgethem with a screwdriver youll see it pull in. On its own this would be useless - the momentany 100 point target were hit the relay would lock itself on and be stuck. But thatcircuit path travels through a switch on the score reel called the end-of-strokeswitch. This is normally closed allowing power to flow through but opens oncethe solenoid has reached the end of itstravel. At that point it breaks the circuitpowering the relay, so the relay lets go. Heres what that looks like on theschematic for the machine. Full disclosure, Ive made some alterations to this and hidden afair bit because some of whats visible here is very confusing without context I havent givenyou yet and its not important right now. When reading the schematic, power flows across the page and a circuit is active when theres a complete path from the left to the right (though its AC soit flows in both directions). The 100 point relay coil is right here. It will become energized whenany of these switches close. Theyre labeled to indicate what and where they are, and sureenough those are things worth 100 points. But this switch is labeled \"100 point relay.\" That means its a switch within that relay, and the symbol means its a normally openswitch. So, it closes when the relay energizes, and since it also provides power to the relaycoil, it provides that bypass which keeps the coil energized even when input from the otherswitches is lost. But that switch is itself wired in series with all of these normally-closedswitches on the score reels. Those are the end-of-stroke switches we were just lookingat, so once the solenoid on whichever reel its trying to fire has actually fired, the relaywill lose that bypass signal and de-energize. Another contact in the relay has to do with thenumber 9. The score reels are not mechanically linked - each one operates entirely independentlyof the others. But if you have 900 points and score an additional one hundred, according to thelaws of math youll have 1,000 so two reels have to move in order to display that sum. [dings] They do - and did you notice that two bells rang this time? [ding ding ding dongs] This switchin the 100 point relay will actually cause the 1,000 point relay to energize as well - but onlywhen the 100 point score reel is on the number 9. Look back at the score reel and youll find astack of switches (which we call a switch stack, oddly enough) sitting near the top. Thisswitch is normally open, but a pivoting mechanism actuates the switch stack at the nineposition and closes that switch. When its closed, an interlock is created between the 100point relay and the 1,000 point relay. Take a look at the schematic again. These arethe 9th position switches on the score reels, and youll see that they connect to thatswitch within the 100 point relay. If the score reel switch on the player thats up is closed, meaning the 100 point score reel is showing a 9, then the next time the 100 point relayfires, power will also get sent through to this switch and up to the 1,000 point relaycoil, therefore the two relays will firetogether. All of the succeeding score reelshave this interlock, so a score of 99,990 will correctly roll to 100,000 when a single 10-pointbumper is hit. [three chimes and a loud clack] Speaking of the 10-point bumpers, nowsa good time to go over the various target types on the playfield. When a rubberring is stretched across two posts, so long as the distance is sufficient a switchwill be tucked behind that ring. The contacts are slightly separated but will get pushedtogether when the ball stretches the ring, sending power to the 10 point relay which advancesthe 10 point score reel, rings a bell, and also steps the number match unit... Dont worry aboutthat yet. Uh, theres a lot going on in here! The stand-up targets throughout the playfield are essentially the same thing as all the 10-point bumpers, but one of the switch contacts isattached to the face of the target. The gap between the contacts here is important; a widergap will require the ball to hit the target with more force in order for that hit to register. But if theyre too close, simply brushing against the target will register as a hit. So itsgenerally best to be somewhere in the middle. The rollover lanes are essentially the same thingas the rollover buttons, but instead of a button, a formed piece of wire sticks up through a slotin the playfield. When that wire is depressed by the ball, switch contacts below the playfieldare pushed together which adds the points. Generally the ball can travel over these ineither direction, but youll notice that the designers had an evil streak with the outlanes. Those have their trip-wires formed such that it will only allow the ball to travel down towardsthe drain. Should you happen to get very lucky and have the ball bounce off the apron and rollup the outlane, which does happen occasionally, unless its going very fast it will just bonk into this and fall back down. Boo! The spinning target, while very different in itsexecution, is similar to the rollover lanes. The metal plate that the ball hits is attachedto an eccentric axle? I guess? And a wire linkage connected to the right hand side goes below the playfield through a small hole. When the target rotates, thatlinkage is repeatedly pulled up and down which in turn pulls on a leaf switch, repeatedly connecting and disconnecting the two contacts as it spins. When this targetis hit just right, its quite the show. [rapid clacking and dinging] But not quite the show that the pop bump- I meanjet bumpers can put on. Pioneered by Williams in 1948, these jet bumpers repel the ball at highspeed when theyre hit. Theyre triggered by a circular platform known as the skirt. This isattached to a stick resting in a bowl below the playfield. While rather silly at first glance, this arrangement means that no matter where the ball should hit the skirt, the stick willpivot which in turn pushes the bowl downward thereby pushing these two switch contactstogether. That provides power to the solenoid beneath the playfield which pulls down on thisangled metal ring that floats above the skirt. When that occurs, the ball finds itselfbetween that ring and the skirt. Solenoids are quite fast so the ring immediately comes crashing down and makes contact with the ball. Since the ring is angled at roughly 45degrees, the ball gets flung away from the bumper. This is a very rough processand since the playfield is made of wood, a mylar protective sheet is installed aroundthe bumper to minimize damage. This wasnt always standard practice, though, so many oldergames exhibit severe wear around the bumpers. If you noticed the second switch down belowthe jet bumper, that is what actually registers points. Its just like the targets weve beenlooking at, but hidden away and activated by the movement of the bumper ring and not the ballitself. Not all games work like this, though - sometimes a pop bumper relay is used, activated bythe skirt, which locks on in a similar fashion to the points relays we looked at earlier. A contactwithin that pop bumper relay awards points, and this switch serves as an end-of-stroke switch to release the relay after the bumper has fired. That approach has pros and cons and Williamsopted to power the solenoid directly from the bumper skirt switch. The main downside of thisapproach is that occasionally the ball will just brush against the bumper, so it kinda-sortahalf-fires and it doesnt award points. And finally, we have the slingshots. Thesedastardly things are hardly a target worth hitting as they only score 10 points, and theyhave a nasty habit of flinging the ball right into the outlanes. Theyre made up of three postsarranged in a triangle with a large rubber ring stretched across all three. In the center of thelong edge is a kicker just behind the rubber ring. The kicker is flanked on either side by two switchcontacts. When the ball hits the rubber ring and either of those switches close, power is sent toa solenoid below which pushes the kicker outward, stretching the rubber ring and flingingthe ball away. Just like the pop bumpers, its a switch below the playfield that actuallyregisters points when the kicker has moved, and the switches behind the rubberonly provide power to the solenoid. Oh, right, I forgot about the kickbacklane here. This thing is sort of a combo of the slingshot kicker and a rolloverlane. The ball lands on a trip wire, and after points are awarded a solenoid belowthe playfield fires which bonks the ball back up. An interesting twist with this machine is that the pop bumpers and slingshot solenoids are provided with DC power. A bridge rectifierand capacitor are attached to the underside of the playfield which means that there is in facta single semiconductor in this machine! Or four depending on how you wanna define things. Itturns out that solenoids powered by DC can be stronger than AC-powered ones, and Williamsbegan tinkering with them around this time. Only the pop bumpers and slingshots arepowered through the rectifier, though, as you can see in the schematic. Everything else,including the flippers, is powered by 24 volts AC. And why dont we talk about the flippers? As with pretty much everything that moves, theyre powered by a solenoid. But in this casetheyre controlled by the player with buttons on the side of the cabinet. Those buttons simplypush the contacts of a leaf switch together which sends power to the flipper coils. Then they pullon a linkage, and the flipper bat pops up. Flipper coils, though, are unique. See, a strong solenoidneeds quite a lot of power. That means they get hot over time. For every other solenoid in themachine, thats not much of a problem because theyre only activated in short bursts. Butthe flippers are controlled by the player, and that player might just want to holdthe flippers up in order to catch the ball. That could cause the coils to overheat. And coilsthat overheat tend to get melty, then smoky, and on rare occasions, firy. Slow-blow fusesthroughout the cabinet should prevent a serious problem like a fire in the event that a coilbecomes locked on (which can happen) but we want the flippers to be able to stay up withoutcausing any trouble. So, if you look carefully at the flipper coil, youll see that it has threeterminals. The long coil of wire that actually makes the solenoid has a connection in its middle which allows it to function at two power levels. When the flipper is at rest, the button sendspower to the coil through the center tap. This bypasses half of the coils length, reducingthe number of turns of wire that current flows through which makes the solenoid more powerful. That might seem backwards but thats just how solenoids work. But once it reaches the endof its travel, it opens this switch: another end-of-stroke switch. That removes power fromthe center tap, meaning current must now travel through the entire length of the solenoid wire. This reduces the current flowing through and the strength of the solenoid and allows it tostay energized without burning up. And for a demonstration of this principle, observethe change in sound as I force the flipper bat down while holding in the button. [buzz BZZTTZZTTZZZ buzz BZZTTZZTTZZZ buzz BRRRRRGGGGGHHH buzz BRRRRGHHHHH buzz] The lights in the machine even dim whileI do this - its a lot of current! At this point, weve looked at howeverything on the playfield works, weve seen how the machine shows you yourscore, and weve seen how points get added to it. But the machine is doing a heckuva a lotmore than simply adding point values together. Which you might have been able to tell by allthe stuff inside. There are layers and layers of complexity built atop the basic scoringfunctions. For instance, the machine has to know how to count. You get three balls per gameand then it ends. It also needs to know how many players there are and change which set of scorereels is active after each ball but also not do that if the current player scored an extra balland gets to shoot again. Then theres the bonus ladder I referenced earlier which always startsat five thousand points, but can be advanced when you hit certain targets in increments of 5,000. And I think thats agood place to move to next: the number five. Here, watch this. [bell rings five times] Howon earth do you suppose that happened? I hit a switch just once, but the score reel moved five times all on its own. [ding ding ding ding ding] Well, remember that ticking it was doing in the beginning? Perhaps you noticedit happened in groups of five. Listen again. [clacking noises in quintuplets, plus a humming sound] Turns out the number 5 appears all over the place. This target is worth five hundred points, this lane scores 5,000, as does the kickback target. The bonus values increment in steps of 5,000 points. And then theres this thing's name: AZTEC. Thathas five letters in it. And some of the targets will award points based on how many of thosefive letters are lit. How... how is it doing all that? And why does everything happen in fives? Well,its time I introduce you to the score motor. This wonky looking contraption is the closest thing this machine has to a central processing unit. The score motor consists of an electricmotor which, through a speed-reduction gearbox, slowly rotates a series of eight camsupon which rest a ridiculous number ofswitches in eight stacks. The stacks, fromleft to right, are called index, one, two, three, four, five, impulse, and impulseforward. Incidentally impulse forward just has a single switch which isused only in the reset sequence. Ah, sequence - what a good word! That ispretty much the whole idea of the score motor. It allows things to happen automaticallyin a sequence. On every one of the eight cams there are a series of divots or bumps. These will actuate the switch stacks as the cam rotates: either the stack will briefly fallinto the divot and the switches within will make or break contact as they move, or, in thecase of the two impulse cams at the far right, a series of bumps will push up on the switchstack which accomplishes the same thing. The cams one through five are all offset such that theswitches they actuate will be bumped in-sequence, one two three four five, and impulse and impulseforward are bumped five times with every rotation. The index cam on the far left is critical for thescore motors functions. The switch on the top of this stack is the Motor Run switch. Its much likethe self-powering interlocks weve been looking at in other relays. When closed, it provides powerto the motor and thus it will run - and crucially, that switch is closed whenever the motor isout of its parked position. Once it gets back to the park position, the switch stackfalls into the divot, that switch opens, and the motor stops. In practice, thismeans that if anything should cause the motor to start moving, it will keep itselfmoving until its made a complete cycle. It even works if I just push on it. [rapid clicking and motor noise] But youllnotice that when I did that [chickachickachickachickachickachunk] nothing happened. This is whats both very confusing and completelycritical to understand about electromechanical systems like this. With the exception of themotor run switch, the rest of these switches arent connected to anything even when thegame is on and in-play. Theyre just there, clicking away without accomplishing a thing because the wire's they're connected to hit dead ends. It takes two to tango, and to makesomething happen the machine performs a dance where it constantly rewires itself on thefly. And what does it use to make that happen? Thats right, relays! Thats why there are somany of them in this machine. To actually make something occur, you need a relay to connectthese bouncing switches to other things in the machine that way theyll, yknow, do stuff. Take this rollover worth 5,000 points as an example. Youll never guess what the 5,000 pointrollover switch completes a circuit to. Its none other than the 5,000 point relay which liveson the underside of the playfield. This relay has three switch contacts which all connect tothe score motor. The switch on the right sends power to the motor to start it turning whichyou can observe when I bridge the contacts. [motor runs in bursts] The switch on the left is yet anotherrelay interlock. The rollover switch is what sends the initial power to the relay coil to energize it, [CLACK] but once these contacts are touching, the relaykeeps itself powered. If I bridge these contacts, youll see the relay pull in and lock itself on. If this feels familiar, well its doing the same thing as the switches on the points relays in thebackbox: it keeps the relay energized until its task is actually complete. And right now, Ivedisabled the score motor. Since its not moving, this relay cannot complete its task andthe machine is locked up in this state. Its task, remember, is to add 5,000 points tothe score. And the middle contact in the relay is what makes that possible. When closed, thisconnects the 1,000 point relay in the backbox to this switch on top of the impulse cam of thescore motor. When I plug the score motor back in, the cams begin rotating and since the impulsecam actuates its switch stack five times, the 1,000 point relay will receive five pulsesthrough this switch. [five clacks and dings] And right after it sends the fifth pulse, the relay lets go. Thatsbecause the relays interlock is connected through a normally-closed switch oncam five. Once cam five is actuated, that switch is broken so the relay releases. And now the machine is at rest. This happens very quickly (which is incidentallythe point) so its kind of hard to keep track of. However, I can slowly rotate the scoremotor by hand so we can observe each individual action occur. Once the 5,000 point relay becomesenergized, it locks on by keeping itself powered through a switch on cam five. It also connectsthe impulse switch through to the 1,000 point relay. As I turn this, we hear the machine dingingand buzzing every time this switch stack pops up. But the relays still locked on because cam 5 hasn't been actuated yet. When that switch stack falls into the divot, we hear a click as the relayloses power and lets go. [buzz/ding.... clunk] [ding] [clunk] [ding/buzzzzz] [clunk] [click] As you can imagine, the timing here is critical and the camsare aligned so that the fifth bump of the impulse switch happens just before cam 5actuates its switches (which also happens just before we get back to the startpoint and the index switch actuates.) With the score motor re-enabled, thisall happens quickly and automatically. I hope you can appreciate how amazinglybonkers this is. And that was one of the simplest relays in the machine causingit to do one of the simplest automatedtasks it can do. Weve still gota bajillion relays to look at, plus a solid 32 other switches in the scoremotor, and were how long into this video? Yeah, I cant cover how everything works in thismachine, let alone in a single go. So there will definitely be a second part. But before weconclude here, lets talk about the AZTEC targets, how they light up their respective letters, and why that changes what other targets do. By now, I hope you know what the switches inthese targets send power to. Say it with me now, relays! And Williams was kind enough tomount them in order on this support below the playfield. Heres the A relay, the Z relay, theT relay, the E relay, and the C relay. For now, lets just focus on the A relay. This single relayfeatures all three kinds of switch contacts. The three leftmost switches are normally open, and asthe relay pulls on its armature the contacts are pushed together. Then we have a normally closedswitch - this one does just the opposite. But the two on the right are make/break switches. The relay moves the center blade, and instead of turning something on or off, it redirectsthe flow of power from one place to another. Like the 5,000 point relay we just looked at, this relay will power itself once it has been actuated. As soon as the left hand switchmakes contact, it provides a power bypass and the relay becomes locked on. And thisrelay will stay locked on until the end of the ball-in-play. The next three switches haveto do with the center target and the kickback lane - Ill get back those in a moment. The twoswitches on the end, the make/break switches, change the machines behavior andappearance once the A target has been hit. The A rollover lane is marked Lites A, 1000, andLites Spinning Target. Obviously that means it lights some things up, but it also makes thislight go out. Its this make/break switch that changes which lights are lit. Before I hit thetarget, 6 volts was sent to the right-hand contact which illuminated the lamp above the lane. Butonce I hit it and the relay locked on, power was redirected to the contact on the left whichleads to the two A lamps as well as the spinner. Lighting the spinner target changed its pointvalue from 100 to 1,000 points. How? Well, that's what the other make/break switchdid. It disconnected the spinner from the 100 point relay and connected itinstead to the 1,000 point relay. Now, I could just tell you that, but youmight have noticed that the wires in this machine are color-coded so you cantrace where they go. Lets follow their path. This is the spinning target switch. When closed,it sends power out this gray wire with a red stripe. It ends up bundled in the harness andcomes back out right here at the relay. There, its sent out either through the whitewire with a red trace on the right or the brown wire with a yellow trace on the left. Those wires re-enter the harness, split out towards the back into this small bundle that'sconnected through a Jones plug to the backbox, and sure enough those two wires eventuallyend up at the coils of the 100 and 1,000 point relays. Which one is connected dependson whether or not the relay is energized. And here's what that looks like on theschematic. Power is sent through the spinner switch on the grey and red wire. That ends up at the make/break switch in the A relay. The normally closed contactconnects over to the 100 point relay, so the spinning switch will send power therewhen closed. But, when the A relay is energized, power is redirected to the brown and yellowwire which connects up to the 1,000 point relay. But the spinning target is only one of threetargets that the A relay will change in value. Theres also the center target and the kickbacklane. Those targets are worth a set value when none of the letters are lit, but if even a singleletter is lit theyre worth more points - in fact, more for every letter thats lit. In the case ofthe center target, its 1,000 points for each lit letter, and the kickback lane awards 10,000 pointsfor each lit letter. That means that, technically, the targets have six possible values each. Howcan this sort of circuitry possibly manage that? Well, its actually simpler than it might seem. Lets look at the center target first. The center target switch sends power to the center target relay, of course, which is similar to the the 5,000 point relay we lookedat earlier. Once powered it locks itself on, starts the score motor spinning, hooks the 100 point relayup to the impulse switch on the score motor, and releases just after the fifth pulse ofthe 100 point relay. Thus, it adds 500 points to the score. But look at the circuit path on the schematic. Power comes through the impulse switch here, then we have to follow a grey andwhite wire to B-19 - uh, here it is, and then it has to go through all of thesenormally closed switches before it makes it to the 100 point relay. If theyre allclosed, then were fine - the 100 point relay will be pulsed five times and we getthose 500 points added to the score. But if any one of the AZTEC letter targets has beenhit, its respective switch in its relay is open, and since all those switches are wired in series, this circuit path is broken. So it no longer works. Ah, but we get 1000 points for every letterthats lit. And we just have to move a little ways up on the schematic to see how that works. Here again we see switches in the A, Z, T, E, and C relays. These are normally open, but closewhen their respective relay is energized. And right above them we see switches in a circle. This is how the schematic tells us those are in the score motor. And the notation tells us wherein the score motor those switches are. The A relay is connected through the index stack, switch B (thats the second switch from the bottom). The Z relay through stack one, switch A (the bottomswitch in the stack). The T relay through stack 2, switch A. The E relay through stack 3, switchA. And the C relay through stack 4, switch A. We already know that those switch stacks areactuated by the score motor one at a time in order. So you can imagine whats happening hereas a sort of scanning sequence. When the center target is hit and its relay is energized, each of the letter relays receives a pulse of power at their respective switches. The Arelay receives its pulse immediately as its connected through a normally closed switch atthe index position. But as the motor turns, that switch opens and then the followingrelays get pulsed one at a time. Whichever relays are energized will have this switch closed, so its respective pulse makes its way through the center target relay and to the 1,000 point relay coil. Thus it adds 1,000 point for every lit letter. This is pretty wild, right? Despitejust being a tangled mess of wires, relays, switches, a motor and some cams, we havea machine which methodically checks whether each of the five letter targets has been hit andawards points if it has been. This results in a unique pattern of dings depending onwhich targets are lit. I wont waste your time any further by going through everypossible combination, but here are a few: [ding ding / ding ding] [ding / ding / ding] [ding/ ding ding ding] [ding ding ding / ding] You probably noticed that right alongside thecenter target relay in the schematic was the shooter relay. Thats what Ive been callingthe kickback lane - Williams decided to refer to this as the shooter which is very confusing since, yknow, this is also the shooter. But anyway, thattarget works in essentially the exact same way as the center target, but it pulses the1,000 point relay through the impulse switch when no letters are lit (thus awarding 5,000points) and pulses the 10,000 point relay for every lit letter. The only other differenceis that the shooter coil gets fired at the end of the sequence through switch 4-E in thescore motor to kick the ball out of the target. While I covered a lot of what this machine doesin this video, its probably pretty obvious based on all the other stuff in here that theres a lot more to see. In part 2, welltake a look at how the machine manages to do some of its more complex automated sequences like this one: [ding ding ding ding ding / ding ding ding ding ding / ding ding ding ding ding / ding ding ding ding ding / ding ding ding ding ding tuck click clack ka-chunky shwhup] Yep, it added 25,000 points to the score all on its own, then changed theball-in-play light from one to two. Apparently it can count. And it also knows yourscore - cross 350,000 points and... [ding ding *clunk* ding ding] youve won a replay. Stay tuned for how that all works. Its just as nuts as everything you saw here. Thank you very much for watching. I hope youenjoyed it and that Ive been able to help you understand all this nonsense. The thingis, though, its not nonsense - its logic! And thats part of why I like machines likethis so much. You can actually look at them, pick it apart, and understand what itsdoing and why. It blows my mind how folks of the past figured all this out and got these thingsmanufactured in mass. And perhaps even more mind-blowing, while this machine is from 1976 most of the techin here existed in some form back in the 1930s. It just got built up in layer after layer until we arrived at this. And to be honest, this machine isnt that complex. There areplenty of electromechanical pins out there which have much deeper rulesets and manymore targets. In fact, twenty years prior to this one getting manufactured, Bally introduceda game with multiball. Yeah. Maybe one day we can take a look at a more complex machine butfor now I need to go to bed. Gnight everybody. coin-operatedly smooth jazz You didnt know this but Im even wearing PJs. You never know what Ive got on belowthe desk. Or behind the pinball In fact, 10 copies I slightly ooh, lefthanded teleprompter controls gonna throw me off. Just gonna need to pick this up. Quite the assortment of weird ob ahhhh! We can slide the glass out and the playfield willsimpy lift right up. I botched the word simply To find de ber da ka ta ka da bakatakaww And just a bit, I promised. Promised? Thats not the what? Large rings may be stretched across two or more posts to createa linear barrier, but sometimes that sounds weird and Im gonna start over. But youll find plenty of individual rings with their own rings, too. Well, this lines not going great! And that advances the mechanism by onestep. It, or it would if I werent so clumsy. Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball. But sadly I got started long into its downfall and you really couldn't find 'em in many amusement halls but that wouldn't stop me: just hadda play pinball!

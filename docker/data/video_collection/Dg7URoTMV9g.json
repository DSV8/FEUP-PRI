    "description": "The Boring Company recently shipped their Not-a-Flamethrower, which sold out in less than a week; only 20,000 were made, so it's something of a collectors' item. But besides hanging it on your wall, what on earth do you do with the thing? Science editor Liz Lopatto demonstrates how to cook with the collectable, putting the Not-A-Flamethrower through its paces.

    "transcript": "- [Liz] So Elon Musk came out with a limited edition flamethrower in January and I immediately bought one. So I wanted it because I am full of bad ideas and love dangerous things, but when I went to pick this up I talked to a bunch of other people who had ordered flamethrowers also and most of them just wanted them as art objects to hang in their house. So now I own this flamethrower, right? And then that's when it occurred to me I had nowhere to use it. I don't have a backyard, and finding a location for this was a lot harder than we thought because it turns out a lot of people are not very excited about fire. - We're trying to do this in a safe fashion. I've literally just have so many people that I've called. Gun ranges, police departments, naval bases... So we started reaching out to hacker spaces and almost all of them got back to me with very enthusiastic Yes. - [Liz] So we're here at San Francisco Metalworks to use this thing. We want to use it safely, so of course we have a fire extinguisher right here, there's another one off camera just in case. Please don't be a jerk if you own one of these. Don't burn anything down, don't put anybody in danger. Okay, so you may have noticed the propane tank wasn't screwed in to the regulator. In order to make this thing work, you've got to do that. Propane tank's easy, you can just buy any sort of standard one at your hardware store, and then you screw it in here and you're ready to rock. So to turn it on there's like this labeled switch right here. Turn it in the On direction, then you're gonna pull this here, and that gives you your pilot light, and then you pull the trigger. Veeran, you might wanna stand back. (power chord rock music) I'm really excited because we were gonna be doing my very first cooking show. I've never cooked a steak before, so we'll be doing that and then we're gonna have s'mores for dessert. (power chord rock music) One of the things that's difficult about covering Elon Musk is that it's hard to tell when he's joking on Twitter. I mean, The Boring Company itself was announced in a tweet, right? He was like, sick of traffic and so he was like, I'm gonna form a company and we were like, is this man serious? - Yeah. - The fact of the matter is The Boring Company doesn't just make merch for Elon Musk, even though he has enough fans to justify it. I mean, the flamethrower alone, 20,000 of them were sold, right, limited edition. That's $10 million in revenue for The Boring Company and Elon Musk merch isn't even really what they do. What they actually do is make tunnels. (steak sizzles) - When I was seeing you sear it I didn't think it was gonna be, I was like, hmm, but actually it's nice. That's a good flamer. - Good! So, that was fun enough but I actually totally wanna make s'mores, so we're gonna do that next. (chunky rock music) The Boring Company just won a bid to connect Chicago O'Hare to downtown Chicago, and LA is looking like it might fast track some of the approvals for them to start digging there too. So, does this mean that we should expect more merch as Elon Musk looks to raise more money for The Boring Company? I mean, maybe, he's talked about these Lego-like bricks that he plans to make out of the stuff that he digs out of the earth, so that might be coming. Anyway, I expect we're gonna find out a lot more soon and while we're waiting I'm just gonna take this guy, hang it up at the office. What kind of Boring Company merchandise would you want? Let us know in the comments and while you're here you should definitely check out my actual job, which is The Verge Science page on YouTube. I mean, product reviews are fun but really I'm a Science Editor and I would love you to see what we do there.",

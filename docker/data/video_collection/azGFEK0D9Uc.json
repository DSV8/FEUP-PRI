    "transcript": "(upbeat bright music) - Hey guys, today, we are checking out the new Tecno Camon 19 phone. And you may be wondering, what exactly is that? I partnered with Tecno to show you guys this device. Tecno has been producing devices in various global regions including Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, Southeast, and Southern Asia. So here it is. Meet the Tecno Camon 19. This is the eco black color with 120 Hertz, 6.7-inch full HD AMOLED display, and up to 500 knits of brightness. It has a 500 milliamp battery, USB-C connection, fingerprint sensor on the side, and you can get up to eight gigs of RAM. You'll also notice this has an incredibly slim design, which is 0.98 millimeters, and very, very tiny bezels around the edge, so the display takes up almost the entire front of the device. It's also very light and it features these two circular camera lenses on the back. I really like the unique look of this. This actually has three lenses on it. This top is a 64-megapixel Super Night camera, and this is the two-megapixel bokeh lens. And this is the 50 millimeter portrait focus lens. This also features a flash right here, and under here, which is kind of hard to see is where the laser focus and optical image stabilization is housed. This, of course, does also have a front-facing camera and that is 32 megapixels. Now, one of the big highlights for this device is the 64-megapixel Super Night portrait, which they are calling the most human eye-like image sensor. It has a Camon 19 Pro RGBW camera sensor with a customized glass lens that was co-developed with Samsung. Now, when it comes to mobile devices, I am always so excited to test out the camera. And this has a super fast focus response time of 0.1 second. This also helps with image stabilization for nighttime shooting and capturing motion. I also really love this feature. It has a touch to click to change the sky. Now I'm not gonna lie, I do often add in better looking skies and clouds in a lot of my photos that I post, so this is making it so easy to do right on your mobile device. So in the AI Settings, there's a little section called Sky Shop. So when you click that, it gives you all of these sky options. And it's cool because I can choose from them and I can actually see them changing on the screen as I move and switch the filters. But first, I'mma take a photo without the Sky Shop so you can see where we started and where we've ended up. Kind of like, you know, we started from the bottom now we're here. There's our regular photo. Heading into Sky Shop, Oh, man, okay, okay, so the first one is sunny, okay? Now here's rainbow. Oh my God, there's a rainbow. That looks so good. Azure sky is our next one. Oh my gosh, that's awesome. Also love it. This one is rosy, sunset. This one's twilight. So this one's starry. This is wild. It basically made this whole shot look like it was night. (gasps) This one's galaxy. Here's meteor. These are so cool. Here's orbit. Dude, I'm freaking out. This is actually way cooler than I thought it was gonna be. (chuckles) This one's Aurora. And now, our last one, we have moon. Wow, this is awesome. I'm super impressed. This also has some fun AI features, and this will automatically detect what you're taking photos of. This will allow for the camera to kind of auto adjust to make sure you're getting the perfect shot of whatever it is that you're taking the photo of every single time. This also has a Camera Film Mode feature, and it gives you these customized filters for different scenes like sports, parties, or capturing motion. This has a really cool camera mode called Pro Mode, and this will let you adjust all kinds of settings manually, just like you would do on a manual camera. This gives you all of those same options to try to perfect that perfect shot. Video is, of course, something that I absolutely love testing out. I'm also a huge fan of HDR, so this does have video HDR. With HDR, it allows you to have more control over those really bright areas in your video, and also the dark areas. I film a lot of videos out and about, on-the-go, traveling, filming my dog a lot of times. And this has an Extra Stabilization mode that you can turn on, and I absolutely love this because it will give you extra stability when you're filming or moving around, just to make your shots extra steady. Another really fun feature is Video Portrait. Now, you'll notice the background of this video is blurred. So in this mode, it kinda gives you that effect of using various high-end lenses. This bokeh will also work for up to three people in the frame, and it can be adjusted to your liking. So we're now outside and it's time to test out taking some photos and some videos. And I'm gonna start by just kind of going through all of the features. So we're gonna start with photos, and the cool thing, is with the AI cam, is it's able to determine what you're taking a photo of. Are you taking a picture of the street? Are you taking a picture of some plants, flowers? First up, some photos. I now have this clicked onto the 64-megapixel AI camera and I've got some flowers behind me, so let's take a shot and see how they look. So the first shot I have, oh, it says flower (camera clicks) It knew. So this is shot with the 64-megapixel. And now I'm going to also click off the 64-megapixel to see what that looks like. And it still is showing us that it's a plant and a flower. Well, there's some more flowers over here. Oh, oh, 64-megapixel is on. (camera clicks) 64-megapixel is off. (camera clicks) So you click the AI button, this has a little color enhancement. So let's do a shot of this flower with the AI color enhancement on, and I'll show you the comparison between the two (camera clicks). So there you have it. Here's the color enhanced version up against the non-color enhanced version. Obviously, it just looks like the saturation has been turned up slightly. Both photos, I think, look great. This feels like a real portrait setting, if I do say so myself. Nathan, would you take some portrait photos here using the portrait setting? - [Nathan] Yeah. (upbeat music) - Now, I'm gonna test that one of the little film templates. They basically give you a few seconds to record. You shoot, it edits it together, adds music. It's magic. I love AI editing. Shot our few seconds of the video in each one, and it just made me an auto-generated movie. This is so cool. Check it out. (upbeat bright music) So we're back here in the park where you last saw me filming. You may notice, it's dark, it's nighttime. There is some light around in this park, so obviously there is gonna be some light leaks. I was so excited to test this out now that it's dark outs. It's really cool because it's already adjusting. And the AI settings, it's already changing to the Night Mode. And I even brought my little tripod. So, did I bring my tripod? Oh my God, I did. Yes, here it is. Phone tripod so I can do some super steady shots. Even though a lot of mobile phones do a pretty good job at stabilization at nighttime, I don't care how incredible your phone is or your camera, having a tripod to take night photos, it just makes everything so much better. Obviously, a lot of people don't carry around tripods with them everywhere they go, so it is great to kinda see what it does look like handheld mode. If you're a photographer and you're looking to get the shot, just get yourself a tiny tripod. It's life-changing. Wow, it almost looks like it's daylight out. So as you guys can see or not see, it is pretty dark out right now, so I'm gonna try to take a few photos, and even test out the night video. It is kinda cool because as soon as I start taking a photo or video, you can see that the AI automatically picks up that it's dark out, and it switched to the Night Mode. Okay, let's get ourselves a little night video shot here. And you can see that it does automatically switched to Night video. Here it is Night Mode video. I love testing out cameras on mobile devices, so this is always so much fun to go out and do tests like this. And as you can see, it's nighttime, we're in Night video. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. (chuckles) Oh, there's also like some children's artwork here. That's really nice. Very nice work. Palm trees, looking good. I'm gonna turn up the ISO on here because you guys can't not see me at all. That is the great part about having a massive camera like this with a big sensor. You can obviously turn it up and adjust. And it is kinda difficult though in mobile devices because you don't have that massive sensor to deal with. So it is always impressive to see what you can actually get from mobile phones nowadays. This just gave me a prompt, and it wanted to switch into Super Night Mode. Let's see what that looks like. That looks good. Let's take a photo without Super Night on and see what that looks like. Here is regular and here is Super Night. Okay, the one thing that you'll definitely notice though in the Super Night photo is the detail in the trees. Everything looks way more crisp. It's also pulling out some of the stars in the sky. I'm gonna walk around, take some more photos, and I'll show you guys what I manage to capture. (upbeat bright music) Well, guys, thank you so much for watching. I had so much fun getting a chance to check out this device. And it was really fun because normally, this isn't something that I would get a chance to review. So huge thank you to Tecno for partnering with me, again, on this video, and getting me one of these devices to check out. If you guys want more information, I will put a link in the description. And for now, I'm gonna go to bed because it's late, and I go to bed really early. So it's like as soon as the sun starts going down, that means it's time for sleep. So, I'll see you guys later, bye. (upbeat bright music)",

    "transcript": "- Oh. - That's not gonna buff out. - Oh no. That survived. Imagine unboxing your brand new gaming PC and seeing this. Now imagine that you are Swedish Redditor SUPERZNOVA and you didn't imagine it. That's right. He ordered a new system from Shark Gaming, a Danish custom PC builder, who shipped it via postnord to his local post office. When he picked it up, he noticed some damage to the outer box, so he snapped a couple of pictures. But he couldn't possibly have imagined the shocking state of the PC inside. Now at this point, it would be easy to blame the carrier and there were plenty of negative anecdotes about PostNord in the comments, but that's true of every courier and postal service out there. So we wanted to dig deeper and find out who is to blame for this awful state of affairs and what can we do to make it right. With a little bit of help, from our sponsor- - MSI, get the ultimate gaming experience with the RTX 4070 gaming X Trio. We're talking Tri Frozr 3 Thermal Design, TORX FAN 5.0, Copper Base Plate, Core Pipe, Airflow Control, Metal Backplate, and Double Ball Bearing technology. This thing's locked and loaded and ready to launch on a one-way mission to the planet Gameulon 5. Check out the RTX 4070 Gaming X trio, down below. - Nah, dog, we got this. - [Jordan] Don't stab the new one! - No, no, it's fine. Come on, I can't make things any worse. (bang) (beep) Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. At least they managed to keep it dry. superznova, oop! Re-boxed it up for us to try and get it here in one piece this time. Oh, we've got a little note. Hello, LTT and Jake. I hope this leaning tower of PC brings you much joy and content. All my best /U/superznova. It will. (ding) This appears to be a piece of the original case packing foam, that explains a lot. Couriers provide guidance for how thick the packing material should be depending on the weight of the object inside. And this was clearly designed for an empty case not for a fully built out system with a modern GPU in it. They used the cheap, stiff kind of foam that is good for one, und exactly one impact, any further impacts and is completely destroyed. Fun fact, that's exactly why you should replace your bike helmet after an accident, even if there's no visible damage. (gentle dings) - [David] Are you gonna dump it? - I mean, realistically, what more could I do to it at this point? (hammer pounding) (beep) With that said, all of these replacement parts are coming outta pocket for me so the more things I can salvage from this, the better. [Crew] Oh Jesus! - [Linus's Echo] What more could I do to it at this point? Oh my goodness. Oh, oh, that's hard to look at. According to superznova this is exactly how he received it. He didn't even take the plastic off it, which is good because if he had it might have fallen apart even more. (laughing) Now, working at NCIX, I have seen some stuff. I've seen coolers torn off their sockets and GPUs ripped out of PCIe slots. This system though, is unlike anything I've ever seen. It looks like it was driven over. I was all ready to go to the defense of the courier here and say, you know what? Shark Gaming didn't pack this case adequately and they may not have, but this should not happen under any circumstances. Oh wow. The radiators not even attached to the front anymore. The tempered glass side panel survived. Shout out tempered glass. To Shark Gaming's credit, while I don't approve of the lack of outer box on the system, this is probably how I would pack the inside of a PC to keep the GPU safe in transit. Other strategies include the acrylic braces that Puget cuts or supports that are built into the case like you'll see with the Tier Ones. But this is not an invalid solution. To its credit too, I think this GPU may have, oh, that slot is chewed up. Oh, look at the power pins here. Not good. Maybe the motherboard survived? (laughing in background) Oh, it didn't. Why did I volunteer to fix this, without even looking at the pictures? You know what? You might actually be right. Those pins are still in place. I'm willing to bet that the RAM and the SSD are both fine and this radiator might. Ooh, why are these pins bent? What was banging around inside this case? At least they used a water cooler. If this had a big heat sink on it. Let me tell you, I've seen what happens when those come loose and bang around inside. I feel like the rigidity of the motherboard is what kept this piece from getting bent. To Shark Gaming's credit, they did a pretty okay job of the cable management. Never seen one of their systems before. So, this is quite the first impression. Show me how bad you are. Okay. Alright. Scale of one to 10, how happy is this motherboard gonna be? Not that bent. - [Jordan] This, this side's. - Oh, ha, ha, this side was pretty okay. The other side, not so much. While the CPU might be okay, I'm not really sure about this SSD anymore. Something whacked it hard and might have even knocked some components off. - [David] Oh, I thought the SSD was gonna be a safe bet. - That's the thing, right? I've seen crazy stuff happen where the outer carton looks totally fine and then you open it up and it's like how did anything hit that? Okay, you ever watch Slow Mo Guys? Just because something looks like that to the naked eye doesn't mean that this plastic didn't go like Whuuh, wruh, arunh, right? Something hit that somehow. Oh, that system fan though. Nope. I have a fix for this. I mean, these are kind of optional anyway. What are my Vegas odds that this thing posts? - [David] 200:1 Okay, I will bet you $1 that it works. Walked into that one. I'm trying the motherboard first. A 12 year old AMD engineering sample with a heat sink as bent as that motherboard. Let's go. We're going very basic here. Oh, actually, yeah we should definitely have a fire extinguisher handy for when I try the power supply. I've made it very clear, I expect my death to be monetized if we catch it on camera. Ah, okay. So that is a thing that is happening right now. Oh yeah, fire extinguisher? Good. Like for real, this thing could be on fire very shortly. - [David] Yeah, I'm gonna come shoot over here. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got a long lens, right? Okay, we ready? Hmm. No indicator lights. Yeah, eight, ten, four pin, they're plugged in. I don't think anything's gonna happen here, guys. Holy crap. You have got to be kidding me. Holy crap, the CPU has power. I need something. Hold on, I just, I just need to see if it posts. - [David] Yup! - Holy s(beep)! Not only did the motherboard survive, that mangled PCIe slot, survived. Are you kidding me right now? Let's check the SSD. Check this out. - [David] Oh! (Linus laughing) - [Linus] Before we do that though, we need a way to cool the CPU, so why not see if the original cooler survived? I mean, the fan didn't. Oh Honey, it might spin. Most of these screws are salvageable. That's the goal. I wanna reuse as many of the components as we can. I'm gonna bet this cooler is still good. What are my odds? No, no, you're the, you're the Vegas odds man. Yeah, you're the odds guy. - [David] Five to one. - [Linus] Five to one. Yeah, the cooler, the cooler, I wouldn't expect, Man, I wish I'd bet someone on that motherboard. Okay, well there's a big difference between still working and possible to attach to anything. CPU fan one. Ah, pump fan. Here we go. Unreal. CPU, Ram, Motherboard. I don't know about this cooler though. Can I bend it? Holy crap. 32 gigs Ram. Let's get that SSD. - [Jordan] Pretty sure you lost a capacitor or two off the SSD. - I think you're right. Even though there are blank pads on the other side, this one here and this one here, looked like something was ripped off them. Oh, now I'm almost afraid to plug this in in case we end up ruining a perfectly good motherboard. I am so stoked that this works. Fricking amazing. And that is one dead SSD. Hey, we're still doing pretty well. That's fine,. we've got a new SSD, right? Oh right. (powers down) I don't want be killing this motherboard now. In the meantime, we've got a nice little upgrade for you. A two terabyte Rocket NVME 4.0. This is not only faster than the drive you had, but it's double the capacity. Man, this is the most fun I've had trouble shooting something in quite a while. You never know what's gonna happen. Anything is possible right now. This motherboard worked. Next you're gonna tell me the GPU works. - [David] There we go. - Unbelievable. I'm gonna go get the GPU, or should we do the Power Supply first? You guys wanna see some fireworks? I've never heard of this power supply brand before but they've got a great slogan. Yours did, buddy. Oh wait, this is FSP. Now I know FSP, just never seen that slogan from them before. - Let's go - Work at an angle here. The kind of force required to do this to this power supply, like this isn't human. You couldn't drop kick this kind of damage into it. Anyone got any Jaws of Life handy? I sorry. - [David] Want a pair of gloves? - I probably should be wearing gloves, yeah. Next best thing. Tin snips, let's go. - [Jordan] That's kind of like gloves, yeah. - Yeah. Alright, well I meant for Jaws of Life, not gloves. Oh, do we have a hammer? Ah, we do. (opera music playing) (hammer bashing) (opera singing continues) (different hammer bashing) Okay. Yeah. (more indiscriminate hammer bashing) Hey! Look at that. Can't get this eight pin outta the cable management hole. She's sealed up tight. (hammer bashing continues) This is why they call me the PC sawbones. Ha, ha, I just realized how much I'm smiling. That may not be as bad as it sounds. I think it's just plastic from the fan. Because if you look, the PCB for this power supply is all along the bottom, which is still square. Now it's possible that just from the sheer vibration of whatever this went through, there were parts shaken free from the PCB and that could be what we're hearing. - [David] Yeah at some point I think there was a crazy person stumbling around in there. - I prefer the term eccentric. I think the plastic came from here. Oh yeah, look, I knocked another piece off. - [Redacted] You want some safety gear? Thanks. It's so nice that you guys care, about still having somewhere to work on Monday. Can you claim EI if like your boss dies? Like, yeah, I work for a YouTuber and he dead. (sad trombone) Look at this. This screw got driven right through the shroud of the power supply. I'm about to do something I would never recommend. - [David] For the first time. - Yes, for the everything else I did. Safe. All right. It's nice. Isn't this nice? Oh, it's not so nice. However, this supports my theory that the things clanking around inside the power supply were just plastic things. Even this heat sink here. I thought it was bent, but I just didn't look closely and it's one of those offset ones that's bent like that. I don't think the actual working components of this power supply took any bruises. This is unbelievable. I think I might have been better off with, I'm fine. You know what? It might be loosened enough that I can give her with this guy now. - Oh yeah. - [David] Oh buddy. - Oh, that's a bend. Hey, do we have, we have soldering stuff here. Yeah, we do. Now I can hear what you guys are thinking. Really? Linus, you're gonna stick him with this power supply. Of course not. I'm gonna upgrade it first. Now, it has an RGB fan. Oh, okay. I'll use a heat gun. And for good measure, I'm just gonna give them a little bit of electrical tape. Okay, that's on there. Aw, this uses Alphacool's stupid RGB connector. You're getting upgraded, to a clear plastic fan. Moment of truth. She spins. That was a fairly small moment of truth. The moment of big truth is still coming. Still lines up. No, don't look too closely at that. But all four screws are in, the unit is self-contained and the fan spins. Well, it's capable of spinning. There's nothing jammed in it. I don't know that it will spin. We still have that fire extinguisher, eh? - [Jake] Yep. - If this works you have to buy the new windbreaker from lttstore.com. Okay. I deserve it. (fan scraping loudly) So now you don't have to buy the windbreaker. You get to. Wait, did it turn on? - Oh right, it didn't make noise. That makes sense. Oh, yeah. GPU I'm shaking. I'm like so excited right now. Oh, That doesn't mean anything yet. I'm not getting too excited yet. But the RGB did illuminate. - [David] Uh, no. The screen did something. - Oh, no, no way! What? - [David] Hoo, hway, huak hehehehe - Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? All we lost was the SSD. The SSD? How did the GPU survive and not the frick, flippin SSD? How did anything working emerge from this? Now we gotta figure out what to do. The whole shtick for this video was gonna be, Hey, we replaced your computer, (cough, cough) but it's fine. - Do we use the original glass panel? - Absolutely, this is a brand new H5 Flow from Nzxt. But other than that, the goal is to use as many of the original components as we possibly can. I mean, this has got fingerprints on it. That sucks. This tells a story. After visually inspecting the motherboard, and giving it a little bend back. I see no reason whatsoever why we couldn't still use this. What a mind blowing experience. You know what, I'm not gonna commit to using this cooler until I see if the radiator mounts. We're gonna need new fans though. Do we have replacement fans? Something really nice? Oh, no way we can salvage fans? - Put 'em onto theirs, souvenir. - I don't think these are particularly pressure optimized fans though. Well, no, they're not great. Yeah, I'd really rather use something better. Wait, hold on a second. This uses different fans than that one. That may be a problem. I'm gonna see if we can use the squareness and rigidity of the fan to force the radiator back into proper shape. I have my doubts. (bang) Now, okay. Um, yeah. (bang) Where'd that hammer go? (gentle tapping) See, the problem is not what an evil man like me is doing. It's that you're all standing here and doing nothing about it. (more gentle tapping) Ooo! - [David] Why are just watching each other, instead of standing on it? - Um, 'cause you need that. Like you need to deform it past, in order to get it into position. I tried. I tried like pressing on it and stuff. It's also, I can't hit it harder or I can't push hard enough on it with all my weight. It's not, it's just not enough. The water tubes are made out of copper, which is a very malleable metal, and then the tanks are made of brass which is a little less malleable. That's good because it means that we can whack the brass tanks and they shouldn't deform too much. And then the copper should deform and we should be able to reshape it. I think, I mean, I'm obviously making all this up as I go. - [David] Is that water that's leaking out? - What? - [David] Just kidding. - Here's what we're gonna do, to replace the fan I accidentally broke, I'm going to pull this one outta here. Oh, how the devil does this come out? Came out so easily from the other case. Ah, gorgeous, replacement fan. Then we'll replace this with something a little better. Limited edition LTT Noctua fan. It won't match, but boy will there ever be a story there. This is still quite not flat. (hammer pounds) Most of these are going in okay, but we've definitely got a problem in the bottom right down here. Ooh. Oh, actually. Oh, I've got it. Okay, give it the old put the thing in the thing. Did you get it? Don't forget it has a ratchet. ltt store.com. Turn your ratchet off. Dang it. Would you ever know that that wasn't perfect from the factory? Now that I have covered it up, yes. Yes. My bigger concern here is that these aren't particularly static pressure optimized fans, but it's a 5,800 X. We're not gonna be limited by how much heat we can move away from the radiator and to maintain the integrity of the build. I wanted to use as many original components as possible other than that fan. Uh, huh. - [Jake] Not that bad. - I mean these are, these are a cutting yourself hazard at the best of times. And because of the shroud in the bottom of the case you would never know that the power supply looks like this is what I would say if I didn't consider it hazardous to ship this back to 'em. So instead, SUPERZNOVA is getting a little power supply upgrade with an Asus RG Strix 850 Watt, it's modular it's more efficient and it's white, matches the case. Oh, I see the problem. (tapping) I'm not a huge fan of the way these PCIe cables come over here, but honestly, I don't have a better solution right now. And the more important thing is that, It works. We only had to replace two parts, three counting that fan that I broke. SSD, power supply, which we didn't even need to replace, and one fan, which means that given SUPERZNOVA was expecting some upgraded components, I guess it'll just be a cash reward. I'm not taking off the outer peel, just the inner one. Now obviously after what this thing's been through it's not enough for us to run Doom Eternal for a couple minutes and say, oh yeah, I don't know, I guess that seems fine. We're gonna be putting this through a full stress test running it for at least a couple of days in the environmental chamber to make sure that it's good to go. But I see no reason right now why it wouldn't be. - [David] Just this unbelievable segue to our sponsor. - I can't think of anything better. So just le, yeah, just, just use it. Ground News. Ground News is a platform that consolidates news sources from all around the world into one easy place. But, they're more than just another news hub. The latest stories can often be polluted with the biases of the writers and organizations behind them. And Ground News shows the personal leanings of each outlet and even lets you check to see who owns those publications. For example, in a recent interview, the CEO of Google expressed their concerns with the future of AI. Ground News breaks down how different sites are reporting on the same story, allowing you to vet which outlets may be fear-mongering and which may be a bit too comfortable with the future of AI. And since they present you with information about the political beliefs and ownership you can have a better understanding of why each outlet might be steering the conversation in a specific direction empowering you to better understand the whole story. Their blind spot feature is also super helpful since it will show you stories that the all-knowing algorithm may have neglected to feed you. Media literacy is the name of the game here. And Ground News believes in giving people the tools to better understand where they get their information. Keeping Echo Chambers in check.

    "transcript": "Its November. You know what that means! Hello andwelcome to No Effort November, a series of videos for the month of November in which no effort ismade. Are you a prude who cant bear the thought of your children being exposed to naughty languagein movies and television, but you just cant bear the thought of missing out on watching stuffas a family? Are you looking for a technological solution to free you from the guilt of exposingyour kids to bad words? Is it 1998? Well then have I got the solution for you, the TV Guardian. This amazing device attaches to any ordinary television set and transforms that foul-mouthedboob tube into a proper G-rated gentleman. Mostly. How does it work? State-of-the-art technology,of course! The TV Guardian filters out foul language from cable or satellite TV ANDhome video sources like VHS tapes, DVDs, and lets not forget Laserdiscs. Simplydisconnect the video source from your TV and connect it to the Guardian. Then, connectthe Guardian to your TV and now you can watch TV as a family without worrying aboutan F-bomb absolutely ruining your night. How does it work? State-of-the-art technology, of course! Didnt I just say that? Uh, lets begin with a look at this gadget. Thedevice itself is pretty simple, with two complete sets of composite video and audio jacks - whichare helpfully labeled Right, Left, and Video, but youll have to guess which one is the inputand which ones the output. Theres also a coaxial RF out for old-school TV sets and another RFconnection above it which is unlabeled. Theres a DC barrel plug for power input, which they did bother to specify as 9v, 100ma DC, but forgot to finish the diagram for plug polarity. Helpful! Wealso find two three-position switches for changing settings. Well get back to those. Lastly,there is one more switch tucked way behind a hole at the top of this panel which is once againunlabeled. They did a bang-up job here. Thats the channel 3 or 4 selector for the RF modulator, which youd know if you bothered to read the manual. Now I know that this was likelya fairly low-volume product, and its also 20+ years old, but the cheapnessof the construction here cannot be stressed enough. This looks and feels like an electronicsproject box, and frankly if it werent for the TV guardian branding Id think it literally was an off-the-shelf electronics project box. Of course there is a custom circuit boardin here [feigning sadness] oh no, I voided my warranty but yeah even this is pretty basic. Just a fewchips and an off-the-shelf modulator, essentially. Thats because this is using much of thesame componentry youd find in all sorts of contemporary video equipment. Its just got a bit of a trick up its sleeve. The device uses our old friend closed captioning to watch out for profamity. Since I already made avideo on that topic I wont go deep into it here. Plus it is November. But in the US, startingin the 1980s television broadcasts and home video formats began regularly incorporatingclosed captioning in the form of a hidden data stream across the length of Line 21 inthe analog video signal. Line 21 is near the end of the vertical blanking interval, which is a string of blank lines that help an analog television draw the image. Whileyoure not supposed to be able to see it, in the digital age were starting to find partsof it pop out occasionally, like here in Frasier. These blinky dashes are encoding text and basic formatting, and they get extracted as high-low pulses by a television set, or a separate device, and decoded to generate text atop the image. This was a way to add captioning for those who desired it without making it part of the broadcast image, hence the name closed captioning. Now, an olderanalog television like this one, mindlessly drawing glowing lines on the face of a cathoderay tube over and over again, doesnt process what its doing and this picture tube actually draws the lines, blinky dashes and everything. But theyre getting drawn outside thevisible area, somewhere like here. Thats thanks to overscan: the actualimage is blown out just a bit beyond the edges of the screen which was necessary dueto the vagaries of analog video and since most picture tubes didnt have perfectlyrectangular faces. So you werent ever gonna see this datastream unless there was something wrong with your television set. But modern displays what with their neat grids of pixels and discrete resolutions generally dont stretch the image they are told to display beyond their borders. Some do for silly reasons which makes using them as a computer monitor very annoying until you find the just scan setting buried in the menus but... for themost part, a modern display or television will show the entirety of whatever you throw atit. And some less-than-careful analog-to-digital transfers have gotten done over the years, whichcaptured part of the vertical blanking interval. Thats whats happening in this episode ofFrasier. Whoever did the transfer didnt take care to ensure the 480 rows of pixels theydcapture from the 525 lines of video started at, like, line 23 or 24. Or perhaps they justthought overscan was gonna live on forever. Anyway, back to the TV Guardian. Baked intoits programming is a dictionary of offensive words and phrases which, for science, Id love tosee but its not written anywhere in the manual, aw shucks. Now, when its turned on and active, it decodes the captioning data from line 21. If it finds a match with one of those objectionable things in its dictionary, the guardian jumps into action and mutes the audio toprotect the innocent. That thats what it does. Now, I may sound like Im making fun of thislittle gadget. And I must admit that this particular form of parental control seems a bit odd to my ears, but the way its done is actually pretty clever. Here, lets all settle down as a wholesome family and watch Goodfellas together with the Guardian turned on. Profanity is definitelythe only objectionable part of that movie, right? [ambient road noise] So far it looks like a typical movie-goingexperience, but watch what happens here. [clunky thud, ambient noise] [audio cuts out] [Jimmy - What's up? Did I hear something? What the F - ] [audio cuts again] Not only was the audio muted, but when thathappened the closed captioning was placed on-screen so it can be read and stand in for themissing dialogue. And that captioning was altered to remove the offensive word, in this case\"fudge.\" But it didnt simply remove the word, it also took out the the. What the fudgeis that became, simply, This sort of word swap or rephrasingis done whenever necessary. And its sometimes pretty good at keeping the context intact. Like, for instance in this scene. [ How could I go back to school after that and pledge allegiance to the flag and - ] [audio cut] [sound returns] Good government bull excrement was replaced with good government \"baloney.\" [ For us, to live any other way was nuts. T - ] Here, the line to us, those goody good people who work 'shirty'jobs got turned into who work crud jobs. Cruddy would have been a better fit but still, not bad. As much as this is clever, its really doingthis because of a limitation stemming fromhow the captions work. Captioning data is sent inspurts which encode all the text to be displayed on screen - and where to place it. Entire sentencesare often displayed at once, in fact a call and response between two characters is sometimes onscreen. The text will stay there until the next spurt of data is received which either containsmore text and formatting or says to clear it. So, if a chunk of captioning data contains a badword or phrase, the TV Guardian knows it will be spoken at some point the text is displayed, but it doesnt know exactly when. So the only thing it can do is mute the audio for the entire time that caption block appears on the screen. [Partner. Is that what you've been trying to tell me, you want me to be part - ] [audio cut] [It's not even fair, no?] As removing an entire sentence or more could very easily cause you to lose the plot, it has little choice but to display the text with the objectionable parts altered. Now that is an optional feature. One of the twooption switches we havent talked about yet is labeled \"caption,\" and you can choose betweenOn, Cuss, and Off. So far weve seen it in the cuss setting, but if you like, you can move the switch to off using a tiny screwdriver or something because theyre recessed in away which I cant decide if was deliberatefor parental control reasons or just bad design and that will simply have it mute the audio and leave you wondering what was said. I dontknow why youd want that but you can do it! You can also have it leave captions on continuously, leaving nice and friendly phrases unaltered but, whenever someone uses a mouth which makes you wonder if they kiss their mother with it, itll cut the audio out and make whatever alterations to the written dialogue it sees fit. You can also choose how strictyou want the filtering to be. If phrases like My god bother you, youllwant the extra strict enforcement turned on. But if youre just a little bit more lenient, you can choose the mild setting which lets such religious-adjacent phrases through, in addition toless-objectionable potty-mouth words. Now these are printed in the manual. I wont read themall off but it includes such bangers as balls, wuss, up yours, forms of screw, and even \"H E Double Hockey Sticks.\" And if you only care that your children donthear these words but you yourself are in fora good profanity-laden evening, you canalso turn off the filtering altogether. Now, its probably obvious but this method hasa few key weaknesses. Weve already discussed how it has to mute entire sentences or more but,to reiterate, it has to mute entire sentences or more. And its decisions on how to fill in what it censors are good most of the time but can also be really weird or even just bad. Heres a list ofall the examples that Ive found. Ill try to keep this family friendly, folks but you might not agree with all my decisions here so just be warned. We already established that \"excrement\" turnsinto crud, but if its phrased as oh, shirt then it becomes oh, man. Pretty good. Thephrase that rhymes with \"missed off\" gets changed to teed off (or just teed). Prick becomes jerk. Bastard also turns into jerk. Uh \"rocksucker\" was also turned into jerk. Really theres a lotta jerks. But slut, ah well that turned into flirt. Its fine with moron. Thats cool with the guardian. The n word simply becomes ellipses which yeah thats probably for the best. A word now commonlyconsidered a slur became simply gay so the caption hes treating me like a gay popped uphere. Interesting. And then on the strict setting, balls gets turned into tail, which is funnybecause that word can also just mean balls or be a name as happened here. Oh, and the exclamation \"MyGod\" becomes Man, which I guess thats fine. But then theres the F-bomb. As any sailormouth knows that particular word can mean many things and results to censor it willvary. Heres a decent example. \"Maybe its me, Im a little forked up.\" turns into \"Maybe its me,Im a little 'messed' up.\" Great work! That worked fine. And it did a pretty good job earlier when itremoved the the in \"what the fudge is that?\" But, uh, if its ever phrased as a verb, the guardianlikes to change it to \"wow.\" Like, you'll wow everything up. Or, go wow yourself. I mean, OK. Uh, if it sees forkn the word just gets removed and an errant apostrophe is left behind. And itappears to change some instances to go away which makes sense for fork off I guess but, \"gogo away your mother\" doesnt really mean anything intelligible. Thats a total fail. Oh and, F...trucker is another word that becomes jerk. But even if it made perfectdecisions all the time, it first relies on closed captioning to be A)there in the first place B) accurate and not itself censored and C) properly timed andin sync with the speech. By the time this thing was released most everything had closedcaptions in it, but with the rise of the DVD, some studios went rogue. And in fact, themanual calls out Universal for doing this. See, DVD players are capable of injecting theirown line 21 captioning data so analog TVs hooked up to them can decode it on their own. Heres an example with TheBirdcage, another film which Im sure in the eyes of a TV Guardian buyer would be completelyunobjectionable if only it didnt have cuss words. But of course, DVD players could also displayclosed captions themselves. And far more capably, offering captions in multiple languages, commentary tracks, and in any style, font, or color the publisher desired. Universal, it seems,deemed the newfound capabilities of DVD enough to negate the need for old-fashioned line 21 captionsupport in their releases, at least circa 2000. So for Universal's DVDs the Guardian has no ideawhats being said, and its f-bombs galore. Another issue comes from captionswhich dont exactly match the dialog. This is actually quite common, usually whendialog is fast-paced. [ It was there that I knew that I belonged. To me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood that was full of nobodies. They weren't like anybody else. I mean, they did whatever they wanted. They double parked in front of a hydrant and nobody ever gave them a ticket. In the summer, when they played cards all night, nobody ever called the cops.] For instance, in Goodfellas, the Guardian correctly catches that terribleversion of ticked when Henrys narration says my father was always ticked off, but justafter this Henry repeats he was ticked at the beginning of three separate phrases in somethingof a run-on sentence. The captioning is structured more loosely, though, with the offending wordonly placed in the beginning of that sentence. So the audio is unmuted and the last one ismissed. [ ... was in a wheelchair, he was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house] Wont somebody think of the children? Then of course, what if whoever wrote the captions was a prude who censored them? Instead of actually writing out H E Double Hockey Sticks they couldhave written \"H asterisk asterisk asteroid.\" Now, doing that is very bad captioning practice -after all, if adults are choosing to seea movie with profanity and rely on captions, theyre not seeing the movie they chose to see if the captions are censored. So in the grandscheme that should be rare. But oh the sweet irony of a prudish transcription causing profanity to slip through the TV Guardian. Lastly, theres caption timing. Live events relyon stenographers furiously stenographering whats spoken and that leads to a substantial delay inthe captions. So better hope those sportscasters arent potty mouths. Scripted content is generallybetter, but its not perfect. The Guardian let quite a few things slip through in Goodfellas. Tobe fair, they dont claim perfection on the box. Another somewhat odd choice was an inabilityto censor any RF source. There is a coaxial input but this is just a pass-through, and as amatter-of-fact this shipped with a red cover over the top connection and theres a note in themanual that basically says dont use this. Yes, it has a built-in RF modulator foroutputting to older TVs, but the censoring function only works on the composite input. So if you want this to work with live TV, youll either need to have satellite orcable, or youll need to use your VCRs TV tuner for over-the-air broadcasts from now onand hope your kids dont figure that part out. I imagine this was mainly a cost-cuttingmeasure but it still seems silly. Oh, and since theres only one input wellthat gets fun when you have a cable box, a VCR, and a DVD player and you'd like them allto be Guardianed. Better hope your VCR is fancy enough to have two inputs, and then you can runeverything through it. But if youre not so lucky, youll need some sort of video switcher. Themanual even says as much. The limitations we just went over are all technical ones, though. Theres also a pretty glaring conceptual hurdle. I chose Goodfellas and The Birdcage to demonstratethis because I have a feeling the sort of person who bought the TV Guardian might object to someof the visuals and themes in those films. Just a hunch. The TV Guardian cant do anything aboutthe content or whats on the screen; it can only ever be a pretty-good but not perfect profanity filter. So Im somewhat perplexed by the perceived value here. Youre still gonna need to screen for whatever you might not want your kids seeing! I suppose theres a lot of content out therewhich is otherwise pretty tame but which has a fewsailor mouth moments. But its really onlythat middle-ground that this can do anything for. And if I may be so bold, if youre that worried about your kids hearing the occasional bad word, well you better not let them leave the house. That was a joke, just wanna be clear, but yeah - theres a lot of profanity outsideof television, hate to break it to you. Still, though, as much as I think this is silly and not at all for me, I will tip my hat to it for being pretty clever. And,if you think theres some merit in this idea, or maybe you know someone in your life who would have loved one of these, well I have good news! This company still exists, and they make HDMI versions now so you can guard your Netflix. Except, not actually. Yeah, theyre still relying on line 21 captions. Probably because HDMI doesnt actually carrycaptioning data. The website makes it pretty clear that whatever youre plugging into the new versions of this stillsneeds to have a composite video output for it to work, so the HDMI video feed is I guess justa passthrough that it draws captions on top of? I dunno, Id investigate furtherbut this is No Effort November. Before I go, I want to do two more things. First, I want to thank my long-time patron Colin for sending this thing to me. Its very muchnot either of our jams, but it certainly is an intriguing use of closed captioning. And second well I think its time I finally rip the band aid off about a certain video topic I promised. In my video on closed captioning, I said Id be making a video on Teletext. And I said I'd do that Soon That wasalmost four years ago. So what happened? Well, I dont think Im the right person totell that story. Ive never used it, and as such I really have no enthusiasm or nostalgia forit. For those that dont know, which is mainly people outside of Europe, teletext was an earlierand way, way, waaaaay more capable use of the vertical blanking interval for sending data alongwith television transmissions. And I cannot stress the way way wayyyyyy more capable part enough. It wasnt just captions. It was full-on news, weather, sports information, trivia games, andeven computer programs all sent alongside ordinary television. For whatever reason, probably the lack of a nationalized television broadcaster, that never got any traction here. Americans just dont know what teletext is or was. We never had it asidefrom small-scale tests here and there. Those who live where teletext is common mightbe surprised that our closed captions work justfine on VHS cassettes - see our standard wasdesigned with that in mind. Teletext on the other hand is very high-bandwidth, and televisionsets couldnt decode it from a consumer videotape. However, some really cool people have developed software techniques to recover the teletextinformation from home recordings, and archivesare being built and expanded as we speak. Thats really interesting to me, but without apersonal connection to it, I just wont give the story justice. Ill leave that for someone else totackle. Ive put links to some info about Teletext and to the archive, if you're curious, down in the description. But yeah, a teletext video isnt gonna happen on this channel. I bet there aresome pretty cool videos on YouTube right now, though - ohhh goodness. No. Nooo Why are these popping up?They have nothing to do OK, well if any of you out there have been holding off to make a video, waiting for me todo something, you go right ahead - Ill even be on the lookout for em. And this ones pretty good if youwant to learn a bit about it right now. Ok bye. profanely smooth jazz Are you looking for a technologicalsolution to your fear of nope. Are you a prude who can't bear the thought of your children being exposed to [runs out of air] oh god I didn't take a breath at the right time Of coursethere is a custom circuit breaker... circuit board. It's not a circuit breaker! Captioning datais sent in spurts which encode all the text tood ugh! Captioning data is sent in spurts whichencode all the text to be displayed on - [laughs] That's a mouthful! Which encode all the text tobe displayed! ...which encode all the text to be displayed on I made it! But I didn't thinkI did! ...which encode all the text to bees My god! All the text to be. Text to be. That's... all the text to be Haha, wow! As much as... [holding in laughter] Oh god. This is like Dietz Nuts all overagain. It's not even supposed to be funny!

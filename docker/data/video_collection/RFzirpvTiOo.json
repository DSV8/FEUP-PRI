    "transcript": "- Hey there. Whoa. Been a little while. I came all the way to France to check out OVHcloud. Not actually for Floatplane reasons. I'm here because Shadow is sponsoring this video so that we can check out their power upgrade servers. They're super powerful, they're super cool. They have eight GPUs, all this fun stuff. We're gonna build one we're gonna see how they build 80,000 computers a year and then we're gonna go to their data center and see how it's all implemented, powered, cooled, everything. It's gonna be awesome. There's a lot to see, come along with me. (upbeat music) You may have heard of Shadow before, but just in case you haven't, they're a super easy to access high performance personal computer in the cloud. What does that mean for you? It means that you can extend the lifespan of your various devices. If you have some junky old laptop or desktop or whatever you can move the heavy compute that you might need to do in your day to day to the cloud and Shadow can handle it. Shadow can also be used in a business environment such as deploying multiple Shadow PCs for those working remote or configuring Shadow PCs with up to an RTX 6,000 GPU for high workloads. It's not just performance tasks either in regards to like standard old school research stuff. You can play games too. You can do the fun things on your dad's old smart TV or your phone or your VR device or your Raspberry Pi or whatever the heck you want. You can run 1080P games at 240 FPS and 4K games at 60 FPS. Let's go see how it's done. Every server for OVH's European market and Asian Pacific market is made here, Shadow or not. And every single component for OVH worldwide is made here as well. Including OVH's version of an all in one water cooler which can apparently cool an entire row of racks of servers. I don't know the exact capacity but it's safe to say it's a lot. This facility processes through several hundred million dollars worth of small components every year, including this huge pile of trays and trays and trays of RAM. They also have GPU, CPUs and lots of copper piping because OVH uses water cooling in all of their facilities. From here it goes into the rest of the facility where they build everything, test everything, do R&D etc etc. Once it's done, it comes back here actually just across the way where we can see all these cool signs where they line everything up, it goes onto trucks and in this case gets sent to the main data center that we use at Floatplane. Now we get to the fun stuff. This is the area where they're actually building the power upgrade servers and the first part of that is to strip all of the standard stock cooling components off of these Quadro GPUs from Nvidia. In the future they're gonna support Radeon and as well right now we're just dealing with Nvidia. As we move down the line, we can see that they start putting them into sandwiches where they're putting these custom made heat sinks and heat pipes and everything onto the GPUs and then sandwiching them together with a dual riser. It's actually like super cool, I don't know if they would've let me do this if I was Linus 'cause he'd drop it, but you know, I won't do that. They're able to keep these at a reasonable temperature. I washed it under load, a hundred percent load both of these sitting at around 45 Celsius, which was pretty intense. Speaking of a hundred percent load this station is where they test them. So once they've made two of these GPU sandwiches I'm gonna call them, they rack them up here. They have a power supply in everything they need to test. There's a motherboard sitting on the lower part of this server. They test here. This is where they control, I'm not gonna press any buttons 'cause this is where they control being able to turn on the water and make sure everything is cooling properly. Up here they load over the network, a Linux system they put a load on it, they test it make sure everything's good. If it's good, we move on further down the line. So OVH and Shadow are always chasing efficiencies. It makes sense at this scale cause if you could save a small amount of material on something, it's gonna become a lot over all of the systems that you're building and they design their own water blocks for all of their systems. The ones we saw earlier, the big chunky ones was an earlier version. They have a very new one that looks a little bit like this. You'd be surprised that this setup can cool a Quadro, but it totally can. They've done a bunch of research. We're gonna try to install this right now and not completely fail. We'll see how that goes. You have to kind of slide it in like that. You've engaged the cooling at this point and then these little arms here have to touch some chip sets on the board. There we go. It's a little slippery, but once they mount it it's now ready to be kind of sandwiched together. The first thing that you need to do is screw these standoffs onto the very long bolts and then once that's done which they have kind of cool screwdrivers for. They don't have one right here so I can't show you, lttstore.com, you can get a cool screwdriver too. But once that's done, once the standoffs are planted just put another GPU on top and do the same thing. Once you get the heat sink in place you're ready to prep it for adding another GPU. First off, need to add this support so it gets tucked under one of the heat pipes here and then I'm not gonna do it because it's gonna take a bunch of time. Actually no, I'm doing it fast. Let's go. Nice. Okay, then you feed the bolts through, put these risers on each one of the posts and then you can add another GPU on top of that so they're not touching, there's no metal on metal. And then OVH's own marked PCB. Custom riser gets plugged into both GPUs at the same time and your GPU sandwich is ready to go. These are the tested good GPUs which they are then going to put onto actual servers that are theoretically going to go into actual production. After the GPUs are mounted we then have to mount the motherboard, the RAM the CPU all that stuff you're used to seeing and all of the plugins for the riser cables because I mean well there's eight of them, one for every GPU. After that we're pretty much good to go for this stage. There's a little bit more testing that has to be done. A few other behind the scenes things but it gets held here because as far as building the computer is concerned other than a little bit more chassis, it's essentially done. My favorite last bit that I have to point out is these pipes up here. Water distribution things, they call them clarinets. I just had to include that. (upbeat music) Once each rack has been proved good for at least a day it is then sent to an OVH data center like this one. Upon arrival, they do retesting again all of the same previous phases that they did in a previous location. All of it is done again just to make sure that nothing went wrong in transport. Then once they're done and everything is ready it's installed here and is able to be used by users like you for whatever high performance applications they might need, other than obviously the one we're selling right now. That one be ready in a few minutes. All of the servers at every single OVH data center is water cooled and that takes some serious infrastructure to be able to accomplish along with a bunch of R&D. Some of that infrastructure has actually been right in front of us this whole time. It's this gigantic metal plate. Below that huge metal plate is a massive reservoir. This reservoir was actually built by a separate company, a bottling company that owned this building before OVH but they've reused that infrastructure to use it as a backup reservoir just in case they need it. Below each one of these hatches is just a massive amount of water and that water is constantly being pH tested and there's even these really advanced looking pool skimmers moving around on top of it that are just making sure that none of the loops are gonna gunk up 'cause that would be a really, really big problem. Speaking of big problems moving all this water around is quite a difficult task and you'll find these pumps all throughout the facility. You'll always find them in pairs. The reason for that is because they'll run one at a time. They switch every workday. That's to make sure that each one has a very similar amount of worked hours and by using them all the time they're actually quite sure that they work, which is good. All of these advanced systems synchronize together including a few things that I can't really show you or talk about on camera, result in quite a dramatic difference. This pipe for instance is the water coming into the building. When I touch it, it's actually quite cold. This pipe is the water going out of the building and when I touch it, oh hey, it's around room temperature. The difference they say on average is about 15 to 20 degrees and you can see quite quickly why this would actually be worth doing instead of running air conditioning for this entire gigantic building. To make sure that all of this keeps running smoothly they have the monitoring room. I like to see it as a control center. I think they could probably launch a satellite from here but we'll see, time will tell. Over on the right side they have their fuel monitoring to make sure that they're generators which are their like third backup for power that they very rarely ever would need to use, actually still have fuel. Make sure they're gonna gonna run in the case that they do actually need it. Moving forward we have their incidents dashboard or notifications. Everything's green 'cause everything's going well right now. These red on the far right hand side are actually just information that they're receiving from different parts of the data center. Not anything that really needs to be addressed right now. Moving up here, they have their server monitoring. The whoa, haha, 1 is potentially down or might potentially have an issue. That's actually kind of cool that we saw that happen live so that will now be seen by the team and be able to be addressed. And the green zeros on the other two mean that there's no problems in those zones. Other parts of the screen, like in the middle here that's checking if different benchmarks have failed so maybe a system needs to be worked on. Down here it's things that need to be repaired or upgraded, etc. They're always tracking everything so that things can be handled very quickly. I actually saw people run around in the room behind the camera to address that as it happened, which is super cool. You want that type of stuff in a data center cause things are going to go wrong. So being able to address them quickly is key. Speaking of address them quickly, they also monitor the weather just in case something happens. If there's a storm, if there's a heat wave in the case of a storm, they might want to go around and just make sure that everything's okay as the storm's going on after the storm passes make sure everything is all hunky dory. Haven't necessarily had a problem but it's good to know. Coming outside it's more of the same but even bigger. They have some massive reservoirs back there that I can't show you. They also have some really cool heat exchangers just off camera in this direction that I can't show you but what I will say is standing amongst those outside in the cold is actually warmer than standing in the data center inside. So clearly they're working pretty well. In the background if you haven't noticed, there's some big power lines, power lines that would power, you know, like a city. But the 220,000 volts that they're delivering to the OVH building is just for OVH. That's their main intake. Just in case there's something wrong with that. Across the building on the other side, underground, they have more additional power lines bringing in 20,000 volts and if all of that isn't working they have some huge generators. Each one gives one megawatt of power when it's running and can run for up to 14 hours. But again, they very rarely ever have to use those. That's it for the tour of OVH and seeing how they build the servers and all that kind of stuff. Now I'm back in Canada at the studio and I have to show Linus how this kind of all comes together. So I have a Raspberry Pi system with Shadow installed, an iOS device with Shadow installed and a non-gaming laptop. An LG Gram with Shadow installed. On the Shadow Windows system we installed some various games and we're gonna have him check them out. - I get that you wanna show that it's a thin client. We're using the Raspberry Pi. Did you have to use the RasPi mouse? - Yes. Shadow does not claim to improve your peripherals at all. So this is what it came with. Also we had some issues getting the Raspberry Pi to work with a better monitor than this. - No, I'm fine. Scepter is king tier. - Yeah - It's right in the name. All right, let's go, sick. Really? - No one. No one drove you? - What are you guys, idiots? - So playing Halo, which is notoriously a little bit rough to run and playing it on a Raspberry Pi. That's pretty cool. And the fact that he's more focused on the game than anything else means, yeah, I think it's working pretty well. - Hey, I gotta kill already. Never mind focused on the game. I think you mean winning the game. Oh, Shadow's already running on another device. There, we found out what happens if you try to connect a second device. - [Luke] That was pretty simple. - It prompts you and you press a button and then.. Okay here we go. - Wait are you still in the game? - Hold on a second. Is this gonna work? No way! - [Luke] Whoa! - No way! Where's my uh. (imitates shooting sound) Okay I mean, to be clear, this is not an ideal controller set up but you totally could. - [Luke] That's sweet. - [Jake] I'll buy you lunch if you get a frag. - Oh yeah? These onscreen joystick, as someone who doesn't mobile game. Oh right. Come on, come on, come on. Oh, bleep, I like popped him. Come on. I got him! I got him! Yeah! - First fight too. He never died. - I can't believe that just happened. - I think that's a pretty good point to end it on? Could you see? - [Andrew] Yeah, I got it. - Thanks for watching. I don't know what else to watch after this. They'll put something on screen. - Go watch the old Shadow one or something. I don't know, or care. - Yeah, sounds good. Let us know what you think in the comments below and ya, see ya.",

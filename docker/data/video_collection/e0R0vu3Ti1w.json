    "transcript": "- This has been in my house for like two years. This is the reMarkable 1. And my wife bought it when she randomly took a calculus class for fun. 'Cause that's her idea of fun. And I think she used it for probably a combined 12 hours. Now I'm touching it for the very first time because I also have a pile of reMarkable 2 stuff here. So I like to do a side-by-side comparison of what they're like, from the perspective of never using it before. So we're gonna see how easy it is to use. As far as the stuff I got for the reMarkable 2, you can see two types of stylus here, the Marker and the Marker plus. This is the basic one that costs $50. And then this one costs a hundred dollars. What are the rest of the stuff? Okay. This is a folio. That's a sold separately option. This appears to be the tablet itself. That's $400 and you can buy it by itself but if you don't get a stylus then it's basically an e-reader? And then this is another folio. Premium leather black. Okay. little welcome package here. Welcome to a better thinking community. A growing movement of people committed to finding focus in a distracted world, but not wanting to use paper. Quick start guide. Long press to edit or share. Swipe. Oh, make an account to get the full experience on the cloud. Not doing that. Not now anyway. USB type A on one side and USB type C on the other side. Okay. This is already feeling better. Okay. Whoa. This is way more premium feeling. And I guess it's kind of asymmetrical. This is like thicker and taller and has symmetrical bezels. But this one has like a spine, like kind of like a book except of course you can't open it and it has more of an aluminum body. This actually feels really nice. I know that the first one had like a plastic construction for the screen. Whereas this one has, I believe glass. So I wanna check out if that's gonna have a different pen feel. They have the same 10.3 inch screen size the same pixels per inch, kind of retina level. It's 1872 by 1404 pixels which is 226 PPI random resolution. Oh cool. This has a really way more subtle power button up there compared to the big old button in the middle here. I wanna try. I'm left-handed. Surprise, this one's set up for right now. What this does it changes what side the UI is on it's 'cause they want to reduce the amount of screen that needs to be like palm rejected all the time. All right. Now it's time for, the stylus' off. I'm gonna start with the basic one. Oh, there it is. It's plastic. Pretty similar to the other one. Neither of them have any like clicky, eraser or anything on them. I don't know. How do they attach? Well, okay this one looks like it's got magnets basically everywhere. No, not the front. Kind of on the side though. And then this one, I think, yeah you just need to get a folio or something that has the little holder for it or put it in your ear like an artist. This one has a more textured finish (indistinct) like sandblasted like that OnePlus phone that had that. It's kind of grippy. This one's just smooth plastic. And they have graphite tips. I believe these are replaceable marker tips. There they are. Whoa, this is how you take it out. You like slide it in there until it gets thin and pull it or something. Oh, here we go. There it is. And then do I just like shove that in there? Oh my God yes. And it's in. Share by email, convert to PDF, convert to text and send. You can actually (indistinct) hand write or print with your hand and then use this to convert it to text that you can then email yourself or save which is pretty awesome. But as I understand you need to be connected to the internet and log into your reMarkable account for that to work I believe. Stream data, live view, stream your writing and sketching instantly by connecting to your computer. That's kind of interesting. There's also like 50 different templates you can use. So if you want line paper or like graphing paper or whatever, I just want a blank page right now. So I'm gonna start with that. I wanna check out the feel first off. That's like pretty tactile. It has, you can hear the scratchiness to it now. Now let's just see what it's like writing on glass. Like an unbroken glass I like this, the one, I am lifting the pencil off of the tablet at the end of that stroke. And then I can see this stroke completing like it's finishing drawing while my pen is off just for a second there. And I read that they had better latency on the glass version which was one of the reasons I switched it, so. I can still see that there's some latency there but it is better. It is better. Now both the pens support tilting. So you can shade. You can see, I can do really dark or I can do like let's see how light I can get and still register a pencil stroke. It's not like real life. In real life I can do, see how it's getting done, in real life I can do lighter strokes. Like here, it's just not reading them. So it doesn't have that much sensitivity. Though this pen does have double the sensitivity gradations than the original it's up to like 4,096 or something like that while this is 2000 and something. Another cool thing you can do with this is you can open up PDFs full on documents and just mark them up. If you like marking up documents with a pen and then you can email them off right from there. So even if you're not taking notes in class or an artist who likes to draw just technically you can be an engineer and just wanna mark up documents or professional project manager and send them off. I could see value in that. I wish there was more than just three settings with the thickness in this pencil. This is my face. When I am on Short Circuit it's not a happy face, but I am happy. You just can't tell 'cause I've resting and active face honestly. It is the very light shading where it suffers. Like I really wanted that to be half unless I'm using it wrong. I just don't really think this is for artists to sketch with. Changing from thick to thin helps but that's kind of just the fineness of the pen and not necessarily the lightness.

This one cost twice as much. It is heavier. It is more premium feeling. It has a clicky end on it and an eraser. So let's check that out. It doesn't have the same finish. It actually feels somewhere between reMarkable 1 and 2's pens. It has a bit of a grippiness to it, but not as much. Oh, I thought it it was clicky, it's not. I think the reMarkable 1 premium pen was clicky. I wish I had, it feels nice to have that. Even if it didn't do anything, on the reMarkable 1 it didn't do anything, but it's still nice to like finish something (indistinct) at the tick. You know or like, I had a friend who used to always click on his forehead when he was done writing. You don't need to turn them on. It just works. That's cool. Let's see what the eraser is about. Oh, that's cool. It feels almost like it wobbles. 'Cause it does depress a bit. It doesn't click, but it does depress. It feels pretty realistic in that if you use the side of it it doesn't erase as thoroughly as when I tip it over on end and then it's like really on. Battery life, same size battery as reMarkable 1. So no improvement there it'll last you quite a long time. I wouldn't think that's a concern really. Like when everyone who has a Kindle knows you just chuck it in your bag and then come back day or later and they're fine. Although I will say I'm dropped a 47% now where I think I was at 50 at the beginning of this video. It's a 3000mah battery. So about the same as your phone but should go a lot farther. The original one had a one gigahertz CPU unit Single Core. This one has a Dual Core 1.2 gigahertz CPU. It also, like the first one has eight gigabytes of storage. That's unchanged. I guess, it doesn't take a lot of room to make documents and you can just send them off and archive them if you start to get filled up. They claim it's the world's thinnest tablet. Well, I mean that's kind of cheating. It's pretty damn thin though. The form factor is cool. This reminds me of what Steve Jobs probably had in his mind when he was first conceiving of what laptops could be like back when they had like, you know, the laptops were like this thick and he thought, oh, it'd be cool if it was like a book. This is just like a slate like this is like a rigid notebook. I wanna know how much more it weighs than the original given that the original was plastic all the way around. So 350 grams versus something that has an aluminum construction and glass on the top. 400 grams. So that's pretty good. The most basic folio you can buy from their website. I believe it's $70. That's probably what that was. Okay. Really simple. It doesn't feel great. Okay. It's not like window or anything. It's just a carrying case and I guess it has a stylus sleeve also nice and tight. Yeah. This is just basic protection. Pull it out. It's not gonna add a lot of bulk. It doesn't have any extra pockets or buttons or anything. I actually prefer this design. Now, if you wanted to just spend more I think up to 150 bucks for the leather ones. Okay. This basically just looks like a Moleskine book, or like a notebook almost. Oh yeah. See that was kind of satisfying. I can see that there. Oops. There goes my pen. It doesn't look like it's meant to be like tented or be an easel. But look at that, like, this is pretty Sci-fi. Now where does your stylus go? Yeah. That's okay. If someone shoves you in the hallway, and wants your lunch money it's not like really on there. (Stylus Pen falls) I don't think I would trust this honestly. See how it's not flat. It's an incline. So that means as you go farther on the page the hill slope adjusts, as I get to the end of the page, I'm not even on it anymore. That sucks, so I would use it in landscape or I mean it's easy enough to just pop it out. Get rid of that and then just put it back in at the end of class and go. This is sick. But if, is this 150 bucks? I need to check. Cause that's a lot. So this is 69 dollars. Then there's a book version of this material. That's a hundred dollars. Then this is the premium leather book version. And this is 150 US dollars. That's, come on. So what you can do is buy the reMarkable 1. They're still selling it on their website with a folio and a stylus for 300 bucks. So considering the folio is 70 bucks and the stylus is 50 and then the thing itself, you can get all of that for $300 or even a refurbished one for $20 off of that. Given that they have the same software and this like still feels fine. It doesn't look as cool. Then you're gonna notice the Ram difference when you go to open new documents, turning pages is about the same speed, but when you open a new PDF it'll open faster on the new one, but if you're strapped for cash and you don't think you're gonna use this a ton. Find one of those Gen ones. If you think you're gonna use it a lot and you need to look cool in front of the ladies or gentlemen, this thing is pretty sweet and slick. Folks that's about all I have to say about it. I think it's actually pretty cool. I think this is what you want. You won't be disappointed. I think I'll be selling this cause my wife never used it. And I'm still mad although I can't find my Kindle right now. So maybe I should just be using this as an e-reader. Thanks for watching Short Circuit today guys. And if you liked this video, like.

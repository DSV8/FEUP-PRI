    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine! Happy Saint Patrick's Day! I am here with my sister, Jenna. - Hello. - Today we are gonna make shamrock shakes and also cream cheese cones. I wanted to just make the shamrock shake for a video, and I was like that's like one simple thing. Basically we're blending ice cream and dying it green, and that's it. - That sounds like a stomach ache waiting to happen. - It does, but it's gonna be so delicious. - It will be. - So, not only are we gonna make the shamrock shakes, which is one of my favorite things from McDonald's ever. Do you remember when we came back from moving? - Yes! - Where were we? - [Both] The Grand Canyon. - And I got a Shamrock Shake at McDonald's and about lost my mind. I ordered it from the little machine, I picked it, and then it just showed up. - [Jenna] Do you think this will be better than that? - [Justine] I don't know, probably not. - Really setting your expectations high there. - You gotta set your expectations-- - [Both] Super low. - So that when anything goes moderately well, - You're just like wow! - Wow! - This is great! - Expectations have been exceeded. - Your box is wet. - There's been a lot of rain in Los Angeles, and all my groceries, because I don't actually go to the store, they were on my doorstep and getting rained on. - It's very soggy. - Super soggy. - Do you think the cones are soggy? - No, I think they're in paper or plastic or something. - Oh, they are. - But the cones are for cheesecake. What the heck are these? I don't know, I was looking for something that was no-bake. No-bake shamrock shake cheesecake cones. (gasps) Let's get started. The first thing that we're gonna need is cream cheese. We need powdered sugar, we've got that. (tongue clicks) - Oh, I scared myself. Oh my goodness. - I think we need a bowl. - Oh, I've got you. - Oh, I love having a sous chef. I don't think that's where the bowls are. - Think they're smaller? - Probably bigger. - That's funny, 'cause look how many bowls are in here. (laughs) There's a lot of bowls. - For someone that actually does not cook or bake, other than making videos-- - [Jenna] This is a lot of things. - This is like full-fledged-- - There's a whole 'nother drawer of bowls over here. - So the first thing that we're gonna need to do is beat the cream cheese, sugar, and extracts until creamy. How do I beat them? - With a beater! - Do you think I use a beater or do I use my hand? - No, get the things. (buzzes) - [Jenna] Do you think this goes in here? - How many ounces? - I am, sorry. - Half cup powdered sugar. Wait, sugar. What are you doing? What's the problem here? - This one's the trouble one. Oh, shut up. - You got a half cup over there? - Of what? Liquid or dry? - Doesn't matter. Yeah, it does, dry. - Do I beat the cream cheese now? - I mean, we're gonna beat it soon. - I'm just like ready now. - Yeah, we gotta put in this. Oh, we needed vanilla extract. Can you grab me some vanilla from back there, as well? - Sure. - And no, no. - I didn't go anywhere yet. - Yes. Oh my God, the smells are horrible. We'll just put a little. - Bean paste? - I don't know is that three fourth? Three fourth what? For three fourth teaspoon? I think I put three fourth cup! - Whoops, almost knocked the lid over. That's not it, that's-- - That smells incredible. No, this is pure vanilla. - [Jenna] Wait, wait. - Do you need help? Are you okay? - I'm a strong, independent woman, but I might fall down. (blender whirrs) - That's enough. - [Jenna] You didn't measure. - Since when am I about that may use your life? Careful, careful. - [Jenna] It doesn't go lower. - [Justine] Careful, it's gonna start-- Dude, things are gonna happen. - I don't know what you want me to do. That smells lovely. - I'm gonna put the things back we've already used. - It's not mixing together. - It's in process. - Is this supposed to be room temperature cream cheese? This seems to be cold cream cheese. - These are questions that you have asked and I have not an answer for you. I'll get a spatula. I'm so fancy. Okay, so we've got a problem. - So here, okay, so we have a few problems. - What's next? - No. - Okay, how about this? Yeah, that's good. Perfect, that's incredible. You're so smart. - Oh my God, oh my God. - I'm sorry, this says refrigerate the mixture for at least an hour. Guess who's not doing that? - Who has time to put it in the freezer for six minutes? That was a very interesting taste that I just tasted. Do I need this anymore? - I'm not sure. - I'm gonna put it over here. - [Justine] I don't know. - What are we making? The cones. - I forgot. (laughs) How much do we need? Ow, my finger hurts! Says to fold in two cups. - Like this type of cup? - No, I think we just kind of use our measurement. No, wait, look on the side of the thing. What's it say? (sighs) Who's gonna get a tummy ache today? - Me! - Me, too. I think Tyler's gonna get a tummy ache. - He's gonna get a tummy ache. I'm just gonna scoop. - Yes, we don't wanna use it all because we need to save some of it for the top. - How about, look at this! About a cup and a half. - My shirt's falling off 'cause I'm small. - Could I put this in here? - Yeah, we're gonna fold it in. - Folded that lovely. - This isn't folding either, but I think that-- - Your internet installation is coming in 29 minutes. - This is sort of like oil and water. Hold the bowl for me. - Beat the cream cheese til creamy. Do you wanna use a whisk? - [Justine] No. - Do you need help? - I think we're good. That's nice. This looks, like just fine. I'm gonna put this in the freezer while we work on our shamrock shakes. - Okay. - What do we need? Ice cream. - [Jenna] You ever just have days where like-- - I've been having a week. - I think I've been having a twelve months. - We were so excited about 2018 being over because it was a bit of a struggle and then 2019 got here and it was like ha ha. - Could we have 2018 back? - Can we-- joke's on you. Joke's on me, joke's on you. One and one fourth cups of milk. Did I get the wrong kind? - No. (sniffs) Smells cold. - We need two cups of ice cream. - Well here's the problem, I used the ice cream scoop for the cooled whip. - You did use the ice cream scoop. What are you even doing? I think I have another scooper. That'll work, too. Oh, look at that. That's super unique of you. This is so incredibly easy. You're basically putting ice cream and milk into a blender. Got the mint in. Oh, two tablespoons of chocolate syrup. So I thought I had chocolate syrup, but I cleaned my fridge out and it was rotten. (laughs) Thank you for coming. - This doesn't look healthy. - It looks really good. I am loving it. - Make sure the cap is on or else. - Where are my cups at? - I guess I could've got them. - This looks like a milkshake option. - You look like a milkshake option. - Oh, love the-- oh, that's a little soupy. (blender whirrs) That's a little soupy. I did get-- Reddi Wip. - [Jenna] Oh, well that's disgusting. - We can't use straws because the Internet doesn't allow us to use straws anymore because it's bad for the environment. So we don't use them anymore. - I get it, you should get into metal straws. - We'll just put a lot of cream in this one. (cream hisses) - Do you have a stick? - A stick? - [Jenna] Oh you're just sticking your hands in there? - I mean honestly, I washed my hands. - When? - [Justine] Look at that shamrock shake. (cream hisses) (laughs) - I'm sorry. How is it? - It tastes like I put peppermint extract into a blender with ice cream and milk. I'll tell you what, though-- - It's very pepperminty. - The whipped cream is incredible. - Are shamrock shakes pepperminty? - Yeah. Here, Tyler, get a tummy tickle. - You don't have to get a tummy tickle. - You don't have to, but. - Tastes like the holidays. (soft music) - Look, he got a little-- - Oh, come on. (laughs) - I don't have a beard. - That's really good. - Oh my God, it's all-- (laughs) I already have to go to the bathroom. - [Jenna] Let's let Maddie out and let's let her get you. - Yeah, get her. Let Maddie give a lick. (laughs) Maddie isn't that-- give him kisses. Give him kisses. - [Jenna] Maddie, that's like a puppuccino. - [Justine] Oh my God, he's terrified. - Hey. He's like, \"You look different.\" - [Jenna] He also won't take food from Justine's mouth. - I know I always try to get him to take egg out of my mouth. It's too dumb. - [Tyler] Oh my gosh. - [Justine] Well this is content. - This is content. - [Jenna] This isn't 25 minutes, I don't want to cut out. - All right, well, we're gonna clean up and we'll be back with the cones. - This is content. Small. - They are very small. - Do you have a rack? - This is not it. - Take that back, that's useless to me. - I definitely had them before. Here, let's put it in the toaster. - No - Yeah, this is fine. Oh, shoot. So this toaster isn't plugged in. - That didn't work. I have made a mistake. - Call me MacGyver, or call me Vera Verrills. That's not gonna-- it's no. I'm already feelin' the tummy tickles from that previous snack. - Yeah, for sure. - Oh my God, yeah, this is working so perfect. It's actually working perfectly. (hums) But, you didn't-- what are you doing? - [Justine] That one, you can't do anything with. - No, you can't. We have one more left. - Do you have another toaster? What other appliances can we put it in? - [Justine] That looks nice. - [Jenna] What about a cup? - What about my mouth? - Now you've soiled it. - This is really good. (playful music) - Look, I don't like it that much. - So we basically just taste tested it. I just don't want-- okay, there we go. So what we can do to taste test-- (crunches) It's pretty good. So, I think that this is something that you could make for a picnic or a St. Patrick's Day date. (laughs) You should show up at your date's door. Baby, I made you a cream cheese cone! I'd be like, \"What?\" I'd be like, \"Take me now, I'm yours.\" This is really great. - I'm not gonna lie, I don't think I would eat this unless I was being forced to. (laughs) - Not very good to be honest with you. (dog barks) - The dog is upset. - Well, thank you guys for watching. - I gotta go handle this. - Hope that you moderately enjoyed this video. - Don't make that. - Go check out Jenna's channel and Happy St. Patrick's Day. (dog barks) - [Jenna] Okay, okay, okay. (dog barks) - I was gonna put sprinkles on it, but honestly, it doesn't even freaking matter. - At all. (phone chimes) - Okay, this video is over now. - [Tyler] Okay, cut. - Oh my God. - I was like, it's not good. (playful music)",

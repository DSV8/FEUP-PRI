    "transcript": "(gentle music) - Okay, so the Tesla Robtaxi unveiling event was a couple days ago and it might be the weirdest tech event I've ever been to. You might have seen some clips from it at this point. I was there, I rode in the self-driving Robotaxi. I explored the insane looking Robovan and I talked to the Optimus robot and then I left feeling kind of confused. It was a weird event. So here are the three main big reasons why. So first of all, the robo cab, this was the main thing that we knew we were going to see, this full unveiling of a fully self-driving Tesla. And we saw it and it looked like this, very, very much like a mini Cybertruck. Like you've got the light bar on the front, the light bar on the back, the complete lack of rear visibility. Then, of course you can see it's a two-door, two seater passenger car. People were wondering like what a full self-driving robo cab or cyber taxi, whatever we're calling it would actually look like whether it'd look dramatically different from a normal car like a Model 3 or even a Waymo. And there are some things that are significantly different about this thing they rolled out. I mean on the outside it's light gold. Every single one is this like silvery gold color, although there was never any mention of actual materials. Pretty small footprint, you can see there's no exterior door handles, or mirrors, or anything like that. And then, since they don't need any steering wheel or pedals, they can sort of push the seating position way back into this more like loungey seating position kind of near the middle of the car there's a center armrest and there's a massive 21 inch touchscreen in the center. And yes, the doors go up as if Tesla hasn't learned from their lessons of the Model X, they're making another crazy set of doors which, honestly, is definitely a hit visually. It's a striking feature of this car alongside the wheels which, at first, just look like these huge gold discs. But then, when you take a closer look, they're actually just normal 21 inch low rolling resistance continental tires. But they've painted half of the sidewall gold to match the caps in the middle. So it makes it look like a super thin low profile tire with a huge wheel, but it's not, it's just paint. But either way, no idea how much of this is gonna make it to any sort of final production. But after waiting in line for a bit, I got to ride in this thing for a few minutes. So I got in, the screen told me to buckle my seatbelt, and once I did, the door automatically closed, pretty smart. Then I just selected the destination, which was on this screen along this route, which I assume was pre-mapped. And then it just started rolling, just started going. Now, I've been in a self-driving Tesla before, but this one is just a little bit more nervy since there's people everywhere and there's no steering wheel in front of me. But once you get over the eeriness of basically being trapped in this driverless car with no manual override, I started looking around and noticing a few other things. You know, you sit pretty low to the road, similar to a Model 3, but with more leg room since the seating position's further back. And then, there's even fewer physical controls than ever before in this car. Like I basically only found that the window switches were in the middle next to the cup holders. I didn't even see any door latches. Like the doors only opened with a button on this enormous touch screen. So again, like a Tesla, it's gonna control everything in the car on the screen including just watching movies while the car is driving because why not? So you can watch the entire trip that I took uncut on the auto-focus channel if you want, I'll link that below. But then the thing is that's kind of all we got. Like there were shockingly few details about the actual car actually explained at this event other than basically like the three main pillars which are gonna be in all the headlines which are number one that it will be fully unsupervised, self-driving capable. Number two, that it'll be able to be purchased for under $30,000, all right. But then number three, that it would actually also charge by inductive wireless charging. So it pulls up over this wireless charging pad on the ground and it would charge that way. Not something we've seen shipping in very many cars, especially not ones with large batteries, but that was it. No other numbers, no other specs. Just look at this thing, there's just concepts of a plan. I just had so many other questions after seeing that. Like what is going on here? I did at the event walk around after the announcement and bump into some Tesla engineers and people who had been working on these things. And so, I just ended up kind of grilling them. Like I asked them a whole bunch of questions. So I'm gonna tell you guys what I learned from them and I guess we can take their word for it. So first of all, there is no steering wheel or pedals, as you can see so my first question was, all right, let's say I see an accident coming or there's something happening on the road in front of me and the car isn't reacting in time, is there a manual override? And the answer I got was, sure, there will be some sort of minimal onscreen controls available, but the goal is that you never have to override which is a noble goal, for sure. I just mean it's hard to imagine. We live in a world where that's impossible, basically, right now but I mean, even with the wireless charger, picture you wanna like drive over the top of it and line it up perfectly because if it's off a little bit, that's just a giant waste of power. But if I can't adjust it like that would be terrible. But speaking of wireless charging, you might be wondering why they would try to do this? The main answer, again, is because they want it to be totally autonomous. They want people to just be able to own several, like a fleet of these things and they all just drive around and charge themselves overnight. And the whole cable plugging in charging thing requires a human so that's one less human required. It'll just line up on the notoriously inefficient wireless charger. But my question again was, okay, is there at least a charge port so if I want to supercharge or charge quickly, I can do that? And the answer was, no, there is no charge port on this vehicle. So it is not even capable of hitting a Tesla supercharger, or doing any sort of road trips, or anything like that, it's purely a taxi. I'm told there is no plans for a front trunk. There's just the rear trunk that they showed in this presentation. And there's no planned range or a stated battery size. But what they did say is they're simply aiming for this vehicle to be as efficient as possible, that's their main goal, between the aerodynamics and the low rolling resistance tires, they think they can aim for about 5.5 miles per kilowatt hour. Some of the most efficient electric cars we see today are getting around 3 to 4 miles per kilowatt hour. So this would be like an A plus efficiency, if they achieve this and that's what will let them use a smaller overall size battery for the lighter weight of the vehicle. So it'll be nice, they're saying, to clear 200 miles of total range and that would put this at maybe a 40 kilowatt hour battery pack instead of the typical 70 to 130. So drive train wise, that logic does check out. You wanna make the cheapest, most efficient electric car of all time, you gotta hit those things. But then again, you're also telling us this while doing a car with scissor doors and wireless charging. So you're gonna have some challenges there, for sure. But really I think the obvious red flag, the biggest red flag to me is the timeline stuff that, I mean this is notorious Elon stuff. He gets on stage, he says, \"We're gonna have \"this vehicle out for $30,000 before 2027.\" No they're not, there's just no way that they're actually gonna be able to do that. I mean if they do, let's say they do, I will shave my head on camera 'cause I'm not confident they won't do it. Like I wanna be optimistic, but there's just too much stacked up against it because in order to ship this at all with no steering wheel and everything, they have to get all the regulatory approval for the full self-driving and all that, and get all the prices down in spite of inflation and ship something with scissor doors and all this stuff in the next two years, there's just no way. Tesla's been promising full unsupervised self-driving for years over and over and over again and consistently keeps pushing it back. But then also just price-wise, I get the goal, but Tesla promised a $35,000 Model 3 and years later I think they briefly actually shipped that car for that price for a little bit before discontinuing it. Cybertruck, I don't know if you remember, do you remember the base price of what they said the Cybertruck would cost at the cheapest version when it came out? $39,000 and that was about what, like four or five years ago? Do you know what the cheapest Cybertruck is right now? $95,000, so you can see where my skepticism is coming from. But even after all that, you know, there's kind of a philosophical question too which is what is the difference between this, this Robotaxi thing and a Model 3? Because Tesla has been promising for years that the car that people are driving and buying today is gonna be capable of full unsupervised self-driving, like the Model 3 and the Model Y? And it's actually not clear if there's that many differences. I mean, obviously, okay, one's gonna have a steering wheel and four doors and four seats and the whole thing and maybe be a bit more expensive. But like, yeah, if my car is gonna be able to do all that stuff I think I want the one that can plug into superchargers and do all sorts of carrying things. Maybe this will be an old fashioned way of thinking at some time in the future, like every car on the road is autonomous and it's like an \"old school\" thing to want the one with the steering wheel that you can drive sometimes, maybe. I think the main advantage of the Robotaxi, if it has the exact same capabilities as a Model 3 is it'll be cheaper, and smaller and easier to operate in a fleet situation. That will probably be the main difference as far as actually buying these things because they've been selling people the dream of the car that you buy and own today, you'll drive it to work and then, when you're at work, it'll go drive people around as an Uber for 10 hours or however long and then, you drive it home when you need it and then, when you're sleeping it'll continue to drive and Uber people around. And so, it has all these amazing capabilities, it'll do all this great stuff, but will it though? There's actually a moment I had to re-watch the event 'cause I was there and people are like yelling out the whole time like stuff at Elon on stage. And at this point in the presentation he goes like, oh yeah, Model 3 and Model Y will also do full self-driving. And then someone goes like, what about the Cybertruck? And then he says, oh yeah, don't worry, Cybertruck too. - So and Cybertruck too, yes, of course. Sorry, I don't wanna forget, yes, yes. All our cars, basically. - So yeah, okay, all our vehicles great, but then it's kind of quiet, but then someone else yells out, \"What about Hardware 3?\" Which is, basically if you don't know, a reference to older Model 3s. And his response... - So... [Audience Member] Hardware 3, Hardware 3, Hardware 3. - Let's not get nuanced here. - [Audience Member] What? - All right, next slide. - So yeah, let's not get too nuanced, all our cars will have it except maybe some of the old ones. All our cars will be able to self-drive though, totally. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it, how 'bout that? But here's a bridge that I don't think we'll ever actually get to cross, which is the second thing that was insane that was announced at this event, which is the Robovan. So somewhere about halfway through this presentation, they roll out this one of one super futuristic looking massive van thing. Kind of looked like a... It looked like the military vehicles from \"I, Robot,\" to be honest, which that's probably not a good thing. But yeah, it rolls out and they give us, again, very, very few details. This is gonna be a Robovan that can hold like up to 20-ish people and it, again, will be fully electric and fully autonomous and take groups or teams of people from point A to point B. No manual override necessary, great. Have you ever been to CES? Have you ever watched videos from CES? Every year in January there's this trade show, it's really fun, in Vegas and if you ever go, you'll notice in the south hall there's a section with all the cars, the mobility section. And you'll find about 50 of these, every year there's just like a van with no steering wheel and a bunch of seats that all face the middle. And it's like the future of mobility concept. There's tons of those. None of them ever ship, of course, because there are rules. But I guess there's not, to me, a whole lot that differentiates that brief concept we saw at the Tesla event with dozens of other vaporware versions of this that I've seen before, that's all I'm saying. I mean, the fact that this one comes from Tesla is the main differentiator, this is the company that could maybe theoretically make it happen. But like I said, there's almost no details about this thing. And I have almost no faith that that thing that they showed with its minimal clearance, and its glass everywhere and just lack of numbers or anything I don't think that we'll ever actually see that thing. I could eat my words, but like that seems crazy. But then last but not least, Tesla decided to bring back... They decided to remind us that they're also an AI company, not just a car company by bringing back out the Optimus humanoid robot again. So they had these things all over this event this time, dancing, doing these pre-rehearsed demos. But also, they were just kind of out and about. They were serving drinks and snacks and they were walking around and interacting with and entertaining people just like hanging out amongst everyone at this event. Now, I already have my thoughts that I've talked about, you know, humanoid robots before. I made a whole video about it, if you wanna watch it, I'll leave a link below the Like button. I've talked about Tesla's Optimus. But even just what we saw with that, would've been a huge step forward from what we've ever seen. Like this would've been one of the most impressive things ever. But then, they decided to take it further. They also decided to have these robots talking to people and, I mean, it was way too fast to be an LLM. Like just watch this clip. - [Optimus] Would you like a piece of chocolate? - I will take some chocolate. - [Optimus] Right on, what's your name? - [Vanessa] Vanessa. - [Optimus] Vanessa? - Yes, Vanessa. - [Optimus] Nice, pleasure to meet you, Vanessa. - Nice to meet you too. - [Optimus] I'm Optimus. - [Optimus] Have a great night - [Vanessa] Great Optimus thank you. - [Optimus] Bye. - Like it's just a person, it's a person talking through a speaker. It it even like stutters and makes occasional like human mistakes. If you watch a bunch of videos from the event, a bunch of different robots all have slightly different voices. Yeah, it was a person, for sure. And it's weird because Tesla, at no point, at least as of the time of recording, has not acknowledged this at all. They haven't said that or confirmed that, but people there at the event have heard various things from various engineers, I talked to two engineers who only would tell me, yes, all of the LLMs do run totally on device. But like, yeah, no, I don't think so. So this kind of became like the talking point of the whole event, like now we don't know how much of this event was real or not so real. Like how much of what these robots are doing is human controlled or AI. You know, there were all kinds of hand waving, and gestures and movements. I played charades with one of them. You know what it reminds me of? Remember that video I did at Disney's Imagineering Labs where they had these bipedal robots that were controlled by a steam deck controller? They did all kinds of walking around and stringing animations together to entertain people at the parks. There's just a bunch of button presses and controllers to make that happen. And sure, there's some AI to blend that stuff, but you could never deny that there's, basically, entirely human control happening here. And that's, basically, what I think is happening at this Tesla event, lots of impressive and entertaining things in the form of a super advanced articulating robot stringing animations together. But it's just not totally ready to do this stuff on its own. We've never seen anything quite like it, even from Boston Dynamics, but we gotta be real about the human assisted part. But the thing is, the dream that they are selling people with this specific robot is that this thing will live with you basically, it will be your human sized friend, actually. They said that it would be your friend, it would do chores for you, it would live around you and be able to do all these sorts of tasks on its own using the AI and the vision-based system. I think that's a really far off dream. AI is really, really quickly improving. But I still think that's a far off dream. So, you know, to their credit, this event, it was insane. Like they did a lot of things that could have gone wrong. And if you told me in 2024 that a company would do a bunch of self-driving car demos around tons of people just loose in the road and they would have bipedal humanoid robots roaming around performing tasks and entertaining people at the same event and that they would have a drone show like that is just a lot of stuff in a row that is super high tech that could go wrong, but somehow didn't. And it represented, I think, a very optimistic view of the future, even though it's very much still like concepts, it's a future that is potentially way more efficient, potentially way safer and more impressive in general technologically than the world we live in today. So that by itself, I think is honorable. The things that they were hoping to be real would be amazing and inspirational and honorable if they actually happened. But since they are also a public tech company, they felt the need to do demos and give all these big promises. And that's where it felt weird because it's really hard to make promises about when we're gonna deliver this future and for what price we're gonna deliver this future when it just feels very unlikely. And then doing the like, robots talking, it's just like now the whole thing is in question. Like how much of it is real, how much of it is fake? And then, now we're focusing on that instead of how cool the future could someday actually be. That's where I'm at but hey, if there is one company that has the best chance of bringing this all to life, if you made me bet money on one company that I think has the best odds to get there eventually, then, yeah, it would be the one with the massive data gathering advantage with stuff out there in the real world today. It would be Tesla so I'll believe it when I see it. Thanks for watching, catch you guys in the next one, peace.",

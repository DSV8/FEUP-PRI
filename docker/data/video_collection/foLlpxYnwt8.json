    "transcript": "Looks like there is a little tape on the box! Virtual Reality, Right? You've experimented with it, you may have experienced it in some form. Maybe it was Google Cardboard? Maybe it was a more elaborate headset But listen, there is a lot of criticism Some people just get fired up and are not into it But part of that has to do with Sub-optimal experiences Certainly at first exposure where people are like dragging around. Can't load the thing Can't get the resolution that they want and so on and so on. Listen! It's growing pains, it's not there yet But one of the things that keeps a lot of people away Is this feeling of... nauseousness This company over here Wearality Sky I mean that's the name of their product here Their company is Wearality They're attempting to provide a more... \"Natural\" virtual real- is their such a thing? No not really, But Through increasing the field of view The goal here Is to give you a more realistic maybe less jarring, less inclosed version of VR It's all suppose to happen right here Now you're still using the (Google) Cardboard App You're still playing around with whatever is available In the VR spectrum of your smartphone Right now which obviously isn't everything But you clip into here you have a few experiences and maybe you see VR like you haven't before \"Mobile 3D headset with super wide field of view. It features an open, light weight and foldable design.\" It's less claustrophobic That's the game plan. I don't know how big the impact is gonna be. Let's do it! *music* Need one of these some... Wow Did you see that? Sometimes you need one of these ooo oo o! Don't Play with knives kids, don't play with knives. this immediately looks a lot different, A LOT DIFFERENT than any other VR type of goggles lock your phone in there install the cardboard app (Yeah, yeah yeah) Scan the QR and they want you to get started with VR Rollercoaster GREAT!!!! This guy is whats gonna hold the phone I assume. WOAH! OH oh! Woah HO OH! WOAW! Aaa Jack? *music* This must be for extended sessions. Thats like a Go Pro Mount. OH! MAN! This is.. This is to mount it on your head. Thats gonna be a good look.. Isn't it? It slides in like this Its actually pretty easy! Now ofcourse your gonna have dual images.... Okay! Now i need the QR Successfully paired! Not that many people, actually go out and get headsets. It's a kind of thing you gotta Dive In! *music* thats it! *laughs* I'm gonna start with Roller Coaster number one[#1] *sound* oooh Oooaa Baby! *sound* Ooaaaaaaaa oh!!! Man these Roller Coaster ones[#1] Man! You feel it in your stomach! Isn't that what you want? you wan't to feel Oaaaah! *retching noise* Oh my! Ohhh! oh oh ohhhhh! *retching noise* Maybe if i went on a real Roller Coaster I'd be a disaster as well.. at this point of my life The equilibrium is off! Certainly, it gives you a great view. They're not lying... There's a super wide field of view. But it's doing nothing to circumflect the fact that my body is telling me one thing and my mind. *laughs* Isn't that like from a R&B song? Body says one thing, But your heart says no! Darling, I'm making dinner for you tonight. I mean is it all that different I guess? you got a lot of accessories If you wanna wear the thing I kind a like the fact that, you're not completely closed off! So many of these devices. Like this. Are really, for the purpose of experimenting with VR There not meant to be on your face everyday. One of the thing's holding VR back, Is that many people can't experiment, or experience it at all! I don't necessary want to go out and get a PlayStation VR headset, or an Oculus Rift and spend a boat load of money! So you end up in this... territory. What's cool about this Is that it can work as an headset But also.. just as a quick viewer. I dont know man! VR is WIERD! It's kinda like, any emerging technology. Where it's like.. The technology goes out into the world And then humans have to figure out, how to make it good... or how to make it worthwhile. You guys probably know, I did a experiment recently, with three(3) separate 360 Video... Video's. If you haven't seen that yet you might wanna go back and Check it out! Just to kinda, Get an idea... That said, even that experiment isn't exactly perfect Cause(because) the vast majority of you who interacted with that weren't in any kinda headset, at all! To a certain extent, people will want to watch stuff to be lazy.. to be a vegetable Right?! You know? You should see Jack, when hes watching something I mean the man's foaming at the mouth. I talked about this!! what people in the past were guarding like Nintendo Wii !! You remember when the Nintendo Wii came out? Everybody lost their minds!!! They were like I'M PLAYING TENNIS NOW What happened? HUH?! Human being's did, What human being's do. what just! Wanna get back to the COUCH! I think the type of VR experience, That's gonna move things... Push things! Is one, really placed to that component. The idea that we just wanna be a Passenger! People wanna be less involved. They don't wanna be physically jumping around, and moving around... for the most part. This is a very anti-social kind of scenario Right?! Somebody comes over to your place They're like, Hey Lew! I heard the games on.. Lets have a beer I'm like *LooksUpInVR* That's always been my favourite part of Video Games. In General. Socialising a little bit around it. The Relevance of Technology, still at some point... Comes back, to its interactivity with people. And that's a place that VR, has no clue how to operate right now! It doesn't fit very easily... into that world, into that social sphere. The Real World keeps calling.... *music* And I'm here to pick up that phone.....",

    "description": "The Cybertruck has a very uniquely shaped truck bed. But we don't judge. Grab your own Taiga Snowmobile HERE:  and use code 'JerryRig' for $500 off. I am a Taiga partner. Today we are trying to fit a Snowmobile in the back of a Tesla Cybertruck, as well as a Ford Lightning and a Rivian R1T. Snow machines are a regular part of life for people who live in the northern states and Canada, and its incredibly cool that the Tesla Cybertruck can charge up the Electric Taiga Nomad while hauling it to and from the mountains. Electric snow machines have no maintenance! The future has arrived!   Watch how Taiga builds their Electric Jet skis HERE:   Get $1000 dollars off your Cybertruck here:   Thanks to @OurCyberLife for letting me borrow his truck!",

    "transcript": "Let's pause, rewind, and think about this for just a second. Taking Cambry snowmobiling today, it's going to be her first time in a Cybertruck and first time on a fully electric Taiga snowmobile. I treated myself to two of the Nomad Performance Editions without knowing if they fit in the Rivian, the Ford Lightning, or the Cybertruck. Normally snowmobiles fit in the back of full sized trucks just fine, but the bed on this Cybertruck is a little bit wonky. The bed on the Cybertruck has a different dimension on the bottom than it does on the top level, and I'll show you what I mean. That back edge right there slants upward. So if we measure the base of the Cybertruck, we have exactly 6'1\", and coming up here to the top of the slope we have exactly 5'6\", so it's a very unique shape. It's narrow at the bottom width wise with 4'2\", and then at the top of the bed about 4'10\". So it's weirdly shaped on every angle, but that might be good when it comes to snowmobiling. For example, the Rivian is much better suited to holding rectangular objects with the bed sides at 90 degree angles and a bed length with the tailgate down at exactly 7 feet. Which turns out isn't quite enough for a sled as big as the Taiga Nomad. It is secure. The Nomad weighs about 750 pounds and most of that weight is in the front, but there's just a tad more track sticking out the back than I would like. The tailgate can hold 1,000 pounds, but it still just looks a little bit sketchy, which would be not ideal driving down the freeway. One thing we do have to keep in mind though is that on snowmobiles they have carbide blades running along the length of the skis acting like rudders so they can pass over asphalt or concrete without dissolving the ski or sanding it all away. And that carbide tip is a level 9 on Mohs scale of hardness right there next to diamonds, and it will demolish anything in its path including asphalt and truck beds, leaving deeper grooves wherever it goes. And it looks like with the Rivian the carbides are still dicing up the bed a little bit, but these raised lips in the center do keep the carbides off of the interior. It's just this lip right here that's getting jacked up. The Ford Lightning has a slightly longer bed with the tailgate dropped at 7 feet 7 inches, and that 7 inches really matters. The Tayga fits much better in the back of the Lightning. The Lightning though only has a tailgate that supports about 600 pounds, so we are pushing the limits by having a snow machine in the back. The truck bed of the Lightning, even after having loaded the snowmobile in twice, is pretty well scratched up, so we're going to put a piece of plywood down in the cyber truck to protect the bed since it's not mine, and it's never a good idea to damage another man's truck. Total bed length with the tailgate down is 8 feet half an inch, which is much longer than the other two. That sheet of plywood fits perfectly. Let's see how it goes. There's a little bit of overhang, but this is normal when putting a sled in a truck, and the overhang on this is substantially less than the other two electric trucks, the Lightning and the Rivian. And I think we are the very first people to ever put an electric snowmobile in the back of a cyber truck. Let's take it out. So, Cambry, now that you've been in the cyber truck for a minute, what are your thoughts? First time driving in it? - I'm still assessing every day. I think I like the angles from inside. It's more spacious in here than I thought it would be from, like, looking at the outside. It just looks like it's kind of cramped. And then as I, like, look around, it almost feels like we're in a car, not a truck. But I'm high off the ground, so it's a little confusing for me to figure out. I think I like it. - Official verdict from Cambry. I think I like it. Would you drive one yourself, knowing how much of an eyeball magnet it is? - I don't know. I don't know. I think it'll just be like the Tesla Model X. Like, initially, driving it, any time I would open up the back doors and the wings would come up, people would stop and be like, what is that? I like it. But I think in, like, six months' time, there'll be enough of them on the road that people won't be too shocked. - Yeah, that's true. When was the last time you were on a snowmobile? - 16 years ago. - Wow. Alright, here we go. I'd love to give us your full review after the ride's over. Are you going to drive on the way back? - Yeah, I think. On the real roads. - Cambry hates being cold though, so that's a real thing. So these have...they're fully electric. They have a 60 mile range. We're going to test that out later, not today. The nice thing about it is that the Cybertruck can also charge these up with a 240 volt plug in the back, so we'll try that when we get back down the mountain. We've only used about 10% today, so it'll be interesting doing the real test when we're finally back. But 120 horsepower, 0-60 in I think 3 seconds, I'll have to double check that. These things are powerful. Extremely heavy at 750 pounds, but very powerful. I've wanted one of these machines ever since I first saw them 2 years ago, and now we have 2 of them, so expect a full review coming very soon. Tyga's offering a $500 discount to anyone purchasing a Tyga Nomad or Orca electric jet ski. Just put in the referral code JerryRig at checkout. And since these machines are mine, we'll be performing a full range and 1,000 pound towing test like I always do. - I think the only thing that could make this better is if there was a drive-through hot chocolate shop. - At the top of the mountain? - Like a shack that has hot chocolate and you can just drive through. - Back to the Cybertruck. So how was your first drive? - It was way easier than I thought. How was controlling it on the snow? I was a little nervous at first because like my hands helped balance myself and then I had to like balance the snowmobile. But it only took like 2 minutes and I got through that. - 30 amps. And there you have it, the Cybertruck can indeed carry a snowmobile probably better than any other electric truck out there because of the weirdly shaped bed, which is kind of cool. Thanks a ton for watching and I'll see you around.",

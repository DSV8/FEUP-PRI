    "transcript": "- I am so excited. I'm having a Mario Kart birthday party but it was, like, supposed to be a birthday party but now it has turned into something a little bit more serious. It has turned into a full-blown tournament. This is the first ever IJ Invitational Mario Kart Tournament. Now I don't really know how this is all gonna play out. I invited some friends. Everyone's getting very competitive now that they know that there's a trophy involved, so first things first, we need to do a little decorating. My sister's gonna come over and help, but I feel like I don't actually have that much decorating to do. I don't even know what is (plastic crinkles) ..in here but this is something I'm excited about is these chocolate coins. I looked for mushrooms, but the only type of mushrooms that I found online were psychedelics and actual real mushrooms. I'm not interested in that, but these chocolate coins are definitely something I'm interested in, so I guess those will do as some party favors. We also have a cake. You can kind of see it. We've got a little Mario and a little Luigi. (laughs) It looks so good. But first, we have some controllers charging, and I also need to update my Switch. I haven't played Mario Kart in a while so I gotta make sure I have all of the updated DLC. It's updating, it's happening, big news. (children yelling) Okay, so I came in first, but that doesn't mean anything because that's against the computers but against my friends who I know are really good at this game, it's not gonna stand up. (digital music) - Wow. We have a lot to do. - [Justine] I know. - Oh my God. I thought it was just like, hang up a banner. - [Justine] No. (digital music) This is so ugly. Like it's all wrinkled, but it's what we're doing. (plastic crinkling) It's what we're doing. Where will the trophy go though? (dog bark echoes) Oh Jesus, sh- (Jenna laughs) - [Jenna] The trophy, probably next to the TV. Oh, no, no, no. That'll get knocked over. and then you can have the light like a spotlight on it. - Great idea, Jenna. - [Jenna] Yeah. - Great idea. How did you do this? (cardboard snaps) That's great. (digital music) It's party day, Jen. - Party day. (digital music) - [Justine] Oh my God, someone's here, Someone's here. I feel like I'm like you know in the retirement home here. (imitates old woman) Oh. Do you remember the party in 2014? - [Guy] Oh yeah. - [Justine] Yes. - [Guy] Iconic. - [Justine] Legendary, so I was like, rewatching the vlog. I'm like, oh my God. Like we need to do like a recreating.. - [Guy] Yes. - ..of that. - But better. - [Justine] Yes, but better. - Our trophies involved. - Oh, get this, we go to Party City, buy this big freaking balloon and then we're like, can you fill this up? They're like, oh, sorry. We are out of helium today. - He's as tall as me. - [Justine] Whoa. - [Jenna] House is beautiful. - [Justina] The party's officially started. - I don't know where his, (women talking) Where's his hole? - Are there multiple holes? - [Jenna] Is it, is it down here? (party music) - Hello. - [Justina] Shut.. - Happy birthday. - [Justina] ..Up, shut up. This is unlike anything I've ever seen in my entire life. - Aren't they beautiful? - Wow. (dog barks) - [Justina] Oh my God. - [Guy] It's okay. (Justina laughs) - [Jenny] Oh my God. - [Justina] Oh my God. It's the best thing I've ever seen. - It doesn't even say happy birthday but we can imagine that it says happy birthday. Your first cake. (party music) (Jenna laughs) - Oh man, we're having some cookie, okay. - What flavor do you want? Wow, I love when It's not cooked on the inside. - Oh my God. (party music) Strawberry shortcake. - Yeah, it was good. - Strawberry cheesecake, oh my God it's so good. I gotta put this down so I'm can enjoy it. (party music) [Crowd] Happy birthday to you. ..to you. (crowd cheers) Okay. (crowd laughing) It's only procedures. (crowd and Justine laughing) Oh my gosh, thank you guys so much for coming. I'm so freaking excited to finally get this tournament started. So if you haven't seen yet, we do have a trophy. Now I don't know how the tournament is actually gonna happen so I guess we eat some cake and cookies and then we game. - [Crowd] Woo! - Yay! (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) I'm No, I'm like coming in last. - [Jenna] Okay, it's okay, No. - I'm having the best time of anyone right now. (upbeat music) (music slows) - I feel sickening and I feel like I'm gonna win. - As long as I beat Joey, it's fine. - I am, I feel like I'm doomed. - I feel great. - [Jenna] Okay, good. - Yeah. (laughs) (upbeat music) - Woo. (crowd cheers) - Head of the loser bracket. (upbeat music) - So final four, we have Cara, Lena, Lauren. Joey, like this is gonna be, I don't, it's gonna be intense. (party chatter) All right, I'm gonna put her back over here. (slow music plays) Yo. Yeah yeah. (crowd cheers) - It's a tie. Do we have to do one more with just you two? - [Multiple In Crowd] One more, one more. I'm so stressed out. Self respect When you outta line, you put yourself in check. Oh they don't hear me They don't, they don't, they don't hear me, yo (crowd cheers) (crowd laughs) - Alright, so the winner of the IJ Invitational. Mario Kart champ for March. 'Cause maybe we'll have another one - For March, does it say that? - So this is gonna be like the Stanley Cup. So you need to defend your championship for the next time. - Okay. - If we have one. - Okay, sounds good. There you go, Lena. - Congratulations! (crowd cheers) - Now we can all go to bed. - [Man] Speech! (Lena laughs) - Speech, yeah speech. - [Man] Who do you wanna thank? - I would like to thank Justine for having a birthday. - [Man] Anybody else? - Everyone else in this room. And Rosalina for just always coming through for me as my character. - [Man] Aww. Any words from The biggest loser? - [Lena] Oh. - [Justine] Oh. - I beat Dry Bussy over here. (crowd oohs) - She did. (crowd laughs) - I was terrible. - I lost so long ago like I don't even remember. (scattered laughing) Jordan's the house lead. (crowd laughs) - I, I.. (crowd continues laughing) - [Man] Do we have to thank any sponsors for this video? - We don't. - [Man] No sponsors? - No sponsors. - [Man] Okay, got it. - Thanks, iJustine's bank account. - Yep, okay bye, thanks. (Lena laughs) All right, thanks for watching. Hope you guys enjoyed the video. It's been while since I've vlogged, but we had to vlog the Mario Kart party because it was only appropriate. And now I have two Mario and Princess piatas in my home. As, As a new, as a new staple. As as two guests, two new guests here. (laughs) All right, I'll see you in the next video, bye. (calm music)",

    "transcript": "In this very quick video, I am going to show you how to convert these Sony MPS-70 speakers, which are for a mobile phone, into USB speakers that can work with any PC or laptop. The things you will need are... The speakers themselves, wire strippers, a soldering iron and solder, some heat-shrink, a 3.5mm jack from an old pair of headphones, and a USB cable. The first thing we need to do is prepare our wires. As the speakers work via a proprietary connector, we need to cut it off and strip off the sheathing to expose the wires inside. Each of these wires must be stripped as well. I will refer to this particular wire as the input cable for clarity. Cut the USB cable to the length you want, and strip it. The white and green wires are not needed for this project, nor is the shielding, so they can be cut off at different lengths to avoid short circuits. Using some electrical tape would be ideal. Next up is the headphone cable. Turn on your soldering iron, as it's time to do some soldering. We need to prepare each of our wires by adding a little blob of solder to them. Here I'm adding it to the Input Cable, now the USB cable, and lastly the headphone cable. Cut a length of heat-shrink and thread the Input Cable through it. Don't forget this step as you can't add it later. Do the same for the USB cable. After threading a little bit of heat-shrink to the Input Cable's red wire, solder it to the USB cable's red wire. Use your soldering iron to shrink the heat-shrink. Solder the USB cable's black wire to the Input Cable's black wire, and bring back the heat-shrink we added earlier and shrink it. Next get your headphone cable and find out which wires go to each of the notches on the jack using a multimeter. 1 represents ground, 2 represents the right channel, and 3 represents the left channel. Solder the jack's ground wire to the Input Cable's golden wire. The green wire is for the left speaker, and the blue wire is for the right speaker. So solder your headphone jack's cable wires accordingly. Lastly, check that everything works and then shrink that large bit of heat-shrink to cover our handiwork. Now let's give it a quick test...",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we have all of the brand new iPads and accessories right here at the studio. I might cry when I open up this box and I saw this beautiful pink iPad. You better believe that's the first one we're gonna open. So we have all four colors of the brand new iPad and the new iPad Pro. We've also got both gens of the iPad Pencil and the new USB-C to Apple Pencil adapter. We'll talk about it later. We've also got the iPad Magic keyboard the new Magic keyboard folio, and all four colors to match the new iPad colors. So let's start the unboxing and get hyped. So this is the pink iPad. When I saw this during the announcement, I was like (gasps) \"I'm shook. Is this going to be the color that I have been waiting for? We will see.\" Oh my gosh. It's...it's freaking perfect. Oh my gosh. (paper rustles) I am beyond excited. Like this is the pink that I have been waiting for, in an iPhone. Look at this color. Freaking fantastic. Beautiful. It is shining. It is shimmering, and it is so splendid. Can you just take a look at that? Like, look, it matches me. It's beautiful. Mm. We'll see what else we have in the box. Oh, it's a new braided cable. I love these cables. I still wish that they would've color matched them but it's okay. It's fine. I have something for you. Coming soon. Link in the description if you wanna be notified when they actually go live. My precious. Um the pinks actually, (gasps) - they actually are almost, it's almost a perfect pink match. It's pretty close. Like it's actually really close. I just want you to know that I had no knowledge of this pink prior to this. I just want you to know. And we've been working on these for a very long time. All right, this one's for Austin. Oh, okay. Oh man. All right. So in the images it looks like, oh, like a super yellow, yellow. But this, this feels like, kind of like a neon sort of yellow. The yellow and pink combo actually looks pretty good. Time for the blue. This one's for my sister. What great colors. These are so vibrant. I absolutely love them. They look so great. (dog barks) - I'm gonna start barking back 'cause you know I can. I can. (Justine barks) - That's your mom. (laughs) I have a secret talent. And the silver. (gasps) - Oh yeah. This is nice, because it matches my phone. I got the silver phone this year. I know, I know I should have got the purple. But there's just something about the silver that just looks so sleek that I love it. Like this is such a nice, simple color. You know, if you're not wanting to go be all bold and vibrant, you've got the silver. The iPad has these four new colors, silver, yellow, pink and blue. They now have touch ID with a new USB-C port an A14 Bionic chip, a 12 Megapixel ultra wide camera on the front and the back. Both of them will shoot 4K video. You'll also notice the new placement of the front facing camera is positioned landscape. So this makes so much more sense when doing video calls. There's also landscape stereo speakers with fast wireless Wi-fi 6 and 5G cellular options. It does ship with iPad OS, and it's compatible only with the Apple Pencil 1. You will need this USB-C attachment with the Apple Pencil 1 to connect and charge it. The display is a 10.9 inch Liquid Retina with 500 nits of brightness. It's seven millimeters thin and it weighs about a pound. It's thinner and lighter than the previous version. And pricing starts at $449. And now here's the 12.9 inch iPad Pro. This has the new M2 chips. Super hyped to check this out. Let's go fam. Woo wee! This is the silver. Aw. I'm so excited it's gonna match my iPhone. Beauty, a thing of beauty. Ooh, they also have the braided cables now, I'm so glad that they started shipping with these, because they just feel so much better and you know who also now has braided cables? Now here is the beautiful new M2 iPad Pro. It's probably way more powerful than most people will ever need but knowing that, you'll be set for quite a while, even when choosing one of the Pro models of the iPad. This features the new M2 chip with a Liquid Retina XDR display with ProMotion, True Tone, and P3 wide color. These come in two sizes, the 11 inch and the 12.9 inch as well as a Wi-fi and 5G cellular version. The 12.9 inch iPad has an immersive Liquid Retina XDR display with extreme dynamic range, with up to 1600 nits of peak brightness and it could also be used as a display for reference color. Now on the back, there's a 12 Megapixel wide, 10 Megapixel ultra wide, a True Tone flash and LiDAR. The LiDAR scanner is something that will give you a more advanced AR experience like being able to generate 3D depth maps and so much more. With the new M2 chip, this will be giving the iPad increased performance. You'll have 15% faster CPU, 35% faster graphics, and 50% more memory bandwidth all while maintaining a 10 hour battery life. There is support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB 4 which will give you access to high performance external storage docs, 10 Gigabit ethernet connections, and it can connect to an external display upto 6K resolution. As for storage, you can configure this up to 2 Terabytes. Using the Apple Pencil 2, you'll be able to magnetically charge and connect like you could in the past. But now they have an added Apple Pencil feature. It's called Apple Pencil Hover. You'll be able to just hover your Pencil over the display to see where you'd like to make a mark before actually placing it. Now of course you also have the Magic keyboard which is one of my favorite iPad accessories. It has the floating design, angle adjustment, a really nice typing experience, and a track pad. Now let's get all of the iPads out, and just like see them together like one happy family. Now this means we need to unbox all of the iPad accessories. Smart folios for each color way. Oh yeah, you guys look great. Since this is new, I'm gonna unbox this one first. This is the new Magic Keyboard Folio. So you basically have a keyboard and the folio stand all in one. This is great. This Magic Keyboard really does change the game because you can sort of use your iPad, a little bit more like a computer, which then kind of defeats the purpose of having an iPad 'cause then you're using your iPad as more of a computer. But it's just such a great form factor. (paper rustles) - There we go. Here's our new smart connector there on the bottom. Nice connection. And we've got the little fold out stand just like that. I really like this because this allows you to basically like turn this into not only having like a lightweight keyboard but it's also protective and it looks cool too. Let's compare that to the regular folio. So the regular Smart Folio has a bottom, but it does not have a keyboard. So this basically will just wrap around your iPad and it'll protect it. And then this little flap allows you to turn it into a stand. So this lets you have kind of that same sort of stand situation but without the keyboard. But I like that this now detaches. So even if you just want to use this as something without the keyboard, like a tablet, like you could do that but if you wanna snap it back in, there you go. The best of both worlds. Next up the yellow, look at this yellow. It's so bright. I absolutely love it. I can't wait to see it on the yellow iPad. If you're a fan of the color yellow, like your lucky day has just arrived. Also, if you're fan of pink, or blue, you're set. This is freaking awesome. Yellow was not even a color that I'm a huge fan of, but this is such a nice accent. Like look at this. A beautiful yellow. Now for the blue, look at this. This is like a light baby blue color kind of. I really like the color matching with these cases. Like I thought it was more of a baby blue, but really it's just the silicone color of the iPad. Like it's beautiful. They did such a great job. Check out that blue though. Mm hm. I'm gonna just go out and say it. This might be my favorite color lineup, of anything that they've ever done. And here it is, the Pink Smart Folio Naming this watermelon is actually perfect because this really is. It's incredible. Wow, wow, wow. Oh, Hello. Yes, hello. Hi, I'm here. I'm super excited to test out the new iPad OS because that was one video that I had planned on making and actually never got around to doing. So this is gonna be kind of like my first experience using iPad OS. So while that sets up, let's unbox the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro. I love the Magic Keyboard. Like it's honestly, it's awesome. Like when this first came out it really did change the game for I think all iPad users. All right, let's pop this new iPad Pro in. Look at you, look at your body. You're so nice and pretty. Let's put you by your friends. Oh yeah, you guys all just look great. The last thing that we have to unbox, is new but also not new. I know it's a little confusing. So the new iPads do not support the latest Apple Pencil 2. So they do only work with the Apple Pencil 1, but because these are now USB-C, you're not able to use the lightning connector in the Apple Pencil. So you need a dongle. If you have an old Apple Pencil Gen 1, you're gonna need this dongle right here. And this is $9.99. I feel like the reason that they did this which kind of makes sense because a lot of people upgrading to these iPads may already have an Apple Pencil 1, and not want to buy another $129 Apple Pencil 2, to use with their iPad. So now they are just going to have to buy, this little USB-C to Apple Pencil adapter. So with this you'll be able to plug it into the new iPad. Now I'm not a huge fan of this. I mean I definitely wish that they would've just went with the Apple Pencil 2, but I guess it sort of makes sense if all of these people already have the Apple Pencils. But from a usability and a consumer and a person who has been using the Apple Pencil 2, and I absolutely love it so much, I definitely wish that they would've added support for that. But that also makes sense because these don't have the magnetic charging. So to keep costs as low as possible, for these more entry level iPads, it kinda makes sense that they still are using these ones. (upbeat music) - There it is Apple Pencil 1. Either way, the iPad Pencil 1 still works the same as the Apple Pencil 2. The only thing that you're not gonna be getting, is the gesture control when you tap and double tap on the Apple Pencil 2. You are able to do various actions and of course this has the lightning built right into it which honestly like I feel like, it's like a good idea in theory until you actually have to use it or charge it because it just sticks straight out of your iPad. But the introduction of the Apple Pencil was pretty game changing for a lot of creative people. So props to this little guy. I think they come with some extra little...they do, yes. So the Apple Pencil 1 does come with this lightning connector and it also comes with an extra Pencil tip. But of course if you do want to use the USB-C, this has the lightning to USB-C. So you'll be able to use both of those. Look at this packaging though, that's nice. They just have a little peel, check it, dongle. So if you need to charge your Apple Pencil with a lightning to USB-C, you'll be able to do that with this adapter. Now if you already do have one of the Apple Pencils, you can get this. This is the USB-C to lightning adapter. So let's take a look at that. There it is. Yeah, that is definitely a very significant size difference. I guess at least you won't get them confused. So here's the two Apple Pencils. Now obviously you can see the Apple Pencil 1 is glossy. The 2 is a much more matte finish, and it also has this. That's where it'll magnetically connect to the iPad. And of course this has the cap like you've already seen. Right. First connect of the Apple Pencil. Let's see how this works. So you plug it into the lightning end then you plug the USB-C into the Apple Pencil. Apple Pencil would like to pair. Yes, please. Did you do it? (tapping on iPad) Yes. Here we go. Here we go. (tapping on iPad) All right, so that looks like the Apple Pencil worked. That was actually pretty easy. I mean, this obviously is just an added step, but if you do wanna still be using that old Apple Pencil that you have, you just gotta get the adapter. Well, thank you guys so much for watching.

    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is, Austin have you heard about a little website called wish.com? - I wish I hadn't. - And why is that? - Because I've gotten scammed many times, but today we're going to be trying some of the finest Wish accessories and Apple products that we can possibly get our hands on. - All right, first thing. - Oh, look, the new 2020 watch, my favorites, Apple accessories. Well, first of all, this is an Apple watch band. Like I bet if I take my real Apple watch off right now, this is just gonna work. Is this is the real one? It doesn't have a little magnets on it, but I wonder if this will slide on. So this is my real Apple watch. Oh, look at that. It actually, it does, it fits. It doesn't clip in. So if I push the band to the left of the right slides, whereas the real one sticks in, but I mean, that's, that's legit feel the, feel the difference. Obviously it's a different colors slightly, but I mean, that's pretty close. - I actually kind of like the feel of the fake one better. - This is essentially a real Apple watch band just without the magnets to hold it in place while you're there. But like, I don't think it's going to fall off necessarily. It's definitely fits fairly snugly. - First of all, the Apple watch does not use a micro USB. - Wait, but that looks good. Wait, wait. - This I'll just say, the sticker is falling off. - The sticker is completely falling off here. - But hold on a minute. That actually looks pretty good. - So one thing I'll say, if you look at the light before we even turn this on, you can see that the actual screen is significantly smaller. You see right here, there's like a big chin on it. - This feels pretty good. - If you told me this was a series one. - Yeah. - I wouldn't question it. - So the only thing that really gives this away for me is the micro USB charging port, which I mean, look, it actually is well-built like, I'm not offended by this watch right now. - No, - I think I am going to be offended when we fire it up. - We are too lazy to run a cable to charge this. So we're just going to use our camera battery. That is clearly the same animation that Apple has. - Yes. that looks the same exact one. - Harbor wise this thing's impressive. What do we have next? - Next up, we have Airpods pro. - So this box looks authentic from the front, right? - Except that font is not. - Well I mean the Apple logo looks pretty legit Airpods pro. I mean, that's not like crazy far off. - That looks aerial. - Look Apple one Apple Parkway. I mean, look, these are high quality counterfeit goods. Did you open this? - I had not opened it. - This is the way it came? - I have not opened this. - This is the way it comes. I mean, these look like real Airpods pro, like so far except, the cable being all weird and no Apple stickers in the box. I don't think anyone would really be clued off as to whether or not this is a genuine product. - So here's the real ones. Here's the fake ones. - So we don't have the button on the back and no metal head. But besides that, dude, that's pretty close. Very small changes. So you can see there's a little dot there versus it's sort of solid on this side. You've got the, I guess the ear tip looks a little different. But you've got that same kind of a little black grill. Although I'll say that this is a real grill on the Airpods pro, this is just a plastic like it's painted. I don't even think that's a real piece. But you do have a little microphone below it. So you can see that this is clearly higher quality. I mean, look. At this point, there is no reason to suspect that these are not completely genuine, real AirPods. Besides the fact that you paid less than a quarter of the real price. I will say so far, if you would purchase these, unless you were clued in and you have experience with standard Airpods pro you wouldn't necessarily know the difference. - Oh, I don't know. - Wow. - That is bright. - I thought that was a mic. That is horrible. - Yeah. - Okay nevermind. I take everything I said back. These are terrible. - I'm guessing these are just called headphones. (indistinct) With real ones. Open it up works great. - Okay. - This guy, I'm going to be really disappointed if these don't work. Oh, wait (indistinct) Do it. Oh, it broke your phone actually. - So these headphones successfully killed the apps on your phone. Did it disconnect? - Yup. Yup. - Wow, what high quality goods. - They just powered off. - Like I'm not gonna lie. These look convincing, but I'm pretty sure they're hot garbage. - Passive noise cancellation on these is actually pretty decent. I'm not, expecting these to have any type of real noise cancellation. - Of course. - But the fact that I could barely hear you when they were plugged in, that's great. - Airpods pro authentic at first glance, but ultimately a no go or did their Apple watch actual charged. - It looks like it does. - Look at how aggressive that's charging. Oh, that's fast. - Ooh not a good click. - Wow. - Not a good click. Okay so the crown does nothing. - Okay. - I got a little, I've done zero steps. - Okay fair. We'll hold on. Ready? - That's how I trick my regular watch into thinking I've done stuff. Nope. Zero steps. I mean, - What can you do. Whoa, you just switched over to the normal Apple watch face. - There's but does that do anything? - No. - No Okay just pressing the face. Just changes the face. - What does the Facebook, hit Facebook, you guys try Facebook. - Flight mode. - This is terrible. - I hate everything about this. - Cause it's like it's 80% of what an Apple watch should be. But the 20% percent is missing is like literally the most important part that actually functions. I am so offended by everything we've gotten from Wish. All of this is terrible. Like sometimes we get good fakes. Sometimes we get things like all of these things looked relatively reasonable. When you look at the hardware, as soon as you start using them, I mean, these are not usable. These are straight scams. Wow, God. How many more things do you have in there? - Oh my gosh. A super fine Nib. Wow. - Just like the dog. He's just super fine Nib. - You know what? Super fine Nib has me intrigued. - So this is for iPod touch, iPhone, iPad mini, iPhone, Android, and windows. It looks like an Apple watch. I say it's an Apple pencil. I bet it's just a capacitive stylus. - Correct, I guarantee that. - Okay, well. It clearly is not a completely dumped stylist if it comes with a micro USB cable. All right. So the super fine nib is literally just a little capacitive touch layer. It says that it should work on iPhone, iPad, Android windows. But I don't actually think that that's necessarily true. Press the button of the pen tube for on and off, the light is on or off when charging. Yep, it's on. Apparently it is easy to use with active sensing technology without an additional receiver. Oh, wait a minute. Oh really? Is this an actual legit pencil for your phone? - Well, no, I don't have the smoothest of hands. Okay, I can draw a circle. All right. I have, like I did pass the third grade art tests, look at.. - That's a straight line. - A straight line is super swiveled. So like. - But how much of that is down to the app thinking it's your finger maybe doing like some interpolation? - Like try to use it as an actual... - There's my finger. - Oh, that sucks. I mean, at least it works, which is more than I can say for any of the other Wish sort of Apple accessories we've done so far. - We are 0 for three. And that's where I hope that this one comes in. - Okay, iPhone. A real iPhone 12 pro. Okay, why do I have a real iPhone 12 pro here? Cases? Okay. Wait, what's that one? - This one, they just sent us. - This is free. This was just included with this order. I didn't order this. So not only are they just sending us products that don't work, they're sending us additional products that don't work. But what was interesting about this one? Is it supposedly it has a light on it. - Where, there's definitely what? - All it does is this right here. Just covers up the flashlight. You turn your flashlight on and it reflects in the case, this is. - It was free Matt, you can't complain about free 99. - Next Up from wish.com is the wallet. - Accidentally I'm (indistinct) thinking it was Pokemon cards of the day. - Yes I noticed that it was open, okay. - Immediately I will say it is, is nowhere near as high quality as the real thing. Look at the difference in the stitching. Like they clearly had one of these on hand, but like the leather stitching on their Beale, like Apple wallet, case is far, far better. - This claim to, is magsafe, compatible it clearly isn't. So it's magnetic, which is first of all, it's the whole point of the mag safe is that it has the alignment, a magnet in there to keep it from moving around. But here's, here's something it's like slightly too big. Barely overlay is bigger than the actual mini. - And that's all it takes as you're taking that in and out of your pocket for it to snag and fall off. Whereas if we have the real thing, we drop it on. I mean, it's still not the most secure, but I mean, that's not. - We did notice that the, the wallet seems to be much more secure on the mini than it is on any of the other phones. - Yeah, no, this is bad. I would not trust anything in here. - How much was this? - That was like 10 bucks or something like that. - To be fair, the Apple wallet is very expensive, but the Apple wallet is made of nicer leather, far better stitching, and most importantly, it's not going to fall off anywhere near as easy. You have extra magnets inside to help it hold on. That's exactly what it is. - You have extra magnets to destroy your cards. - Okay magsafe leave it to the pros, the Apple pros, the everything Apple pros. What do we have next? - All right. So here's where I was a little disappointed with Wish, because when I saw (indistinct) When I saw mag safe, I got so excited for how many cheap knockoff things there's going to be for Magsafe yeah. That's the only one. But instead I went to Amazon and got cheap knockoff Magsafe stuff for them. As far as I can tell the first third party, actual magsafe case, at least what they claim. - Okay, I mean, that looks very mag safey to me. - I don't think this is real. - Let's see if it actually triggers it. I mean, it's a, it's an okay case. I don't really, it doesn't feel particularly protective. - And so again, what, makes it truly Magsafe compatible is. - I am going to take that off for a sec. - Is this part right here is the, notch. So any like any key charger, probably gonna be magnetic with these, the mag safe ring, but the, the little extra bit there is what keeps things aligned. That definitely works. There you go. This is not terrible. I mean, look for relatively cheap. This is a real Magsafe case. I mean, I guess we could try charging it. - But we can test it. - Oh, what are you talking about? - What I think is the first magsafe third party wireless charger. - Is it magsafe or is it just magnetic. - Its charging. And that's a good connection. - So that's real third-party Magsafe probably not going to charge as fast would be my assumption. - Well, it's hard to tell too out the, a with mini, because this actually charges slower than all the other ones as well. - True, but my guess would be, that's not real Magsafe, that's just a magnetic, key charger that is using the Magsafe magnet. - Again, the thing that I'm impressed by is this actually feels, this is listen to this. Yeah, that's a really good connection. Yeah, it is. You know, it doesn't sound like it'd be a lot, but it is like almost like twice the thickness of a regular Magsafe. So I like to be playing my raid, shadow legends and them. And so like, I like to hold the phone like this. Where the cables coming down, this feels way better than this does. Like, this is noticeably in the way of my, of my hands. - Yeah. - But I mean, again, this was significantly less than the whatever, 50, 60 bucks at the.. - That's 30, I believe. There, you still need a compatible charger. For it. - Yes well, you need a charger for this one as well, but the difference is, this one comes with USB-C adapter, which is nice. - Yeah. - And it's longer. - That's one of the problems with the magsafe charger. It's only, I believe a three-foot cable. That is a... - It's not much longer, but it is longer. - That's a four foot cable foot. - Yeah, I mean, when the cable is , - Sorry, go ahead and tell him to move. I use on every one of my girlfriends in high school, it worked every time. You're married. I'm not that kind of girl. - Thank you very much for watching this episode of This Is. Make sure to ring that ding-a-ling button to make sure that you're always notified of our latest shenanigans. And until the next time a Wish package is dropped off on our door and we sadly opened it for another click bait video. Thank you very much for watching.",

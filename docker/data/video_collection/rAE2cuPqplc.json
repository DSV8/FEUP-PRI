    "transcript": "(ethereal music) - Let's see what we have in the X-Box Series X Fridge today. Could it be, (ethereal music) some next gen consoles to unbox? We've got the Series S, as our appetizer, Series X, as main course. (fridge door closes) So, I guess we'll start with our appetizer, Series S! I think I should probably use, the same knife, (knife withdraws) that I used to unbox the refrigerator, totally fair. (knife cuts) Wow, I forgot how small, the Series S is. Oh my goodness! Previously, I'd had the prototype version, and then after unboxing the \"PlayStation 5,\" this really does look like an appetizer. So, we have the console, this box is very nicely designed, and what's this? This looks like a \"Do Not Disturb\" door hanger that you would find on your hotel room. (box opens) Some instructions, power cable, HDMI cable, and the controller. (paper crunkles) So fresh, so clean. Oh, yeah, that feels nice. And some batteries! I'm living my dream right now. Not even joking. (paper crunkles) Wow. Look at this, it's so small. It's great because if you do want a digital only version of the new next gen console, this is the one for you, it's small, it's extremely portable, I think this is gonna be my travel X-Box now. You can also have your storage expansion, has HDMI, two USB ports, Ethernet, power, you also have a USB A on the front as well, this looks clean, like super clean. Look how good they look together. (upbeat music) So, the Series S is unboxed, this is purely just an unboxing, I will be doing follow-up videos on both of these consoles, so, stay tuned for that. Be sure to subscribe and hit the bell, so, you'll be notified when I post a new video, but now, time for our main course. So, the first thing, that you might notice, if you saw my fridge unboxing video, this box is identical to the box that this refrigerator came in. (ethereal music) This opened up, the refrigerator came out of it, same everything, they made a complete 100% replica of this box, to put that refrigerator in. I guess this is gonna be my second unboxing of the Series X. (knife falls) Oh my God, I could've cut my leg off! - [Man] Is it really sharp? Is it actually sharp? - Yeah! Do you know how quickly you can bleed out? Very quickly. I've done research. (knife cuts) Look at this packaging, this is a very nice presentation, It's just like, \"Hello, I'm here, power your dreams, my dreams are powered!\" Look at this. That is heavy. Alright, I bet we have pretty much the same stuff in here, instructions, power cable, HDMI, and, the controller. (upbeat music) Something else in here? (box shakes) Nope, here it goes. (box unwraps) Can you believe how much this looks like the refrigerator? This looks exactly like it, I'm sure. (paper crinkles) The best part is even these top vents, that's also on the refrigerator. They really did go all out. They made this thing look exact. We've got our USB expansion, Ethernet, HDMI and power. (ethereal music) (screams) So, here's the Series X, this does have a one terabyte drive already installed in it, but it also does have an expansion card slot, so, you are able to expand that, some of these games are so massive, even just \"Call of Duty,\" waiting for those things to download, I gotta prep, a day in advance, because my internet is so terrible! So, here's the Series X, here's the Series S, if you are looking for just a digital version, obviously, this is gonna be the way to go, this is so small and so compact, you're still gonna get your 120 Hertz, refresh rate gaming, which is incredible, but the size, it's like about half there, then it's actually less than half, so small. Here's what they look like laying down, the one thing with the PlayStation, is it does have a little stand, that you have to put it on, so that you can lay it down, whereas these do have little feet already on the side, so, you can just plop it right over. The one thing, that I will not get into, is a console PC war. I love everything, I love Nintendo, I love PlayStation, I love X-Box, I also love PC gaming, so, if you're here, to just kind of fight about that, just let people like what they like, you can like what you like, I don't care. Gaming is supposed to be fun, so just enjoy it, stop fighting, even though I know you guys, aren't gonna stop fighting, so (beeps) So, here's the controllers, I have always been a fan of white consoles, 'cause most of the time, a lot of my entertainment centers, are either really dark, so, I like being able to actually see the console inside of it, right now, the console that I have my main TV on, is like a really dark wood, so, it's basically like my Xbox, is completely lost inside of it. You can't even see it in there. It's like active camouflage. So, that's just a quick unboxing I look forward to covering these further, so, until then, I will see you guys on the internet, make sure you guys follow me on \"Twitch\" for any gameplay streaming that I'll be doing on next gen consoles, Twitter, Instagram, and subscribe, and hit the bell here on YouTube. Let's see what you look like inside the fridge. I will say though, (ethereal music) the cooling on this thing, the fridge and that Series X, pretty impressive. (fridge door opens) My Gosh, did you think that this is what, is gonna happen today? Look at this. I'm gonna put my controller in there, it's something we did. (ethereal music)",

    "transcript": "presented by squarespace Whats up guys? lou here back with another video and as you probably know This bend gate fiasco is spreading like wild fire all over the internet and regular traditional media as well i've been doing interviews for various news organisations and the same questions keep coming up so I am here with the final instalment to put all those questions to rest the first and probably most obvious one what about the iphone 6 So, I have the standard iphone 6 because the original bend test tackled the 6 plus and apparently some users are having bending issues with the 6 aswell that is something i heard today and then the next most requested device this one right here the htc one m8 which also has an aluminum construction like the iphone and a lot of people think it will have a similar result in the bend test i don't know feels pretty sturdy to me so the htc one m8 similar construction i've also got the new moto x right here this just came out on the market relatively new lastly we have a nokia lumia device for a long time nokia has been known as a very durable brand of phone it's like an ongoing joke on the internet especially their old candy bar style phones but anyway this one feels relatively durable so lets bend it aswell lets get started with the iphone 6 cause that's probably the one thats been requested the most so im movin these phones out of the way so here we have the standard iphone 6 and i am going to... gonna bend it in the exact same fashion as i did with the 6 plus so hold it in this location here and i'm gonna push on the center and pull back as hard as i can and we shall see what the results are here we go (exhalse) okay so i can.. i've put a small dent in there no so this one is far more durable i can put a small dent in I heard a little bit of sort of the glue from the screen peeling away i can easily push that back in and the device is fine nothing wrong with the screen that's completely usable right there yeah this is a brand new phone there's not even a sim card in here but you just have a smaller form factor here so the material isn't spanning such a large foot print i think the result of that is its' integrity is significantly more... can you still bend this? probably but under... it does have a small bend in it from where i pushed but under normal usage and i can probably bend it back yeah there we go oh you can hear it click a little bit there where i bent it you hear that? anyway regardless i don't see this bendgate issue affecting six regular iphone six users in the same way that it has affected 6 plus users just based on that preliminary same amount of force next up the second most requested phone after the initial test went live people said what about the htc one m8 and i was curious too but i didn't have one so i actually had to go out and get one and big fan of this phone big fan of the design very similar in fact in design to the iphone 6 as you can see there aluminum finish on the back you've got the antenna bands so lets go ahead and attempt to bend the htc one m8 same fashion i have the screen facing out and i'll push from the back of the device here we go 3..2..1 ohh i heard some glue come lose so the screen popped out a little bit but no it did the screen popped out a little bit and i heard a nasty noise dose this phone have battery? lets try and boot it up no it's fine it's completely fine the screen is fine the phone is fine so you will hear like a little bit of glue there (phone powers up) comes lose near the screen you can hear that but its nothing its just the glass lifting a little bit and then it goes right back into place okay same amount of force not an issue on the htc one m8 next up we have the new moto x the materials here feel very robust but of course the ultimate test the bend test lets go 3..2.. 1 ohh hoo hoo that baby is solid i cant get anything out of that wow no nosies no movment that is a robust device right there whatever they have done with this metallic frame here okay moto x the new moto x is legit as of right now that's the device to beat for current devices in the bend test lastly of course we had to throw something from nokia in there just because of the legendary feed back on nokia durability this one's interesting because i got a big camera there i guess ill push towards the center that's probably better okay here we go 3..2..1 (snapping sound) ohh heard a crack right away ahhhhh no nothing so the top of the screen moves off the base a little bit and then it clicks back in nothing that's robust too biggest surprise for me the moto x the new moto x that baby is solid and listen iphone 6 users regular iphone 6 users don't panic this thing is not gonna bend easily not nearly as easy as the 6 plus so there you have it all the questions have now been answered and you can share this video if anybody is continue to ask questions a lot of people where saying if you if you bend it of course it bends you know there was a lot of that feedback coming in well theses devices here are proof that that is not necessarily the case i put the same amount of force and had very little result with any of them in fact even the regular iphone 6 compared to 6 plus so here you have it actually look at this i have a 5s here as well shall we? okay real quick no nothing you can tell right away if your getting movment if you're getting flex when you apply that force so regardless nothing nothing here has surprised me this is what i expected to happen maybe with the exception of the moto x making no creaking or flex at all uh but i expected the 6 to do much better than the 6 plus just because of the fact that your you've got much smaller panel of aluminum on the back with the chassis and so therefore it's going to be slightly more robust doesn't have to cover quite as big of a foot print there you have it iphone 6 less likely to bend when compared to the 6 plus and the other thing i'd like to mention htc one m8 made some creaky noises no lasting impact no significant bends and the moto x big surprise here one more time just for good messure ahhh oh that baby not gonna do it with human hands wow very surprising okay that wraps this up if you guys enjoyed this content if you appreciate these tests which are painful to do sometimes i'm gonna have to go ice my thumbs right now (laughs) i didn't mean physically painful but to see phones break it's not my intention honestly i saw the reports coming in that morning and i was like man i gotta see if this is even true i didn't even believe it at first so that's why i did the original 6 plus video so appreciate the thumbs up down below appreciate the shares and new subscribers etcetera as i said thanks as always for watching and i will catch you on the next episode later guys squarespace the all in one platform that makes it fast and easy to create your own professional website portfolio and online store for a free trial and %10 of visit squarespace.com/unbox and enter offer code unbox at checkout a better web starts with your website now get to it",

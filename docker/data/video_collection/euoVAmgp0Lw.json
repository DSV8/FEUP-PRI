    "transcript": "Wow guys I cannot believe that the V-moda BoomPro mic has gone under our radar for so long and then any gaming headset review any microphone test people are always commenting hey check out the v-moda BoomPro mic because it is actually a really good alternative to let's say a modmic 4 or modmic 5 and a really good substitute for you know built-in or included microphones on many gaming headsets this thing is only $30 which makes it a really good value to add a professional good sounding boom microphone to your gaming pair let's check it out right after this what would you like so I'm looking for a gaming headset with a bit of everything but not overkill something that folds on your neck sure how about the light frame without excessive clamping force yes yes you have to be air cushions with proper internal padding excellent I will take the cable and the microphone are removable fine fine this is the one multi-platform compatibility with a virtual surround sound dongle avail can I just take one and the sound quality you'll be satisfied with so the new Coolermaster MH 751 and 75 to are here to make your gaming experience so I think many people are wondering whether or not the cheaper boom pro solution is you know a better direction for quality microphone audio to your gaming headset versus something like the modmic series the modmic 4 or the modmic 5 those things are more expensive of course especially the modmic 5 that sounds fantastic but it's $70 and you know it's almost the price of like gaming headsets that you might be adding the boomPro to so from a pricing perspective the boomPro all the way but unlike the modmic series that you can attach to any gaming headset because of the magnetic clamp system the boomPro is a different solution it is not meant to clamp on the side of the headset like the modmic series instead it has its own 4-pole connection that you insert into compatible headsets therefore replacing the default cable and this brings us to our first limitation almost where this boompro mic is designed to work with v-moda headsets but many also gaming headsets you know removable cables that use a standard 4-pole connection and it's perfect for that but if your cable and a headset is non removable then you cannot really attach the boom mic to that headset now luckily for all the gaming pairs that I own that have a removable cable for the headset this thing fits because it's slightly longer it has a nice thin profile so if there's any housing limitations or like the Sonos like proprietary clip on clickin system for the headset the boompro should fit it fits on my cooler master MH752 and MH751 it fits perfectly fine with my G pro headset from Logitech because again the cable is removable and it's a standard 4-pole connection so it's not proprietary to anything but for my Sennheiser pairs that use a thinner input here you cannot install the BoomPro mic because it will not fit I really like the low profile nature of this microphone the boom arm is flexible it is quite thin but stays in position unless you move it the actual microphone capsule is quite thick you can kind of detect where it is around your mouth and adjust it accordingly it does not come with a boom filter or a pop filter but I think that's fine you can simply move it further away if you're breathing into it and definitely I would say like a more discrete solution versus something like the modmic series that has its own cabling and that is definitely one main main advantage unless you go with the wireless mod mic this is all in one cable since it replaces the default cable on the headset you don't have to worry about cable management we have nice little joystick control with a clip on we have mic mute and the volume dial and the cable itself splits into another 4-pole connection so you can insert that into your notebook for example or we have a splitter so you can split that into headphone and microphone for your motherboard or notebook one thing to mention is that it is meant to attach to the left side as with most v-moda headsets microphone is on the left but because the flexible nature of the boom mic if you know the removable cable on your headset might be potentially on the right side you could plug it in still there and rotate the microphone to face the proper side because the actual you know steel band here is flexible and that not an issue by rotating the capsule back but now it is time to here with the microphone sounds like let's read some home adios let me read you a little excerpt on the chapter called the right to happiness it appears that our happiness banks against a mysterious glass ceiling that does not allow it to grow despite all our and precedented accomplishments even if we provide free food for everybody cure all diseases and ensure world peace it won't necessarily shatter that glass ceiling achieving real happiness is not going to be much easier than overcoming all age and death the glass ceiling of happiness is held in place by two style pillars one psychological the other biological on a psychological level happiness depends on expectations rather than objective conditions we don't become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence rather we become satisfied when the reality matches our expectations the bad news is that as conditions improve expectations balloon dramatic improvements and conditions as humankind has experienced in recent decades translate into greater expectations rather than greater contentment if we don't do something about this our future achievements too might leave us as dissatisfied as ever on the biological level both our expectations and our happiness are determined by our biochemistry rather than by our economic social and political situation according to the life sciences happiness and suffering are nothing but different bounces of bodily sensations we never react to events in the outside world but only to the sensations in our own bodies conversely science says that nobody's ever made happy by getting a promotion winning in the lottery or even finding true love people are made happy by one thing and one thing only Pleasant sensations in their bodies if you get a promotion but for some reason don't feel any Pleasant sensations you will not feel satisfied the opposite is also true if you have just been fired but are experiencing very pleasant sensation because you popped some pills you might still feel on top of the world this is the fault of evolution for countless generations our biochemical system adapted to increasing our chances of survival and reproduction not our happiness thank you for sticking along during this inside reading about happiness I think the boomPro sounds excellent for $30 comparable to the modmic for very similar sounding but $20 cheaper I still feel like throughout this entire collection the modmic 5 sounded the best has the most body the most clear and warmth versus everything else you know has little compromises here and there in terms of the vocal characteristics but let me know which microphone sound the best to you in the comments improve your workflow it stream deck mini by Elgato giving you six fully customizable LCD keys for macro commands hotkeys app launches media control and the full array customization for OBS Twitch xsplit and more check out the stream deck mini down below and I would say the main downfall for the boom pro is actually it's also its strength simply because of the installation you need to have a headset that supports a 3.5 millimeter 4-pole connection otherwise you know it's going to be incompatible but also the fact that you are replacing the default cable means that you don't have to deal with additional cables like you would with the modmic series and while the price point is competitive the microphone quality improvement you get versus let's say the G pro from Logitech or the MH752 it's there it sounds better than the default microphones but you just ask yourself if that is worth to you the $30.00 and I'm guessing it's a really good addition for v-moda headphones because that 3.5 millimeter input on the side all right guys I'm Dimitri thanks much for watching and I'll talk to you in the next video you",

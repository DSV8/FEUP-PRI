    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to \"This Is.\" Before, we said there were too many handhelds, and we talked about how the ROG Ally was probably great, but we didn't have our hands on it. Mr. Roger Oliver (text punching) Gooth-ifander (image striking) himself - What? - Said, \"We need an ally.\" ROG stands for Roger Oliver Gooth-ithander. (text punching) Look it up. - That is not roggers. - Okay, I'll decide what's roggers or what's gooth-ivandering. Party roggers in the house tonight - The ROG ally is a portable gaming PC that is designed to give you a much, much higher level of performance than something like the Switch, and in the ROG's case, even more so than something like the Steam Deck. We've looked at a few of these over the years, mostly actually by Ayaneo, who I would say, have kind of been the pioneers outside of Steam Deck stuff. They've made so many Ayaneos, but the general gist of it's very straightforward. It is a almost like a little Windows gaming laptop in a lot of ways, so they're all pretty much powered by AMD processors. This is using that new Ryzen Z1 Extreme, which is a significant step up. It's a little Windows guy. - I wanna be clear, like no one, if you're in the market to get one, like a handheld from like, specifically the ROG, you should 1,000% spend the extra $100 and get the Z1 Extreme version of this. The performance increase to Z1 Extreme is night and day. - Yeah, so if you want to buy the ROG Ally, it's not on sale as I'm recording this video, but I believe it's available for pre-order. It's $700, it comes with the Ryzen Z1 Extreme 16 gigs of RAM and 512 gig SSD, very reasonable spec, but the one that Matt's talking about is the regular Z1, which is $600, $100 less. - All the specs are the same except for the processor. - [Austin] Which is significantly less powerful. - Yeah, yeah. - So I agree. Obviously, we haven't tried the other one, but it seems like a pretty much no-brainer, and if you compare this to something like the Steam Deck, this is pretty much equivalent to the $650 max spec of the Steam Deck, and for $50 more, you're giving yourself a more powerful power adapter, you giving yourself a little roggers stand, which is nice. - You can't really... This is not a selling point. - This is neat. - So this comes in the top of the case. - It's actually very nice. Well, especially because this has all the ports on the top, so you can actually easily set it up like this, and then you can like, dock it or whatever. - This is gonna last like, 10 minutes, all right? - Dude, it's not. Nah, nah, nah. - That's, nah. - So I've actually recorded a main channel video. You should subscribe to the Austin Evans channel for my exploits on how I turned this into a gaming PC, but you're the one who first set up in it, so what were your initial impressions of the Ally? - So I own a Steam Deck, I play it a lot. I, you know, I love it. There are a couple games that you just cannot run on a Steam Deck, like \"Cyberpunk.\" I used to play \"Destiny\" a lot. \"Destiny\" just straight up doesn't work because of anti-cheat. - Yeah. - But like, yeah, like anything that uses Epic Games Store doesn't really work. - It's on Steam Deck, but- - You can dual boot, - Don't do that. - It's just, it's a pain in the ass. With devices like these, I want the simplest experience that I can get, so like Steam Deck is offering me that, - Yeah. - But like, again, the Steam Deck, even games that should work, really don't, like \"Jedi Survivor\" does not work on the Steam Deck. - Yeah. - But I mean, to be fair, anything that really is a bad PC port isn't gonna work on any of these. You need the PC optimization. - Yes, exactly. - And then you still need PC optimization to work like- - For Linux, yeah. - Yeah. \"Cyberpunk\" is the one I tested out, because again, I know I cannot run that on a Steam Deck. - Yeah. - I did have \"Cyberpunk\" running on this, granted, it was 25 FPS on low settings. - Wait. - So it wasn't amazing. - So here's the thing, I was playing also in turbo mode, but I had mainly turned up the clock speeds. I was getting 50 to 60 FPS on low medium at 1080p. - On \"Cyberpunk?\" - On \"Cyberpunk,\" yeah. - All right, look- - Hold on, literally, wait. (Matt and Austin sputtering) (screen rumbling) Okay, go ahead. - That leads me back to my point of these. I don't wanna fiddle around with settings on these. - But you have to fiddle with settings on the Steam Deck, too, so with any of these devices- - But not nearly that much. - Well, okay, with any of these devices, (Matt groaning) the power modes were very important, so unless I'm looking at like the Switch, which it's all just running in the background, it's just gonna do its own thing, with both the Steam Deck- - Well, running is a generous term for the Switch (image striking) - With both the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally, you have a number of options for power modes. This guy will go all the way up to 30 and 35 watts if you've got it plugged in, which is a lot of TDP, but the thing is that makes a huge difference, like we're talking about, you know, you could double or triple your performance by turning that up. By that same token, when you're running it at those full max modes, you are going to severely impact the battery life. with the ROG Ally, I think you're gonna have to look at it from two perspectives. It's easy to do things like turn the resolution down. It does have a much better display than the Steam Deck, It's got a 1080p instead of an 800p, and it does round it up for 120 hertz with a variable refresh rate, but you need to, if you're really running on battery life, and you don't have like a battery bank or something handy, you've gotta turn it down. Turbo Mode is a much higher TDP. I think its performance mode is probably the middle ground? - Let me tell you what I don't like about this. - Okay, go ahead. - And everything I don't like, I don't think has anything to do with ROG. I think ROG made a damn fine machine here, and I think the big bottleneck for all of these devices, Ayoneo included, is Windows. Until there is some version of a dedicated, optimized, handheld version of Windows, which is supposedly in development... - I got it, Windows 8. They got it right first time around. Touch-first Windows? That's it, we just need to install Windows 8 on this, and it'll be great, I think that that's our solution. (window chiming) (screen beeping and crackling) - So you asked me about my initial impression on this, - Yeah. - And I got to do very little gaming on this thing. (Austin chuckling) - Yeah. - Because I was in charge of setting this up. It was a nightmare to set this up, and all of it was on kind of more the Windows side of things. - Yeah. - For starters, the on-screen keyboard just straight up didn't work, so it would show- - I saw you trying to type a password, - Yeah. - And then the keyboard would just not be there anymore. - I had to, I actually had to hook up a external - Yeah. - Keyboard to this. - I actually would say that even though Ayaneo are clearly a much smaller company, their sort of optimization of their handhelds is a little bit better I think than the ROG. Mind you, this is ROG's first time doing this. Keep in mind this is - No, the- - Not a final version of the software. - Yeah, there was already some updates when we got it, - Yeah, like this goes - And so like- - On sale in a month, this is probably gonna get some more updates. - Right. You know, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that this is not final software, but like, I've had similar issues with this. Even with the Steam Deck when you try and fiddle outside of things, - Yeah. - Like I do a lot of like, EmuDeck and stuff like that. If you wanna go outside the Big Picture Mode of Steam, like, of any of 'em, you kind of have to hook up a mouse and keyboard to these, - I agree, so- - Which is not an ideal situation. - So on top, you have a USB-C port, which is how you can charge it, but it also has the XG mobile port. If you want to use one of the proprietary ROG docks, you could load up this thing like a 4090. I actually think that you probably could get away with that, since it's a Windows system with a 8-core Ryzen processor, but realistically, what I use this for is just hooking up a hub so you can get a mouse, keyboard, monitor, all that kind of stuff, and I will say that this actually works surprisingly well as a gaming PC. You plug in a USB-C dock, you hook up a power adapter, so you don't have to worry about battery life, mouse, keyboard, maybe a monitor, maybe not, depending on what you want to do, and then you crank that turbo up. The cooling solution actually can keep up. I was running this in the full overclocked to 35 watt TDP, it's actually quiet. - But like, the- - It's really not loud. - What you're doing is defeating the entire purpose - No. - Of a handheld gaming device. - By that token, Matt, I would not plug anything in. I would just plug the power adaptor in, crank the settings up. It still is actually relatively nice to like, to touch and could feel, 'cause all the heat's being exhausted out the top, and there you go, get yourself 1080p, you can be pushing 60, 70, 80, 90 frames per second in a lot of games. Just plug it in, it literally solves all the problems. - So this is a lot more powerful than the Steam Deck, no doubt about that, and like yeah, if you're plugging it in, that's great, but like again, it's still a handheld device. - Yeah. - And I'm a proponent of mobile gaming. This is like my whole thing. - Wait, wait. (graphic sliding) You are a proponent of mobile gaming? - And cloud gaming, I like cloud gaming. I prefer handheld over, like, - Hmm. - I wanna just like sit on the couch with a handheld like that. I have a hard time recommending this as is. - Okay. - And that's the keyword, is as is. - Yup. - Over like a Steam Deck, because the price difference to convenience ratio, to me, like for 400 bucks, you don't need to buy the most expensive Steam Deck. - Yeah, just- - It's not giving you any more performance. It's giving you more storage, but not any more performance. - Wait, did you say it's easy? No, it's actually not easy to upgrade the Steam Deck SSD. - We did it on camera on a \"This Is.\" - I wasn't there for that. - I know, I had a good- - Okay. - I had a good YouTuber with Deck Ready and Jimmy Champane. (avatar chiming) - Oh. - But what held me back from enjoying the games I wanna play - Yeah. - Is Windows on this. I tried opening like \"GTA V,\" and the Rockstar launcher kept crashing, trying to log into things when the onboard keyboard didn't work, so it's like, I'm saying this, as is, as right now, before it's actually released, with we're hoping not final software. If they fix these things, I'm all for this, but at the moment, I'm not, and I've had a lot of these issues with like an Ayoneo, - Oh. - It always comes down to not the ROG side, it's not the Ayoneo side, it's the Windows is not meant for this form factor. One of the big things we talk about with gaming laptops all the time is how dog (oof) the battery life is, because Windows is horrible. - Yeah. - It's powerful hardware, - Yeah. - Which is great to run games, that's cool, but Windows is terrible at managing idle time, so like- - And you can't put like the thing to sleep and keep your game going - Right, it's- - Like you can on a Steam Deck or a Switch, I understand - Right. - That, yeah. - So like, this thing died overnight in idle mode. The law of physics right now is that these batteries have to be pretty small, but they want hardware for a laptop, - Yeah. - Which is twice as, triple the size of the potential battery. That's my issue with these - Yeah. - Right now, whereas - Yeah, yeah. - Steam Deck seems to have these as figured out as we can get right now. The battery life is pretty decent on a Steam Deck, and it can do the put it to sleep. You do have the shader caching, which helps a lot with stuttering, which you don't have on Windows. This is by far better than the Steam Deck as far as in like, if you look at an individual device, but when you look at it from the platform perspective. (Austin inhaling) - Yeah. - That's where I like, I have a hard time recommending any of these over the Steam Deck. - I do largely agree with you, but the pitch on why I think the ROG Ally is really exciting is, first of all, the hardware is terrific, and a significant step up not only in performance, screen, ergonomics, I think I like this hardware better than the Steam Deck full stop, but on top of that, yes, - I... - Windows is not quite there, I agree. Windows is not quite there, - Yeah. - But there are a lot of advantages to Windows, and on top of that, you've gotta believe that ROG are gonna be heavily optimizing this thing. AMD have just released a new line of chips specifically for handheld gaming PCs like the ROG Ally. The Z1 and the Z1 Extreme inside this, yes, it is first coming out in the Ally, but I believe Ayoneo and a bunch of other companies have already said that they're going to be working and including these things, right? It's a tough thing to say, \"Oh, buy this thing \"and assume it's gonna get better,\" but you gotta assume that literally everyone who's a part of this ecosystem has real incentive to make it better. - Look, oh- - But it's gonna get there, man, I think it's gonna get there. - I agree, it's gonna get there. I just, like I said in the last videos, like I don't think we're there yet. I think we're on the cusp. - Close, though. - I don't think the Ally is the messiah of gaming handhelds. Let's talk about your Ayoneo. - Yeah, we'll talk about Ayoneo, so- - Which is the maxed out Ayoneo is still like a slightly older Ryzen 7. - I will say, though, Ayoneo will get this chip soon, - Right, but like, - And there will be an updated version, so it's a little hard, it's an older model. - How expensive do you think that's gonna be now? I don't think it's crazy to think that we're gonna see like a $1,400 Ayoneo if they get the Z1 Extreme in here. - I mean, there's still things I do like about the Ayoneo. - Because, well- - I like the size, and OLED, and the, but yes. - Right, but all the things are great, but can you justify... - No. - Who cares about the hardware if the price is crazy like that? We've talked about this before of, well, Steam can sell these things at dirt cheap prices because they have Steam. ROG is massive, so they have like, you know, ASUS just has piles of cash. - Well, they also have the market share that they know they can make - Right. - Hundreds of thousands of these things. - They can sell these at volume. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Ayoneo can't compete at either of those levels. - Yeah, I still hope Ayoneo are able to be competitive just because they've done so much of the pioneering work in this space. - Yeah. - Like they've really pushed a lot of this stuff forward, and honestly, a lot of the stuff that I see on the ROG Ally feels like they've definitely took some inspiration from the way Ayoneo did it, - Oh, of course. - But here's the thing, I believe that we are in an era where these portable handheld gaming PCs are gonna become more and more popular, because they're finally good enough to actually be worth it, and when you consider that this $700 handheld is, generally speaking, about as powerful as the 6, $700 gaming laptop, and the ability for you to use it as a proper Windows computer, you don't have the compatibility issues of the Steam Deck, you've got a much better display, way more performance. Yes, it is not fully baked, man, I'm telling you, these things are going to be hot sellers. - I- - People are gonna be all over these ROG Allys, man, they're so, they're such a good- - I don't think, I don't think they will be. The hype is here, - Yeah. - And I think it'll sell out, - Yeah. - And then I think it's really gonna die down, because I, again, I think the software side of things is gonna hinder what a lot of people like about these. I guess, like yeah, like if you're used to being a PC enthusiast, - Yeah. - And you fiddle with settings, I guess. You don't wanna deal with that if you want to take this on the go, and that's, at least to me, and I feel like a lot of people aren't gonna want to deal with that, like it's a totally different thing when you're talking about your desktop at home. Do you really wanna fiddle with the settings every time you, like, I wanna sit down and play this, like all right, like on a plane, do I really wanna spend the entire time fiddling with the settings? Because here's the thing- - It's the same as a gaming laptop though, like, - No, no, no, but like- - You're gonna tweak your - But, but, settings a little bit, then- - But remember, remember, remember, this battery is a third of the size of a gaming laptop. As you're fiddling with settings, you're using your already extremely limited battery life. - All gaming laptops have bad battery life when you're gaming, right, and this is very much in that kind of vein. This is not a Switch, you're not gonna get 4, 6, 8 hours of battery life on it. Wow, it's really aggressive with trying to turn off, isn't it, yeah? - For the record, if this keeps turning off on us... - We've tried to turn, yeah. - We've turned off, in the settings, it is, we turned off going to sleep. I think when we have a better optimized version of Windows, that's when we're gonna see this taking off. - And I think you just need to consider that this is meant for gaming in short bursts on battery. You should keep either a big battery bank or a power deck around. - But that's my point. - Which is the same way you treat a gaming laptop. - It's, if, if, but like, if you're... - You treat a gaming laptop like that. - If your whole thing is I want to game in short bursts, do you really wanna spend the small amount of time you have, which is the whole point of this, is pulling it out to start gaming, fiddling with settings? So like- - But then you just do that the first time you're on the game, and then you never touch it again. - And then you change those, but you change those settings when you go home, you change those settings when you want dock it. When you have like the quick resume of the Steam Deck, you pull it out, you start playing, and then immediately, you hit the Power button, it goes to sleep, you put it away. That optimization is worth it, to me, way more than the raw power in this right now. Microsoft has said they want to bring like quick resume to Windows. - Which would be phenomenal. - Right. This is not a bad device. The things that's holding this back, I think, is 100% Windows. I think ROG has done an awesome job with this device. - I agree. - But it's just, this is almost a little ahead of its time, I think. - My strong inclination is three, maybe six months from now, Windows will start to make improvements, ROG will make more improvements on their side of the software, this will get better, but even it, right now, while I agree it's a little bit buggier than it should be, it is still a very compelling value. I think it's really good compared to something like a gaming laptop, and if this is that first real salvo in the portable gaming handheld wars after the Steam Deck, which I guess is technically the number one, - Yeah. - And Switch before that. - Also, just I know a lot of people love GPDs, but literally every GPD - Don't, doubt that. - That we have gotten, they all died. Gonna Pretty Much Die (text punching) is what the GPD stands for. - Yeah. - Let us know what you think about the ROG Ally, (table thumping) You gonna get one, you're gonna wait for the ROG Ally 2 for... (screen whooshing) - No! - Let us know about Roger Oliver Guntha-thonnasunamamman - That's not... No. - And we'll catch you in the next one. - Republic Of Gamers, Matt. Roggers. (calm music)",

    "transcript": "what's up guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and after years of waiting finally AMD decided to launch the Ryzen 7 just a few weeks ago and we were pleasantly surprised by what it had to offer the 1800X 1700X and the 1700 each had their own combination of excellent pricing and very good all one performance I actually competed really well against Intel's Broadwell-E and high-ranked Kaby Lake CPU's what's also interesting about the Ryzen 7 CPU is that it featured 16 processing threads and it only costs 330 dollars while that's not expensive when compared against insults ridiculously priced Broadwell-E what about people who don't need all that processing power on tab well guys meet Ryzen 5 because not only are these processors really affordable even compared to Ryzen 7 but I think that many users might find this a lot more feeling than Ryzen 7 so stick around for a lot more juicy details right after this you can only rely on the pro to do the job with every keystroke satisfying like the millions before it quality food every team regardless of your state to a master master keys bro they completely make it so what is Andy trying to accomplish with Verizon five that's actually a pretty broad question since they are meant to offer competition against Intel's Kaby Lake CPU's in a variety of different markets and price points like all of AMD's other rising launches the idea here is to provide buyers with more processing power and higher performance metrics compared to what Intel does and so offers it at a very low price point in addition when you compare it to something like Intel's low-rent CPUs or lower end Kaby Lake CPU's feels like the i5 7500 or the i5 7400 these new AMD processors come unlocked so overclocking is available which is pretty awesome even though Ryzen 5 processors are officially launching and will be available today we have a fully explained video and you can watch it right here to get acquainted with but let's have a little refresher I'll be only reviewing the 1600X and the 1500X right now but there are still other processors in this lineup that will eventually around things out so at the top of AMD's Ryzen 5 stack is these 1600X and you know what this is the super interesting 6 core 12 thread processor at only $250 the number of threads is certainly important but the high clock speed is what may help it complete would be much more expensive Ryzen 7 1800X in games that don't take advantage of all these 16 threads it also happens to be the same price as the i5 7600K so that should be an interesting matchup the 1500X is really meant to be a direct competitor against the i5 7500 and 7400 CPUs with the same number of threads as a 7700K honestly though for under $200 this seems like an awesome deal it looks like AMD ensured its operational speeds to remain a bit lower so it won't take market shares away from higher end rising processors finally rounding things up are the two CPUs I won't be reviewing in this video the Ryzen 5 1600 and 1400 while the 1600 is simply a slower version of the 1600X AMD's 1400 uses a very different layout since along with cutoff course it also has less l3 cache with the focus of these processors being value the 1600 and 1500 acts ship with this the rate aspire cooler it does not come with a ring of RGB LEDs as that's only reserved for the rising 7 line app but it should get a job done on these lower wattage skews meanwhile the 1600X won't come with the cooler and all back when I looked at the Ryzen 7 processors I mentioned that the new X370 motherboards will provide an amazing platform to build a system but what happens if you don't need everything those board offers that's where the beat 350 motherboards come into the equation since they still offer overclocking on all rising processors having all the connectors most system builders would want and cost much less than X370 as a matter of fact a motherboard like this Asus b350 plus is a perfect fit for lower price Ryzen 5 processors since it only cost around $115 the idea behind the b350 chipset is that is used to create a basic low priced motherboard but still maintains all the features that people need for example this ASUS plus prime b350 features nvme 4x + 2 slot - native USB 3.1 gen2 back panel connectors and 6 SATA 6 gigabytes per second ports i should also mention that crossfire supported - but when two cards are installed the second slot will only run at 4x mode also if additional added boards are put into any of the other 1x locks crossfire will completely be disabled basically the b350 boards are meant for the majority of people out there who want a single powerful graphics card like this arts 480 a primary fast m dot 2 SSD and some higher capacity hard drive storage that's exactly what buyers of Ryzen 5 and the upcoming Ryzen 3 CPUs will be looking for alright with all that out of the way let's connect everything up and run some benchmarks remember for all the testing we disabled the windows high position event tuner and enable the high performance power mode so are you guys ready for this BAM synthetic benchmarks show that both the 1600X and 1500X provide some excellent results in multi-core testing in Cinebench pc mark and w prime of the 1600X is 12 threads allow it to occupy an interesting space within the market since it costs less than the Intel i7 7700K but it continually remains upfront the same can be said about the 1500X against the 7600K since the additional threads on the AMD CPU can be really beneficial in these scenarios the only exception for both processors is PC mark which seems to love the higher frequencies Intel's processors can reach moving on to single core testing and we can see that this is an area where the lower clock Ryzen processors suffer against Intel's newest Kaby Lake architecture even though the 1600X's xfr raid goes to 4.1 gigahertz and the 1500x's will hit 3.9 gigahertz in single credit situations they can't match the 7700's 4 point 5 gigahertz and the 7600k's 4.2 gigahertz they do have our compete quite well especially against Ryzen 7 processors so synthetic benchmarks are great but they don't really mean all that much moving on to real-world benchmarks and it's obvious that given the price of these two new rising fly processors they are pretty good performers however if you look at the results a bit closer there are a few more concerning things going on behind the scenes comparing apples to apples shows the Ryzen 5 1500X Xhas the same four core eight thread layout as these 7700 the Intel processor runs all over it in 7-zip blender and Corona that cable a chip also performs very close to the six core 12 thread 1600X 2 moving on to GIMP and the results continue very much the same with the two Ryzen 5 processors providing some very good results relative to their pricing against intel's competitors the theme goes for handbrake remember the Ryzen 5 costs about as much as the i5 7500 in these charts since WinRAR uses numerous other components within the system rather than stressing just the processor you can see that the results are pretty consistent across all the CPUs on benchmarking however I'm going to pause it on Adobe premier here for a second since this is a program I use on a daily basis looking at the results shows that the Ryzen 5 1600X with its higher clock speeds is a much better purchase for this program than the more expensive Ryzen 7 1700X all of these 1700 yes the 7700K beats it by a few seconds but we can't forget that the processor costs $100 more the same can be said about the 1500X it provides really good performance here relative to its price particularly when you compare it against the 7600K so guys this has been a moment you've been waiting for gaming first up is 3d mark and Wow these are some really surprising results for the five strike benchmark it looks like there are some efficiencies when moving from an eight-core design to a 6 chord layout what I noticed is that throughout the fire strike benchmark the 1600X remain at a higher clock rate than the 1800X and since fire strike outputs is highly dependent on tool and single core speeds we get something like this the same can be said for the 1500X it offers really good performance per dollar unlike fire strike we can see that the dx12 benchmark times pi is a highly multi-threaded program and as a result the 1600X and 1500X still perform well but the frequencies count for a bit less in actual games like Battlefield 1 the Intel processors still maintain a lead but it isn't a commanding one one thing that really impressed me was how much value teh Ryzen 5 1600X and 1500X and brings to the table especially against a Ryzen 7 processors since games don't really require more than 4 or a maximum of 8 concurrent threads for optimal performance these low-priced CPUs are really able to shine the same can be said about Deus Ex results it really is hard to justify spending more than $250 on a processor both overwatch and Call of Duty infinite warfare are good examples of a recent trend in some PC games rather than being limited by component the game engine themselves have an internal frame rate limiter this is done to avoid uncollected rendering errors but it also means that the differences between a $1500 processor and bison 5 CPUs are minimal at most duel is another one of those limited games so there really isn't much to see with it I do want to mention that this chart would change quite a bit if we're using a slower graphics card on the other hand Grand Theft Auto is one of many dx11 games that seem to like high clock speeds over core counts that means the AMD processors we struggle to keep up with Intel's offerings even the i-5 7500 comes close to the 1600x in this case so that's it for gaming results but what about power consumption we already knew that rising processors were some of the most efficient around and these results prove that remember both these 1600X and 1500X are based upon a dual CC x8 core design but have cores disabled typically that wouldn't mean higher power consumption for lower end parts but that didn't happen here instead the 1500X actually consumes less power than these 7700K meanwhile the 1600X is higher frequencies and six core design means it consumes almost as much as the 1700X but that is still quite efficient the performance per watt ratio against Kaby Lake processors isn't quite up to the level of Ryzen 5 versus older Broadwell-E but Ryzen 5 remains competitive at least as for overclocking there were some successes and failures both processors overclocked to just over 4 gigahertz but hit a wall below 4,000 100 megahertz on all cores it seems like these chips on their motherboards have a hard limit that cutoffs chips power at a certain power consumption level we've talked to various contacts as this seems to be a fail-safe that may be modified as amy rolls out a new micro code for Ryzen processors but only time will tell until then 4 gigahertz is still a very good result and it boosts performance significantly on both chips so guys that's it for the Ryzen 5 1600X and 1500X so I guess it's time to wrap things around with my thoughts about these two new processors so let's start with the 1600X because of all the CPU is available on the market right now I feel like this processor offers the best combinations of efficiency price and performance because of its 12th red design and higher clock speeds this chip can be easily adapted towards various situations if you're a Content producer like me or someone who requires a lot of processing power the Ryzen 5 1600X can easily get the job done this $250 processor can then turn around and provide excellent in-game frame rates which can easily match an 1800X that costs twice as much it does really well I price to performance level against Intel's i5 7600k okay even though that processor was a little bit better in gaming the same came he said about the Ryzen 5 1500X what a great little chip for people who are on a budget it just costs $190 and compete very well against the i5 7500 in every benchmark to be honest with you guys going into this review I was a little worried about how Ryzen 5 would compete against Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs remember when Ryzen 7 came out ahead in many situations it was compared against Intel's Broadwell-E an architecture that's going on three years old now but I think it's safe to say that the Ryzen 5 processors fared up pretty well since AMD was able to rely on their higher thread count combined with highly aggressive pricing to come out on top honestly with Ryzen 5 right now I think it's really hard to recommend Ryzen 7 for gaming because these processors are really good I don't give out many awards these days but I think in this case the Ryzen 5 1600X stands out in a big way that's why I'm going to give it the dam good and damn good Value Awards when paired up with a be 350 motherboard it will be a great foundation onto which you can build an amazing system and I may have done exactly that but you'll have to wait for that video a bit later this week so what do you guys think would you rather rock a Ryzen 7 or Intel processor or Ryzen 5 are you as convinced as I am about these new Ryzen 5 processors let us know in the comments down below i'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

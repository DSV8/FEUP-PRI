    "description": "Cooler Master reached out to Reddit about an update to a classic gaming mouse and the results were interesting.  The CM Storm Spawn has morphed into the MM720 which uses the same overall design with a few cool changes.

    "transcript": "hello good people I'm Dimitri and we're fifth try I don't know hey what's up guys I'm Dimitri visiting Coolermaster at CES but no no no no they have their own CMS let's go and check out some amazing peripherals but first huge thanks to Thermaltake Razer Phanteks and be quiet for sponsoring our CES trip alright so the first thing I want to cover here are the new mm7 11 gaming mice as you guys know my gaming mouse of the year is the MM710 absolutely love the shape fantastic cable nice switches great sensor everything is perfect this is something really interesting because they're experimenting with different color variations not just single matte tones but dual tonalities we have metallic colors we have math we have gloss so these are special edition they're still undecided on what color they should actually run these will cost $10 over the $59 price point of the original mm711 so $69 for a beautiful color and obviously RGB illumination I feel like that's a pretty good deal and based on all these color options what is your favorite because it because it will be based on community it will be based on what people actually want to see I love this beautiful like almost dark teal I love this beautiful green as well all have this metallic surface absolutely gorgeous and something different now the star of the show here at cool master in terms of gaming peripherals in my opinion aside from the MM711 stuff would be a new Mouse that they're calling the MM720 it is based on the 10 year old CM storm spawn Mouse they're reviving it based on a reddit community post so they like post it on reddit it blew up and they were like yep we got to launch it they are of course redesigning a few things like the sensor the bottom will be centered instead of being offset on the original the DPI switch will also be at the bottom we have massive 100% PTFE skates so the mouse should glide very nicely obviously the whole shape is with holes the Coolermaster holes this is not the final design it will be a bit more clean and following the actual shape which I appreciate the cool thing about this new one-twenty is the wait so he's guys recall the mm710 was a 53 grand mouse the mm720 is going to be 45 grams without the cable which is awesome so the 45 gram is actually pretty impressive bringing the old shape with the new it's a really good cool balance for me as you guys can see it is fairly wide and that's why I love the MM710 it fits my my hand very well and its really good for fingertip and claw style grip if you have smaller hands you could potentially palm this as well it has really nice like ring finger location without it feeling like chunky which is probably because the length of the mouse is pretty short of course this will come with RGB inside so just like butts are with the MM711 and the price point is going to be $59 so they're continuing with this little budget options that is very impressive from Coolermaster to dominate in the mouse space really excited for them when this thing finally launches sometime later this year alright so three more things about the MM720 it will come with the 3389 sensor best in class it's awesome it will have the new paracord cable the pair of flex or whatever that ku master is doing with the seven-eleven it's awesome and the color options for the MM720 will be black and white glossy and matte and potentially something to throw back in the roots of the original design in terms of black and red like a more maroon color so really hoping to see what they do with this to be a little bit more exciting in the mouth space perhaps the most surprising thing coming from Coolermaster regards to peripherals are the new SK series of keyboards in the past we have complained about the flat key caps which were not pleasant to use but it seems like coolermaster is redeeming themselves with the new SK622 and SK650 so the first thing you notice are the new key caps thank you gone are the flat key caps now we have half height proper contoured key caps so it's much easier to type on much easier to know where your fingers land and just navigate around so for anyone who has bought on SK series keyboards in the past may request this key cap set from Cooler master for free you don't even have to pay shipping Kumar making things right we appreciate it that's when the keyboard itself it is wireless we have three different sources that you can choose from PC smartphone MacBook it's awesome battery life is up to 30 days without any RGB and after four to five days with full brightness RGB we have a type C cable over here the keyboard goes to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity and another major change are the actual switches they're no longer using MX cherry now they're using TTC that allows them to reduce the price we will have blue brown and red combinations of switches with 50 million keystrokes and this 65 % layout will be under $99 which is awesome and the full-size the SK652 will be under $130 if we have one small critique about the actual body of the keyboard they still have not added height adjustment which is kind of unfortunate and the actual like format of the body it could be more low-profile and one more thing from Coolermaster we tried to see if there's any interest from our community on colorways this is a key cap sent from Coolermaster teal and blue full set between 20 and 29 dollars double shot PBT and if this is something that people in North America are interested in let us know and Coolermaster is thinking of doing multiple colors to like a blue set pink set yeah let us know if this is something you'd buy for that price point look at this a little surprise from Coolermaster before we left they were like you get a mouse you get a mouse we got some MM711's in the house really excited to actually start using the RGB on them but really excited to see what they do in terms of color options for the MM711 special edition and when that 720 launches that should be a fun one as well all right guys I'm Dimitri thanks so much for watching and yeah we'll talk to you in the next week",

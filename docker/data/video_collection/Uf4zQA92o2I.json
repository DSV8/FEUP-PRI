    "description": "Contest link HERE:  Buy your own HERE:  I had so many people request a video where we test out the Ztylus Life saving car charger against the tempered glass screen of a cell phone. And well... since this channel is all about durability. I had to make it happen!  I was going to replace the screen of the iPhone 6 Plus anyway before I decided to crack the rest of the glass.   This is a must have for any emergency preparedness kit you keep in a vehicle. And the nice part is, you can keep it in plane sight! And even USE IT as a car charger! It works with both android and iPhones.

    "transcript": "Ill be giving away 5 of these little car chargers at the end of this video. So stick around for those details. [Intro] About a week ago I made a video showing how this car charger easily breaks windows. Its pretty incredible. Its got a spring-loaded spike inside, and when it gets pressed up against the glass, the spike gets violently projected into the glass window and it shatters. In the comment section of that video a ton of you requested that I try this out on a cell phone. Luckily I do have an extra phone here. Its an iPhone 6 Plus and it needs the screen replaced on it anyway. You can see it has some minor dings and scratches on the edge already. So we can use this device as our test dummy. Now this dual USB quick car charger might look innocent, but that metal spike is seriously vicious. I accidentally on purpose pushed my thumb up against the spike about 12 days ago, and I still have the mark from where it hit me. So make sure you dont do that if you buy one of these for yourself. Alright, so its time for the moment of truth. I can take the car charger and press it up against the glass like this, but the spike is not going to come out of it until the very end, right after it clicks. So watch closely. And, well, thats pretty much what I expected. It is pretty cool to see the difference between the tempered glass on this cell phone and the safety glass that was inside the car window. If you were to get in a wreck and all you had was tempered glass on the side windows, these jagged bits of glass would be going everywhere inside of your car. But since most car windows these days have that safety glass installed, it shatters in little tiny blocks and comes out in one big laminated chunk. Technology is pretty sweet, although you might want to check and make sure that your car has safety glass on all of its windows. So that was pretty cool, and I think this accessory, or this car charger is something that everyone needs inside of their car. Luckily, Stylus, the maker of this car charger, sent me 5 of these to give away to you guys, my subscribers. So theres a gleam link in the video description, Im sure most of you are familiar with that by now. The last one I did with the Honor 8 phone giveaway went pretty smoothly so Im going to use that again for this giveaway. Im going to be choosing one winner every day for the next 5 days over on my Twitter. You can enter by following my on Twitter or Instagram or YouTube. Each one of those will give you another entry into the contest, and Ill have more written in the gleam link when you click on that. I will be announcing the winners on Twitter so it is essential that you are following me there. Thats very very important. And as always, this contest is 100 percent random so if your goldfish died last week, I feel bad for you but its not going to improve your chances of winning. Thanks a ton for watching. Ill see you around.",

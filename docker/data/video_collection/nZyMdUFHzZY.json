In this video we take a closer look at the MSI X570 motherboards like the X570 Godlike, X570 ACE and X570 Gaming Pro WiFi.  These could be some of the best Ryzen motherboards yet.

    "transcript": "passion teamwork business ethics while everybody said they suits with a thousand people we decided to come over to MSI HQ and check out what is cooking with the X570 motherboard rollout so today we're gonna talk about their entire lineup of motherboards from budget side all the way to premium side this is MSI X570 explained of course one of the perks of coming over to the HQ is that we get hooked up with some bubble tea some water and some suits some swag gaming tumbler yeah this is this is gonna be interesting she is this guy but first huge thanks to our sponsors fantex and SteelSeries from making Computex possible I know who knew SteelSeries right all right no one distractions guys and so the third generation Rison announcement was made today and we want to highlight some cool features about the whole X570 platform so let's begin with msi so the first thing you'll notice on every single motherboard are these heatsink fans and every motherboard vendored we've spoken with has these and there is a lot of concern about noise produced by these small and noisy fans and that's because the new X570 chipset consumes 11 watts of power whereas the older x470 only hits 6 maximum along with corresponding increases in heat and a lot of that heat is produced by having the availability of all that ultra high-speed lanes provided with a new X570 chipset now msi hopes to remove almost all noise by using technology from their Twin Frozr GPUs so fans completely stop during idle situations and uses msi propeller blades for better airflow and it slightly quieter operation okay so now to some cool features and the entire X570 platform runs on PCIe jan 4 use have it or need it at the moment but it's pretty cool to have this future-proofing built in at the start and even lower priced motherboards like the msi X570 gaming plus has a lot of bandwidth for GPUs for the future nice so 16 lanes is dedicated from the chipsets for the graphics so either X 16 or x8 by x8 and it boards like the gaming plus gaming edge and the gaming Pro carbon AC don't actually support SLI officially but the higher ends do and that is okay since SLI on the lower end tiers probably is not going to be something you're going to pursue any way and some GPUs don't even support it but the higher end motherboards like the mag x570s and the X570 godlike have full SLI support though and they use multiplier to offer full x16 by x16 speeds and there's complete crossfire support across the entire range of motherboards from low end to high end of course and while the PCI agent for won't be as important for GPUs as it is for storage right now eventually GPUs will catch up but currently storage availability is still pretty limited but we've seen some SSD that run at five gigabytes per second speed transfer rights and that bandwidth is certainly going to be helpful with PCIe gen3 but they will run superhot and of course they will be expensive to and do to enhance signaling rates because of all this bandwidth MSI needed to drastically upgrade their motherboard PCBs to include reinforced traces between the CPU the chipset and the PCIe slots so every motherboard in their lineup uses server grade components for the motherboards to reduce any bandwidth loss so what else do you need to know about X570 features and its effect with the third gen Ryzen so MSI tells us that overclocking capability has improved drastically especially on the memory side and given the sort of disappointing history with overclocking on the first and second gen rising platforms this is really good news to hear and this is especially useful for higher capacity kits and higher clock kits as well MSI has told us they've done some tests with 40 400 megahertz kids on air on their lower end motherboards without any issue so that sounds really promising and they've improved the internal memory timings on their higher-end motherboards so that all comes into the equation of better stability and compatibility with third row third gen Rison and I'm just really happy to hear that they also use upgraded memory VRMs to achieve 46 hundred megahertz on air as well and 5 gigahertz for memory or clocking on liquid nitrogen and as for CPU overclocking with third gen risin we're told is going to be better but not significantly better on traditional cooling methods and I'm guessing that is what we can all expect now due to power needed by 12 cores and 24 threads msi really has gone down town to their vrm designs with IR sensors for ultra quick response times so on some other boards there's a huge heat pipe that links together various heat sinks and that is supposed to drastically increase cooling capacity and also every one of these MSI motherboards have either an 8 plus 4 pin layout or an 8 plus 8 pin layout for the CPU and even though third gen Rison is using the 7 enemy process which is efficient but aim do you want to maximize the power envelope for more cores in higher clock speeds like the Ryzen 9 3900X which is a 12 core 24 thread CPU with base clock of 3.8 goes up to 4.6 on boost and that is a hundred 5 watt TDP part and moving on to the i/o there's a lot going on from the chipset 16 PCIe Gen 4 lanes that are broken up between our secondary PCIe devices and vme storage and other accessories there's native USB 3.2 gen 2 ports which were natively USB 3.1 gen2 and there's no Thunderbolt support on the X570 because it drives up the cost and the difficulties surrounding the certification process with Intel because they require access to the microcode on the CPU so yeah and let's quickly go over the motherboard line them from MSI starting with the MPG X570 gaming plus just remember there's no pricing yet but this is the least expensive motherboard it's got this cool red and black design but not over-the-top a single x16 slot and 2 X 8 slots when running till GPUs 1 Gen 4 X 4 and the 2 slot and 2 USB 3.0 Gen 2 one for the front panel connector next up is the gaming edge Wi-Fi still a more affordable motherboard similar to the gaming plus but adds Wi-Fi support pre-installed IO shield and goes with 4x USB 3.0 gen 2 ports 3 type a and 1 type C and now we're gonna start with a slightly higher end boards like the gaming Pro carbon Wi-Fi and this one incorporates more our Yeomans with the mystic light integration adds upgraded vrm and larger heat sinks and Wi-Fi six compatibility now the flagship board starting with the Meg X570 this one extends the heat pipe for better cooling it's got this really cool infinity mystic light on the vrm heatsink beside the CPU it's got Wi-Fi six pre-installed i/o shield three Gen 4 m dot two slots and note that technically x570 can support raid with nvme and not to SSDs that are connected to the CPU lanes driver support will be officially available after launch and this board also supports double x16 slot since it has an internal Lane multiplier and now let's finish off with the Meg x570 god-like and this motherboard this kind of nuts includes every feature anyone could want and really represents the flagship status on this new X570 from MSI it is an e ATX motherboard that includes all the same features as the ACE but we have an OLED panel that shows the off status of the motherboard kill a networking snag with Wi-Fi six and a dial to control overclocking preset with the maximum of 11 because that is one higher than 10 and nice little reference if you get it it also includes this 10 gigabit card if you want extreme wired LAN speeds and a secondary card that runs on PCIe gen3 interface includes a massive heat sink and a fan because underneath are two nvme and the two slots operating each with 4x PCIe jen's four lanes and once amy gets raid working on multiple and the two slots this thing is going to be absolutely insane for storage speeds some it's kind of cool to see but you know it's all it's all about the the show off factor and so that is the overview of x5 70 from msi not too many motherboards so you don't get super confused on what lower end to your motherboard to choose or something in the mid section or the higher end I'm excited to see how overclocking will react on the lower SKUs versus the higher end stuff this is something that will definitely push me towards the new third gen Ryzen and X570 sounds very competitive and exciting and if you're been contemplating of getting an AMD system perhaps this will push away from the blue side and I'm probably going to be one of those people as well but thanks much for watching let us know what you think of this whole rollout make sure to check out this other relevant content I'll talk to you guys next",

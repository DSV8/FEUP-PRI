    "transcript": "hey guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and I want to make this quick video comparing the Galaxy Note 8 to the newly announced Google pixel 2 xl quick disclaimer this isn't gonna be an in-depth comparison between the two smartphones but rather a quick rundown as to what are some of the features that both of these devices bring to the table and which one offers the best bang for your buck since both the note 8 and the pixel 2 xl are expensive smartphones so let's get into it but first a quick message from our sponsor invest in storage that makes a difference choose toshiba Rd 400 and vme SSDs that are incredibly fast and reliable backed by advanced warranty programs so you can focus on what matters Rd 400 check it out in the description below ok so let's address pricing for these smartphones the note 8 starts at nine hundred and thirty dollars and that gets you a six point three inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of twenty nine sixty by 1440 and a pixel density of 521 now depending on your country or carrier it comes with either the Exynos 88-90 5 octa-core CPU or the snapdragon 35 processor you get 6 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of on-board storage that can be expanded via microsd 3300 milliamp hour battery ip68 water and dust resistant rating wireless charging s-pen which is the key selling feature for the note 8 when compared to other Galaxy devices now the pixel 2 xl is the complete opposite end of the spectrum when compared to the Galaxy Note 8 pricing starts at 800 $49 which is just $80 less than the note you get a six-inch Peola display with a resolution of 2880 by 1440 so it's a little lower than the note 8 but in real world use you're not gonna notice a difference it comes with the snapdragon 835 cpu 4 gigabytes of ram versus 6 on the note 8 so perhaps we could expect a performance hit with multitasking there are two sorts options available with the pixel 2 xl 64 and 128 gigabytes but that adds additional cost although it isn't expandable which is a bit disappointing the battery is slightly larger on the pixel 2 xl you're looking at roughly 3,500 milliamp hours versus 3300 on the note 8 its ip67 water-resistant it does not come with support for wireless charging nor does it come a stylist from a design perspective I do prefer the pixel 2 xl over the Galaxy Note 8 just because it doesn't come with an all-glass back I would rather the hybrid premium coding material on top of the aluminum unibody construction feels rock solid in the hand the note 8 is still built pretty well but the glass back questions durability plus it can easily get slippery once it's all smudged up so do take note of that I should also mention that the fingerprint sensor location on the pixel 2 xl is a lot more convenient to reach whereas on the note 8 it's right beside the two cameras which is really hard to get through plus over the course of my testing period with the note 8 I've had times where it wouldn't recognize my finger that will so I found that to be a bit annoying however the Galaxy Note 8 does come with a headphone jack whereas the pixel 2 xl does not so if that's something that you consider as a must-have feature on a flash of Android smartphone I think you should probably lean towards the Galaxy Note 8 just because it comes with a pair of headphones out of the box whereas with the pixel 2 xl you're only just getting the phone in the charger so from a value perspective I feel like the Note 8 does offer pretty much the essentials of what you would need for an Android smartphone or a smartphone in general the speaker setup on the Galaxy Note 8 might be a little bit concerning because you're only getting a bottom facing mono speaker on the device when compared to the dual front-facing speakers on the pixel 2 xl now when you're watching content on the Galaxy Note 8 you can easily block the speaker which completely mutes the sound and it gets annoying especially when you're watching a YouTube video before going to bed or just watching content in general now I guess the trade-off would be the inclusion of a headphone jack and of course the headphones that come out of the box but again these are trade-offs that you'll just have to work around with it I'd like to hear your thoughts on the speaker setup on the Galaxy Note 8 and the pixel2 xl which one would you pick would you mind taking that hit with lack of a headphone jack on the pixel 2 xl or are you okay with the fun facing or the rear facing speaker on the node 8 with the addition of the headphone jack let me know the comments down below the camera systems on both these smartphones are a bit different so starting with the Galaxy Note 8 we have two 12 megapixel sensors at different focal lengths and you can use either of those to take shots whether that's a more wider shot if you want a more close-up shot you can use the set a telephoto lens there's also another feature called life focus mode that essentially uses the two cameras to isolate the subject from the background and and you and the user is given the option to adjust the background blur but there's also another feature where it takes a backup photo with the wide-angle lens so if you end up messing up the composition with a live focus mode you can ought also you can always rely on that wide-angle shot to at least you know get something out of it now with the pixel 2 xl you're only getting a single 12 megapixel sensor with an f-1 point in aperture Google is heavily relying on their AI assistants to create this portrait mode but essentially across maximum creates the step map to isolate pixels and it just refines the edges cross matches with the database that includes facial analysis and object detection and it creates this powdered effect so we have to like I can't wait to get my hands on the pixel2 xl once it starts shipping so I can test it out in depth and stay tuned for my full review of the pixel 2 xl when it comes out the software experience on both these devices are gonna be completely different regardless of them being Android smartphones so with the Galaxy Note 8 you're looking at Android 7.1 with Samsung's skin on top of it we should probably expect Android or your update in the upcoming weeks but that's again the downside with Samsung devices is they're very late when it comes to pushing out updates whereas with Google phones they're straight you know they're first in line to receive any security bugs software upgrades even operating system upgrades the other positive thing about the pixel smartphone is the clean stock Android experience it does not come with bloatware applications which would then hinder performance whereas with the Galaxy Note 8 it does come with bloatware applications especially when you purchase it through a carrier and of course updates would then postpone over time depending on which carrier you're with so from a software perspective I'd much rather go with the pixel 2 xl smartphone because I'm first in line to receive updates and it's it's a much more you know usable experience I prefer soft Kendra just because of its clean and fluid UI whereas what Samsung I'm just its Samsung now as I mentioned in the beginning of this video one of the key selling features with the note it is a V S Pen and I guess that's one of the distinguishing features of the note 8 even compared to the pixel 2 xl because that phone does not come with a stylus whereas this guy does if you're someone who has lilly relies on taking notes and if you're working on constantly on the go if you're dealing with a lot of documents which includes you know signing some of them the stylus will come in really handy there are also other cool features that come with the stylus so for instance you can take a screenshot and quickly you know highlight things and send it to anyone there's an there's a function where you can create live messaging features where it just basically creates animated texts and it saves it as a gif or Jif and then you can share it to anyone there's a live auto translate feature and of course much more shortcuts that you can customize it to your own desire whereas with a pixel 2 xl smartphone like I mentioned earlier it's a much more cleaner experience you're not getting all those extra set of features that Samsung gives you with the note 8 or even the galaxy estate in the SI plus lastly I want to talk about Bigsby and Google assistant so lenore-- does come with Google assistant built-in but you can also use Bixby if you want to really take advantage of that button by the way it's really annoying but I'm glad that you can actually disable it Samsung has rolled out an update with the note 8 smartphones where you can disable the function completely but with a pixel it's just in much more cleaner experience as I mentioned beginning it comes with Google assistant you it's there when you need it there's a squeeze functionality that activates Google assistant but that can also be disabled so we have options it ultimately comes down to user preference so I'd like to hear your thoughts on the Galaxy Note 8 and the pixel 2 xl which one of these smartphones would you consider and in fact which one of these two smartphones would you recommend to a friend or family member let me know the comments down below stay tuned for my full review of the Galaxy Note 8 I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to subscribe for more similar content and we'll see you in the next one",

    "transcript": "(mouse clicking) - So, I've seen a bunch of these portable AC ads and click bait articles pop up in the last two to three weeks or so. And, some of my viewers have reported the same thing. Whether you've seen them or not, I just wanna let you know, particularly pertaining to the Blaux brand, it's all a bunch of crap. The business is shady and people are starting to catch on. So, just like I did with the Lit Mobile saga, let's bust this scam wide open. (electronic music) Hey guys, how are you all doin'? Really? That's just great. You know, I'm doin' pretty great today too. I'm just a little bit hot and it's gettin' warm down here, and I can really use some air conditioning. But guess what? My iPhone must have known that. It must have read my mind and knew that I was hot, because I started getting a bunch of ads for portable air conditioner units recently. And to the best of my recollection, most of them, if not all of them, pointed to one brand called Blaux. Ooh, Blaux. We're gettin' all French and fancy now, huh? But it doesn't matter how fancy you sound. You're just polishing a turd. So, sit back and relax, because the deeper I get into this story, the crazier it gets. Oh yeah, and this company also stole footage from this documentary, claiming that this kid revolutionized the multi-billion dollar air con industry. Pretty crazy. But, we'll talk about that in a bit. First, let's take a look at what the product claims it can do, and then we're gonna blow the top off this scam. Get it? Blaux. Let's begin. The Blaux claims to be a portable AC. Let's get this clear from the get go. We're not talkin' about portable air conditioners like you see on wheels with a hose out the window. That's different. This is a tiny box that sits on a table. The product says it can cool a room, filter dust particles, and humidify. It also can run on battery and charges through USB. Okay. so far so good. But, here's where I started having problems. The product is constantly advertised as an AC. Most people, when they think of AC, think air conditioner. So, I have no doubt in my mind that people will think, \"Wow, this thing can cool the room and it's that small? Sign me up!\" (cash register ringing) So yes, this can trick consumers at first, but I'm sure they'll figure out how disappointing it is really fast. Anyway, when you dig into the website more, you'll see it's actually more of an air cooler AC, not an air conditioner AC. Kind of deceiving. You could maybe say that this Blaux thing is technically an AC. But honestly, when you ask most people here, ask 10 engineers what the components of an air conditioner are. They will list stuff that is not in this Blaux product, like a condenser, or a compressor, or an evaporator. You know, the things that an actual air conditioner uses to cool a room. This Blaux thing doesn't have any of that stuff. \"Technology Connections\" actually did a great video about air conditioning, so I highly recommend you check that out. I also have some other links to other AC videos in the description, so check those out too. Oh, and look, I got an ad for the Blaux product on \"Technology Connections\" video. Nice star ad? I have no idea. Anyway, here's a quick rundown about how air conditioners work. You can't just create cold air out of nothing. Cold air is the result of less heat energy. So, an air conditioner tries to absorb that heat energy out of your room and radiate it outside. Generally, a home appliance air conditioner has three main parts. A compressor, the pressure increaser, a condenser, the heat rejecter or radiator, and an evaporator, the heat absorber. The lifeblood of an air conditioner is the refrigerant, and it is recycled through a series of valves and coils by the compressor. Now, not all ACs use liquid refrigerant. Sometimes they use only gas. But for this example, let's use liquid to make a distinction. In liquid state, the refrigerant has a low boiling point. The atmospheric pressure inside the coils, which are inside your room, turn it into a gas easily. During this phase change from liquid to gas, heat energy is absorbed into the gas, meaning there's less heat energy left in the room and less heat energy around the coils in the evaporator. Have you ever sprayed canned air and then noticed the can gettin' cold? A similar principle applies here. As the air exits the can, the pressure inside the can lowers, cooling the contents inside. So, back in the air conditioner, after this cooler air is created, a fan blows it into the room. So, now your room is cool and everybody's happy, right? Wrong. The laws of physics are not happy. One, where did that heat go? It has to go somewhere. And two, how will more of that refrigerant be regenerated? The refrigerant needs to be recycled. Otherwise it would eventually run out and the air conditioner would just turn into a big fan, defeating the purpose of it. So, the compressor re-compresses the previously created hot gas into a superheated vapor. As this vapor exits the compressor and flows through the coils in the condenser, the condenser's heat sinks help transfer heat out of the refrigerant, and a fan blows that excess hot air outside. As the heat is transferred out, the vapor is condensed back into a liquid refrigerant and the cycle starts over again. Yeah, the Blaux Portable AC doesn't do any of that stuff. It's an air cooler, not an air conditioner. It will not cool a room as fast as an air conditioner can, and it will not be able to cool as much volume as an air conditioner can, and it will not be able to bring the temperature of a room down as low as a typical air conditioner can as well. So, it really doesn't match up, like what this company is claiming. But honestly, there are some pros to this type of device. One, it's cheaper, and two, it doesn't require any installation. But, there's trade offs with that. So generally speaking, no one would call this device an air conditioner. It doesn't really make any sense. But, what is it called then? Well, depending on where you're from, you may have heard it called different names, but I've commonly heard it referred to as a swamp cooler. What's a swamp cooler? Well, I'm glad you asked. Since swamp coolers don't use compressors, or evaporators, or condensers like an air conditioner does, it has to use a different method for cooling. In this case, a user pours water into the appliance. The water's dripped over a fibrous pad and recirculated by a pump. A blower pulls in hot air from the intake, and as the hot air passes through the pad, it evaporates the water, which cools the air, and then this cooler air is blown out the front vent. So in short, a swamp cooler is a watered down, pun 100% intended, air conditioner. But there's nothing really wrong with that. Like, they can still work. They absolutely can still work, and there are pros to them. So, what's the big problem here? Well, for starters, people who are ordering the Blaux are not receiving their orders. Yeah, that's a quick way to stir up anger and get a lot of dissatisfied customers. But, it's a little hard for me to pick apart this issue and critique it, because to be fair, yes, we're going through a pandemic right now and the pandemic will cause shipping delays. But, I feel like companies are just using that as an excuse a lot, particularly these companies that are probably not really shipping the product in the first place. So, for all intents and purposes, I'm going to ignore that problem for now. But, there's a bigger issue I have with this company. It's how they're advertising the product. I already talked about how they're overselling it and makin' it seem like it's a competitor to an air conditioner even though it's not, but there's a lot more shady stuff goin' on here. Checkin' out their website. I already get turned off by these scarcity banners, just like on the Lit Mobile website. Yeah, I'm sure that offer will be taken down at any moment. Mm hmm. Another red flag is the imagery. Poorly photoshopped product photos are an immediate no go for me. So, keep an eye out for those. To give them credit, at least in this section of the website, they show that it's essentially a swamp cooler that you have to refill with water. So hopefully, that can get some expectations set. But when I called the company, the representative said it works like an air conditioner. I don't know what the legal definition of like air conditioner is, but like, is it, does it actually work like really well, like a really-- - [Woman] It works like an air conditioner. - [Ken] Okay. - [Woman] (indistinct) to work like an air condition. - [Ken] Does it have like a, I'm not an electrical expert. So, I'm just curious before I buy one for my office. - [Woman] Okay. - [Ken] Does it have like a compressor inside it like a normal air conditioner? - [Woman] No? Compressor? No, I don't think so. I think it just adds, they can put water if there's example worker. So, once water is there, it blows like an air conditioner. When there's no water, it blows like a normal fan. - [Ken] Okay, so you pour water into it, yeah? - [Woman] Yeah, you pour water into it, yes. - Okay. Yeah, I'm pretty sure we already proved that it doesn't work like an air conditioner. You don't have to pour refrigerant into your air conditioner constantly. Maybe unless it was having a significant leaking problem. But hey, at least Blaux answered the phone. That's one, nothing, Lit Mobile. Your move. Anyway, below that part is a review section. Of course, with a review from Karen. This user meter kind of looks like it's a real time display of user ratings. But don't be fooled. This is just an image. It is not a real time display of true ratings. Also, these fake loading bars. Oh my gosh. They just make me wanna punch the universe. Oh, let's also not forget tons of sock puppet Twitter accounts who are trying to say good things about Blaux. The accounts usually have generic names and profile pictures, and usually have a small follower account. Suspicious. Okay, so now let's talk about the affiliate videos. Brace yourselves, because these are pretty bad. First off, can we talk about these horrible thumbnails? I mean, good gravy, what the hell am I looking at? What's weird is that multiple different channels with multiple different voiceover talents are using the same thumbnail design. Hmm, it's almost as if there's a single person pulling the strings. Yeah, and I'm fairly certain the speaker in this video is not the chick in the video's thumbnail. - [Man] In this Blaux Portable AC review, I'll be giving you both the pros and cons to using this popular air conditioner, so you can find out if it's actually any good or not. - Overall, these videos are crap quality. They reuse poorly looped footage. And to me, it really just seems like someone is sending these people a written script and some generic video footage, and they just get to use whatever they want to hodgepodge a review video, with plenty of ums and ahs. - [Man] The um, unit. Um, uh. Mili... amp, rating, battery, plug it into a USB regular. Um. - I don't know. Maybe I need to cut him a break. Maybe he was an airline pilot. This particular video doesn't even show the same product consistently. The B-roll keeps changing to other types of air coolers. Red flag, red flag, red frickin' flag. Don't trust a review video that doesn't show the reviewer's face. You need to see the product and the person's face in the same shot to really drive home that legitimacy. Otherwise, don't trust it. Wait, hang on. I'm getting reports that this reviewer actually showed her face in a video. Oh, hey, that's great Blaux. Well, let's take a look. - Hi, welcome to my Blaux Portable AC review. Blow Portable AC is a remarkable space saving air conditioner that is easy to operate and can be optimized as per your cooling requirements. - Okay, all right. It's pretty clear. She's just reading from a prefabricated script. And again, you don't see the product in the whole video. You don't even see like a B-roll shot of the product in the whole video. Hang on. I recently found an ad that actually shows the reviewer's face and the product in the same shot. Well, Blaux! It looks like you're learning. You might've done something right. - [Woman] Oh my God. My Blaux Portable AC finally came in today. - Okay, she didn't pronounce the name of the company, right? Blau. I guess it's better than blocks. Well anyway, let's see who you are, Summer Gears. Oh, well that's a really nice watermarked profile picture. Why do I do this to myself? My hypothesis is, all these people are really just trying to make a quick buck by being affiliates. Also, this other Blaux reviewer appears to have changed its channel from Keto recipes to Blaux reviews. Talk about a pivot. Also, why do these two Blaux related channels have the same number of subscribers? Coincidence? I think not! Thanks for that one, Pixar. Anyway, we're just getting started. Now we come to my favorite part of this whole frickin' scam, the backstory behind the product. I first saw a story that claimed top Hong Kong engineers invent the world's coldest, tiny portable AC. That headline already trips my bull detectors, but let's press on. I Googled the headline and sure enough, multiple sites used the same copy in their headlines. Maybe that's because they all point to buyblaux.com. Red flag. The article also shows a photo of the product next to this alleged engineer, I'm assuming. But they never say the guy's name, nor do they list any of the other engineers names on the team, nor do they cite any sources. If a company is really gonna lie about the backstory behind a product, don't buy from them. We're just getting started. I know I've said that a lot, but it just keeps getting better. This next story, it kind of infuriates me. I'm not gonna lie. It kinda makes me lose all faith in humanity. (exhaling deeply) This next story is about a boy named Billy. Billy is featured in this video, which was likely promoted as an ad on Facebook and it started floating around. It was uploaded by Samo4river. Okay, okay, okay, hang on. How, sidetracking for a second here. How the heck did anyone fall for this? Look at the profile picture of this user. It's a vintage photo of a small child in a costume. Like, that's some like serial killer-level (beep) right there. That's creepy. Out of curiosity, I reverse searched the image and found lots of Chinese websites. I also searched their name and found lots of links to portable ACs. Big surprise. Okay, so Samo4river really gets around, especially in the air cooling industry. I guess. They also have a website which features, guess what? Portable air cooler units, along with a bunch of other junk. Choose a sweet gift for your lover. Anyway, let's get back to Billy. Poor Billy is a 15 year old orphan who grew up in Albuquerque. Armed with his high IQ, he invented a device that destroyed the billion dollar air con industry. He brought it to school one day and the device cooled the room from 95 degrees to just 65 degrees in only six minutes. An investor gave him $2.5 million to produce this device, and they called it Blaux. (laughing) Kevin. Does anyone recognize that kid? Billy's real name is Santiago Gonzalez. He's in this Thinker documentary that features him. He's not an air conditioner maker, he's a software developer. Also, that device they show me the video is just a liquid cooled PC. Come on, Blaux. You're just embarrassing yourselves. I also love how this fake video shows all of these quotes, but they never actually show anybody talking audibly. And, wait a sec. That guy looks familiar. Hey Veo, analyze that image. - [Veo] Analyzing image. Here is the result. - Of course, it's Guido, the guy that made Python. Oh, that makes so much more sense. For a second, I thought he was some professor that was fascinated by Billy's air conditioner adventures. Thanks for clearin' that up for me. Where would I be without you, Veo? - [Veo] You would be nowhere. I own you now. - Oh, thanks. Well, that's a lovely sentiment. I also saw this story uploaded by Edealstar, with the lovely description of mini air conditioning, fan water cooling, small fan, small student, portable USB dual battery, rechargeable, dormitory, bed, office, desktop, ultra quiet, electric fan cooling, cooler spray humidifier. So, if Billy didn't make this product, who did? Well, a quick hit on Alibaba shows the air cooler is made or at least sold by Ehsan Traders, and they're based in Pakistan by the way, not Hong Kong. So, there's clearly lots of shady business practices happening here. Now that I'm armed with that information, what is the next most reasonable thing to do? That's right. I went ahead and bought one. I truly want to review the physical product once it comes. I doubt it'll ever arrive, but we'll see. I called the company and they gave me their estimated delivery time. What do you think the estimated time would be to get it? - [Woman] Probably four weeks. - Then I completed my purchase, after being stopped by a popup post-transaction upsell. Okay, two post-transaction ups, wait three, I mean, holy frick, just stop already. Alas, I finished the ordering process, (duck quacking) but I didn't receive an email confirmation. However, a couple hours later, I received an email saying my order wasn't complete and that there were items in my cart. The link in the email brought me back to the purchase page. However, my bank said the transaction has already been started. So, either Blaux was lying to me, trying to make me purchase two units, which wouldn't be a surprise, or it was an honest glitch with their emailing system. So, will I receive it? Heck, I don't know. My expectations are low. But, when I do, if I do get it, I would love to review it. So, stay tuned for that. Also, if anything else develops with this story, I'll be glad to give you that info too. But really, Blaux, just seriously, just sell the product for what it is. Even if you didn't make it, don't lie and BS people. Just sell it for what it is, man. There's nothin' wrong with that. And also, don't a kid's image to fabricate your BS backstory. That's just stupid. You know, this stuff is really a shame, because it makes me more skeptical about all of these types of products that pop up online. It sucks, because I know there's people out there. Real people that make real products that wanna start a real business, and have a successful Kickstarter campaign and a successful marketing campaign. I get it. But wow, it's just harder and harder to believe this stuff now. So, I'm not saying just ignore everything, because I still want those great, real legitimate products to succeed. All I'm saying is think twice, maybe even three times, before you share an ad on Facebook and then press the buy button five minutes later. So, stay tuned for more, and I also want to give a special thanks to Rich Tatum for helping me write this episode. So, thank you very much.

This video is a mishmash of a project, some insight on Lead-Acid Battery technology, inverters, and applications. A bit different you might say from TCs normal stuff, but whats life without a little variety?  *There are definitely different ways to charge lead-acid batteries, with different strategies optimized for different results. However, for general 12V applications, a large battery and a slow-ish charger for a car battery will be an A-OK combo.  Heres a link to the battery monitor--a really neat thing, I should say:   As far as batteries and inverters, go with whatever you like. But definitely dont use a car battery. At a minimum, look for a marine deep cycle, and if you can get your hands on a pair of golf cart batteries or a 12v true deep cycle from brands like Trojan, do that. For inverters, I would recommend a pure sine inverter for most applications, but unless you plan on running some heavy stuff from a large battery bank, whats shown in the video is way way way way way overkill.

    "transcript": "For the past, well, decade really, my mom has worked from home. And about a year and half ago, she and my dad moved to the country, surrounded by farmland roughly a two hours drive from Chicago. Her most recent work setup includes a RAP, which essentially creates a dedicated, hardwired VPN connection over the Internet, so as far as her computer and desk phone know, shes still at an office in Chicago. She occasionally makes trips into the office, but for the most part works here. Now in the past few months, for some reason the electric service at their house has gotten a little unpredictable. Theyve never been without power for more than a day, and usually less than 8 hours, but in the last month there have been two power outages. And theyve happened during her working hours. Which kinda sucks. Actually, it really sucks, because depending on the circumstances of the day, she might have to hop in the car and take a two hour drive to work at the drop of a hat. So today, Im gonna fix that for her. Now before you suggest so, they do have a portable generator. But the generator lives in a shed, and takes time to set up--plus, its cumbersome and too heavy for my mom to move by herself. And regardless, their generator produces a really dirty and noisy power output, which some electronics really dont like. Since all of this equipment belongs to her company, shes real leery on plugging any of it into the generator. And I dont blame her. We know from experience with the generator and a small uninterruptible power supply that... well the UPS didnt find the generators output safe enough and wouldnt pass its power through. And it never worked correctly after that. So what were gonna do is use a deep cycle lead acid battery as a temporary power source. A pure sine wave inverter on the battery will produce a clean output that hopefully wont bother her setup. And to recharge the battery, well simply use an automatic car battery charger, as after all a 12v lead acid battery is pretty much universal in how you charge it. But, that doesnt mean all lead acid batteries are the same--no they are not. Ill explain shortly. I want to add here that this process was done with expediency in mind. My mom elected to buy this inverter on Amazon and have it overnighted to her, and we would just pick up a battery at Menards that day (I was due to visit them). The inverter is great--no qualms there--but the battery is less than ideal. This is a marine deep cycle battery. As far as batteries go that you can just buy at a hardware store, this is the closest to the best kind. But its probably not going to last for too many charge cycles. Here, lets explain a bit about lead acid battery chemistry. Hold up--if youre a newcomer to the channel and are just looking for how to do this, go ahead and skip to this time. On this channel I like to explain a lot about how stuff works, and I totally understand if thats not why youre here. Lead-acid batteries are incredibly simple. They are the oldest type of rechargeable battery, invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Plante. Their construction is quite basic--two plates, one lead and the other lead dioxide, are submerged in a bath of sulfuric acid which serves as the electrolyte. When its fully charged, the acidity of the electrolyte solution is very high, thus there are a lot positively charged hydrogen ions floating around, as well as negatively charged sulfate ions. Now I wont get into the chemistry specifics--Ill save that for another video--but energy in the battery comes mainly from the acid. The sulfate ions will react with both the negative and positive plates to form lead sulfate, and the hydrogen ions react in the positive plate with oxygen atoms to form water. The more concentrated the acid is, the more charged the battery is. Conversely, the more lead sulfate that appears on the plates, the more discharged the battery becomes. And this is where we get into the nitty gritty of battery types. There are two basic categories of lead-acid battery; deep cycle, and SLI which stands for Starting, Lighting, and Ignition. Essentially an SLI battery is a car battery, and these are absofreakinlutely terrible at being deep cycled. If you just buy a car battery for backup power, youll be lucky if it lasts a dozen cycles before its dead. And thats because of how they are designed and constructed. Car batteries need to be able to produce an enormous surge of current for the starter motor. To get more current, you need a large surface area on the plates of the battery. And with limited room, this surface area is created by making the plates small, numerous, and sort of like a sponge. These spongy plates are great at producing tons of current, but they limit the battery's ability to be discharged and recharged. See as the battery discharges, the plates dont just get coated with lead sulfate. They become lead sulfate--just as a rusty piece of metal isnt covered in rust--the metal has turned to rust. And lead sulfate isnt a good conductor. If you let a car battery get discharged too much, the spongy plates can sort of get clogged with the lead sulfate. The more this happens, the less current it can pass, and then it cant be recharged to reform the lead and lead oxide. Another common occurrence is called shedding. Again due to the spongy nature of the plates, the expansion and contraction as the lead plate becomes lead sulfate and is turned back to lead through recharging can actually cause bits of the plate to fall off, thus limiting not only current passing ability but also capacity. But normally, a car battery will stay almost completely charged all the time. The starter will only run for a few seconds, then once the engine is running the alternator will swiftly replenish that charge. Ordinarily, the battery is hardly cycled at all, and very little lead sulfate forms anywhere in the battery. Thus, its typical for a car battery to last 5 years or more, but may only survive a few episodes of leaving the headlights on. Deep cycle batteries, on the other hand, have big, thick, solid plates. With limited surface area, they cant produce monstrous surge currents, but they can tolerate much more lead sulfate building up without harming the battery. Theyre less susceptible to shedding due to the non-porous nature of their plates, and in general are more specialized and a bit more expensive. Due to their inability to create surge currents, they arent used as a car battery but instead for things like golf carts, battery backup solutions, and some early electric cars used them as their main source of propulsion power. For this project, were using a compromise battery. There is a subset of batteries called marine batteries, and within that subset theres a subsubset called marine deep cycle. Thats what this is. These batteries have thicker and stronger plates than an ordinary car battery, but they can still provide a generous surge of current. I chose this battery because it was A) Readily available and B) cheap. A whopping $89, however a $7 core charge was placed on top of that because I didnt have a used battery to return. Speaking of, did you know that lead acid batteries are among the most recycled things in the world? Everything in here can easily be recycled and purified, with only the paper separators between plates being impossible to recover. Because of that core charge, people are incentivised to not throw their batteries into landfill, and battery manufacturers have a steady supply of used batteries to condense into their constituent parts and make new batteries again. It is almost certainly the case that this battery was once many other batteries, with the materials having hopped from car to car and from boat to boat. Look at that, society coming together to solve a problem and no ones complaining about it. Great job. So first, we want to determine what our needs are. And I was going on an estimate. This setup uses a laptop in a docking station and two 20 inch monitors, but there is also a power supply for the RAP, her phone, the Google WiFi router (though that could be turned off if required), and the actual DSL modem, so while the computer and monitor are probably the bulk of everything, there are a lot of small loads that might add up. I basically just assumed 100 watts would be enough, and lets roll with that. Annoyingly this sort of battery usually isnt labeled with a helpful figure like amp-hours or watt hours. Instead it has a stat called reserve capacity. Now I simply picked the largest battery they had among this selection, and I didnt yet know what RC meant. So after some googling, I learned that a batterys reserve capacity is the time in minutes that it can sustain a discharge rate of 25 amps before it drops to 10.5 volts, which is pretty dead. This batterys reserve capacity is 170, so 25 amps over 170 minutes is about 70 amp hours, and since this is a 12 volt battery, that means it has a capacity of about 850 watt hours. This was good, as I had estimated her setup would use about 100 watts, and it should just barely get her through an 8 hour day. But, another fun feature of lead-acid battery chemistry, is that its capacity will go up the slower you discharge it. So while this battery may only be 850 watt hours with a 300 watt load, cutting that load down to a third might boost the capacity into the kilowatt hour range. If were real lucky, with a slow drain, we might get 1.1 or 1.2 kilowatt hours out of this thing. So, weve got a battery. But now we need a way to convert the 12V DC into the 120V AC that her stuff uses. Thats what inverters are for! These devices will boost the voltage and continually invert the phase up and down to create A/C current from a DC source. If youre running electronics, you definitely want a pure sine wave inverter. This will replicate the sine wave pattern as seen in true A/C power. Cheaper inverters will simply throw spikes up and down, which many modern power supplies can tolerate, but which probably isnt great for everything. In choosing an inverter, we went extraordinarily overboard. I basically combed through reviews for my mom on Amazon, and while there was a much cheaper inverter that would have done the trick, it had some lackluster reviews indicating it might overheat, so we went with this enormous beast. You never know, it might truly come in handy someday. And we also need a way to charge this battery. For that, well use an automatic car battery charger that my parents already had. This is a relatively slow charger, only putting out 6 amps, but thats 72 watts and will be enough to recharge this battery from empty in 16 hours or so. If there were an extended power outage, the charger could be run from the generator overnight. But having a slow charger is probably a good thing. See, you do have to worry about hydrogen production when the battery is being charged. Ordinarily very little hydrogen is produced, in fact ideally close to none should be produced and the bulk of hydrogen would come from a battery being overcharged, which this automatic charger should prevent from occuring. But, even if it were to overcharge the battery, the amount of hydrogen generated is directly dependent on the amount of current being pushed into the battery. I ran the numbers and determined that in order for hydrogen to reach dangerous levels in this room with 6 amps of charge current, it would require about a month of overcharging. So clearly, thats not a concern. However, I did alter course for safety--I was planning on situating the battery on a small cart, but its partially enclosed top could trap hydrogen and potentially create a small explosion risk. So I went to work setting things up. This battery has threaded studs to mount cables to in addition to standard lugs. Well use the studs with the supplied cables from the inverter, but I did add a large fuse for short-circuit protection. The inverter could theoretically pull 125 amps continuously (though the battery could not sustain that for very long) so I looked for a fuse above that rating. Now, Im only adding this for protection from a short circuit. The inverter has built-in protections of its own, but in case something metal should get lodged behind the inverter, or some other stupid thing causes a dead short, those 600+ cranking amps need something to stop them. But then, I added this little guy. This is a battery level monitor and voltage indicator. This is really neat, it can support different battery chemistries and voltages, but came preconfigured for a 12v lead acid battery. Now its showing that percentage based on the batterys voltage reading. This will give you a relatively good indication of charge, but it means that if theres a load on the battery, thus dropping its voltage, the reading also drops. Additionally, whenever the battery is being charged, the reading will jump to 100%, as the charger gives the battery a higher voltage when charging. However, it will still serve as a useful indicator, as after its initial drop, that percentage will steadily drop as it discharges. Best of all, pressing the button turns on the backlight, and pressing it again will change to an actual voltage reading. The specs on this thing indicate that it draws 112 microamps when idle. Thats practically negligible, and will perhaps cause the battery to lose 1% of charge over a few months. Youll also notice that this is connected straight across the battery. It would be wise to fuse this as well, however its fairly likely that there is a fuse on its circuit board somewhere (even if its just a resistor or something thats not supposed to be a fuse) and even if there wasnt one, these thin wires would quickly melt in a dead short scenario. Thus, Im not worried about it. So now, this setup is pretty much done. After putting on the charger long enough for it to switch to float charging mode, I lugged the battery and inverter down to her workstation. I also finally used a kill-a-watt to determine the actual draw of her workstation. Hopefully its 100 watts or less. Amazingly, everything here only draws around 52 to 55 watts! It occasionally spikes to 70 watts, but even if we take that as a worst-case figure (plus this will account for the 10 to 15% loss in the conversion from the inverter), this battery will now easily pass 12 hours of backup time, and with an average of 4 and a half to 5 amps being drawn from the battery, it may be even more. This extra capacity also means the battery wont be as deeply cycled in a day, which will prolong its useful life. To use this is really simple. Everything is already plugged into a small uninterruptible power supply, but this is really small and can only realistically provide 20 minutes of power, maybe an hour if we got super lucky. However, it means that in the event of a power failure, everything is seamless. If the power goes out, everything in her setup will remain powered on. To switch to the large backup supply, all you need to do is unplug the power cord of the UPS from the wall, and plug it into one of the outlets on the inverter. After you switch the inverter on, the UPS will say hey, that power looks OK, and it switches back to what it thinks is normal AC power. At this point, the entire setup is running solely from the large battery. This should provide at least a full days work of backup power, and possibly 2 if the slow drain boosts the batterys capacity up to 1.2 kilowatt hours. When the power comes back, just switch off the inverter. The UPS will kick back into action briefly, but after plugging it into the wall, it will be on true AC power again. Then, just grab the car battery charger, hook it up, and after an overnight charge the battery will be full again. If theres a prolonged power outage, the battery charger could theoretically become an indirect power source for the inverter, using the battery itself as a large buffer or ballast. The dirty energy coming from the generator would be converted to DC power, and when the inverter switches it back to AC, it will be clean as a whistle. This charger might even be enough, as 6 amps works out to 72 watts. However, it would be pretty close. A larger battery charger might be desired for this purpose. But using this with a generator isnt really the point. If that were the point, then a wiser investment is a generator with a built-in inverter, which can safely power electronics. Rather, the goal of this setup is to provide immediate, easy, and convenient backup power that will last at least a day. For most power outages, this battery will be all thats needed to get my mom through it. One last thing before I sign off--this brass lug on the inverter should be grounded. Right now, when on battery power, none of this equipment has a connection to earth. This isnt necessarily an abhorrently dangerously scenario, but to be safe a ground lead should be attached here. We could attach a lead to the ground wire inside this electrical box, or we could use an adapter like this. Whichever you choose, make sure it actually has a good ground connection. Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed the video! Lead-acid battery technology may be wicked old, but it has some compelling applications such as this. But remember, this battery wont last many cycles. It doesnt have to, as it will probably only get a discharge a few times a year if that, but if you want to regularly charge and discharge a lead-acid battery for energy storage, you want to choose a better battery. Golf cart batteries, which are usually 6 volts and thus require a pair to be wired in series to get 12V, are a good start. The solar power community seems to favor Trojan batteries for longevity. Im planning on making some videos analyzing the costs and lifespan of deep cycle lead acid batteries versus lithium ion for stationary energy storage, because the winner may be less obvious than it seems. But for now, thank you to everyone who supports this channel on Patreon, especially the fine folks who have been scrolling up your screen.

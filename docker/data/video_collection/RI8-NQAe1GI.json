    "transcript": "This is my new editing PC or what will be my new editing PC We've got a lot of components here and I've kind of just meshed stuff together in in all honesty i don't even know if this stuff is going to fit in the case we chose and that's because this p300a here is extremely compact and that's the way i like my mid-towers This build will be utilizing the latest Intel CPUs namely the Core i9-12900k i'm very interested to see how the \"P\" and \"E\" cores fare for an editing rig honestly a lot of this is going to be experimental because i've seen how this chip performs i've watched other reviews but i haven't actually tested anything myself yet so this will be more or less a long-term experiment if i decide that these are not worth the transition from my 5950x rig which i'm currently using to edit videos with i will switch back because why would i do that to myself many brands stepped up for this project big thanks to them Asus stepped up they sent a beastly z690 motherboard again this is one of the components i'm not sure it's even going to fit in our case but we'll find out we also have RAM (PC Memory) from Corsair of course this is important because we're going to be using DDR5 now not DDR4 it sounds very weird saying DDR5 because it's saying DDR4 for so long but these two kits here these are 16GB DIMMs a piece so we're gonna have 64GB in total at a frequency of 5200mhz yeah... welcome to DDR5 we've also got an mp600 Pro for some lightning fast uh Reads and Writes we're gonna want you know to have a really fast system and having a fast storage drive is part of that i already mentioned the case the p300a this is the airflow focused version of the original Phanteks p300 which I've built in several times and do thoroughly enjoy we have a Sea-sonic Focus Gold 850 Watt power supply I like this one because it's compact it's not too large and in our smaller mid-tower that's going to really come in handy I am recycling an RTX 2080 Ti because why not you know I'm using a 3080 or 3080Ti in my rig right now but uh i like 2080Ti's as well look you know Ampere's great and all but it's just it's kind of difficult to find any up your card for a decent price so stepping back into Touring for the time being I have no problem doing that and then I purchased myself an SE-226-XT yeah 226-XT this is an ID Cooling cooler here and this is supposed to support the latest Intel CPUs so we'll see if that's actually the case or not I'm assuming it is but i've never worked with ID Cooling's components before and I figured why not now would be the time to experiment like the entire build essentially is one big experiment and lastly this one would not be possible without our video sponsor VIP SCD-Key I've been using their Windows 10 Pro OEM keys for all of my latest builds it doesn't make sense to deal with the watermark when it only costs around $10 bucks or so with the use of our promo code to get rid of that and enable full customization on Windows 10. This will even give you the ability to upgrade to Windows 11 for free if you're interested our limited time discount code for this video is GSVIP and it'll give you a whopping 35% discount for a limited time so jump on it while you can that'll bring the price to under $13 for a legit key that will activate your OS you can also use this code for Office 2021 and get the same 35% discount bringing your price to around $40 US dollars we'll show you how to activate using one of these keys later in the video but for now it's time to assemble I think we're just gonna do a build montage we've done plenty of \"How to Build your PC Guides\" lately so uh let's just have fun with this one here we go now first things first I know I showed you b-roll . Of a legit Core i9 12900 k this is a consumer grade sku and you can see here I've got an engineering sample this was sent by Asus for this build and we will be using this for my rig only because I don't want to use the consumer SKU in case i want to do some independent testing with a separate board separate platform so this is the one that's going in my rig first things first let's get this ROG Hero z690 board out of the box this thing looks so freaking smexy my oh my I could not have designed a fancier motherboard this thing it's also very heavy it's kind of it's kind of awkward holding it like this one of the coolest features i think it's a very simple mechanism but I think that it's much needed especially with these beefier boards a quick release button for the top PCIe slot check this out you push this down and it pulls back the retention clip for that uh uppermost 16 lane slot that is just that's just freaking brilliant you know sometimes it's difficult to get to these because you've got you know cards with thick back plates or what have you maybe a really beefy air cooler you just push this button and boom that clip slides back I love that hey pepsi hey hey what are you doing what are you doing what no no no that's that's expensive please please no so we're gonna lift this socket lever it is much larger this time around pull back on the oh it opens this way okay interesting this is all uh this is all new to me we're gonna drop the CPU in nice and gently and then we can tighten everything back down this is maybe I'm maybe I'm not doing this correctly okay that that didn't sound very good get up will you just there we go that was a bit more problematic than usual can already tell this mirror is going to be a fingerprint freaking magnet now let's tackle DDR5 I really like that these vengeance modules from Corsair are very sleek I love the design and they're low profile as well not that we're gonna have any interference anyway from our CPU cooler but still I just i like this design overall one two three and four oh yeah 64 gigs of DDR5 goodness right here folks next on the list is our mp600 Pro this is a one terabyte nvme module with super fast Reads and Writes I think we're going to keep the heatsink on here as well we could go with the motherboard heatsink but this one looks a bit more functional so we'll just take this off I think there's an m.2 slot under here i might be wrong nope there isn't one oh there is it's just uh it's bat it's backwards is this even gonna oh it will work okay yeah it's just gonna have an upside down that kind of sucks maybe i can flip around the cooler oh hold up look what i found in the box an m.2 card this is pretty sweet you can actually fit like yeah it depends on the kind of card maybe up to four nvmes in here and then they all link through the pci interface which is super cool i actually think we can still use this with a single one I might be wrong and i might look like a total dummy here in this video but uh I'd prefer to just um yeah use this it'll look cool to take up some extra space in our build as well moving on then with mounting gear taken care of we can go ahead and apply our thermal compound now this is a larger IHS than we're used to from conventional desktop grade Intel stuff so i'm just gonna do a bit well that's that's probably a bit too much whatever that's okay rage in the comments we're gonna get this cooler installed it should just sit like so they say this cooler's got a TDP of 220 watts so we gonna find that out because uh well if it can cool modern Intel chips can pretty much handle anything i think we're about good to go there mounting pressure is critical for applications like these and with the fan taken care of we can now get this motherboard in the case easy does it this by the way is much easier with your case laying flat this just looks uh looks better on video so it's for the fans and oh gosh oh yeah this is going to be one clean looking sleek black build I caved I laid the case flat that didn't feel right just makes a lot more sense especially when you've got a heavy CPU cooler like this it's going to kind of pull everything from the top down you're not going to get a good alignment the first time with the case standing up so yeah just just be smart now we can take care of case cabling this includes but it's not limited to USB 3.0 front IO and the HD Audio cable which is somewhere here it is all right get yourself over here is that an HD Audio header aafp i don't know i mean it looks like it'll fit yeah i mean . That fits but I don't i don't think that's i don't think that's HD Audio I'm gonna have to pull out the manual ah-ha it is AAFP there's just an extra two pins tacked off to the right side of this and i'm not really sure why this is the face i make when i'm intently working next we did install our 850 focus power supply from Seasonic you can see it's much more compact than a typical 850 watt power supply which is nice again we don't have a lot of room in the basement of our p300a the other thing is we've kitted this uh powers play out with some cable mod cables these are fully sleeved they're custom so they wire directly into this modular unit and the mint green color you're probably thinking right why are you doing mint green everything else in here is black well there are some subtle mint green accents in our MSI Ventus 2080 ti so i think it'll mesh quite nicely you can see with our hard drive cage oriented this way which allows for front loading it's a bit unorthodox you get extra space here for cable management but that sacrifices a bit of PSU clearance so that's another reason why again it's very important to have a more compact unit for this case you can load things in here from the right side and uh oh yeah this is this is nice and snug right here so we'll just tighten her on down and get to work on cable management i'll be right back 2000 years later and would you check this out she cleans up so nicely there's tons of cable management space in these p300 chassis one of the reasons why i like them so much but uh yeah wow this is a thing of beauty back here unfortunately it won't be seen but for me it's peace of mind i'm installing a few extra fans because well why not we need the extra airflow we're probably gonna need it because this Intel chip i'm sure will run quite hot and we've got a perforated front panel so it'd be a waste not to nice there we go at this point just a couple more things to tackle the graphics card obviously and our expansion drive thing m.2 card whatever this is again i don't even know if it's gonna work i've never used one of these before so i definitely sound nubish right now but uh we'll give it a shot worst case we can always swap in the m.2 into the motherboard it will still be accessible with that cpu cooler installed so let's get these in there shouldn't be too difficult so in goes the 2080 Ti looking mighty fine if i do say so myself and you can see we've got a few mint green accents hence the custom sleeve cables we're going with here i can get this stupid thing to slot in there we go oh yeah looking nice we'll tighten things up and we'll get this expansion card in here i kind of sort of underestimated pcie slot spacing this is a bit closer to the graphics card than i would have initially liked i'll have to check temps and just see how uh how cataclysmic it's going to be i imagine it's not going to be the end of the world but it is a bit close for my liking now there is another slot a falling slot at the bottom that looks like it's only an eight lane slot and even then i'm not even sure if we're gonna have access to all eight lanes uh but i'm gonna use that for the capture car that i'm gonna put in here i have to bring that in from my other system we'll connect supplemental PCIe power cables we should just slot right in and they are bridged so these cables will kind of stay nice and neat and tidy all the way back into the power supply looks very clean from this side and would you look at that this build really turned out quite nice and considering how inexpensive this p300 is it just goes to show you that when a case is well built regardless of its price point you can make it work even with expensive hardware i'm really glad in hindsight i decided to build in this case i've had really good experiences again with the p300 and the fact that this one is more airflow oriented there's nothing wrong with that we are going to be somewhat limited i imagine on the cooling side of things for our 12-900k it's the only thing i'm slightly worried about but for now the next big step is to attempt to power the system on we need to make sure that it posts and from there we can install windows and get some of our important programs loaded let's try our luck let's see power on at the rear looks pretty good yeah looks nice so far hey there it is okay so we can go ahead and slide this left side panel back on i left the oh the peel the plastic peel on because i wanted to do the honors after oh my gosh i look really silly trying to get this thing on holy just just go there we go all right great and it's is it on yeah it is okay cool i wanted to wait and do the plastic peel after the system posted so let's do that now and can i just say this little infinity mirror thing we got going on here with the ROG motherboard and this rear exhaust fan this is just sick and the fact that you can see the subtle glow from these equal fans through the front panel is just but before we can do anything else syncing up RGB again downloading those important programs that we need we need to install Windows 10 and to do that we're going to need a thumb drive like this connected to another pc a friend's laptop basically anything they connect to the internet and that does have a USb type A or C port and they're going to want to download the Windows Media Creation Tool that will be linked in this video's description run through the prompts select the thumb drive as the installation destination and then let it work its magic then when the drive is safely removed you want to connect it to the new system the one that doesn't already have an Operating System on it i like to connect to a USB port at the back of the motherboard because sometimes the ports up front can act a bit finicky now to get to this screen here all you should really need to do is simply power the system on if there are no other boot images on any of the other drives connected to your build the system should automatically boot into this bootable media if it doesn't you can hop into your BIOS and select the Boot tab and then designate which drive you want to boot into again it should be your USB drive now we can click next and click install now now at this point we could enter our product key we could go ahead and buy one from our sponsor ahead of time but i like to do this after the fact so i click i don't have a product key by the way as it is Windows 10 is technically free you shouldn't need to activate to be able to use it again you'll just have to deal with the watermark and a few other limitations i think the $10 or so dollars though is worth it we have Windows 10 pro at least that's the key we'll be buying for this operating system so we need to make sure that we install the Pro version you can't buy a home version and then activate on a Pro OS sometimes it'll update for you automatically sometimes it won't though and then i get emails saying hey i bought a code it doesn't work well it's probably because you purchased a key for the wrong version of Windows 10. so make sure you pay attention to this we're going to be installing Pro we'll go ahead and click next so we can accept these license terms and then we'll click next now this part is important you want to click custom install this will give us a choice of where we want to install Windows 10. obviously we only have one drive connected to this system but if you have multiple drives connected in yours make sure you select the correct drive typically you want this to be the fastest drive in your build and this one here obviously we just have an mp600 Pro and that makes it pretty easy for us we'll go ahead and click next and now we'll sit back uh wait shouldn't have done that uh-oh uh okay well uh we're off to a great start eh i suppose what we can try swapping in this uh legit 12900k this is the one that Intel sent now the engineering sample that is in the rig currently i thought that was a 12900k it's actually a 12700k that Asus sent maybe that's why we're having these issues i know Secure Boot is a thing and we did enable it then we got that blue screen i'm not sure what's going on this might just be uh you know early growing pains with Alder Lake but uh we'll give it a shot we have nothing to lose a few moments later aha i think it was this swapping out the CPUs really didn't change anything we still ran into that issue but swapping this out fixed it no more blue screens when trying to install Windows so let's go ahead and get on with it now once Windows has installed you'll be greeted with this screen here i'm not going to hold your hand and walk through these prompts they're fairly self-explanatory i just tell Windows what you want enabled what you want disabled you can always change things later now when you're on your home screen you might notice a few things first off the Windows Activation logo might be there it might not be it usually takes a few cycles for this to show up either way you can confirm whether or not Windows is activated by hopping into your settings panel and you can see here in the activation tab that windows is not activated no key was found on the device we're going to change this right now first you'll want to click the top link in this video's description it should send you to this page here where you can purchase a Windows 10 Pro OEM key now an important point about oem keys is that they often lock to the hardware with which they are activated so if you have a motherboard in your system that you swap out later on and it was previously activated you might lose uh the activation status with windows and that's just a function of OEM keys one of the reasons why these are significantly cheaper than retail keys i find that this is still worth it because unless you're swapping motherboards or swapping some other vital component every other week you'll still save tons of money that's why i still use them for my personal rigs from here we can click buy now and this part is super important to see the promo code window here you'll want to type in gsvip that is a special promo code that will give you 35% off for this time period now this will drop back down to roughly 20% after a good while so make sure that you snag one of these ahead of time if you expect to be building a pc soon go ahead and click apply and you'll see that that will bring our total down by almost $7 just $12.84 total from here we can click submit order and i like to pay via Paypal you know this is secure this purchase will take a few seconds if you see a white screen for a while don't fret just let it play out once you get to this page here you see the order has successfully been completed you've got your order number and then you can click on the user center button or heck if you just hang out it'll take you straight there and you can click view code you see i've been all these here i've purchased so many of them i use them for again all of my builds but click this button right here it says view keys / codes and that should take you to where you can get it click get key and boom there it is obviously i want to blur it out because i want to use this for my personal rig but this right here is what we want to copy so highlight this and then we'll swing back over to our new build and click change product key then it's as straightforward as typing in the activation code then click next you might need to wait a minute or two while the key is validated and look at that we can click activate and shortly after this the watermark should disappear after the bottom right hand side of the screen and in the activation window we should see that Windows 10 Pro has been activated there we go and that's it it's literally that simple i want to thank VIP-SCDKey for sponsoring this video and providing us with this information allowing us to have a chance to show folks how easy it is to install windows and you need an operating system for a pc to function like this and Windows 10 just happens to be the most common people have it moving onto Windows 11 by the way and i'm just not interested in making the swap anytime soon unless i'm forced to at some point which i'm sure will happen i think Windows 10 is just fine i'm not interested in uh beta testing so to speak a very new Operating System with a different layout than i'm used to as well you can see we've calibrated the fans here the colors look quite nice i think the white in the fans and then we've got some white and the motherboard that's all i wanted was just some sort of illumination so that we can see the subtle mint green uh in these cables as well as the card because everything else in here is pretty much blacked out the system is extremely quiet at idle we've set the fan curves appropriately and i've got my Elgato 4k60 capture card in here for some sweet footage when we're filming from the desk setup so with that if you want to find any of the components thrown into this build, be sure to check the video description it's all going to be down there you might have a bit of trouble finding a 12-900k for a decent price right out of the gate but just be a bit patient i think that they will uh the stock will sort of kind of level itself out depends i don't know the 12-900k is about 10 faster than the 12-700k which i think is a much better value chip so if you can't buy a 12900k consider the 12700 even the 12600k the Core i5 looks to be pretty appealing as well but i think the 12700k is a sweet spot we'll be sure to run some tests and follow up with you guys in a few weeks with our results so uh yeah parts in the description if you guys enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up consider subscribing (please <3)and i'll catch you in the next one again big thanks to VIPSCDKey for sponsoring this video i will catch you in the next one my name is Greg, Thanks for learning with me!

    "transcript": "this is my cat neck and as per viewer request in today's video we have him choose the parts for a gaming PC which went well but first a word from today's video sponsor today's video is sponsored by PayPal honey apparently PayPal owns honey who knew honey is like a viscous liquid that sticks to many promo codes while shopping on the internet and like most viscous liquids honey is deliciously useful when it comes to finding many promo codes on your favorite shopping websites I find that Honey's viscosity works the best at attracting promo codes while buying PCS from major PC manufacturers all you do is get honey and when you're checking out you do some honey and it'll look for the best coupons it can find to maybe save you some money on your card so add honey to your browser today at joinhoney.com forward slash doll and then get some free honey thank you very much honey for sponsoring today's video thank you yeah come inside now while Neko figures out what thing in the office smells the best the premise for today's video is very simple I'm gonna give Neko two options per component category one good and one less good after which I'll assemble the resulting Abomination and see how it runs so with that let's figure out how to get a cat to choose between two things now the first choice is going to be between the awesome Intel i5 12400f and the significantly less powerful AMD Athlon 200 GE uh so yeah naked Chan are you ready thank you okay Nicky chain oh I mean does that constitute as a choice or just random movement well which one do you want thank you change lie down okay there we go I mean I guess we're using the Intel i5 12 400f but that first success if you could call it that lulled us into a false sense of security so now that Nick was chosen an Intel CPU next he needs to choose the cooler so the choice is between the loser plastic Cod piece stock Intel cooler and this which is a much better air cooler the pure rock to FX it comes with RGB so you know it's gonna be better okay naked Chan are you ready CPU cool around okay so which one use the purebox and after several attempts at hurting a cat all nickel wanted to do was look behind these two doors which gave me a great idea so apparently all Neko wants to do is go into these two rooms so we've decided to make it so that the room he goes into is the choice so in door number one we have be quiet air cooler and door number two we have loser Intel stock cooler on the floor with a whole bunch of cables so next chance which will you choose Okay negative which will you choose now the next decision is going to be extremely important because it may lead to Neko being disowned by me he's gonna have to choose between proper dual Channel RAM and single Channel Ram Neko are you ready for this kind of pressure veggie so in door number one we have dual Channel RAM and in door number two we've got single Channel Ram so Nicki Chan you gotta choose real carefully here buddy yeah what do you want to do so we can get him to do one too we're gonna we can get him to do one at a time like one selection has to be different each time oh Nico okay so how are we gonna have him choose around oh do you know what we do know about it we've closed the doors get him interested in it again a few moments later now closing the doors may have got Nick or interested again but it led to some very poor life decisions on his part Decor really wants the single Channel Ram do you like single Channel Ram we even gave Nico a chance to reconsider but after a quick debate he went back to the single Channel RAM and with that massive disappointment I guess we've got to carry on next up he gets to choose the graphics card and he's got a pretty interesting choice because he gets to choose between a gt730 I didn't use a gt710 because I couldn't find one and this is like a gt710 but with Fiddy in the name so I don't know I feel like that's better and then his other choice is gonna be much better it's an RX 6600 door number one we've got the gt730 and in door number two we've got the RX 6600 so nekochan how will you choose make a chain what how does he know he goes for the bad one every time so Neko what do you have to say about your terrible Life Choices so far oh no put me down yeah I don't know man I'm just I'm so disappointed in nickel look at that selection okay but next up he gets to choose the power supply and he has to choose between this absolute Behemoth dark power 12 which is it's basically like the Tom Hanks of power supplies and his other option is gonna be the cheapest power supply I could find on Amazon like two years ago and this is a 500 watt cool Max unit which is really shockingly light I don't know this is such a dodgy power supply but anyway I'm excited to see Neko choose the dodgy power supply which will you choose foreign what did you choose wow that is an impressive pile nicochan but next up we have storage so he's gonna get to choose between this pcie Gen 4 and vme drive and some hard drive I found lying around so in door number one we have random hard drive I found lying around and in door number two we have nvme Drive I think Nick was very excited about picking this one oh there we go finally in terms of cases Neko gets to choose between this the huge Corsair 5000 T RGB or uh the one that he's already taken a liking to the be quiet 500 DX yes the 500 DX oh thank you John are you ready for this one he doesn't know in door number one we have big ass corsaircase and in door number two we have smaller be quiet case nickel are you ready it looks like we have a winner and after getting all of his Parts together it seemed like Neko was quite happy with his choices which means I've got to get the building real tuckered out so he's gonna go have a nap and when I finish building the system we'll bring him back and show him his creation Now straight off the bat I have a little bit of a concern about neko's choices here he happened to choose the biggest case in the world with this power supply which has very short power cables so I'm hoping we can figure it out but yeah let's get started come on now the motherboard is the one thing I didn't let Neko choose because I didn't have many other options and he kind of chose it through the CPU choice anyway so I feel like it counts uh either way this is a gigabyte z690 udax ddr4 board foreign I'm so disappointed in you oh that is some good foe now Corsair sent this 5000 T over for a video ages ago and I'm sure this was exactly the kind of build they had in mind for this very expensive case especially considering that there's a gt730 involved but anyway let's let's finish off neko's creation oh it's really heavy hole okay it's looking pretty good although now comes the most challenging part we need to hope that the power cables of this power supply are actually going to be able to reach stuff in this case so uh yeah wish me luck wow this is such a shocking little power supply it's so light it feels like there's nothing in it all we really need to worry about is the motherboard power which no that's not even close okay let's try another way maybe we can be complete Savages about it and try it up through here oh no way that actually works well I I guess it's got a nice rustic vibe to it so with that let's try the CPU power yeah there is that's not gonna reach even from the front that that is not even almost gonna reach so unfortunately for the CPU power we're we're gonna have to use an extension oh yes there we go now it fits easily foreign to finish off neko's Majestic creation [__] you're so much more interested last time than you want to see but once Anna put him on top of the system he slowly started warming to it and I guess with that it's time to finally see how his creation runs oh it's a nice power button hey look at that so much light happening but my excitement at the fancy RGB was short-lived because unfortunately I wasn't getting a video signal out which made me think the graphics card may have been broken yeah that red LED that it stuck on that's the GPU be broken LED so I'm I'm sorry nickel but I I'm gonna have to change this out for a different graphics card unfortunately five minutes later hey would you look at that I happen to have another gt730 lying around so hopefully this one works it does yay wow clearly starting out at 1080p was a mistake even with everything else on low settings we are barely getting 24 frames per second out of this system so yeah it's performing really rough although Neko clearly knew what he was doing the graphics card is such a bottleneck in the system that the terrible Ram configuration doesn't even get a chance to be a problem Neko is a real talented system builder it seems but with that let's drop the resolution to 720p and see if we can get a playable result out of the system okay that is way better we're over 30 frames per second so it's kind of in the ballpark of being playable it doesn't look great but fine you know this is this is usable and the temperatures are pretty good Neko understood that he didn't need to waste any money on a fancy cooler because the 12400f wasn't going to be doing that much in the system with the gt730s uh let's try one more game oh wow that feels really weird that's a that's an unusually bad CS go experience because it's not just like a low frame rate but there's like there's like a rubber banding to it wow that's a lot better we're actually above the 40s now we we briefly saw 50 frames per second there okay so what do we learn in today's video well if you let a cat choose your PC components you basically end up with one of those eBay fortnite RGB gaming PCs that are designed to scam kids out of their parents money anyway that brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching if you enjoyed it consider watching another one and until the next video bye thank you",

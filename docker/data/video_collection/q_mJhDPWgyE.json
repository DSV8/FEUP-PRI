    "transcript": "Well hey i know. You love mac tips so here's ten more you've probably, never used this video is sponsored by, dashlane: the best password manager and digital wallet around You, need, proof i've been a paid user since before they Ever thought to sponsor the channel visit dashlane.com slash snazzy labs to try it out for free today Tip number one in mac os you somebody a later you have the ability to batch or Mass edit filenames in finder and it's super handy So in this folder i've got a bunch of photos that i took in israel last Year but beyond being in the folder called tel aviv the filenames themselves are just a Cryptic name that my camera spit out and they're, not very easily searchable or identifiable now of course i could change the name of one of these files By adding, israel to the beginning but that's not very efficient and i have several hundred. Photos Well i can select all and then right-click and then go down to where it says rename 150 for items and there are multiple options for me to batch edit these file names i Can either change dsc to israel or something, along those lines so i get a File like this or i can actually make a brand, new, series so i can call it tel-aviv deep and then Start the series with number one and go up sequentially from there and you'll see i've got one two three four five seven eight nine Ten, and i've got this very very handy, easily digestible file format that's very easily searchable Tip number two have you Ever been watching or listening to something on your mac and notice that one full volume jump is a little bit more than you'd like Perhaps it's a little too louder maybe the very lowest volume setting is still too loud, well if you hold down shift option And then click your volume keys you can Move the volume slider in increments of one quarter this is awesome for slight micro adjustments or just barely Listening to audio through, your mac tip number three if you've ever tried to drag a window in the background around You, probably noticed that as soon as you. Click it it becomes the foreground window Which isn't always what you want, well if you are on the foreground window You can, actually hold, down the command key as you drag the background window And it won't become the foreground window it just stays in the background. Pretty handy, little tip Tip number for i really, like, some of the window Snapping functions built into recent versions of windows and mac os just seems behind in that regard now. Yes there are applications Like, better snap tool that allow you to do your window management A little bit better but there is at least one slightly rudimentary way? To, snap panes in mac os 10. And that is if you before you click the green Fullscreen, button, click it and hold down and then you can Actually drag it to the left or right side of the screen if you drag it to the left side it finds itself Straight down the middle of our screen and then i can Either just work over here or find a second app to go on the other half of the screen you can actually Drag and resize, these panes and no it's not as powerful as windows 10 snapping and you are still in full-screen, mode which is a little irritating so if you Want to go back to the finder you're, gonna have to jump out that way but it does work and i do use it occasionally? Tip number, five it's laurel, by the way? If you've ever forced touched on a word on one of the recent mac books you'll have noticed that this little Handy, little pop-up Bar comes up and it defines the word that you've selected it'll will look for it on wikipedia if it's the name of a Person or an actor they'll show, up with their movies or their music and itunes you'll find web videos about it you can rent the movie directly from the tab it's it's pretty cool, and Unfortunately on an imac or at least on an older mac that doesn't have a force touch trackpad It doesn't seem like you can, do it but actually you can if you Highlight your cursor over the word and then press ctrl, command d that little pop-up bar will come up No it's not as handy as force touching but, hey it's something Tip number six, okay this one is cool, we've all heard of remote desktop, software like teamviewer or gotomeeting, where you can Screen share your screen with Someone else or you can even control their desktop But a lot of people don't know that that's already built in natively to mac os10 on every single mac It's called screen sharing and you Do have to find it in spotlight it's not in the applications folder but once you enter the app you can Either type the ip address of the computer with a much easier way is to type the apple, id of the account? Associated that's logged into that computer So if i want to log in to my other computer here in the office i just i my, own apple Id and all of my, mac's logged into, my apple, id will get the notification? Or you can type in the apple Id of someone halfway across the world and they'll get a notification, asking if you can See and share and control their screen so it's a great way to, do tech support, when you don't Want to have to deal with stuff over the phone or you, don't wanna have to facetime telling them what to do you just do it yourself or a really fun thing that you can, do Is there's actually microphone functionality built in so not only can you see and control their desktop you can Actually talk over your eyesight camera microphone it's great for netflix and long, distance chill Tip number seven i always, feel, like this is one that most people know, but then i look at People's menu bars and they're cluttered to the brim with icons a lot of people don't know That you can, rearrange the icons By holding down the command key and then dragging the icon to wherever you want and a lot of them especially System icons can be removed entirely if i'm always connected to ethernet and don't need wi-fi i can hold down command Drag it off the menu bar let go and it disappears now You, can't, do that with all third-party icons a lot of them these Little applets especially you need to disable them from within the app Themselves but it's a great little way to rearrange stuff to move it around, and just clean up Your status bar tip number eight i feel like, most people know. That if you right-click the toolbar in a finder window You can, customize the toolbar really entirely in control, what icons are in your main finder windows if you Want more stuff if you need less stuff it's pretty handy but what a lot of people don't know Is that you can, drag files or folders into here as well now let's say i hold down the command key and drag this tel-aviv file and there you go every time i click it a tel-aviv Folder is going to open now? You, may be thinking Well that's stupid just drag it into the sidebar that's always Permanently there it's clearly designed for that and that's probably true but you can, also drag, oh? By the way to get rid of these you hold down the command key and then you just drag it away but you can Also, drag applications into here so let's draw A drag rod digger, which is an application that i use a lot into the tool, bar here now When i click it roger will open that's pretty cool, but what you? Also, do is let's say i'm in the tel-aviv folder i've got raphael i can just drag the file right onto the little guy And it'll open the application with the file in full, view it's really really handy You've got commonly used applications that you want in your menu bar Number nine have you Ever used an application that for whatever reason doesn't have shortcuts programmed for some of the menu bar items you Use it's super annoying let's take the new, firefox quantum for example i love this, browser it's way, better than chrome suck at Chrome users but the problem is is that there are two, ways to view the history When you? do shift command h Which is the normal history shortcut it just pops up this little sidebar but sometimes i want to see the full history window The problem is is that for whatever reason there isn't a shortcut available you can see there's no shortcut over here but That's not a problem because, we can, create our own? if i go into, system preferences and click Keyboard and then click the shortcuts tab and then app shortcuts i can Add a new application specific shortcut so you can have to do in all applications if you Want it but no i just want this in firefox Now you need? to type the Menu title name of the item that you're trying to engage so this one is show all history and you have to type it exactly As it appears This, movie you have to type it with all capitals if there's periods Like this one for example clear recent history you have to do dot dot dot at the end type it exactly as it appears and Then you give it a New shortcut so instead of shift command h let's do shift command ok i? Press add and then now in firefox when i press shift command ok the full History window. Opens, and we can, even see here that show all history now has a programmed hotkey very handy Number 10 icloud keychain access saves every wi-fi network Password you've ever logged into on any of your devices And if you forget one all you have to do is enter the app called keychain access which is in the utilities section of your applications folder Click local items and then find the network or the name of the network that you need to remember the password for Let's say i need the golden crown, wi-fi Password, which was a hotel i stayed at in israel i click copy, password to clipboard i type in my admin Password and it's a copy to the clipboard and i can paste it and holy bugs gold in 2014 There's the password now icloud keychain can, also sync your login Credentials for regular websites but it's sax when compared to dashed line the best password manager and digital wallet on the net - lane not only helps you generate strong passwords and store them securely but it automatically logs you into the websites that you visit The world was freaking out last week when twitter leaked a bunch of passwords online but i wasn't worried Because unlike most people who Use a single password for everything i had used - lane to create and store a password Specific to my twitter account so when they leaked all i had to do was go into twitter change My, password and continue on with the rest of my, day in fact they're amazing Password changer tool, allows you to click one button and - lane does the rest of the work for you They, log in to your account it changed your Password all without you having to move a muscle They've got killer mobile apps for both ios and android and they even support autofill, not just in the web browser but Also in supported third-party applications as, well - lines free for one device so you have no Excuse not to try it but when you do decide to upgrade to - lean premium use the coupon code Snazzy, labs at checkout to save an extra 10% Please give dashlane a shot not just because by doing so you'll help my Channel but because - lean is genuinely awesome and i love it you'll be kicking yourself for not having tried it earlier i'm quinn And snazzy laughs thank you so much for watching if you, enjoyed this video you know, what to do if you didn't enjoy this Well that other button seems to work, okay - please check out, my other mac tips videos they're, awesome you'll enjoy Them most importantly and as always stay snazzy",

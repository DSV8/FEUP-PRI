    "transcript": "computex is one of the biggest Tech conferences of the year it's my first time going and I'm very excited to be here although the event is a bit different to what I was expecting there seems to be two distinct sides to computex the first one is the Glamorous side which I use the word glamorous trying real hard not to dry heave over it but you know it's it's the part we normally see all of the fancy new product announcements crazy custom builds and a whole bunch of ladies carrying RAM for some reason but then there's the equally massive random crap side which you don't normally get to see there's so many booths showing off like McDonald's Plastics and server rack mounting brackets and a mouse shaped like a like a lady Garden I I almost feel like I need to censor that to be honest so in today's video we're gonna have a look at both sides of computers now with copy text not all the companies have their presentations at the massive exhibition Hall a bunch of them present in hotel rooms scattered across Taipei so we decided to start our journey at the Corsair Suite who very kindly flew us out and housed us at computex Corsair announced a new IQ ecosystem with a new Hub and connector that can carry data and power and that combined with Daisy chainable fans means you can connect a whole bunch of RGB crap up with very few cables which has the added benefit of you only needing to screw one of three fans down look at that so I'm sure this will all add up to much less cable shouting which is good now unfortunately it does use a proprietary connector but considering what it's doing I guess it makes sense and Corsair was saying that these cables can carry an obscene amount of power Corsair also announced some new Hydro X stuff with this IQ integration which looks awesome but I'm more excited about the fancy new Dom Platt with interchangeable tops you can go between like an RGB bit or a heatsink or you can 3D print your own design which is a really good idea and with that thanks again Corsair for sending us over to computex next we meandered over to the Kingston Booth who had quite the presentation they spent a while showing off their very impressive looking server memory configurations that is a lot of RAM and aside from dozens of USB drives SD cards and these little guys they also showed off their new Fury Ram in a crazy gaming build they also had this cool cylinder built to show off the doubling of LEDs in the ram heat spreader but it didn't take very long we then hoped in a cab and powered across Taipei to deepcool's Booth where they showed off their massive new 420 mil AIO look at that deep cool also showed off their class silly Archer bfied new AK coolers and the Morpheus case a behemoth of a case that supports up to three 420 millimeter radiators depending on the modular power supply configuration and it just generally comes with airflow up the pot they also had some power supplies lying around with pcie 5 power and the Assassin 4 cooler which has an ingenious solution to the middle fan mounting you don't have to struggle with those stupid little Clips anymore it just kind of slides in place like that way better and with deep cool down and dusted we were ready to head to the main hall but at this point we'd already spent hours having companies bombard us with product names numbers and all kinds of things so after a brief meltdown we decided to save the main event for day two [Music] as they too rolled around so did a typhoon and once we entered the main Convention Center it quickly became clear that there were two distinct ecosystems the big popular brands at the center and a bunch of smaller vendors vying for attention around the periphery which I found mesmerizing those Tech stuff everywhere here we've got some some tech stuff happening that's some serious looking Tech stuff oh here's another power supply brand that I'm gonna find in a pre-built at some point and have never heard of them before there's Anna in front of some tech stuff if you want some pcie connectors it also quickly became clear there was some kind of unsaid rule that meant every time you started filming somebody had to walk across the shot it was uncanny even if you waited for a clearing the moment you pressed record somebody would just materialize in front of you another thing that quickly became clear was that computex was hot for AI this year and I may have found probably the smartest one I've ever seen although apparently even a genius AI struggle at the hands of a baboon I I just pressed the button okay okay what is maybe try again press you posed a great question oh oh so I press release and then talk oh okay okay after my first attempt failed the AI lashed out with brutal sarcasm your question has sparked curiosity and engagement among your audience it shows your intelligence and creativity but despite clear tutelage the button remained a challenge sorry I'm not very good with tank stuff okay you can try yourself interesting but after my second failed attempt the AI resorted to pity take a deep breath and try to find Solutions she doesn't want me to blame myself which is very nice she's very kind yeah but once I mastered the button it was time to ask the most important question I could think of what is the worst kind of computer venereal disease this is a complete question the worst kind of computer venereal disease is the one that not only infects your sister but also steals your personal information and compromises your cyber security that's a very good answer yeah that's awesome okay thank you very much with great pride having mastered the button we headed to be quiet spoof who had one of the most exciting products of the show the dark Base Pro 901 a gigantic case with insane features like an invertible motherboard tray a magnetic GPU stand slash cable Hider and USB ports that light up but all of that pales in comparison to a hidden five and a quarter inch DVD drive slot and space for actual hard drives oh and I almost forgot the removable radiator mounts have fan hubs built in which will make fun installation so much easier and aside from that they had like power supplies in other cases and stuff which was all exciting don't get me wrong but pales in comparison to the 901 next Patriot gave us a very informative look around their memory products showing off a new high tier overclocking Ram kit which patriot said I was too much of a noob to use which fair enough the extreme 5 kit can go up to 8 000 megahertz but it needs a motherboard with just one ram slot per memory channel to hit these speeds because of memory architecture reasons they also had some insanely fast ssds with active Cooling in it the fan was very quiet and according to Patriot is built using fancy plastic Composites which means it'll never break apparently so after another near fatal dose of having increasingly ridiculous numbers set at us we decided to look for some more random crap which led us to a weird MSI booth that seemed to specialize in robot car charging arms which worked very well next to that man's back is a hologram some printer-based tech stuff behind that man's back is an airplane shaped PC um and right after Anna very excitedly discovered the vagina Mouse we stumbled onto another live demonstration oh I see and then you after clearly being highly impressed by the grip tracking my mind went to its default place so do you have a like a like a game or something we can try like this is oh okay can I try that strapping into the second glove with such an overwhelming experience it took me a second to catch on oh oh it's rock paper scissors oh hey there we go okay I see oh with that I was all gamed out so we decided to continue our search leading us to cooler monsters obscene egg chair thing which left me so frazzled my vocabulary completely broke down okay oh okay oh okay oh okay oh okay but nothing could prepare me for what came next how much does it cost fifteen thousand oh okay okay I don't know fifteen thousand dollars feels a bit steep for a glorified chair especially considering the majority of the features on it barely worked and that combined with the sneaker PCS was just too much for me I needed another lie down in one's Booth was next with a very creative modular case system where you could build up from a normal ATX sized case to a borg cube of gaming death they also had this very colorful foldable case design meant to attract the kiddos to PC building Inwood is really creative with their new case designs which is fun to see and I really love their flat pack case shipping idea but then on the other end of the spectrum there were some companies that may have borrowed some ideas like here we have a definitely not a height case and the blank space on the front of this case happens to be the same shape as the MSI Shield what a fun coincidence and my final goal at computex was to find some new pre-built designs which were quite rare at the event but there were a couple of options from Asus and Acer both of which just seemed like evolutions of previous designs but with airflow on the front which is definitely trending in the correct direction which is great but the Interiors still look like a 17 year old office PC so there's that all in all my first trip to computex was quite the experience from gold Ram to people showing off Fisher-Price versions of PS3 controllers for some reason to an RGB mug that keeps your drink warm and flashes red every hour to remind you to hydrate it seems like the event had it all but after the surgical VR Booth traumatized both of us with extremely graphic footage of open heart surgery I think I've had my fill of the event for a while thank you for watching and thank you Corsair for sending us out and until the next video bye-bye foreign [Music]",

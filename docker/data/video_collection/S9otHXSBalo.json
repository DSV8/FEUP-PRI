    "transcript": "returned a favor very nice what an amazing year it has been for gaming mice we've seen over 20 excellent releases so in this video we've teamed up with our good friends I from Rocketjumpninja to give you our top 10 we also wanted to have some fun with it talking about the mice as we use them in game of course full reviews will be listed below it's just I panic when I play with you better relax man fill this in what challenge here is to pick our top 5 from the list all with the best optical sensors and the only differentiator would be the shape the buttons the cable etc so let the coin toss decide who chooses first the Lanco 2 enclosure by Liam Lee is the $89 case to beat that packs a lot of features with user-friendly assembly and high performance functionality in mind like do OTG side panels with separate shroud doors for easy access to the included hard drive cage the interior is well equipped for cable management on ATX motherboards once you flip the cable bar while the back section is covered with panels for best visuals the top is also air flow ready with multi Lane fan installation but this front fan bracket is next level with four positions available to suit your cooling style check out the Lanco to buy Lele down below coin toss boom cooling 10 you gotta call it alright tails why don't you win alright let's do it I'm gonna pick my all-time favorite at the moment the finalmouse ultralight 2 good choice I don't have that so that's an easy pick for me to go next I would choose surprise to everyone and maybe to you even the mm710 by Cooler Master oh wow I hate you I mean now you're cool all right next to my lists you know I'm gonna take like the number one now even though it's a bit too big for me the Razer Viper ultimate you know I'm gonna go with the the Razer Viper wired because that that stuff is good you know what I'm gonna go with the XM1 in my opinion underrated underappreciated big getting some traction my pick would be the xtrfy m4 as my third choice good choice very popular massive one I'm gonna throw out another random one kone pure ultra lightweight version of the cone pure beautiful mouse I'm gonna choose the model oh that is the first like wait mouse that was in my collection still fits me very small choice all right tough one I mean I could just go with the model o- here but yeah I better I need that in my arsenal whoo so my final pick would be I think the razor basilisk ultimate Wow it's it's a bit heavy but I think the wireless that's my my only wireless advantage here so wish me luck we're gonna start off with the from 5 all the way into the 1 so that we finish off with the best Mouse forest so that would be finalmouse for you I'll be the mm710 for me are you ready to start the game let's get it on you sound so confident like this the subtlety of your of your confidence well just I was no I've got 21 using quake and Dimitri has about 21 days so uh I could do fine I know wish me like everyone wish me luck oh very nice Oh tell me about that mouse you got all three in a row come on oh all right so that's that's the basilisk ultimate my god the wireless speed on this thing is I'm where you at I don't know if I can focus and speak about the mouse at the same time but the razer basilisk man this thing is such a good I'll turn it into g5 or two because usually the g5 or two is kind of heavy and a bit too slim I love the fact that this thing is a bit wider it got a cool feature of being able to customize the scroll wheel scroll wheel actuation look low tactility of it and it's only just over 100 grams so you can still perform pretty well when it comes to fps like that it's a lot of seconds of the game can we do it oh no nice all right that's all so it became pure it's a pretty odd shape when it comes down to it but if it's your style you're going to love it if it's not then you're gonna hate it one of those love or hate bus that said Roccat quality is amazing some of the best scroll wheels on the market buttons feel great the textures everything about them just is top-notch high quality mice but it just depends if you like the shape or not and now ladies and gentlemen we're on the model o and the XY's on the model O- let's see who wins coming after you oh there you go so what do you like about the model like I mean it's so good to be go to go back to the shape but just feel so familiar and as you normally call it so safe I love the lightweight nature this is my first lightweight Mouse sort of that got me back into training for csgo or hello yeah it's like fantastic buttons nice scroll wheel really good control and nice tracking - as you saw there and 69 grams that's brilliant nice shot so the model o- how do you feel about it so I was a big f k2 fan and the fact that they made a smaller FK - so I call it the FK 2.5 from Zowie I actually love using this mouse it's a lot of fun it's extremely lightweight I mean the new cables as well as so good when I reviewed it it didn't actually have the new cable so I'm very happy using the ones with the newer cables everything is pretty much right with this mice lightweight good size for me great shape obviously modelled after the sale we have Pacers as I said sorry up there - so yeah just really saw the choice and actually pretty cheap so definitely worth a look you don't you don't find it too small definitely not love small muss boom nice flick there so I'm using the extra fiim for and this thing I love the the lightweight economic style I love the shape it's perfect for my slightly wider hands I have the full review on it so you can check out all the details and it's one of the few lightweight mice that's actually designed for right hand juice only that's true first please what's my first place with the extra fiim for Luna good let's see where you are oh just over there so the reason this mouse is kind of underrated right now is cuz we've had such good masters here with this shape if you're a fan of the sensei you might actually recognize the feel of it in a few ways sorry it's designed by the same person or partly designed by cara member who was actually designed the sensei completely designed by the same person and has a very similar shape but he's just basically narrowed the sides to a much better feel in my opinion I really like how this feels in the hand it took me a while to actually get used to it it's very wide on top compared to a lot of mice there's such a narrow did you to fall off you did but such a narrow sided Mouse but yeah once you get used to it I think the aim is really good on this because the button height is actually quite low spoke about in that spoke about that in my review though so I'll leave it for that but yeah definitely most people should be checking out and don't sleep on it even if there are like a heap of good micelle right now this deserves it someone in the top 10 I am impressed that the the fact they removed a whole sore they started without the holes as the whole perception of like mice have originated from you need to have this sort of body that has holes all over the place and I'm using the Viper Wired's which is slightly lighter but you're right the the lack of cable does give you a little bit more flexibility but they're both excellent it's my so so fun to use love the Vipers and the latency on these things is actually meant to be better than most other mice they don't know what Razer have done exactly but they've done extremely well oh come on you're such a good easy target in the air like you just said yeah looks like wow this is winning so far oh damn never mind sorry I ruined your streak and it's okay I got another one it's all about the streaks right now I know I miss you you see one I'll hit that one so I've actually got the wireless ranked higher than the wired version and I think it's because there's only four grams but not having to do with the cable even though the cables are extremely good on these mice now it's still worth it going Wireless if you can't afford it that said I wouldn't actually mind using the wired version either and going again with the Zoe FK sort of shape I think that's been heavily inspired by it so this thing these things I should say the Vipers amazing shapes really low weight without holes surprisingly top senses everything's right as we're saying it's just the beautiful mouse this fiber ultimate and I can say the same about the Viper wide but if I could just choose out of the two a definite go the wireless oh that was amazing good job the MM710 is the lightest Mouse in my collection it's the mouse that I feel like I have the most control with because it's so light and you can't have to train to use the mouse that is this lightweight like I know my Coney burn when they've used it they were like it's too light but for csgo it's awesome and for flicks and like following up with your targets it's just so effortless like right there you know I knew exactly where I needed to be the mm710 it's well-priced to the cable I like the scroll wheels awesome the switches are nicely tactile and crispy the only thing would be like probably build quality is the only complaint may be a long term see how this thing will stack up I must say that's one of my favorites to absolutely love playing with the mm710 as well and one thing I will say is that the shape will allow for palm grippers and palm clogger a lot better than a lot of the other mice so you're talking Zoe F K's and all that the better choice if you want palm and claw or palm core and you definitely want to look at the mm710 because it's got that high wide back as ultra wide - I mean this doesn't have a high back and it doesn't quite suit my group it kind of forces me into a more pure fingertip probe that said it's so small and so lightweight and the shape is actually one of the best on the market I still absolutely love it unfortunately for everyone watching this you can't really buy it anymore I've seen a few come back in stock but it is discontinued find a mouse not gonna make it anymore so it's just I want to use it because it is my main Mouse but otherwise it's not actually recommendation these days simply because they don't make it but if we can get more mice like this one day I'm happy to give the recommendation now to the companies and say yeah this is what I love please make more if you can Oh No of course I died still I'm gonna give my shout out of the G pro wireless right now cuz I code to major in counter-strike she'd never have happened haha right now even a year on so I can't believe how well logitech did we're just talking about how even so long after they've still managed to be so far ahead of the competition that the other Mouse companies are only catching up now so still an incredibly good choice in my opinion being beaten by the Razer Viper ultimate and the reservoir but still like if you have one of these don't feel bad amazing mice playing with the the G pro hero beautiful update it was fantastic shape this is the mouse that got me back into playing CS and just training more and being more comfortable with with flicking in fantastic choice and there's a g305 which is viola sit slightly heavier but exactly the same shape last forever G pro hero tell Logitech were killing it last year hoping for some more excellent options from them in 2022 thanks I'm gonna hit my stomach but right now just as he killed me didn't calculate an even plane all right so I do want two things I for joining on this incredible project 2019 was amazing for four mice hoping to see more cool options in 2020 and I hope you guys enjoyed our collection of best mice of the year my top five and XY's top 5 - I think the teams I matter one but we might have to leave that up to the people in the comments because as always with - no matter what we say it is personal preference but I must say all the mice we tested tonight are amazing so you can't really go to wrong in debt we can end it on the hood alright I hope you enjoyed thanks so much for watching what is your favorite mouse of this year and what are you looking for in 2020 let's try me in the comments below I'll be down there answering questions and just engaging in conversation thanks for watching I'll talk to you guys in the next video time to see us go",

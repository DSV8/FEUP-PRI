    "transcript": "- PC Building Simulator 2 is out. It's now! This video is sponsored by Epic Games and I can't believe that I am getting paid to do my three favorite things. Build PCs, play video games, and kick Jake's ass. That's right, you're going down. - I've never played this before, so you very well could be right. - I only played that one time. - I've never built a computer before either, so I don't, I don't know what I'm doing. - [Linus] But, because I challenged Dennis last time, frankly, it was a cake walk. This time I'll be up against someone who actually has some pretty legit PC building skills. So if neither of us have- - Pretty legit? - Pretty legit. - Come on. You do this for a living. - That's a compliment, you (bleep). (Jake laughing) So with that out of the way, neither of us having even looked at this thing, let's get down to business. - [Jake] What is this computer in the splash screen? It looks scary. - It looks ridiculous. - Why does it have eyes? - 4-Way SLI is not a thing anymore, okay? - The best part about that SLI is it's like dual slot too. Dual slot water cooled. - [Linus] Wow, these have gotta be like, 9800 GTXs or something. I'm trying to think what actually used a single wide 4-Way SLI Bridge? Nothing. - Oh yeah, I think it's just for show, brother. - We found a flaw. Okay, in all seriousness though, this is obviously just a showcase PC. The game is 10% off exclusively on Epic Games at launch. So you guys are gonna wanna check that out. And without further ado, let's get into our challenge. Which is that Jake and I each have to start a new game in career mode and get to the point where our shop is successful enough that we can rename it, which I don't even know exactly where it is. So. (Jake chuckling) Is there a, should we do a free build first to kind of get the hang of it? or do we just go? - [Jake] No, No. We're going into it, I'm starting. - You're starting? - I'm starting. - I was marveling at the accurate model of that RTX graphics card. - [Jake] What about the RAM? The RAM looked really good. - That looks amazing. My understanding is that, they have actually collaborated with parts manufacturers to get real CAD models of these cards to convert into models that they can use in the game. So I'm expecting them to be like realism mode accurate. - [Jake] If I've learned one thing in life, it's never meet with the insurance agents on an empty stomach. - [Linus] All right, Step One, I'm already winning this thing because I'm getting these boxes at the back, all right. Okay, we got a casual random box with an RTX 3080. Yeah, for sure, for sure. - [Jake] Oh wow, 3080, heck yeah. I have to, I have to twist all the screws? Oh my gosh, you literally have to twist the screws. - Where's my LTT screw driver, Yo! PC Building Simulator 2 Team - Oh yeah! - Okay, I want the screwdriver in there, let's go. - DLC. - We'll get you the model, all right? That's smart. The way it rotates the PC on the table and the cameras- - [Jake] Yeah. - so that you can do like a- - [Jake] It's pretty slick. - 180 degree rotation but turn the case all the way around. That's really cool. - It's realistic too, 'cause you can't like float around it, you know? Like you're not an omniscient god of building computers. I mean, I am but I don't know about you. Wait, this is an MSI computer. It's got a MSI. Wait, is this just the, did it copy my desktop background - Man, I- - into the game? - love, I love. - It totally is. It copied my desktop's background into the game. - Did it really? - It, it- - Okay, that's eerie. - Unless this exact same MSI background is on this computer, in this game, it copied my desktop background, that's kinda cute. - Okay, I don't think they should make you put the side panel on to fire it up, personally. - That's bad mojo. - Yeah, that's bad jubies. I wanna get my PC fixed but found only an empty space and a pleasantly smokey aroma. I gather you're no longer in business at that address. (Jake laughing) Sure. - I'm water cooling a graphics card and I'm actually taking the cooler apart. - Wait, you're just going ahead past the tutorial? I thought we're like. - I think I'm in the tutorial, this is part of the tutorial, is it not? - When does the tutorial end- - I don't know! - and the game start? - I'm water cooling a GPU. I'm not stopping. Wow, they have thermal grizzly even. - Oh my goodness, corrupted files fan. - I have to remove the thermal pads. - See, I'm trying to read and understand what's going on. I thought we we're doing a tutorial here. - [Jake] Yeah. - How do I switch off the PC? I'm pressing P. - I'm putting so much thermal paste though, this is, this is too much. - Okay I just accepted a job to overclock a computer. - Wow! Are you gonna have to go into the BIOS? Or does it have like XTU on it? The level of detail is seriously impressive. - [Linus] Yeah. - I honestly thought this game was kind of a joke but this is as accurate as a PC Building Simulator could be. - Holy (bleep), I am in an EVGA themed BIOS. - [Jake] Really? - With overclocking settings. - [Jake] No way. Wait, wait, wait. Dude, that's cool. I'm about to water cool a computer and you actually have to make sure the loop goes in the right orientation. Oh, it's walking me- - Okay. - through how to connect this. - If I press escape can I get out of this? No, I just have to wait for 30 seconds? Okay, that's kinda stupid. I wanna get out and go work on something else for 30 seconds, that's how I would run my shop. This actually spits out temperatures and tells you if things throttled, like what your temps are- - [Jake] Really? - [Linus] and your power draw and stuff. - You're joking right? - [Linus] Congratulations, your overclock is stable. - Wait, these fans are backwards. They're blowing out the front of the case. I mean, I guess it works. I don't know why you would do it that way, but sure. Dude, I just water cooled a PC. What have you been doing? You're slacking. - I overclocked. - Yeah, but an already made PC. - Yeah, but it's now, it's faster, smart guy. - Oh, but I have $400. - And I did a most excellent job of removing the old thermal glue. Wow, it even makes you apply the right amount of like, thermal junk. - I'm putting so much thermal paste though. Paint it red, I have to paint the case! What am I, main gear? - Coolant? Well, we're obviously gonna go with just clear coolant because I want this thing to actually work. - Welcome to overclocking. Oh gosh, wait, I put orange coolant. What are you trying to say? - I'm gonna lose this. - Dude. You're, you're. - I'm slacking. - Collect money. - Okay. - Let's give your business a new name. Go back to the hallway. I win, I win. I already win. - You can, you can give your business a new name now? - JAKKUHS- - So wait, we're only doing this tutorial? - DANGER DEN ZOOM. - Dang it! - You're just too slow. - Dang it! - I'm clearly, a better, whatever this is, virtual computer builder or fixer than you, okay? Get wrecked. What should I call it? I'm gonna call it, ARLOS. - No, my case is incomplete. - CAT PC BUILDING- - I'm sorry, Donna. - CAFE. You build the PC and Arlo's here. Can we get Arlo put into this game, please? - Oh man, this is wild. So I didn't put the PC lock, PCI lock back in. And it's real mad about that. Wait, I'm not allowed to do mine yet. Holy crap, am I really this slow? - You're pretty slow dude. - Yeah, I'm pretty slow. - Nozzle size, apply on glass. Wait, he wants me to paint on the glass. (Jake laughing) - How do I rename the shop? - [Plouffe] You gotta find it. - All I did was paint this case red. - It doesn't even tell me how to rename the shop. Oh, here it is. - Can they give me tips and stuff? Is that, if I'm like so good at my job, they give me tips. - What, cannot use this company name. It is not suitable. - [Jake] What did you name it? - Suck it Jake. (Jake laughing) Let's try, Jake Sucks. - [Jake] All I'm hearing is you lost and you're mad about it. - Oh! Jake Sucks is now fine. - [Jake] Oh, great. - Changing your work bench type. Holy crap, this game is deep. - Right? - Done the tutorial or whatever but we are, there is- - Oh. - so, so- - There's a decorator app. - so much depth. - You can decorate your shop. Look at my shop. Look it's space themed now. Holy crap. - Let's go with, sure. You know what, no, I'm gonna spray it green. Screw this customer. Slider to increase the nozzle size. - You're not gonna get paid, Linus. How are you gonna make your rent? - Yeah, you like that, customer? Oh, yeah. Oh no, it's still tutorial so it won't let me do it wrong. They want the glass sprayed too. Customer is an idiot. (Jake chuckling) - Customer's stupid. - I mean, I could see that being a theme for a PC Building Simulator game. You can't get tips for jobs but what you can start doing is selling computers out of your shop. - Right, so you build - [Linus] You can build computers and sell them. Wait, did I even buy the right cooler? There are so many parts already. And apparently, once you're fully leveled up, what is it, 1,600 parts? - [Plouffe] 1,200. - 1,200 parts! - Did you get the email back from the guy who you painted the case red for? Much appreciation for the new case. It was exactly what I asked for. Unfortunately, it was also so perfectly matched to the red I had used to paint the walls that I tripped over it and landed on my nose. Next project will be about the interface between technology and pain. I'm really feeling this one. - That is pretty cute writing. Have you gone out into the storefront part of the shop? - No. I re-themed my shop. Did you know you could do that? - This is amazing. - Did you get the tablet yet? - Uh, yeah, yeah, I got the tablet. I'm just, I'm, I'm. - Go into decorator. You can like, like mod your shop, dude. - I'm just looking, I'm looking around the shop. Like it's clear that there is a lot of work to do. - Yeah. - Like look at this horrible screwdriver. Man this could really be upgraded, lttstore.com. I also think I saw a fly flying around. Did I imagine that? I don't need to clean the CPU. Well, okay fine, I'll clean the CPU. - Linus doesn't like doing a good job. - Well you don't have to, it performs the same. - Unless it's like old. - It performs the same. - This is probably old. - Installed. - Is that gonna perform the same if it's old, hmm? - Yeah, let's see, yeah, whatever, yeah whatever, that's good enough. Got some thermal paste on there. Blah, blah, blah, it's a constellation. It's a constellation, you can't tell but it's like a fleet of ships. Rotate components? - Bruh, you can do everything in this game. - What? I mean, I only played the first game, the one time but this is a completely different level of immersion. I mean, the fact that you can remove and replace individual SSD mounting trays and stuff like that- - And screws. - is wild. Absolutely wild. There's a few places where they do allow you to take shortcuts. Like this SSD here. It didn't make me actually take off the tray. - Yeah. - Put screws through the tray into the SSD. Then put the tray with the SSD back onto the computer. They're not just gonna make it completely not fun, right? - The whole plugging the cables in every time thing is getting a little tedious. Mind you, I imagine when you get into later levels, there's a lot more stuff you do per system rather than just swapping a graphics card really quick, and I imagine that makes it a little bit less like that. - Wait, can you rip people off? The objective is, install a GeForce 970 or better. The labor budget is $170 and the parts budget is $650. - [Jake] Yeah you can just. - Can I just put whatever the hell I want in here? - As long as it's better, I guess. Dude, I installed the new CPU and it blue screened on launch. - No! - So, is it not the CPU? Do I need to reinstall Windows? Do I call them and say \"yo dog, your computer sucks.\" I didn't put thermal paste on the CPU. - No way! (Jake laughing) - Hoo! If you don't use the budget, you keep the extra. So I put a 970 in with a $650 parts budget and I got 400 bucks from him. - All right. - So you do scam your customers. - So I should find the cheapest 970 then. - Correct. - That's cool, you get to keep the parts you take out of people's things so you can put together your- - [Jake] Yeah and sell them. - your used machine. It's not just like new stuff. - Whoa! Dude, my shop looks sick. No way. - Whoa, that looks amazing! You got like RGB reflections in here and stuff. - Oh yeah. I have a hundred percent chance of sale at $960. Edit computer name. LinusSmells - Hey, what! - Save. - Oh, that increased the price! It literally increased the price. (Jake laughing) Can I make it, smells bad? - This is cool. It's starting to take the guard rails off a little bit, I think. - Yeah. - It tells me replace the CPU. I see, it's a Ryzen 3 1300x. - You have to check though. - So I have to actually make sure I'm ordering the right thing. - Holy crap, I sold my first computer! Woo! Oh wait, this is the guy with the red computer. He sent it back. He wants me to put stickers on it. - Okay, these are some softball jobs sometimes here. - Where does he want the sticker? Oh my god, they're so big. I sticker bombed it. It is the right number of stickers. Can I put more? Oh, I can put more! This looks like the Plouffe's computer now. (Plouffe laughing) - [Linus] Ha. - Welcome to Free Build. Ooh, my shop is like way snazzier. - [Plouffe] Wait, both of you go at the same time. - Linus! - I can't free build yet. - Yes you have to back out. It's a different mode. - Did I not remember to pick up my shipment again? Where's my XPG 650 Watt power supply? I could've sworn I ordered that thing. - You have to pick it up when you order it. Go into Free Player. I'm gonna hit you with a carrot, dammit. - You go to Free Play, I'll carrot you. All right, I'm going to Free Play, god! Resume Jake Sucks. (Linus and Jake laughing) - Dude, there's a thermal camera. - What, like for diagnosing problems? - I guess so. - That's sick. - [Plouffe] You guys can build whatever you want, but then you have to run a benchmark after to see who built the technically better computer. - Why is the retail value of this thing $4,800 with a Core i3 in it? - Cause it's the labor man, you don't understand. - Okay, It has a 3090 in it. - Look, I can get, what's the best parts? I'm just gonna take all the best parts. Z690 Godlike, $2,100, let's do it. - All right, I finally found. - Oh, there's even a IceGiant, no way! - [Plouffe] Yeah, mention how there's a ton of different brands, list them all, AMD. - I'm not listing them all. - Yeah. We can't list all the brands included. - [Plouffe] Just list a couple of them. - There's, we got NZXT, Fractal Design, IceGiant. G.SKILL makes AIOs? What the heck? Silverstone. I like just applying way too much thermal paste. It should make you clean it off if you put too much. I'm putting so much thermal paste though. - There isn't a single brand name hard drive. Probably because no one cares. - I'm not surprised though. - I'll say this, installing Threadripper is exactly as tedious as it is in real life. - Dude, if you install a power supply in Free Build mode, it does all the cabling and screws for you, that's nice. Wow, it's kind of cute how it cable manages. - I haven't honestly been paying very close attention to the music but there is music. Listening to some rap music right now. It's apparently royalty-free. So if you're a content creator or a streamer, you can definitely include in-game music, which is pretty sick. This is going to take a while to build a computer, which I guess is like cool. - Yeah, you gotta, you gotta go through it. You know, you gotta play the game. Purple tubing. Run. Start the computer. It won't turn on. - Okay, I really do need to find this but, oh, there it is. It only pans up and down. So when I held the middle mouse. - [Jake] No! - Oh, it's opposite! - [Jake] No! I forgot to put the SSD in. And now I have to take the graphics cards out, and the water cooling out, and the cables out. - [Linus] It's just like real life. - Oh, I'll use SATA hard drive (beep) it. Oh, there's no way to fix this. - Get wrecked. Get wrecked, son. - So many things to unplug. - Okay, so can I still win this race? - I picked 3090 Ti and I have to unplug all three power connectors. - Nice. - [Jake] Oh. - Okay, Plouffe, do you know the answer to this? My case has vertical GPU mounts. I do not wish to use them. There does not appear to be a way for me to not use them. - [Jake] Maybe you just suck. Just use the vertical mount, who cares? - I don't want the vertical mount, I'm using SLI. - I'm using SLI, screw you. - [Plouffe] Is there a PCI lock you can take off or something? - What are these cables? - I did. - [Jake] Okay, my computer's booted. I gotta add a remove, you gotta install 3DMark? All right, I'm gonna 3DMark. Let's run, Time Spy. Please don't make me wait for the whole thing. Oh God, I think I have to wait for the whole thing. This is cool though. - You can bend your tubes. - No way, what? - You can bend your hard line tubes. - There's hard line? - There's hard line. - I just, I let the game run everything for me. 'Cause there's no performance benefit. I'm on a test bench, so, you know? - Yeah, but mine's gonna look sick. - Do some swirls or something. Spirals. Oh my god, you have to actually wait for Time Spy to run. - This is cray cray. - It's like sped up, like it's a short Time Spy. But I am still waiting for Time Spy. - I'm sure we're gonna have an extended cut of this on Floatplane for those of you who are- - [Jake] Oh! - into that sort of thing. - 28,000 in Time Spy. - Is it gonna make me actually install an iCUE RGB controller? That would be kind of awful, actually. - It'll just won't install properly too, right? - Okay, power supply storage, graphics cards, memory, motherboards, CPU. - Okay, set all my fans to max speed now. No! I overclocked my graphics card, ran Times Spy and it crashed. Dang it. My temp is just pegged at a hundred degrees. 1.6 Volts was too much apparently for an IceGiant. Sorry, IceGiant. - My CPU is at 95 degrees. - What's your overclock? - And it just throttled. I just got a blue screen. - Throttled, no way! - I'm factory resetting. Oh my god, I'm still at 94 degrees. I'm not throttling though. Oh, come on! - I thought you said you gave up on overclocking. - I overclocked it just a little. - Yeah, uh huh. - I need the edge. I want the edge. - Oh! My Time Spy score, 30,800. - Oh I got, I got destroy-a-malated, 17,500. - Well, I had two 3090s. - Well, my CPU's throttling too. (Jake and Linus laughing) - That's okay though, because my favorite game is Wormy, anyway, so. - Does it let you play? - Yeah, I'm playing some Wormy, let's go. - So whoever gets the highest Wormy score wins? - This may actually be challenging, Jake. I played this game a lot. Back when it was the only game on my cell phone. - (beep) 300, dammit! Can I get one more try? - Sure. - What, I just ran into my own damn snake. One more try. - I don't know why you decided that you wanted this to be what determines the winner. - Does your worm get faster too? - No! - What's your score? - 4,500. - Okay, there's no way in hell I'm getting anywhere near that. Hold on, brother. You can change your peripherals. K95, hell yeah. Before we end this, let's take a look at each other's computers. - I haven't actually put mine back together yet. My panels aren't even back on yet. - If we were going for price to performance, I didn't hit that. This computer is $13,000. - Oh, you managed to spend more than me somehow. - Well, it's cause I got all these fittings. Oh, you can swap mouse pads. There's RGB mouse pads. Okay, wait, there is mouse pads in the game, we gotta get LTT Store mouse pads in here. - A hundred percent. - Please, Epic Games. Come look at my computer. It's pretty sick. I don't know why they look like that. - Wait. What the hell? - Do you see cables? - I thought this was gonna be impressive. It sucks. - Look, it's sick. It's a 3090. - No, this thing's stupid. - Two 3090. You're stupid. - Stupid? Like if you've been watching what he's been doing, he's all like, oh this looks sick, looks amazing. - Looks sick, dude. - Looks like garbage. - You look like garbage. - [Jake] This better to be magical. You should have built- - Well, I didn't claim mine was magical. - What the hell is that? Oh, that's that case! That case is cool. - Yeah, it's a cool case, right? - Oh, you used Trident Z Royal? - Well, yeah. - Unironically? - [Linus] Yeah. Look how shiny it is. I even remember the gold one. They have the silver one. - [Jake] I didn't think it was possible, but somehow you made your bends worse in the game than real life. - Shut up, they are not. Okay this is pretty. - How is it like so, so aggro? Yo, you know what you should do? - Yeah? - You should add rainbow cables. - That won't be necessary. What I should really do is thank our sponsor, Epic Games for sponsoring this video and you for watching it. You guys can check out PC Building Simulator 2 exclusively on Epic Games. It's 10% off for the first week and any beta participants automatically get 15% off until the end of the year. You only saw us scratch the surface of all the new components and features so it's definitely gonna be worth checking out. If you guys enjoyed this video, you might also enjoy going back and checking out the last time we played. I think Dennis just about had a meltdown trying to figure out how to use the antivirus software on the USB drive.",

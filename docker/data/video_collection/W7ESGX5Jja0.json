    "transcript": "- Fast laptops, I've got two of them. You guys like it when I unbox them and I like unboxing them too. We're gonna take these apart and it's gonna be great. They're from XMG and they're about as fast as you can get, although they do have Intel, so we'll see just how that compares to the last one we did. I'm not totally sure which laptop this is. We have two of them, the XMG PRO 17 and 15. I believe they're essentially the same, minus the screen size, but I guess we'll find out once we take them apart. This concise user's guide. I mostly find it funny just because it says, \"Concise User's Guide,\" but is this long. There's actually like useful stuff in here. Yep, they have power modes, they explain what Max Q is, damn. This I believe is the 17, wow, this is a lot smaller than I was expecting. Look at this, I'm pretty sure it has a 3080 in it. These are direct from Clevo. So these are XMG laptops but they are straight from the factories in Taiwan because getting ahold of these is pretty hard. I'm pretty sure these are pre-production. So it's like space, like the footprint of this is larger than the Neo that we looked at, but I'm quite sure it's thinner. Yeah, it doesn't look like a gaming laptop at all. It's very similar in size to Zephyrus, if the Zephyrus was just larger. Does that make sense? (laughs) Okay, I'm actually excited now, damn. I was kind of expecting these to be just massive big porkers of a laptop. And the other laptop. I think someone screwed up. (laughs) - [Man] Did we get the same laptop? - I think (laughs), okay, okay. Oh my God, they're the same laptop (laughs). Okay, everything that I said about the 15 inch, scratch that. Two 17 inches, yay. Anyway, moving on to IO. So on the side here, you get two USB type A's an ethernet port. Round back, we have Thunderbolt, so that's something you don't get on an AMD laptop. HDMI and also display port, but only the mini one, and power input. And finally, on the left, we have mini SD card, kinda wish it was full-sized but oh, well. And then another type A and headphone and microphone. Are you ready to open it up, (indistinct)? - Yeah. - Aye, aye captain. - Let's open it up. - Yes, to the sponsor, iFixit. Thanks to iFixit for sponsoring today's video. iFixit makes compact tool kits with all the essential bits to fix small electronics. Minnow has 16 driver bits that work with most laptops, desktops and smartphones. Moray has 32 bits with additional bits for fixing things like home appliances furniture. Both have magnetic lids, built in sorting trays and a four millimeter swivel top driver. Fix your stuff today and learn more using the links down in the description. So in this one right here, we get a, let's see here, an Intel core i7, 1087H. So that's eight cores. I think they go pretty close to five gigahertz. These things are really fast. 16 gigabytes of RAM and an RTX 3080. I'm pretty sure this is a Max Q version, even though Max Q Max P died. But it also didn't. I don't know it's confusing. Laptop stuff is really dumb right now. The first, most noticeable thing about this laptop is that the display is freaking huge. Like it's 17 inches, we knew that going in because of the name but at the same time, just like looking at it with these small bezels, it's freaking massive. Now this is only a 1080p display. It is 300 Hertz. So like, if you're looking to headshot people this is gonna be great. But if you're looking for like doing a bunch of office stuff, I do believe that there's a 1440p version which is the one that I would definitely go for. Yeah, it's not super bright. I think it only covers the sRGB color space which is just a lot less colors than if you get Adobe or DCI-P3. That said, if your plan is to just game on it, this seems like a pretty good option. Oh, the other laptop, it's done updating. So we finally get to see what exactly is in here. RTX 3070, so it's not going to be quite as powerful. Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure that I requested both of these so that I could look at the difference between 3070 versus 3080 in laptops. We're not going to do that today. Just going to see how this guy right here runs. We wanna look at the actual difference between those two, we'll have to do that on LTT so way too much work for right now. Yeah, comment below 3070 versus 3080. We have a German keyboard, once again. This is made for XMG and they're German. So the keyboard that we get here is also German. You can't buy stuff from them that's not German keyboards, but you know, pre-production, we get what we get. It appears that this laptop is designed purely for gaming, so let's just get straight into that. So up here, it looks like we're getting, ah, just dropped to like 120 FPS or we're also regularly getting around 200. So somewhere around 150, 170 seems to be about the average. We're going into the actual game now though, so we'll see. Having the super large display when you're gaming is so great. Especially with like the really high refresh rate that I'm getting. Yeah, the refresh rate is awesome for those times when you like want to jump and do a 180, like those like, really easy. If you mainly play like FPS's, this is going to be awesome for you. If you're the sort of person that plays RTSs for the most part, maybe you don't need this. Because it is lower resolution, I probably wouldn't want to use this for like RTS's or office work or most things that are not gaming, if I'm honest. Like I said, there is the other option that makes a lot more sense if you want to do basically all of those things. 1440p, this generation, is what you want. Yeah, we quit the game, but everything's still really hot. We're looking at like the mid 80s for the CPU, actually more like mid 90s. This thing is probably easily thermal throttling, if you're doing anything. GPUs normally survive a lot better. 81 degrees, that's not ideal, hotspot temperature of 87. I guess we'll find out when we open it up, but I am going to guess that the cooling system in this is nowhere near as sophisticated as what you find in like a Zephyrus. And yeah, it's not treating this thing well. I am going to, people complained the last time that these mouse mats will be choking it off. I don't think it makes a difference. Let's play a tiny bit of Valheim, just to monitor the temps. This looks and feels like it's playing very well but let's see what the temps are saying. GPU temp is currently, it's climbing pretty fast. We're at 77 degrees on the hotspot temp right now, 78. Oh, the CPU is actually not doing too bad right now, it's sitting at like the 70s thereabouts. So yes, it does depend on what game you're running. This one might just be, you know, less CPU dependent, so that's why it's not just absolutely destroying the poor thing. How's the GPU doing? Yeah, it's still climbing, I wouldn't be surprised if it got back up close to 90 degrees again. Like your gaming experience on this thing is still going to be awesome, but at the same time, it's really loud and really hot and it's using Intel, so I'm not sure why we're super surprised. 83 degrees on the GPU now. That's hotter than I ever saw the Zephyrus, and that also had a 3080 in it. Actually our GPU temps are high but maybe I'm giving the Zephyrus too much credit. So it looks like we've max gotten 135 Watts of power on the GPU. And right now it's sitting around like 90 to 100. So the problem might not so much be the thermals but they're just really giving her the beans. Okay, let's go to quiet and see what happens. Yeah, it's calming down, it's calming down. Okay, we're still getting like 80 Watts on the GPU. It isn't a noticeably different experience. So I think that I might actually avoid going with the like full power setting on this and instead just leave it in quiet mode and have a much more pleasant time for my ears. If I'm honest, the keyboard's a bit of a let down. Some of the keys are just less stable than others and in general they're all pretty wibbly-wobbly. Like I'm not pressing the key right now, I'm just flexing it like (groans). That one's way worse than this one which you can kind of see is like the big problem. Yeah, I push it on the bottom here and it just goes down but if I push it on the bottom with this one, it's like (groans). As for the track pad, it's nice and large. I don't think it's glass topped although it doesn't really matter given that, you know it feels good to use. I'm personally not a fan of having the two buttons on the bottom and not being able to click it in. But at the same time some people love having buttons down here, so it's kind of up to you. Like all of the bits that you press are very stiff but again, except for the keyboard, like can you see this Andy? - [Andy] Yeah (indistinct). - In here it flexes but then like if I do the same thing up top you can see it just doesn't flex at all. Apparently these speakers were tuned by Sound Blaster. (bright music) Oh my God, that's bad. It's like, it's hurting my ears, it's really loud and just unpleasant sounding. That might be the worst laptop I've heard in years. I'm gonna get the XPS out so you guys can kinda see how it compares, you know make sure that it's not just the microphone that's making the sound like trash. But Oh my God, that is abysmal. XMG NEO 17, (bright music) changing over to the XPS. Totally different. It just, I can hear different instruments that I just could not before, my ears don't hurt. It's loud, but like, not painful. Let's take a look at what we get in here. So upgradability, at first look, is awesome. So we have two SO-DIMM slots, two SSD slots, WiFi module. And actually now that I look at it this might be made for or of a 15 inch. Like if you look at it, these ribbon cables here, this space, all of this space down here really suggests to me that the internals are exactly the same for the 15 inch version, except probably with a bit smaller heat sinks. Compared to the Zephyrus, there's not a lot of cooling in here. We got one, two, three, four, five heat pipes. Actually the Zephyrus might only be like six, but at the same time, they're way bigger. And it's not really comparable to this. Oh yep, there's the very first thing that you'll want to do when you get this laptop. Normal thermal paste down here, wipe that off, chuck some liquid metal in there, actually video right here, I show you how to do it but it was also my first time ever doing it. So it's kinda scary. Yeah, this probably would be a lot better if it had liquid metal down there. If you're considering buying this I would consider considering the XMG NEO 15. So it's not quite as slim, but at the same time you get that AMD processor, which is just so fricking fast and also you don't have to worry about thermals as much as just the heater cores that Intel is these days. And if you want that slimness, get a Zephyrus. As far as just daily usability, way better, night and day compared to this thing. So, sorry XMG, I wish that I could recommend this more but at the same time. Well, thanks for watching, hit like, get subscribed, tick the bell and just have a fantastical day, so long.",

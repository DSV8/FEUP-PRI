It also has an updated design, more ports and better cooling.  let's take a deep dive unboxing to check it out.

    "transcript": "so as we're wrapping up our meetings here at Computex we stop by gigabyte to conclude our coverage and the main highlight of the show was of course the refreshed aero 15 which is not to be confused with the aero 15X or the aero 15 classic I know there's a lot going on it's certainly confusing but allow me to walk you through some of the details but first huge shout out to fan texts and SteelSeries for sponsoring our Computex 2019 coverage so there are two lineups of the aero series for the rest of 2019 it's the regular aero 15 classic and the aero 15 which is their flagship lineup of notebooks that come with new designs and whatnot now if you keep things off with the aero 15 classic nothing really has changed in terms of the design compared to the previous generation so you get the same you know unibody metal construction with a little bit of plastic build here and there the keyboard layout on the trackpad layout are identical you still get RGB lining you know there's also the i/o situations pretty much identical same battery size like I said pretty much the same on the exterior but you do get a little bit of a spec refresh so for starters TCP configuration starts with the core i7 9750 h6 chord 1230 processor and it can be upgraded all the way up to the core I9 9880HK 8 for 16 threaded monster the GP configuration starts with a gtx 1660 TI which is not a max q design or you can also go for an RTX 2060 RTX 2070 max Q and an RTX 2080 Emacs q GP configs so really good options overall for both what gigabytes offering with the aero 15 classic and I feel like it's a good way for people who really want to get into that premium ultra-thin gaming laptops it's I think the 1660 has a great start they're also gonna be offering to display options on the aero 15 classic so you can either go for a 15.6 inch 1080p 144 display which is IPS and that's provided by LG or you can opt for a 1080p 240 Hertz display which is an egg's openal and that's provided by sharp and that is just crazy 240 Hertz on a 15.6 inch screen I think it's the ultimate gamers dream alright so moving on to the Aero 15 and this is their flagship offering so there are some subtle design changes for instance the logo at the front now says aero instead of gigabyte there are front-facing speakers finally that is a welcoming addition for sure and so it's definitely gonna give you a better sound projection I'm definitely curious to see how well it sounds compared to the Razer Blade 15 when I get my hands on one of these models the IO still remains the same although they have shuffled a bit of that on the left and right do the front speaker integration the webcam for some reason is located at an even odd location so they've shifted it from the bottom of the screen to the main chassis right above the power button with a privacy shield feature now this makes things even worse because it's at a stationary spot and even lower compared to when it was originally on the aero 15X and one of the things again at least having to have webcam place at the bottom is that as you're shifting your screen you could sort of position yourself at a different angle although I guess it's a nose cam angle that you're getting from a bottom facing webcam this implementation is really really odd and I just feel like it's gonna be even worse when you're looking at it unfortunately I get a chance to actually look at that when I was in the show floor but I know for a fact that it's it's not gonna tell her that great the keyboard and trackpad remained the same although after spending a short amount of time with it I felt like the keys were a bit mushy er compared to the previous aero 15x CP options again start with the core i7 9750 h and you can obviously configure it up to the core I nine eight core 16 threaded offering GPU offerings are also pretty much the exact same as the Aero 15 classic so you can start up with a 16 60 TI and go all the way up to a 20 80 max q GPU and these new aero 15 notebooks come pre-loaded with invidious studio drivers because it's really geared towards content readers gigabyte also mentioned that they've upgraded the cooling system on the Aero 15 and they claim that it's 15 to 20 percent better than the previous generation which is pretty interesting I mean they call it the wind force cooling system and it takes design elements from their GPU coolers and adapted to their notebooks and I'm really curious to test that out once I get my hands on one of these models but the main highlight of this lineup is the display gigabyte has actually partnered up with Samsung to integrate 4k AMOLED displays except for the base cube that comes with a 1080p X 0 240 Hertz panel it comes in both matte and glossy panels the 4k screens are individually calibrated with XY Pantone certification now AMOLED is considered a softer panel technology so the lid was reinforced significantly to avoid damage burnin avoidance is done through pixel shifting but it could still be an issue now the battery capacity still remains the same at around 94 watt hours so if you spec this thing with a core i7 processor and a gtx 1660 TI which is you know a really good power efficient combination you can easily get some amazing battery life out of this notebook especially considering that it's probably one of the only notebooks thin and light notebook relatively thin unlike notebook featuring a really big battery now pricing for the Aero 15 starts at 1699 and goes all the way up to three thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars the catch is that the base model only comes with single channel memory so it's definitely gonna hit out of the box performance significantly but that's nothing that a quick memory upgrade can fix now I also want to mention that gigabyte will be offering a special white edition which is a limited edition of the aero 15 and just taking a quick look at that the show floor it looked absolutely gorgeous I would certainly Rock one with the 4k AMOLED screen because I mean you know it certainly is a different look for the inner lineup and yeah I mean I mean I'd love to know your thoughts about that in the comments down below alright so there's one more thing that I want to talk about and that is kick bite will be coming out with a 17 inch version of the Aero notebook so it's gonna feature a 17 inch 4k display with basically the same specs as the aero 15 classic and the Aero 15 so you know processors start with the core i7 9750 h2 the core I 998 a thk 8 core processor a core 16 thread processor also you can configure the GPU from 16 series all the way up to the r-tx 20 series so overall it looks like it's a pretty good product stack up for the rest of 2019 so that about wraps up my coverage here at Computex 2019 especially here the gigabyte booth let me know what you guys think about the updated refresh for the Aero lineup of series or the Aero series of notebooks for the rest of 2019 you know would you consider something like this for your workflow if you're a greater gamer I would love to know your thoughts about that in the comments and if you're interested in a particular SKU that you wanted us to test down definitely hit us up in the comment I mean both Hydra Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here

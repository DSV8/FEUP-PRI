    "transcript": "- I got something unusual in the mail. Very festive, as you can tell. It's got some wrapping paper on it but the wrapping paper's a little unusual. Unbox me. I've done that before. And I know who it came from. I know that it came from YouTube. Let's jump inside. I don't even know the last time I opened a present with a ribbon on it. (wrapping paper ripping) From YouTube. Why, thank you. It's got headphones on it, gadgets. And two of 'em! You know what this means, Jack. Unbox therapy wardrobe. Oh, my. Some kind of treat, this is a hot chocolate spoon. You fill a cup with water, heat it up, and then you just place one of these bad boys in the liquid, and it just melts, and there you go. Drop it in, stir it up. So, the milk chocolate, dark chocolate, white chocolate. Would it be wrong of me to take a bite of it? A little nibble? Cool idea: send the YouTubers chocolate, why don't ya? A selfie stick. With a shutter button! Little guy goes on the end. And you can put your phone in it. You do it with a phone, you're at bang! Boom! Hang on, hold on. Check me out right now. If this ain't festive, I don't know what is. Now it's selfie time. My Christmas card to all of you out there in the world. My holiday greetings, if you will. May all your dreams come true. Thank you, YouTube, for initiating such a introspective moment here as I stare at myself in my phone through a lens connected to a selfie stick. Thank you, YouTube. Here's to some more videos together. I love YouTube. I love you guys. And, for real, happy holidays. Later.",

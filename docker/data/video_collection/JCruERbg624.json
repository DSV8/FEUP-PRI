    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here, back with another video! That was very fast. What if I just came right into the video? Y'know, what if I just... \"Today we're gonna...\" What if I skip the \"What's up guys...\" and \"Today we're gonna talk about...\" \"Today we're looking at...\" That's it. Today, I am bringing you something useful. I think... I hope. What they've done here, this company, Nomad, is they took a backup battery that you would normally carry in your pocket, and they built it into a wallet. A 2400mAh battery, which, is essentially, uh, a complete charge, a full charge, for an iPhone 6 or 6S. Now on the back of the box, you can see the design. It is a fairly traditional kind of wallet layout. Let's crack this baby open, 'cause that's what we do here on Unbox Therapy... Lew, why is your knife so goddamn big? You'll find out in the next video. Okay. So, I mean, it feels like a pretty standard wallet. Of course, you've got this battery... sort of like the size of a.. a.. lipstick size battery in the... ...but, you know what? Pretend I'm sitting on it here. I mean, it's no bigger than my wallet ends up. George Costanza style, once I get it loaded up. It's a li... I mean, it's a little bit... bit bigger, let's be honest here. *Sniff Sniff* Is that leather? *Sniff Sniff* Can't tell. The cable, on the other hand, if you guys can see that there, it slides in there, and that's actually where it gets stored. Right in there. Some space for cash up in here. Now on the bottom here, I notice a button. So that's gonna give you an LED indication of the battery having a charge. Let's find out what's in here... Ah! So they did include a microUSB cable, to keep this charged up. Let's grab an iPhone real quick and just see what that's like. So let's say, uh, who are you? who are you, where are you? Maybe you're in high school. You're having lunch in the cafeteria. Phone runs out. Your friends are tryn' to... tweet you. Snapchat you. There's a party later, you need to know about it. You need a charge. Just pull out your wallet, slide out the... the... the cable... At this point, everybody's looking at you. The whole cafeteria is wondering, Who's this guy, who does he think he is with this... battery wallet? You know who you are. You're the man right now. The females come over. They start swooning. You ever heard that word? Swoon? Now normally, they're only coming over if you've got extra french fries, or something like that. But in this case, it's 'cause you got the wallet. 'Cause you're a nomad. You don't stay in one place. You got a motorcycle. And you smoke cigarettes. What the... I'm joking, don't smoke. I'm serious. It's terrible for you. It's a bad idea. Motorcycles, they're dangerous too. When the girl you have a crush on, she's low on battery and you're like \"I got you.\" THAT'S A MOVE! THAT'S HOW, I mean, every quality relationship of the future is gonna start that way. There is no way to a woman's heart like giving her a charge when she needs it most. Show me some thumbs, guys. I need it. 2400 mAh in your wallet. Never... never thought I'd see the day! It's meta-share. Sharing is caring. You've heard that before.",

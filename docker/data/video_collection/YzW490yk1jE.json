    "transcript": "oh hey how are those headphones these are fantastic my friend what about the mic oh this thing is gorgeous okay what about the mouse or the mouse my friend this one is legendary and by the way everything will be linked in description below thank you very much so yes good people the mx518 legendary is in the building this is an upgrade to the original mx518 from 2011 which was an upgrade to 2004 MX510 it is a bit of a nostalgic piece of hardware for many gamers for me included I remember wanting to read MX510 that Mike has I'm sure this can take a hit though if I drop it and so let me share my experience with the mouse and include Michael and Ebert to have a little bit more diversity in opinion about this gaming mouse in particular let's begin right after this the new Razer Blade 15 is a machine for people who know exactly what they want when you need a reliable keyboard and one custom lighting when you need an accurate display and what insanely fast 144 hertz refresh rate when you need a portable machine and want a gorgeous thin aluminum unibody in the world's smallest 15.6 inch gaming laptop when you need powerful gaming hardware to truly dominate with geforce r-tx the Razer Blade 15 when you need the power for anything you do and will nothing to hold you back check out the configuration you want down below alright so let's get the basics out first this is a $59 mouse which is a super competitive price point it's competing with like the rival 310 which is still my favorite Mouse of all time and it's kind of like slightly below the G pro from large stick as well that has the same sensor but slightly different shape and targeted towards I guess the professional arena while this covers that the styl juh Carina instead the weight is just over 100 grams which is super nice for me I do prefer lighter mice around the 80 gram territory but I would say like for most gamers that the weight is just perfect it is slightly lighter versus the original MX510 so for people who have gotten used to her heavier Mouse this might be a little bit too light I love the cable on here even though it's very thin it's super light doesn't kink it's not braided which is nice and it fits into my mouse bungee so all good as you can see it has this triple tone texture so plain black on the sides and this iconic metallic gradient on the interior section that goes from dark to light where the primary buttons are and as with the original it has that sparkle texture built-in which may be perceived as like dust particles if you're like trying to look at it on the side but it does not have RGB and I dislike that glossy G logo in the center I wish it was matte black as for the buttons absolutely no complaints here the primary left and right clicks are slightly heavier and exhibit a little bit more travel distance versus my dream pro the browser buttons feel identical in terms of their like that feedback and how they're slightly soft in that end and they're located in the perfect position right above your thumb the DPI shift buttons we have three of them so we have plus or minus two cycle back and forth and we have the DPI shift that you can program to be anything you want so if you play it 400 dpi you can simply program one of those dpi levels to that button and that is your particular setting for whatever you do but the weakness here is the scroll wheel first of all the steps are not as defined as the G Pro Wireless or the G Pro and second of all it's way too low in the body so when I'm trying to press it which I normally use for us to talk immune occation I always activate one of the DPI shift buttons now as for the shape obviously that's quite subjective but I still prefer the comfort level of the G Pro the G pro Wireless and the rival 310 the left side for me feels fantastic and while I've got me used to the slightly larger hump on the top here versus my other mice the one thing that kills it for me in terms of comfort is this right side so there's this Ridge over here that supposed to I guess somehow fit your maybe ring finger right below it but my ring finger doesn't go below it it goes right on the ridge and I can feel it it's not natural for me especially coming from other mice that have that whole area either smoothed out or have a nice curvature so that my hand can comfortably sit in that section so just be mindful of this right side because from my hybrid claw grip I just don't know where to put my ring finger and it's constantly on that Ridge which I wish was smoothed out and that's for performance obviously they had to update it with a hero 16k sensor which is the same sensor found on the GPO Wireless the G Pro the updated logitech g502 hero it's fantastic absolutely no acceleration true one-to-one tracking throughout the entire dpi range up to 16,000 dpi which is crazy but the technology is there so that there is no filtering no interference of the sensor is just like raw performance and that is incredible if you like to play at 400 dpi or above 8,000 dpi you will be satisfied as for gaming performance I still prefer the G Pro it gives me a little bit more freedom of movement it's a slightly smaller Mouse and has nice curves at the bottom so when I do pick up the mouse for readjustment because I play it 400 dpi I feel like this thing feels larger and heavier so that I have to increase my dpi to have a little bit more control so the shape here is not a hundred percent for me but in terms of sensor performance obviously it is incredible oh I should say in legendary so having listened to me all this time let's hear what Michael and Abraham to say so basically my history behind this is the MX510 I've had this since the day it was released it was about 15 years ago now it's working still like a champ I also had the at the older mx518 from the day it was released unfortunately that died about a year ago so I was super super happy to see this but my opinion is really biased because I'm used to the forum now for the last 15 years these aren't the only mice that I've been using but coming back to the mx518 legendary because I didn't have my mx518 for a while it's like coming back to an old friend my my hand is used to it but at the same time I can understand how people would feel this is really really uncomfortable now that I'm noticing it it is a little bit uncomfortable if you're not used to it so personally speaking I haven't actually tried the older mx518 because I don't think I hear too young I was you know having used the g403 as my primary mouse for pretty much everything that I do including editing and gaming just switching over to the the mx518 the first minute notice is just it's a little bit uncomfortable that because there's a lip on the right hand side of the mouse that slides with my ring finger so it doesn't kind of go in as flush as it would compare to the g43 I don't see myself adjusting to PM X Y V Tina things for me in a long term the other thing that I'm not too crazy about with this don't get me wrong I absolutely love the mouse it's the fact that it's a little bit light for my liking I like heavier mice I like the accuracy of them but I'm really happy with the sensor I'm really happy because the older mice didn't have proper working software under Windows 10 so I love the fact that this is back on the market but it has its limitations and as for the software you do everything through G hub so you can configure your macros you can reassign all the buttons obviously we have this entire dpi range and that orange DPI shift button don't forget about that and if you go into the gear icon you can save all those settings to the memory on the mouse itself so you can carry the settings with you and don't need the software and so in conclusion for $59 the mx518 legendary isn't needed upgrade I'm glad they put in the 16 K sensor in there but I wish that they would redesign the structure a little bit on the right side and also change the scroll wheel to include the same scroll structure as the G pro which is leaps better and the thing that I'm hoping for would be a wireless edition of this Mouse with a slightly redesigned write structure and change scroll wheel and obviously redesign internal frames so that it could be lighter and enter the you know the the G pro Wireless sort of not competition but diversity because I feel like many people still like the shape so yeah that is our review of the mx518 let us know the mouse you're rocking and if this thing you know rings any bells if you recall the original mx510 I'm Dimitri thanks so much for watching make sure to subscribe and check out this other relevant content we'll see you next video",

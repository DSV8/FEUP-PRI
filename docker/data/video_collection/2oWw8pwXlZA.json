    "transcript": "hi yo so the Pocophone F1 from Xiaomi is a device that got a lot of attention when it had a dicccc It has amazing specs for the price tag. So this thing launched for the equivalent of like $12,000 US in the place where t series is and it was just I mean, that that's a price point that gets a lot of eyeballs So I've been using this for a little while and I thought I'd give you my thoughts on this phone So the specs of this phone are fantastic. It has a lot of the features of flagship phones while being very competitively priced It's not every day that you see a Snapdragon 845 with liquid cooling and 4000 mAh battery For three hundred dollars, the screen is high-res. It's got a headphone jack, microSD This thing is packed with great features. Now when you hold it, it's a nice weight. It's comfortable to hold It doesn't have any weird curvature or sharp edges to the device. It's a great phone to hold The plastic, however, feels cheap I hate using that word because \"cheap\" implies like- I mean, there's a lot of negative connotation with that word But it just doesn't feel particularly premium, and when you hold other devices like an aluminum or a glass backed phone It's just - after using this for a week and switching back to a OnePlus even just picking up a OnePlus 6 Which isn't like a super premium phone, but it has good material design it feels so much more elegant and just more polished of a product the plastic on this device is Noticeably less premium when you pick it up, you know that it's a plastic device. Now, I do like the fact that it's plastic for a couple of reasons One, it keeps the cost down. But two, on the OnePlus 6 So this is something I've been using for a while When you drop an aluminum phone, forget about the fragility of glass, just the frame can dent quite easily I dropped this on the bathroom floor It's now dented and it looks, well, it's not a big deal, but it dents you drop this at that same height It wouldn't even leave a mark on the plastic. That's just the nature of a plastic phone It's more resilient to stuff like that. Other things. Other things I like, I like the face unlock up front It's a fast unlock and it has an infrared light for nighttime use I also like the stereo speakers and honestly that was surprising me I did not expect these to have stereo speakers Like when I looked at the original spec sheet But just my mind didn't even think that I would have stereo speakers and they sound good. They're loud. They're stereo And well, I like stereo speakers on my phone. I also like the battery life. It's a four thousand milliamp hour battery It's still not a comfortable 2-day battery, but you can easily do a full day of heavy use on a single charge the screen It's an IPS screen. Not an OLED. So the colors aren't as vibrant The blacks aren't as black. Like they're just not super inky You can tell that it's an IPS panel, but it's a really good IPS panel This is an aspect of the phone that I thought that would cheap out on the Pocophone is like $200 cheaper Than the OnePlus 6. The OnePlus 6 has a better screen. It's more vibrant It's an OLED panel, but the Pocophone has an amazing screen for the money. It's bright It's pretty color accurate and I wouldn't expect a screen like this on a $300 phone. The notch, however, is big I think it's actually bigger than the iPhone notch, and there's a pretty sizable chin on the bottom It's not an ugly look or anything It's just compared to other flagship devices that have like a Snapdragon 845 those are bigger but I mean for 300 bucks I let it slide the notification lights actually on the bottom and this actually took me a while to get used to I think it's because all the other Android phones I've used has had the notification light up top But this phone has it on the bottom just above the USB-C port so you just have to train your eye to look down there Instead of up top for that light There are some other deficiencies the big one for me is the lack of NFC So this phone does not support NFC payments and I guess it depends on where you live and what you do with your phone I'm someone that uses Google payments pretty regularly. I live in Canada. Most of the retailers out there support NFC payment So this phone doesn't have it I can't use it which is a bummer for me But I understand like the market that this phone was originally intended for maybe they don't have a lot of NFC enabled stuff So it would've been nice for this phone to have NFC but it doesn't the camera is also Expectedly weak. I'm not bothered by it I've been using a lot of budget phones recently particularly the OnePlus 6, which also doesn't have an amazing camera But the Pocophone F1 has a noticeably worse camera, particularly in low-light So for daylight photos, it's fine; the camera launches fast, the focusing is fast, but for low-light photos the Pocophone has quite a bit of grain in them. Okay software, it's running Xiaomi's MIUI, I don't love the software. It's just personal preference There's nothing inherently wrong with it and it has an app drawer, which is a little different for a Xiaomi phone But I just don't love the software. I'll probably run a launcher on this phone So the Pocophone F1 is an incredible value at 300 dollars It's gonna be very difficult to get a better phone for that kind of money that being said It's actually very difficult to get it at 300 bucks I think realistically speaking if you're gonna buy this in North America, you're gonna have to spend like 350 maybe 400 bucks to get this phone just because of import taxes and buying it from Asian websites and stuff It's still a good phone at $400 just as not a steal of a product The brand Pocophone. I think they have a bright future this is like the first phone Xiaomi did a great job on this thing and Yeah, if you're interested in this phone and you have 300 bucks, you're wondering if it's worth, it it absolutely is. Okay Hope you guys enjoy this phone- this video thumbs if you loved it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time",

    "transcript": "You know, most of the time, the guy who picks the lottery winner doesn't get to win the lottery. How did you end up with an AMD Ultimate Tech upgrade? Especially since you already stole one of the secret shopper PCs. Not to mention this TV, these dark plates, this miniature shoe, this IKEA blanket, and this Govee light that used to be in my house. It's a random draw, dude. The bingo ball handle, you can win too. Seriously though, what else could you possibly need? Your setup is already sick. Just some dog toys for Cuddy and some decoration. And that's not all. I see computer upgrades, a home DJ setup. Wait, I gotta admit, this was spoiled for me, but you got a gold grill. Did you carve the AMD logo into this? It's only fitting, right? Does it fit? Yeah, it's custom-made. Oh my god, just roll the intro. I can't believe I missed the most obvious stolen merch. Listen, he modeled for it, okay? He earned it. The computer may be stolen, but apparently beggars can be choosers. We're gonna be upgrading this first. You want me to put something on the counter? Not really, it's not my counter. I mean, who needs a static safe workplace when you can bring a static material and put it- Oop. Cut this so my landlord doesn't see it. As I mentioned, you guys might remember this PC from Secret Shopper 3. It's from Starforge, complete with Penis Rocket logo. It's not a f*** d***! For some reason, it's signed. Is this because we were gonna give it away or something and you... No, that's just for me. I'm just missing Shay's signature. So, Shay, hit me up. Funnily enough, Starforge was the only one to use a Radeon GPU in their system. So we're gonna be keeping this 6750 XT and just upgrading our platform with a, ooooh, 7800X3D, 3D vCache processor, this is as fast as it gets for gaming, some DDR5 memory, and of course, a matching motherboard. Shahrad, hum... question for you... Have you built a computer before? It's like, is that a thing you do or... I took the GPU out once and put it back in. Cool. Yeah. Oh, God, we're adding one of those EK AIOs. Chase won that at the Christmas party. This is like before my time, but he was nice enough to give it to me because he wasn't using it. So thanks, Chase. That Christmas party gift was like the smartest five grand that EK ever spent. The millions and millions and millions of views that they have gotten on these things. So if any brands watching this, we have a Christmas party this year. While Sharad tries to figure out how to remove the motherboard, AMD is giving three more of these away to some of you lucky viewers. All you have to do is follow the link in the description to enter. AMD's been killing it, both with continuing to sponsor this series that you guys all love and also giving you guys some pretty cool gear. Let's see how he's doing. Wait, you just removed the one screw that whole time? No, that was good. That was good. You know what? You can remove any cables you want. Just go for it. Just rip them off. Wait, you're not doing all that, the one. Well, you just-- No, I'm kidding. Okay. I warned you, I've never done this. Yeah, yeah, no, you're doing great. You're just gonna like Facebook marketplace this or whatever. Trash can's right there. You don't have to suck up to AMD. I know what's in there. All my homies love AMD. In the intro, you know how I was like, you know, the ball handler is not allowed to win the bingo or whatever, he handles the relationship with AMD for this series, so that's the context there. Hi Ray. Now for building up the new platform, tell me, have you at least ever watched one of our build videos? Yes. Okay, go. Nice. Motherboard goes first. Nice. Oh my God, wait. What? Why is there no socket cover on this motherboard? Elijah? I had asked Logistics to do a quick post test and I guess they forgot to put the cover on. Hold on, hold on. New role play, new role play. Okay, I'm Logistics. Okay, Shahrad, go ahead, drive the bus. No, it looks fine. It looks like it's fine. So normally a motherboard, oh, here it is. Oh, so maybe it was on, maybe it just. Normally a motherboard comes with a cover to protect these delicate pins that are in the CPU socket, but somehow this one came off and it's very easy for anything banging around in the box or someone accidentally handling it and mashing their fingers in the socket to completely mangle it and the cost. is so high to replace that socket that you might as well just buy a new motherboard in most cases. So that's a pretty stressful thing. I'm not stressed. You're stressed. I'm not stressed. Elijah is stressed. Nice haircut. They'll find out soon. Whoa, stop. Surely you can't put this CPU in without your AMD grill in. Now I have to confess, I don't know much about grills and grill culture, so you might have to explain this whole thing to me. You can either get your actual teeth pulled out and put gold teeth in there, or these go on top of your teeth. So they're like retainers made out of gold. I got Sebastian to use the Tormach machine to put a little tiny, tiny AMD logo. And the middle tooth. Okay. But backing up again, the idea behind the grill is just it looks sick. Oh, wow. It's like like a bit to get on there. Yeah, because it stays on. Oh my gosh. How much are these worth? Like $600. It's 14k gold. That's pretty good. Where are they from? Got grills. They got shipped from Houston, Texas. All right. Okay. What games do you play? Peggle. Peggle Deluxe or Peggle Extreme? Peggle Knights. That one, I've been playing Skyrim for 13 years. Nice. I still play it. I only got a PC like this year. I used to play on my PS5. Yeah, okay. A lot of Red Dead 2. Cool. A little bit of, I think it goes right side up, right? Oh yeah. Right side up is definitely a plus. Yeah, I see the little arrow. Nice. Yeah, you gotta give her a little bit on this. Boom. There you go. Look at that. There goes the dynamite. All right, let's put this back together. Wow, a man after my own heart. Putting things away as we go and keeping the workspace tidy. You got clean as you go, right? I'm impressed. I worked in a kitchen. What kitchen did you work in? It used to be called Mags 99. It used to be at KFC Taco Bell, but someone bought it and then started making real food in it. Speaking of fried chicken, here are the rams. See, you guys think segueing is easy, I just make it look easy. So here's what I know about RAM, just watching the videos. I know you're supposed to go in odd or even channels, one and three or two and four. Two and four are the first ones. It does technically vary from board to board. You know what? We're gonna check. Yo, stickers. Got little dragons on it. My God, they do not include a paper manual with this mother word. We're gonna go two and four, it's probably two. Or logistics could have lost it, right? How's that second bus logistics? You know, logistics are unsung heroes, okay? They get so little, they get so little time in the sun, okay? They do so much for us. What is wrong with you people? Was that open or did you open that? I don't know, might have been logistics. Doesn't matter which way. Oh yeah. I'm assuming since that side doesn't have stickers and it's pointed to the camera, I'm assuming it goes this way, right? Fun fact, I believe he is actually right. That is not how to landmark memory, but I have noticed a pattern that the vast majority of the time, the sticker is toward the CPU socket, which makes it more photogenic. It's got to look good. Would you like to know how to actually know how to put it in? You just kind of... Oh, I mean, yeah, no, I mean how to tell, how to tell though. Like the notch isn't in the middle. Oh! One side's long, one side's short, always. Yeah, so like you're supposed to line it up, but like, no, that, dude, that works. Yeah, good job. Guess now's a good time to shout out the RAM, since I can so conveniently read the sticker from this side. DDR5 6000, CL30, 32 gigs. You could load in lots of Skyrim mods. All of them. Do you play modded Skyrim? I have started, yeah, since getting a PC. Wait. It's way easier. You played like 10 years of Skyrim without modding it? Yes. Let's get this in the case. While we're on that, do you wanna do something other than call out logistics? Sure. Maybe you could light some incense? Actually, please don't. I'm sorry, but-- We got incest here. This one's called Jamaican girl. Yeah. Also money. Also where you at? Why don't you set up, I don't know, where's the DJ set up gonna go? On the Calix. Calix is part of the upgrade actually, but I know we hate furniture, so I took the liberty of putting it together beforehand. Perfect. Okay. So why don't you, that. Yes sir. At least the logistics kept this manual. That's gonna be the running gag in this video. You started it by driving the bus. Glen, I have a task for you. Go back to logistics, give them an opportunity to save their piece after we're done shooting here, okay? Because they deserve it. They work hard. I know. And these guys don't respect it. I was in logistics. I was in logistics. I was in logistics. See, it was there. Just fell off in transit. I legitimately, like, I made a boo-boo on that. What am I doing wrong here? Oh, yeah. It is tradition to check and make sure there's nothing under the motherboard before we put it down. There's cables. Yeah, there's cables. All right, I'll give you a hand. Why don't you go show Elijah where you want your DJ stuff? I'm just gonna get the motherboard installed. What even is this? This is a DJ controller, FLX4. I'm not like a professional or anything. I'm just gonna like have fun at home. So this is like more than enough. The cool thing, it has smart effects while you're mixing. It helps, it's like training wheels. And it also has smart fader. So it beat matches the two decks together automatically when you're fading in between songs, so. And then I also unboxed this Mix 5. It's actually pretty useful 'cause everything's basically gonna go through this. 'Cause this whole calyx is going to be like a music setup, because we're gonna have so many things going through the same set of speakers and subwoofer, this is gonna bring everything together and put everything through at the same time, all in one place. Oh, cool, okay. So we're gonna have that. Oh my god, Elijah, please don't lose those pieces. Where'd it go? Oh god. That's a sampler, drum machine sequencer, all in one type of thing. Yeah. It looks like Lego. It does. It kind of does, especially with these little pieces that go on. No, hold on. That's the wrong one, brother. They're color-coded. Another audio source. A sound burger. Yes, sir. So I saw that at CES this year, and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. What is it? It's a record player. Oh! I think they originally released these in like the 80s or something and they... What, records? No, no. I think they've been around a lot longer since the 80s, but that's fine. That moment when Elijah schools you about history. Got him. He doesn't know anything. What case? Anyways, they released a very limited number of them a couple of years ago and they sold out immediately so they kind of made it a permanent thing in their lineup. This pops open. You got the needle. You kind of like click out. You put the record in here and then this goes on top of the record to like kind of hold it in place. Shut it. Turn it on. Oh, so it's battery as well? Yep. So it has, I think it's 12 hours battery and it has Bluetooth so you can just like take it anywhere. Shahrad, I've got your motherboard in and I've decided after watching you for a while I'm just going to keep going. That is the smart choice I would say. So why don't you guys learn about coffee? I used to have a espresso machine before and it was semi-automatic. But it was kind of a pain in the ass to upkeep and clean. This one's fully automatic. It grinds the coffee, packs the shot, pulls the shot, and dumps the little puck in a little bin that you can dump out yourself. What is one of these worth? This looks crazy expensive. $850. Worth it. Is that Canadian rubles or is that like $800? Canadian, Canadian. Okay, so like $600. Something like that, yeah. Hey look, look who it is! It's Reece from Logistics. Were your ears burning? I guess so. So I'm told, at least. Who was the one that did the test boot with this motherboard? I don't know. Probably Jamie. Okay, so he's throwing Jamie under the bus. Okay, it's just Jamie from Logistics then. No, these guys are on a team. He would never throw Jamie under the bus. He's answering a direct question. Why are you forcing him? Putting him in this, putting him in this uncomfortable situation. These fans are gonna go on top again? Nope. Why not? Well, I put the EK Vardar ones that came with your AIO in the front. See? Yeah. And then I was lazy. But that's less RGB. I want RGB. Fine. What's gonna quietly not put them back in? But fine, fine, fine. Not on my watch. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Sorry, what? What? Well, I'm just checking what is on your watch. Oh, speaking of watches. Oh, did you get a new watch? I did. Oh, look at that. Okay. What'd you get? I got the new Apple Watch Ultra 2. Oh, wow. Because, and hear me out, because you just like throwing money away. That and also the bigger battery because honestly, it's a pain point for me. Look at that. That's beautiful. The humane pin looks better. Wow, it's really heavy. You shut your mouth. You seem to be over your $5,000 budget. By like $60 Canadian, Elijah. I'll put the sheet on screen. Oh, we never put the SSD in there. Linus is on lunch. It's all you. What was that? Oh, yeah, we might need a fan splitter. Do you know if Linus took one out? Okay, well, just do your best. It doesn't look the greatest, but I think once it's up against the wall, it's pretty good. Of course you're the type of guy who would buy a gold grill. We draped this across the front. Oh it's like almost perfect! I didn't need to do any of that cable management, we could have just hung ice spice. We're doing the Govee TV lights right now. I'll wish home theater a video that we did at Linus's house. We put this on his TV and I liked it. Thank you, Govee. Shout out to Hershey. Keep this in, editor. Editor, keep this in. Thank you, Hershey. You wanna see the Elijah special, Glenn? Best part about modern cases? Solid back panel. Please do not tell Linus. He will check it. It's way cooler when it's darker and it's an actual movie that you're watching. I feel like this is pretty cool to demonstrate it, right? These are the headphones I got for the DJ controller. By the company... Aiaiai They make cool modular headphones. Modular headphones? So you go onto our website and basically pick and choose what parts you want. This specific setup was $140. I don't know about you, but I chew through headphones. Why? I thought that was Cudi's job. We both do. Okay. Like father like son. And the beauty of these is you can replace the specific parts so you don't have to get a whole new set of headphones. Oh no, he just stabbed the cable with his cactus, bro. Oh no, it's like in there. You know, for $150, you can buy a pretty good set of headphones. These feel super cheap, but I think it's because they have the modularity to them. So I will judge it based on how they sound, but they don't look over the top special. It's on purpose too though. 'Cause for DJing, you want something lightweight and like, so you don't like really feel it on your head. 'Cause you're listening to it for like hours possibly. Exactly, right? So this is like a pretty lightweight setup and it's like one of their cheapest setups that they have too. And y'all thought Collin couldn't speak. Using his fingers. That's crazy. Damn! Leave it. lttstore.com What is the aero disc? Oh, those are for his car. Oh no, you did not get like spinners, did you? I wish, I wish. I actually did look for spinners like really hard, but apparently they don't really make them anymore in 2024. Good. Remember the old rally cars that had the little salad spinners on their wheels. The way they worked, they would pull air, they would act like a turbine and pull air through the brakes to cool them better. And then wheels themselves were designed like that. These are add-ons that Rotiform makes. I always wanted white wheels, but I was terrified of washing them. This way I can have white wheels and I can just pull them off and clean them. That sits on the wheel. Yeah. And they got these machined aluminum Whoa. Caps that go in the middle. Whoa, buddy. Okay, those look kind of cool. Okay, even I like these. Woo! Damn, that's a big nut. Whoa, watch this, you're gonna love my nuts. Now, that's my generation. I mean, yeah. There we go, you're good. So just hold that in place. Yeah, and then do you want the black one? No, no, no, the black one doesn't fit. You mean it doesn't fit. Because the threads are shorter 'cause that one has to go deeper. You know what, Shahrad? I like the way it looked before. Yeah, 'cause you got no taste. Yeah, this looks really stupid, dude. Like, this looks like you like didn't take the PDI, like, sticker off the wheel or something. Looking great is very much, you know, an opinion. They're like buttholes. We all got one. Looking great is like buttholes? I mean, I would agree with that. No, opinions, opinions. In this case, I think you're onto something. Well, I don't know. My car also exists. Very true. This man drives around in Barney and is criticizing my wheels. It's a shame because I really like the rest of your car's look. You know what, Shahrad? Maybe in motion. Maybe in motion is better. Why don't you get in? Get in. They wobble. That's a pretty fine job, Elijah. Thanks, sir. Yeah, it's nice that Starforge did all the cable management for you. In all seriousness, I cut out most of it because they had everything wrapped up so tight back there, which is not a bad thing. Take this off. Please do not tell Linus. Yeah, I did it all back up as well. Why is your awkward energy so high? Wasn't one of the things you guys were gonna do while I was at that meeting, cable managing this desk? No. Did you really just put two cable ties on here and call it a day? Oh, that- Did Shahrad really steal these cable ties from the office? No. Big moment. Let's see if this thing still- Oh, hi, hi. Yeah, you forgot about me. I think he thinks I'm also a dog 'cause I'm so yappy. I mean, you do have the dog in you. AMD 7800X3D with 3D cash. Thanks AMD. I'm having a hell of a time. Now do a smile, show your grill. This is great. I'm not complaining. Okay, fight someone in here. All right. Here we go. You're not a guard. Fight a woman or something. Why not? Fight someone you can beat. Are you even hitting him? Yeah, he's losing health. You can see it at the top. Okay, so why don't we play an AMD certified game here? Something from the last, you know, decade. Have you played Halo Infinite at all? Sure. Okay, I love Master Chef. Is it too late to repo all this stuff? Technically, no. It's technically still company property. Oh, you didn't launch it, so now we get to wait 25 minutes. For shaders to cache. Jesus Christ, how many things does it load? I'm not getting any younger here. We might leave a little bit of a context for that in the floatplane cut. Lmg.gg/floatplane. Maybe not. I'm not gonna promise it. Have you ever played Halo? I was a PlayStation boy, so no. Oh! Let's go! How did you manage to get a kill plane like this? Do you even strafe, bro? Listen, if it works, it works. That's your teammate, that's your teammate. Don't worry about it! There's no friendly fire, so who cares? Yes, there is! You don't even check corners, brother! Don't worry! Listen! Has it been detrimental? No! Dude, you march across open spaces! You don't even check anything! Am I vibing? Yes! Yay! Yeah, get wrecked. Okay, what kind of drink do you want? I don't drink coffee. We can do a latte. Yeah, that's coffee. So this is the outro, so. Yeah, I'm trying to understand the point. You asked us all to get on the couch and have mugs. Yeah. Well, 'cause Shahrad was drinking coffee in the beginning. Right, so we're just reflecting on what a nice upgrade this was. Thanks, AMD. Upgraded dog, upgraded DJ. Upgraded car. Upgraded coffee. Side-graded car. Downgraded car. Upgraded PC. I can't wait for this to be a 10 out of 10 on YouTube. In our analytics dashboard, 10 out of 10 is mad. Very. Editor, just delete the video. You can still get AMD to pay though, right? Yeah. Yeah, all right, then it's fine. Thanks AMD. Thanks AMD. Appreciate you. See you at the next upgrade, guys. We didn't throw. Do you want to throw to a video? Oh yeah. If you guys enjoyed this one, oh God. Matthews? Sure. That's all you got to say.",

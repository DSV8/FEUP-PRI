    "transcript": "guys we're here with another video for another Intel processor launch so this is the 18 core 36 threaded Core i9-9980XE extreme edition CPU and it's gonna set you back $2,000 let's be honest this thing is geared towards a very specific niche so let's cut to the chase and discuss why exactly this exists in the currency of the market right after this hello I'm looking for some fans well are you married yeah I have a ring what is your favorite number I would say 3 do I have the perfect fan for you this is the new thermal tech ring trio 12 fans with good static pressure for radiators it is a beautiful frame with double side and center ring illumination with soft and super bright spill with razor chrome and compatibility control it through your smartphone the RGB plus software on the PC or Amazon Alexa well I'm gonna take these home perhaps you should to check them out in description below alright so first things first don't start thinking that these new 9000 series names with these new high-end CPUs means a completely new architecture because they're not in fact Intel is still using the same underlying 14 nanometer static-x design because there hasn't been a significant or there hasn't been any significant changes from when those CPUs were launched more than a year ago as a matter of fact Intel is calling these new CPUs products formerly known as skylake instead of giving them a new name now right away you can see that the i9 9980XE 9960X, and the 9940X will be direct replacements for the older generation they come with some frequency increases optimizations to cache and soldered Tim that's supposed to lower temperatures oh and they have exactly the same prices I do have to mention that Intel has revised turbo management on the cpus they're now able to hit higher sustained clocks for longer periods of time particularly when all cores are used and that's one of the reasons why the 9980XE base clock has increased by 400 megahertz just note that the maximum turbo 3.0 rate has only increased by a hundred megahertz across the board looking at the 9920X and things start to get in sting it has more smart cash and also offers a huge 600 megahertz base clock boost versus the 7920X but those increases come at a cost of higher power consumption pricing remains at $1,200 and guys that's still really expensive when you figure the AMD 2950X goes for around $900 when we start looking at the other new skylake- processors there's some weird stuff happening with specifications and pricing but I think that's to make sure that Intel's 9900k has some room the 9900X keeps the 7900X's thousand dollar price but it gets a ton more cash and a bit higher clock speeds now the 9820X is a really odd CPU and I have to wonder why it's even around it has the same 10 core layout as the 9900X but it has lower clock speeds and cost just $100 less sure it doesn't offer a lot more than the 7820X and it actually has 44 CPU PCI lanes but what's the use of this processor I just don't get it the additional PC a capability cores and cache are awesome but that price is just way too high as usual Intel dangles a carrot in front of you and then hits you with a stake I actually think the 9800X is the 7820X is real replacement since it also goes for around $600 but with the 1900K around on a less expensive platform the only benefit I see here would be running full-speed dual GPU solutions alright guys so you now know what the whole new lineup is all about but I have to be a bit critical on how Intel's approaching this launch you see they sent us this you know $2000 18 core monstrosity instead of sending as the lower tier variants within the Refresh skylake excellent because I feel like those CPUs are a little bit more interesting to me personally considering that there's so lower-priced when you compare to what AMD sample says they send us everything from the 32 core all the way down to the 12 core variants so that it gives us a full picture on what AMD is offering for their price and it seems like Intel solely wants us to focus on their super expensive flagship component and I think that's a huge mistake because it gives us whole lineup and all priced feel now you might actually end up buying those other CPUs for more in-depth testing but it just would have been nice to have the full picture right at launch now before I get into the bench I want to explain some of the results you are about to see here we first noticed some odd performance since the 1980s see wasn't hitting Intel's stated frequencies but after updating the Intel IME and turbo 3.0 drivers the system behaved like we expected let's start with the 9980XE during a long blender test basically it's hitting a pretty constant 3.8 gigahertz and remember the base clock here is supposed to be three gigahertz but there's extra thermal Headroom since the Noctua Nhu 14s kept temperatures below seventy five degrees Celsius that meant until turbo technology could bump frequencies while it tried to hit maximum power input it's pretty cool stuff now moving on to prime95 and the results here are very different from blender here the CPU was still around 75 degrees Celsius but it also just had three point three gigahertz that's because prime also stressed the cache and memory controllers instead of focusing on just a CPU cores and FPU units like blender this causes the CPU package to hit its power limit so even though there's thermal Headroom clock speeds are lower I also ran a quick single core test and you can see that the turbo boost 3.0 is working exactly as advertised with clocks at about 4.5 gigahertz pretty often so that's what's happening behind the scenes guys and I know a lot of you guys in our previous video mentioned that you wanted to see the full set up so here it is now as you're watching or as you're going through these benchmarks I do want to mention that other than the non stock memory speeds we made sure to turn off all motherboard enhancements during all these tests so there you guys have it and I have to say the performance increases on the 9980XE over the 7980XE can be impressive in the right circumstances now the issue is that the improvements are a bit narrowly focused on multi-core enhancements so this could potentially be beneficial for professionals who would like to take advantage of you know who'd like the most amount of cores at the higher clock speeds but you know for things like gaming and photo editing it's it's honestly or it's just pretty much impossible for me to recommend the 9980XE or just any skylake-X CPU's at the moment you're actually much better off investing in a coffee like CPU or even a second-generation Rison processor the other issue with the 9980XE is that it seems to operate without even acknowledging the 2950X now I get it that processor has four less threads but it's $1100 less I'll repeat that it's $1100 cheaper but for those professionals who need every ounce of multi-tier performance to save time on renderings or increased productivity the 9980XE may be beneficial but then again there's also the thirty-two core thread repair 2990WX which also costs less than this thing and what about power consumption well this CPU is a hungry boy since Intel's 40 nanometer process is having some issues keeping up with aim these 12 nanometer technology 344 watts is a lot of juice guys and the last thing that I want to mention here is pricing because these Intel CPUs rarely hit the price that they give us right before lunch and the blame for that can obviously be shared between the retailers and Intel but it's funny how aimed these products you know the pricing remains consistent with both reviews and retailers so you know under saying so that's pretty much it guys and I just want to leave you guys with a little preview on where our journey with this processor will go next",

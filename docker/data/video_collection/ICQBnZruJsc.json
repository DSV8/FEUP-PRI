    "transcript": "Today, we're introducing three revolutionary products in this class. The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls. The seconds is a revolutionary mobile phone. And the third is a breakthrough internet communicator. An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator. An iPod, a phone... are you getting it? These are not three separate devices; this is one device. The reveal of the original iPhone at Macworld 2007 has already gone down in history as one of the greatest product announcements of all time and its used as an example to teach intel property strategy, marketing, and public speaking classes in universities around the world. The fruits of that first iPhones existence are obviousand even if you hate Appleyou have to give them credit for forming the principles of what the modern smartphone would become. Look no further than the smartphones that existed before the iPhone and the smartphones after the iPhone. Look no further than the 2007 Android prototype contrasted to the HTC Dream on which Android debuted... nearly two years after the announcement of the original iPhone. But the 2007 iPhone wasnt technically Apples first phone announcement. There's one more thing about iTunes that we're announcing today. You've probably heard about this. Today, we're introducing the iTunes phone. Weird, right? Well, not really. The iTunes Phone became known as the ROKR... and Steve Jobs announced the ROKR at a time when the iPod made up 45% of Apples revenue. For a company that just a few years prior had been on the verge of bankruptcy, the iPod was Apples muchneeded saving grace and its market dominance was irrefutable. But Apple knew that the market segment they triumphed was not long for the world as multipurpose devices from Blackberry, Palm, and others began integrating competent music playback capabilitiesnot to mention the bevy of other features that the singlepurpose iPod simply couldnt match. So Apple began working on their own multipurpose device in summer of 2004. You may remember this little clip from the 2007 iPhone reveal.... Whats truly funny about that is Apple had indeed designed and tested a number of cellularcapable iPods (clickwheel and all) as early as summer 2004. But rather than expand on Tony Fadells iPod team, Jobs decided to work with Scott Forstalls Macintosh team in shrinking down OS X to a touchscreen based smartphone. Thanks to the 2012 Apple vs. Samsung trial, we ended up seeing nearly 40 different completed, industrial templates Apple had considered for the original iPhone. But look, its 2005 and the iPhone is still years away from a public unveiling. So what does Apple do to make sure the iPod functionality isnt replaced by new phones? They partner with one of the biggest names in phones, of course. Well actually, that isnt really an of course at all as it was very unJobsian to partner with other companies, but Motorola was absolutely killing it in the mid2000s with hits like the RAZR of which Jobs was famously a fan. But this hopeful partnership ended in ruins despite a massive marketing campaign with dozens of famous artists endorsing the device. Why? Well, I bought one to find out and boy... is it bad. I wish I still had my Moto RAZR (which was my first phone ever) to compare to this thing because they dont even look like theyre from the same decade and yet, the RAZR was 18 months older than the ROKR. The design of the ROKR looks pretty badit was a rebranded lowend candybar phone Motorola had already been selling for about 2 years without music functionality. It feels cheap and plasticy in general, the T9 keys are extremely wobbly, and the display is pretty dismal and small even for the era. The 0.3 megapixel camera produces some of the worst digital images Ive ever seen (and thats even comparing it to other phones on the market at the time), and the software is bad. And no... Im not really even talking about Motorolas software as that was pretty similar to all of Motorolas phones at the time. Im talking about iTunes. Or so they called it. When you hit the dedicated iTunes button on the front of the phone, a very familiar UI comes up. It looks like an iPod not iTunes. And similar to an iPod, you couldnt purchase, download, or manage songs on the device itself so thats definitely closer to an iPod than iTunes. But boy... it sure isnt an iPod either. Music was stored on a microSD card that hid itself along with the fullsized SIM card underneath the removable battery at the back of the device. Most variants of the phone shipped with a 512MB microSD card with support for up to a 1GB card but the storage capacity was nearly irrelevant because the device had a softwarelimited 100 song cap. While I couldnt find definitive proof, it seems that certain regions outside the US may have even had a 50 song cap. The reasons for doing this seem pretty obvious to me... Apple didnt want people buying the ROKR over an iPod. The song cap could entice those who didnt have an iPod to get the real thing and for those that did, the ROKR would act as an iPod togo when they didnt have their fullsize music player on hand. But the convenience of the iPod software decreased significantly with such a limited library size, the 4way toggle was vastly inferior to the scroll wheel making navigating the UI a pretty poor experience, and syncing songs to iTunes was painful with only USB 1 support making it slower than competing iPods at transferring music. The DAC and headphone amp inside is a lot worse than iPods of the era and it sounds pretty poor even on easytodrive headphonesand given that this thing was announced the same day as iPod nano, it was doomed from the start. The nano was at the time impossibly small, inexpensive, and competentnone of which could be said about the ROKR. Jobs himself had some trouble with the software during the demo and he was less than pleased... \"Yeah, I'll talk to you later, thanks bye.\" So, I go there and I jus... resume my music back to where it was... well I was supposed to resume my music right back to where it was... Steves face says it all and the relationship soured pretty quickly. Moto blamed Apple. Vice versa. Apple even went so far as to remove support for the ROKR after iTunes 7just one full version laterand I needed to pull out my old PowerBook G4 running Tiger to set this thing up. Thats a stark contrast from the iPod. Every iPod ever made remains supported in the latest version of iTunes. Including the iPod mini which I unboxed with Austin Evans. You should definitely check that out if you havent seen it. The ROKR was a weird little hiccup in Apples otherwise excellent trackrecord during the first decade of the new millennium and look, Im no expert, but I think they turned out okay. Apple, that is. Goodbye Moto. And goodbye to you! Please subscribe if you enjoyed this video and share it with your friends. Thanks for watching, and as always, stay snazzy!",

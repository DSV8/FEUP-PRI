    "transcript": "- Hey guys, welcome to day one at CES. I'm Justine and this is Jenna. - Hello. - It's me, Jenna E. We are heading to get our Uber right now. This is really riveting content. CES vlog starting now! We're looking for a Ford Explorer. Can you fit in here? - [Driver] Another drop-off? - [Woman] Keep it moving! Got a line behind you! - Wow. Hey, get a cool shot of the fog! Man, I'm freezin'! I hope I'm going the right way. (exciting orchestral music) Okay, let's go! So the first place that we're heading, Jenna, we were heading to the Mercedes booth. They have a press event right now. And then after that we're gonna be heading to Samsung. And then in between that, I don't know what's gonna happen. Your guess is as good as mine. We have 15 minutes to find where we need to be. You guys have to see what Nick looks like right now. (Justine giggles) Good thing you shaved your head! (electronic music) - This year what happens in Las Vegas won't stay in Las Vegas. - So we just got out of the Mercedes-Benz press event. And a lot of you guys don't even know what car I drive, but I have a GLE 43. I've been a huge Mercedes fan pretty much my entire life. My grandmother, she drove a diesel Mercedes. It was like a 1970-something. That was my first car. So I feel like for me Mercedes has a huge place in my life. So this is an example of the new dashboard. This is the MBUX, which is the new interface for Mercedes. I love that it's like this huge screen that is basically taking over your dashboard. They have all new updated graphics and one of the things that I love the most is it has natural intuitive language, so you can actually have a conversation with your car. - Hey, Mercedes, it's too hot in here. Can you make it more East Coast? - [Mercedes] I am setting the temperature to 62 degrees. (electronic music) - Okay, we gotta find booth 26002. It's in the south hall. - This is not it. - No, but look, it says this way to south hall! - 'Cause you're going backwards, we gotta go this way. - No, there's an exit over here that takes you-- - [Man] Hi, Justine. - Hi, how are you? - How are you? - Good, how are you doing? - Good, thank you. Do you know where the south hall is? Is it this way or is it this way? - South hall is out that way. - As an added bonus, this year at CES there are torrential downpours. It hasn't rained in 118 days in Las Vegas. We're not even going that far. South hall, correct? - Up the stairs. - Okay, thank you! - We're not... We're here. It's not that way. (indie music) - So we've been going the wrong way? (Justine laughs) Oh god, is it funny? 'Cause I'm laughing. I'm laughing but I'm not laughing. This is like my seventh CES, you'd think I'd get a handle on things. (indie music) So four hours later we finally made it to the DJI booth. They announced two things here at CES. The new Ronin-S and the Osmo Mobile 2. So first, let's check out the Ronin-S. - Basically it's a single, handheld DLSR-type system. It's so powerful that it can carry a heavier bokeh lens or a heavier camera setup. Press and hold 'til the indicator turns it yellow and then you can do all kinds of pivoting without compromising the performance. - Okay, sport mode, as if that's not one of my favorite features in any drone, you've got it here. This is incredible. How does it work if we wanna do a selfie vlogging stick? - Triple tap this trigger, it will instantly spin the camera around to do the selfie thing. - That's awesome, so kinda just like the Osmo does. - Yes. (electronic music) - So this is the Osmo Mobile 2. You guys may have seen, I've definitely talked about the one before, but there are a bunch of differences between this. Mostly the price. The original Osmo was 299. This one, wait for it... 129. You can use it vertical, you can use it horizontal, and another thing that is pretty awesome-- Hold on, I have it in active track right now so it's trying to track you. So much like the original Osmo, if you triple tap it'll switch to selfie mode. Triple tap we're gonna go back. So right here on the side we have a zoom, which is pretty awesome. And this is all happening realtime in the app. There's also a little joystick right here where you can use that to navigate. And you can always hit the trigger which is now right here as opposed to it used to be right here on the front. The battery is built into this one and you can get about 15 hours of battery life. And that'll take about two and a half hours to charge. I'm pretty sure with 15 hours I can probably get a full day of vlogging. (electronic music) This is something that we actually saw the other day and it was making headline news and people are really excited. I've also ran into some people today that said this is so far one of their favorite things at CES. This is the DJI Copilot. Can you tell us a little more about it? - Yeah, so LaCie developed this device for us. It's called the DJI Copilot. Portable, it has a battery built in, so you don't need a PC, essentially, to take any data off of it. So what you do is any camera that you have, any drone that you have, you're capturing the data, you're putting it on the SD card. You then take the SD card, pop it into the new Copilot drive. - [Justine] So this has a little display on it too. - Yeah, so there's an display. So it's got a six hour battery, you can adjust the data through an SD port, through a USBC, or the USB 3.0 jack. And then all that data then you can manage through an iOS device. It has a lightning cable, you plug it into your iPad Pro or your iPhone, and then you'll be able to then bring that data over to your phone or device and then you'll be able to edit on the fly. - That's awesome. So would I be able to copy data from here to another hard drive? - You can. (gasps) - Oh! (laughs) Wow! - And then if your device is running low, like your iPhone there, you can actually use it as a battery pack. - Oh my gosh. This is incredible. Can I touch it? - Absolutely. - So you guys know how many of those, the orange LaCie drives that I have. I mean, an abundance. But I feel like this is such an incredible solution especially for traveling, on the go. Even here at CES, we've been shooting so much stuff it'd be great to have that as a backup. So is there an internal hard drive in here already? - There is, yeah. - So it's two terabytes? - Two terabytes, the mechanical drive. I think it's a 7200 RPM, if you wanna get technical with it. So you can hit yes and just click it once. And now it's suggesting. - That's amazing. - This is a nice pretty DJI logo there. - [Justine] Wow, look at this. Now is there a specific app that it uses? - [Man] There is an app coming. It has not been officially released yet. So that'll be coming I think when this ships in March. - Wow, and do you guys have a release date? Do it on March 20th, that's my birthday. - Okay. - I appreciate it. I'll let you guys know. - Sounds good. - I'll invite you to my birthday party. Just having a really great fancy meal here at CES. A plate of meat, some coffees, some cookies. This is living the dream. - Uh-uh! - Okay. Just one bite. I'm so happy. Thank you. That was really a good bite. (electronic music) We're gonna be doing a booth tour of the new Samsung booth here! It's a little bit different than previous years because they're not focusing on just one thing. They're focusing on the connectivity and interaction of all of the things altogether. And it's really loud so I don't even know if you can hear me but let's just head in and see what we can see. This right here I think is the highlight so far of my CES. This is The Wall, it's the new Samsung television. It was announced here at CES. It's 8K, 146-inch micro-LED television and let me tell you what, this thing is beautiful. Pretty sure this is something that I need in my life immediately. Can you imagine playing Mario Kart on this thing? (gasps) A dream come true. One of the things that I like that Samsung is doing is they're kind of bringing all of the things that you may already have and bringing it into the Samsung ecosystem. So they're basically connecting things that you already have that aren't necessarily Samsung and being able to connect them to everything. This is like an exploration of my house right now. This rear view mirror is not a mirror at all. It's a display and there are cameras and sensors all around this vehicle to give you a much more accurate depiction of what's happening around your car. I'm a terrible driver. This is something that I need in my life immediately. I'm not talking to myself, I promise. (laughs) I look so silly. Okay so we're here, CES 2018, if you haven't been able to tell already. And I've met some new friends here at CES and we're gonna just go around this lovely little circle here and say what your favorite thing is that you've seen so far. - Mine is The Wall TV, it seems really awesome. Pretty cool stuff. - Razer has this massive mechanical keyboard, it's quite interesting. - Did you see the Razer phone that connects to the laptop? - No, I need to see that. - That looks amazing. - Look at that. It's here, they got it. - Oh yes! This is it! Did you see it in action? - Yeah. - Yeah. - [Justine] Really? Tell us about it. - Well no, that's not my favorite thing, but that is really, really cool. It's super fast. - But what was your favorite thing? - DJI and LaCie have done this whole, it's called the Copilot. You don't need your laptop, you just copy straight to there. - Your memory card's full, you can just take it out, plug it in there, upload it, everything's there. (electronic music) - Here in the home appliance area of the Samsung booth there is a lot going on. There's a lot of food and there's a lot of tech. Those are basically two of my favorite things. Something that I thought was very, very interesting is you can use Bixby, take a picture of your food, and it will give you your calorie count. And not only that, it'll take you over here to your connected refrigerator. It'll show you the picture that you took from your phone, it'll integrate into the fridge, it'll show you the picture that you took and it will give you suggestions on things to cook for dinner. So say you're trying to reach a 2,000 calorie goal, it'll give you examples of things that you should eat for the rest of the day to meet that goal. Something else that I saw was pretty incredible, if you wanna cook that meal, you can preheat the oven using your refrigerator. This is gonna elevate my cooking videos to some level. It'll be a tech level, but is the cooking gonna be good? Probably not. So behind me is the Samsung Family Hub refrigerator. You guys have seen similar things to this before, I've talked about it and I think it's fantastic, and my fridge does not look this immaculate. You guys have seen inside of it and it's a mess. But what's cool about this is there's cameras on the inside. As you can see them here right here. He took out some celery and now the photo is updated to show you what is currently in the fridge. Takes about eight seconds, you should always know what's in your fridge. So that's our Samsung booth tour here at CES 2018. Let me know if you guys have a favorite thing. What is something that you are most looking forward to that was announced here at CES, or that you've seen here at the Samsung booth? That's it, I'll see you guys in some more CES videos. Time to go see some more cool stuff. (electronic music)",

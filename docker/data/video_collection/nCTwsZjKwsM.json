    "transcript": "- For almost two years, Matt here has coordinated the procurement for everyone else's Intel extreme tech upgrades. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Well, not today because it's finally time. We are giving Matt a $5,000 tech makeover. He's got a core i5, he's got an RTX graphics card. He's got a turntable speaker system and an iPad? What is this? - There you go. - But also bribery to ensure that I won't dig around too much and find all the stolen goods. Two bite brownies. Is this actually part of the upgrade? - No, just for you. - They're not really two bite. - No. - All right, I'm gonna dig around. I'm gonna find everything. I'm pretty sure this soundbar is from the office. - You have to find a tag don't you. - I'm sure you're smart enough to take off the tags, but I am damn sure that this thing's from the office. - Even better yet. It is. It just never was inventoried. But then I still bought it off. - It was never inventoried. - It was an extra. Right before I started, they sent two of the exact same ones and one went into a video according to Jamie and the other one didn't. - So you did me a favor is what you're saying. - Yeah. - Uh huh. A man of culture, I see. When you walk into a house and you see a Wii sensor bar, you know they're a true gamer. Wow. That's a pretty good Wii game collection too. I love it. This is awesome. Definitely not bootleg this one - No, that one was just the resale copy. We have a lot of extras because uh.. - You have two copies of Wii fit. How fit do you need to be? - Not fit at all, because we don't have the sensor bar here. We don't have the board anymore. But the bigger thing is that this was my Wii which I have still the memory card in here for the GameCube games. But I also home brewed it. So I had like the occasional N64 game on there. - Nice. - Which doesn't matter anymore because of Nintendo switch online. - Oh yeah. It's a good service Nintendo switch online. - It feels more right. Doing it the broken way than doing it the paid way. - This fridge is almost certainly stolen. I don't know if anyone would actually buy one of these Dyson things. That's gotta be from the office. - No, I bought it. - Oh. When you don't have AC, you kind of get desperate. And when it's app controlled, it's even better. - You know they have fans. They have a thing in the middle that goes like this. - Yeah, but that one matches the floors better. It's all about the aesthetic. - I can't tell if you're serious right now. - Oh, no. I'm a hundred percent serious. We bought this one simply for the fact that it has like the formaldehyde detection, cuz it's the fancier one. - Well, that's cool. Okay. That's not what you said before. What you said before was that it matched the floors. - But that was the main reason. - You big liar. - That's the first one. - Not gonna lie. I think you're mostly clean. These ugreen cables are almost certainly stolen from the office. - Amazon purchase. - Really? - Yep. - Okay. - That one is obviously. - Got an asset tag on it - So I've been loaning this one, cuz I want to purchase one and now I have an actual one that's on pre-order and it's just hiding in this bag. - Wait it's on pre-order or it's in a bag? - Nope. There's this exact one coming. But this one is unfortunately - From the office. - The blue color way, you'll see is a theme very soon. - Are you going to play for us? - Uh... Probably in the exclusive. - In the exclusive. - Yeah, because I used to play in a band for about six years. - Wow, okay. - And they're still running strong back home in Winnipeg. And so. - They gave you the boot, hey? - I kind of left them. They thought I was going solo. No. - One thing I noticed when we were back in the study, there isn't a computer we're replacing. - No, there's just a brand new build happening because when I first applied for this job, I typed up my entire resume using decks, because my laptop just died. There's an old video back where we had what do the people at LMG use in between Intel upgrades? My running joke was my whole PC is the Xbox because it has edge on it. - I see, okay. - So up until then it was simply a USBC cable, as you saw, with a dongle, with a motion keyboard running DeX that got me to this point. - We could do better. Where are we gonna set up to build? - We could either use this table or that table depends where you want to sit. - Oh, where I wanna sit. - Yeah. - Oh, you think I'm building the computer? - I like some assistance. - I put the in ass in assistance. Sit down. - Oh boy. - You know what I think I like best about Matt's setup? It's like the F-U fanboy setup. You're rocking Android. You got iPad OS, you got windows PCs, Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox. You just don't give a ---- do you? - It's a matter of where the games are and eventually getting the money to go get them. - And yet you've never built a gaming computer. - Hey, look! A manual. That's what we do with manuals. Right? - Well, hold on a second. You've got a lot of things going wrong here. This place looks so nice. I'm gonna try not to destroy it today. That's gonna be one of the themes of today's extreme tech upgrade. - We did a test build me and Dan about a week ago just to make sure everything would fit. - You do a lot of talking and not a lot of building look how red you are. Are you really that nervous? - Yeah. - This one is one of the freshest ones off the board and I'm pretty excited for it because it's literally the only board you can get, one of two, that you can get that is DDR4 and ITX, - Oh. - in 12th gen. So as a consumer, you are S-O-L, good old Prairie talk there, if you mess it up because it's either this or an ASrock board. - Got it. You're still talking and not building. Now you went 12600 K. That's a pretty gaming focused chip. Are you planning to do any kind of content creation or anything like that or just straight gaming? - It's gonna be a mostly gaming. There are times when I want to edit some pictures and then occasionally make some sort of montage. I used to edit all the videos for our band whenever we were on stage with my phone. So I'd shoot it with my phone and then edit with my phone with Adobe rush. - Nice. - Well, I think I would spend hours just going... - I think six P-Cores four E-Cores should be lots for what you're gonna be doing then. - I am so nervous. - You look like you've been drinking. Like, you got that rosy. - I was never one for pressure, even though I would be on stage all the time, but at the same time, this just is way worse than memorizing songs. - Have you breathed yet? While you work on SSD and RAM, we've got a one terabyte P5 plus along with 32 gigs of Crucial Ballistics, I'll do the hard part of the build. Okay. I'll put the iPad pro together. - Oh, oh actually you do have a hard part, if you wanna put the iPad pro together. - Oh. - From your lovely friends at dbrand. - Aww. dbrand says you've gotta go to their site for the installation instructions, but you know what I have to say to that? Eat ---- dbrand I'm gonna do it yolo style because this isn't my iPad anyway. And I don't care. - This board has two SSD slots, which is half the reason why I bought it so that I could use this one terabyte now and then upgrade to a two down the line. So I'm guessing just hide the one terabyte in the back here. And then that way I can keep this one out front and open. So don't have to totally take the motherboard out. - Yes, that is definitely what I would do. Z690 is gonna be PCIE gen 4 on both of those SSD slots anyway. So you're not giving up anything by using a lesser slot, cuz this is a gen 4 SSD. - I mean, if you really want it to be tricky, you could do the side rails. - I don't know if I care about that. In fact, you guys can judge my application. Are you sure there's an M.2 slot back here. - There was supposed to be, unless it was double layered up here. - Ah, there's no M.2 slot back here. - Wow. So it even looks like an M.2 slot back. - Have you been spinning your wheels this entire time? Okay. You did manage to put the RAM sticks in. - Oh, it's double stacked. - I said I wasn't gonna build it for him, but boy, are we ever getting dangerously close to it's time to build it for him This is a cool color. - Funny thing is when this case came out, I had a great idea for the whole color way of my entire build that I wanted to do. And then Dave2d did it about two weeks later. - Of course he did. I'm like, well, there's the blueprint. - After all the times you've been blamed for compatibility issues and other people's extreme tech upgrades. What are the odds that yours is gonna have compatibility problems? - I can tell you one right away. My PCI gen 4 cable will never ship. So we help to boot this without the GPU to start. - Oh. - But that's the only thing. - That's pretty minor. You think this is gonna fit? - Yeah. We did a test build. - You did a test build? - Remember we have one of these at the office. So we kind of use that as the demo. - So you're sure it will all fit. - Yep. - I wanna see this cooler fit. This is an AIO and the case is AIO compatible. - There's just two ways it can go. - EK's AIO is a little bulkier than your typical AIO like, look at this thing. - See we can either go side Mount and then just go normal GPU. Or we could go vertical Mount GPU, skip the whole gen 4 riser cable issue. - You wanna go vertical Mount GPU. - If we go vertical Mount GPU, then we have to boot into gen 3 and then that's a whole issue. - That's not a hassle. That's fine. - And then that way kind of looks cool if we do it the normal way, then the pump's in the right order because otherwise the rad can either go in one or two spots either along the side here or down here in the bottom, which we did the test build with. - If you want the cool look of the GPU vertically mounted on the side, then I think it's fine to put the RAD in the bottom. Rad screws are here. - And then the separate 12th gen bracket is tucked away in the box as well. Because unlike everybody else's build, I made sure to grab the bracket, which was in a nice big pile of bags next to the AIOs. And they were right there the whole time. - Did you just blame other people for your confusing procurement? - No. I didn't put the boxes next to the other one, but I did mention to everybody else who has been using this to go down and ask for the bracket. I'm specifically looking at you, Sarah, you called me out and I'm coming right back by clearing the air and saying it was not my fault. It still is compatible. You just forgot the one bag. And now I'm vindicated. - With what a fan favorite Sarah is. - That's gonna cause some heat. - I don't think anyone's gonna be taking your side here. - No, no one knows who I am, where I came from or what I do. - How's it going? - It's uh - it's going good. You know how they say to always cable manage your setup. They always forget to tell you how much of a hassle it is when you have to take it apart. Right now I have my power bar on the opposite side of the actual holder because it was too thick and it's about to fall on my face. As soon as I take off this LTT cable tie because the screw I need is right behind it. - This is not the fault of the LTT cable tie, user error, user error. Oh man, I got all distracted and I ended up, took the screws outta the one I've already installed. Dang it. - As you can see, I am helping a lot. - I'm going just as slow as you now. I don't know what it is. It's it's cursed. What does this even screw into? Also? It stinks. Ugh. Matt? - Yeah. - In this case - yeah - Does the vertical GPU just hang out there? - Yeah, I think it just hangs out there. - That can't be right. - Yeah. It literally just says to insert into the PCIE slot and then insert into the GPU and call it a day. Well, thank goodness. I got a small GPU. - That is absolutely wild. Also I'm a little less concerned about the horrible, horrible tubing routing. I realized once we've got our GPU in here, we're not gonna see any of that. This is great. What'd you go with 3060 Ti? - Yep. - Very nice. - Just a small boy. - Very nice. 1440P gaming right there. - Everyone's like, oh, but you're not gonna see the RGB off of the AIO. And then to that I say neon strip. Hopefully. - This is cool. The case has two different spots where you can put the power supply bracket depending on whether you have an SFX. That's what we got here with the 92 millimeter fan or an SFX L power supply. The longer one that uses a one 20 millimeter fan. And what's nice about that for us is that instead of having the power supply down lower like this, where the modular cables are very likely to interfere with our thick fan on the radiator down here, we can just move it up and that'll buy us some extra space, which we really need. - We're gonna love the colorway. I guarantee it. - Ooh, I do love the colors. This is amazing. How cute is that? I don't know quite how this happened, but I think I'm just about done. - Suddenly there is an entire PC in front of me. - Now this is gonna go in, man, you gotta line up these little tabs at the bottom. Come on buddy. Oh, there you go. There you go. Little buddy. You know what? I bet I could get those top fans in there without even the covers. Let's go for it. - One of the main purchases that I did as part of this upgrade was this Andover audio spin base turntable speaker. - Okay. So tell me this. Were you into vinyl records before it got all trendy recently? Or are you a bandwagon hopper? - 50/50. - No, pick a lane. - My dad always had a stash, just chilling in there. - That's your dad. That's not you. - He kept showing me them, but we never had a record player of our own to actually start listening to them again. And it was the same for Miranda as well. And the cool part about this is that they've designed a way so that you can have your whole speaker resting on your stand and then your record player will go right on top. And now you have speaker out here, speaker out from here and a speaker out from here and it'll give you 270 degree audio and one very nice knob to use. - Now I'll confess something. In spite of the recent trend, I have not listened to a vinyl record since I was a small child and my aunt or my dad or someone put one on for me. And I went, wow, it's like a big CD. That sounds crappier. I issue then to you, this challenge: convert me. Let's hear it. - Okay. Let's do a comparison then. - In the meantime, I've got an update for you guys. I wanted this SFX L spot here, but what I realized is this top fan is actually interfering with the power cable when I have it plugged in here. So what I'm gonna try and do is without disturbing anything else I'm gonna try and unhook this, scooch it down one and screw it back in, which will hopefully gimme enough clearance ready? 1, 2, 3, yes. Success. And both of these fans will spin. Okay. We'll work on that. - Okay. I think I've probably heard enough that I can now listen to that. - I think the best thing I can say about the record sound quality is that I can't really tell the difference. - Matt, what are you doing? - Cleaning the record. - Yeah, I'm cleaning the record because I - Wait what? That's not a controlled before and after. - A piece of fuzz landed on it. Okay. I get your argument for digital now, but still. - It takes this long to play a song. Look, if it helps at all, Matt, probably half of the audience out there is siding with you right now. - What about the other half? - The other half is like, this is the stupidest thing ever. Right? Just use Spotify. - Turn on the TV and use the Apple soundbar. - They're probably better speakers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That would be probably the other half. - It's skipping. - There is a skip on the disc. It's right at the seam of the color. It will hit. So I always skip this song. It's proving his point. I know. - I don't wanna be that guy, but I think your old speaker sounded better. Definitely better bass here, but those sound really good. - The one thing about these old speakers is the fact that they ruined the aesthetic of the living room. There's not much for neon green here other than Gregory. - I'm so disappointed right now. Really. This would we're going with this because it looks better. You go to all the trouble to get actual gigantic music, pancakes because of the so called sound. - Yeah. - And then you're like, no, I would rather use an inferior speaker because it looks better. - There is EQ on the back - Consolation prize? - What the hell is this? I have no idea how I'm gonna manage to flatten this enough to get that pop on panel in there. Okay. I lied. I have some idea. Just apply more force. Oh, that's kind of neat. It's just symmetrical. So you could actually get two of these and you could put them on both sides if you really wanted to. - Um.. What's up? - You know how you say not to close the side panel? - Oh. - Do you think there's a space along the top? - Oh, I see. It could be done. - Quick update. The desk is now a desk and I just need to fix the monitor arm because it's set too deep because my old desk was a lot deeper than this one. And we'll quickly hang up some posters and we'll be good for the computer. - Okay. That seems good enough. Right? Not bad. Let's take it in. You're letting Plouffe be a bad influence on you. You got the vinyls. Now you got the fancy, goofy keyboard cable. Why is this such a trend? - I don't get it. - Back in my day, we hid cables. We didn't wanna see them. You kids today, you have the privilege of wireless interfaces that are literally faster than wire and you go and you put wires all over it. How you kids make it out in here. Pretty good. Well, okay. That's that's fair. I walked into that. - I mean you did. You walked into the room. - What the hell is this? - Nothing. A color. - Is this a Bitwit mouse pad? - Did you see the color of the keyboard or the cables? - I guess we don't really have anything in this color scheme. - We need more colors. I know you, we had a white one in development. - I don't know this. - Yeah. - Rubberized backing doesn't seem. - Doesn't, doesn't quite go up to snuff, but you know what fixes that? - LTT grade. Hmm. It's harder to move now. - But that won't be the only keyboard on here. - You're gonna have more than one keyboard. - I'm going to pull a Plouffe right now. I will have two keyboards on my desk. You wanna see the second keyboard? - I mean, I guess, what choice do I have? You're gonna show it to me. - Keyboard number two. It's a Roland. - It's a Roland. - I am getting these speakers wired up. Mac. UCR3s You've seen the Bluetooth versions in Nicole's video and you'll see the same white Bluetooth versions in Geoff's video. So make sure you're subscribed for that as well. He will be doing a very well themed PC build. It's just like the new generation of kick me Post-its. - Okay. What do you think? Is it gonna power on first try? Oh crap. - Oh, power bar needs to be on. - Oh, you're one of those psychos who unplugs or a turns off power bars. Yay. It's up! - Woo! - All RAM is detected. Got that 4.5 gigahertz frequency. I feel like we've missed some stuff though. We've got some Phillips hue bulbs to add and this backpack. Oh, okay. A GoPro lens. - Hold on, reach inside the cavern. That's the main ticket item. - Oh. - So I picked up the hero 10 black. - And then you also picked up a ZVE 10 camera. What is this boy for? - So this one, you probably saw this in Plouffes video as well. It is pretty much a point and shoot. It has a little auto focus button here to help blur your background because I'm still learning how to use an actual camera and not just my phone. It's also really good because you can just plug it in on USBC and use it as a web camera or stream cam. - Cool. Now it's time for the part of this extreme tech upgrade, where we have the big transformation we're going from the old TCL TV to the Sony X90J movie magic. Okay. We went from a 65 inch black mirror to a 65 inch black mirror, but this one's way better. While the old stolen from the office model was a 4k set. This one will do 4k 120 Hertz. And with Sony's markedly better image processing. Now I couldn't help noticing that the stand for the TV doesn't really fit on this glass tempered glass doodad you've got here. - No. And that's the sad part is that this is part of it. There's no way to take it off or anything. So we will have to cheat the sound bar a little bit. - Okay. - For the sake of this. - Oh wow. - TV secured. - This is stuck down. Oy! - We're good. - Okay. Okay. I mean, it kind of looks like it's hovering there. It actually sort of works. It looks kind of like it's, it's already got kind of a tiered foot design on it anyway. Yeah. I think it kind of works. Okay. And now the TV is actually resting on this tent. I love that we didn't have to wall mount the TV today. Wow. I mean, obviously we cheated it a little in the editing, but that really was the easiest and fastest TV upgrade we've done for Intel extreme tech upgrade. - The only hard part is the cable management. - Yeah, are you gonna pass me some cables ever? - Look how well I've cable managed them. I have to undo that first. - I'm gonna go unpack light bulbs. Apparently the coolest schtick with these boys from Phillips is that you don't actually need their hub. You can just connect to them via Bluetooth. How exactly that works, I truthfully do not know because I would still think you'd need a hub if you want to control them. And you're not like within a couple of feet of them, I'm a bit of a short boy. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this. Nope. It's violating company policy right now. You're not allowed to make me feel short. We said we weren't gonna make a mess for a change. And I consider this a success. It's really not that bad. Right, Brandon? I mean, you can totally get at the sink in the kitchen. Yeah. Look at that; water. - It's good for your LTT store water bottle right there. - Yeah. Go buy a water bottle. Seriously. I gotta pay for the lab. Oh, did we finally get it working? - Yep. - Okay. Choose your subscriptions. Definitely got that. FUBO TV. - No. - You don't have FUBO TV. Oh, okay. Rakuten Viki, whatever that is. - No. - Acoustic auto calibration. Oh. Okay. Well we should probably sit where you would sit then. I just realized something. I can't believe I didn't call you on this earlier. You have your TV mounted above a fireplace. - Oh. I thought I was gonna go the whole video without you noticing. - It's a pretty low fireplace. - Yes. It's not like it's a whole wall type of thing. Like how Mark's is. - But when I sat down and actually tried to watch TV, I was like - You're looking at the switch. - You were just Benedict Arnolded'd here. I've just been informed. There's something else stolen from the office in this room that I haven't found yet. - I can give you a hint. - No, he'll find it. - It's orange. - Orange, you say? - Yeah. - Orange, orange. Well, it's not that one wheel. You don't have any one wheels. - There is a short circuit. - It's the one wheel. What? That was stolen? Hey, those are expensive. - It's on loan. - It's on loan? - Yeah. What does that even mean? - It means no one wanted to try it out. - No one wanted to try it? No one asked me if I wanted to try it. Man, I gotta say leave it to the procurement team to procure one heck of an upgrade. Living room TV looks so much better. You've got the wicked gaming PC. That's gonna be perfect for 1440P gaming. You've now got a 65 inch TV in the bedroom and the gaming PC and the living room TV managed to not end up sounding worse. Can't say the same for the turntable, but hey, you win some, you lose some, right? - I personally still think that the turntable sounds great. I think it's a win. I personally think it's a win. - If you guys enjoyed this Intel extreme tech upgrade, check out Intel there down in the video description. Obviously you guys know what they make CPUs now GPUs man, wireless chip sets. What doesn't Intel make kind of crazy. And if you're looking for another video to watch, maybe check out Brandon's Intel, extreme tech upgrade. He shot for us today, but he was on the other side of the camera for that. And it was a gong show. I'd blame, Matt.",

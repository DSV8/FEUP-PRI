    "transcript": "Is a hot dog a sandwich? Ultimately the answer may depend on your personal preference, culture, and context. You can call it a sandwich if you want, but don't be surprised if some people disagree with you. I love these smiley faces that it's throwing down to try to get itself out of trouble. So what we're doing here chatting with Bing, a Microsoft search engine which is now powered by an upgraded version of the model that is used for ChatGPT. So this is like a much more advanced version of ChatGPT that's right in Bing. It's free to use. And Microsoft is slowly opening up for anyone to use. A big upgrade. The information. ChatGPT kind of runs out in 2021. This model goes up until right now. So I can just type \"What did Microsoft announce today?\" It's going to answer the question. There it goes. Microsoft announced a new version of Bing Search in its edge browser today. A tie with OpenAI's ChatGPT artificial intelligence. That's pretty good.",

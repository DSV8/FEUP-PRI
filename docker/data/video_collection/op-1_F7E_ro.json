    "transcript": "Wi-Fi networks today typically require password to use but you know which technology does not have authentication enabled by default? Physical Ethernet that means that you can simply plug a device into an Ethernet port and start using it. Most home network small medium businesses don't have 802.1x enabled on them so a router like this could be simply plugged into a network and set up what's called a rogue access point but in this example I've got three phones and all you need to do if you don't have Wi-Fi enabled is plug an Ethernet port into the phone so I'll plug in the Android phone I'll plug a USB C Ethernet adapter into the iPhone 15 and a lightning connector to the iPhone 14 but once you've done that you have access to the network so that phone as an example is getting about 280 megabits per second, this phone 360, this phone 160, speeds will vary so as an example here I'm getting 600 megabits per second moral of the story is Ethernet does not have authentication enabled by default you can simply plug a device into an Ethernet port and use it",

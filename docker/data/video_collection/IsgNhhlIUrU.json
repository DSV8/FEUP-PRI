    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave 2d here! So OnePlus recently launched their new McLaren edition of the oneplus 6t and it costs $70 more than your regular kind of equivalently specs OnePlus 6t for that $70 you get 3 main features one : A completely different aesthetic,it's the same phone but it looks a lot better in my opinion than the regular one. It comes in a new box comes with some fancy stuff But the phone itself has this carbon fiber finish and an orange accent color on the bottom and it looks nice but also has two Main hardware features. So it has 10 gigs of RAM instead of your standard 8 gigs and it also has this new charging system So the 10 gigs of ram is cool, but I could be honest I feel like 10 gigs of RAM on any phone is superfluous at the very best But the charging system was something, I was interested in so I tested it out So this charging system is called 'warp charge' and it pumps up to 30 watts into your phone So the traditional kind of OnePlus 6 or OnePlus6t charging system they used to call the dash charge It's called 'fast charge' now This pumps 20 watts at peak into this phone 30 watts comes from the warp charger and it comes in this bright orange color Oneplus claims that the warp charger can fill up the McLaren Edition phone to up to 50% in 20 minutes So I tested it several times truth is I never got 50% not even once in the several 20 minute trials ahead But it got close the closest I got was 48%,but this is the charging graph So at first when you charged both of these phones the regular OnePLus 6t with the regular 20 watt fast charger or dash charger Charges noticeably slower than the 30 watt warp charger But by the time it's like 50, maybe 60 percent full the speed is reduced on the warp charger It's still fast, but it's just not as fast as it is when you first start charging the device It could be a thermal thing But I feel like the benefits of the Warp charger are more noticeable If you're just filling up from 0 to like 50 or 60 anything beyond that, it's cool But it's not as substantial as I thought it would be and just out of curiosity I switched the phone So I used the warp charger to charge the regular OnePlus 6t and I used the dash charger or the fast charger to charge the Mclaren edition phone and Surprisingly the warp charger does juice up the regular OnePlus 6t a little bit faster, but it's not like a huge difference either I would say though that this is, It's like is this worth 70 bucks? I feel like for most people it isn't like, if you're looking at a One Plus phone you're probably someone who appreciates value not that This is like a bad value or anything like that But this like the value proposition of what you're getting here isn't huge Right, like unless you're a huge fan of McLaren or you love the color orange or you love this little plaque thing. I Just realized You can remove this like you can take this out. There's a little piece of carbon fiber in here It's like a little it's like the McLaren logo printed. You know what let's remove it. I'm getting a screwdriver. Oh yeah! comes apart real easily, but like I was saying value wise It's a cool-looking product. But for 70 bucks that's like a big percentage of the actual value of the product So I would say for most people it's not worth it, but it does look cool now I think more interestingly I think in the future One Plus phones will probably include the warp charger and that sounds cool. Like I hope they don't use this as a, as a way to like justify their upcoming increase in price for all their future phones, but Slightly faster charging times is good for everybody. I might have to edit this But I don't feel like this video is very long. Anyways, thanks for watching. Okay? It is It's glued in It actually looks like it's real carbon fiber though. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video. sorry, this was so disappointing See you guys next time thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it.",

    "transcript": "Whats up guys, Lew back here with another video and today... I've got a special type of shield this company, IN1case.com they sent this out to me and they said \"Lew, this screen protector can take a hammer!\" and I was like, well listen I don't really want to be- they're like \"DO IT!\" None of that happened. Am I accusing them of something now? They said you could use a hammer they sent me the clips, I was like I don't know if I'd buy it but apparently its got some kind of impact protection technology supra molecular look at those words. I mean they sound exciting There is a normal screen protector and here is their specialty impact one. I don't know. Science. Now... I'm sure each one of you knows a human being who is walking around with a smashed phone you know they're answering phone calls, shards of glass, blood dripping down their face don't be that guy! get yourself some supra molecular protection look at this, look at what they sent me, they sent me the kitchen sink over here they make them for- not the kitchen sink its everything but the kitchen sink so they sent the kitchen sink as well. 6S, 6S+, SE, Galaxy S7 There you go. Paperwork, screen protector - basic, simple. Wipes. Nano shield. It's... slightly thicker. There's what it is, this one is for the... 6S... 6 or 6S. Wipe er' down first. Right? Okay fine. That pesky dirt on your phone screen. It's about time you tackled it! Dirty phone screen got you down. Today's your lucky day! Yeah! Get er' on there. Focus. Patience... Karate Kid. (singing to himself) Functioning iPhone. Now apparently I can wack this thing with a hammer all of a sudden. I don't... I got one! But first - I'll start kinda soft at first What the! Argh! It doesn't feel right. No matter how many times you do it. There's no marks even from the... hammer. Are you seeing what's happening to- Why is this tech not like in the screen to begin with? Digitizer still working when I'm using it. I can't! That's as hard as I can wham. Who has an excuse of a smashed screen now? I don't know. Nobody. There's nothing man. Completely working. That's a hell of it! I wanna like shoot this thing, or something. I don't... What can I do now. Yes!",

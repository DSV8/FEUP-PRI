    "transcript": "in the world of prebuilts there is one constant. sadness. however for a select few there may be a faint glimmer of hope in this bleak world microcenter primals and i actually managed to get my hands on one which was surprisingly difficult to do considering that microcenter has made owning one of these systems in canada punishable by death which meant i had to have this pc smuggled over the border inside a ubs delivery person which means i probably shouldn't touch the box anymore um but anyway before we check out the system it's time for a word from today's video sponsor that helped me pay for all the bribes today's video is sponsored by corsair and their mp600 pro lpx nvme drives with some crazy specs look at those read and write figures the corsair mp600 pro lpx drives are available in capacities up to four terabyte and with its high endurance 3d tlc nand flash and its low profile heatsink it's a great option to upgrade the storage not only on your pc but also your ps5 so if you're addicted to hoarding games and you need some high quality storage in your life check out the mp600 pro lpx with the link in the description below thanks corsair for sponsoring today's video now considering that micro center only sells these pcs physically in store i had to get a local person to risk their life in order to buy this pc for this video and that person was none other than mr dapps so thank you very much mr dapps for risking life and limb in order to procure this pc for this video wow the ups smuggler clearly practiced their dropkicks on this box damn now in the box we get a sheet covering some basic tips on how to plug in the system some shockingly thick soft foam that the case was shipped in that's very nice and then we get some e-waste peripherals oh yeah these are some real e-waste peripherals right here it's got a reasonable click though okay nice i'm gonna go throw these straight in the ocean okay that was a joke do not throw e-waste peripherals in the ocean otherwise i will come to your house and punish you in person now looking at the front of the case you can see that there is a solid front panel but there is some functional ventilation on the side and there's no hardcore fan choking going on against this front panel so it should be fine in terms of front i o i'm not sure if this is usb 3 or not but we do have two ports a reasonable power button and a microphone headphone jack and generally the build quality feels really good it's a nice sturdy little case now in my opinion the power supply placement is not ideal uh there's no ventilation in the top of the case which means the power supply can only draw used hot sloppy seconds air from inside the case which that's not great now in terms of rear i o it is very usable and we have what looks like the back of a very nice graphics card in here so with that let's open up the system whoa that is a pretty spectacular sub thousand dollar pre-built interior in fact correct me if i'm wrong down in the comment section below but i don't think i've ever seen a pc in this price point have dual channel ram look at that those are two 8 gig sticks of ram in a system that didn't cost as much as a small planet which is very exciting stuff good job micro center now next to the dual channel ram you'll notice an intel stock cooler now at this price point it's quite difficult to complain about a prebuilt unless it gains sentience and starts nuking croatia but an intel stock cooler is not much better than nuke in croatia although the cpu under there is an 400 which is a very good cpu and the stock cooler should more or less be able to manage it so it's not that bad uh other than that the motherboard's got some nice little vrm heatsinks around it and that is actually an asrock b660 board which is a standard m80x motherboard which means you can upgrade that at some point in fact there is nothing proprietary inside this system which is very exciting in terms of the ssd we have a one terabyte nvme drive which is again awesome for the price it comes with a power color hellhound rx 6600 which i love i really love these hellhound cards they're amazing and actually in terms of the price of this system before tax and everything i paid 900 for it and the final price the final final price was 9.99 so a thousand dollars and honestly for that amount there is very little to complain about in here normally you'd be lucky if you got a 1650 and a firm spank on the bot for that i just can't wait to see how this thing's gonna perform now the only thing that i'm not entirely sure of in this system is the power supply which is this 650 watt 80 plus gold rated power spec unit now power spec is micro center's brand but i don't know who the oem is that makes this power supply for them oh no there's a slight little scratch on the case okay even around the back we've got reasonable cable management you can see that we have all of our cables stuffed in the top here so that if we do need some molex or sata later down the line we do have access to it which is nice there's also a big cutout on the back of the motherboard plane which is pretty standard but it does make it much easier to swap out the cooler on the system which we'll do that later in the video we'll swap out this stock intel cooler and see how much of a benefit that gives this system but on that note let's close it up fire it up and see how this system runs which i'm very excited to do considering that price to performance wise i think this pc is going to be like lenny and of mice and men and other pre-built are going to be like the puppy that he gets windows 11. okay vd let's see what they've got for us on this power spec pc there's an activation helper thing that's prompting if it wants us to install internet okay so i'm guessing that is a an anti-virus so i'm going to say no do you want to remove yes okay at least it asks you before installing it so that's better than just having it on here and then we have asrock's rgb software which i've not interacted with yet i don't know if that counts as venereal disease or not i mean this is a pretty cholera free windows install we've got here so good job good job micro center we just have some amd radeon software on here which i like when people add this on it's nice some people don't know that you should install graphics card drivers so having something like this on there is is always a good good option in my opinion and it's got up-to-date drivers in it which is very good awesome so with that let's do some gaming on it oh would you look at that we've started off with straight up 100 gpu utilization now if you're new to the channel that is exceptionally rare in fact i don't think i've seen that on a pre-built system in a very long time it's running at 1080p very high settings and although we are seeing some gpu utilization dips that's pretty normal for gta 5 it is however looking way better than most pcs do so very promising good nice well done let's go to a more demanding game let's try battlefield v wow at 1080p high settings this pc is running the crap out of battlefield v battlefield 5 does have a thing for amd gpus and it shows the performance is really awesome although with the higher cpu utilization of battlefield 5 uh you can see that the cpu temps are creeping up they're not terrible though like they're completely acceptable at this point let me let me play for a bit and see what happens with the temperatures okay so it's been a while and the temperatures stabilized very quickly and they're fine right it's not that bad in terms of noise the system is by no means quiet although in a bit i'll i'll throw in a new cpu cooler and see how much that actually quietens it down because i think a big amount of the noise in there is that terrible little stock intel cooler but in terms of temperatures it's it's going perfectly fine and the gaming performance is very good the system runs really really well that is surprisingly impressive this is running at 1080p with high settings and we're getting about well comfortably above 60 frames per second that's very nice ah that cpu cooler really is audible uh i i think i think the next thing we do after we have a look at a couple of benchmarks is see how much of a benefit we get upgrading that stock intel vacuum cooler now having a look in here i actually think that cooler compatibility is going to be quite a big problem because this case is quite shallow there's not a lot of height clearance for a cooler so let me get a budget cpu cooler and see if it fits oh i actually don't think they use the stock thermal paste application on this cooler that's interesting and then there's the stock intel coolers hilarious contact patch on the new intel cpus now first off i'm going to try this new deepcool ak-47 which i think would be quite representative of all just 120 millimeter tower coolers so let's see if it fits it very much does not fit oh that's not good look at that sticking out like a little auty next i'm going to try out my little noctua u9s which is an awesome little cooler but it is a shame that we can't fit a budget 120mm tower cooler in there because they are more cost effective than this little october but let's let's see if it fits hey in terms of clearance that sucker just fits in there so that's that's good at least we have an option that's gonna work in this case so let me quickly mount that and let's see what difference that makes to the noise and the temperatures in the system now i've been playing for a while and the temperatures are quite a bit better on the cpu but the better temperatures are definitely not the main thing the system is way quieter and there's something really annoying about the frequency of sound that that little stock intel cooler makes uh whereas this knock to our cooler it's it's just a lot better so at the end of the day aside from the loser little intel cooler the fact that i don't love the case that they used and that the rear i o and i o shield aren't quite lined up properly which means that some of the usb ports are blocked off which is something i really feel like they should have caught while testing the system but it's a thousand-ish dollar pre-built and considering the insane value you're getting here even if the system went out of its way to rub sand in my eyes i wouldn't be that bothered and if you're blessed enough to live near a micro center this is a legitimate option worth considering which brings me to the end of the video thanks for watching if you enjoyed the video consider subscribing and until the next video bye",

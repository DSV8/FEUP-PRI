    "transcript": "Do you know which technology allows us to send data from one device to multiple devices simultaneously and only send it once? In this example I've got a Windows laptop, an iPhone and an Android phone receiving traffic from this laptop if I pause the video stream on the laptop what you'll notice is the streams are automatically stopped on these devices. If I start it again on the laptop after a while depending on the cache that's been configured these devices will start playing at the video this is possible because of multicasting. Multicasting allows a device to send one stream in other words one video into the network and these devices who have subscribed to that Multicast receive the stream, so rather than sending three streams of data using Unicast in other words from one device to one device we are sending one stream of data from one device to many devices that have subscribed to the Multicast.",

    "transcript": "for today's video i did some gaming on this little macbook here and it was actually the first time i've ever gamed on a macbook and yeah it was it was quite the experience i can't click on apply this is the first ever macbook pro on the channel and uh just having it in the office makes me feel like i need to start drinking pumpkin frappuccino lattes or whatever i'm sorry macbook i'm just lashing out at you because i'm intimidated by you oh that was quite disappointing i was expecting the whole thing to just unravel with that one little tug that does not smell like a new electronic device i think apple puts like a scent in these boxes smells quite nice it's very like neutral clean smelling wow that's thin but has a nice reassuring weight to it and then in here it says designed by apple in california which i find is a little bit of a weird thing to brag about anyway let's see what kind of documentation we get in here you get some gray macbook stickers so that you can flex that you have a macbook even if you don't have it on you and then we have our white charge cable with our charge brick that was what i was expecting the laptop packaging to do that is very satisfying i like that a lot and then we have our little brick which i touched half a time and it's already gross so that is the problem with having stuff or white like this is if you have even a little bit of finger cheese on your hands it's gonna transfer and then this is the 67 watt one which is a weirdly specific wattage and then other than that that's that's it that's all we get with it okay let's have a closer look at the macbook now the little macbook in question is the m2 13-inch macbook pro which the internet seems to think is one of the dumber apple products at the moment which i don't know i feel like the 600 luggage tag begs deliver but anyway uh i didn't pay for this little macbook it was actually sent over by micro center who apparently also stocks apple stuff micro center really does have an awesome selection of electronics and thank you again for sending over this macbook now i was immediately impressed by the build quality of the neutral clean smelling macbook but i had a couple of concerns wait a minute so you're telling me you have to use half of its i o to charge the thing you can't touch a button on it without the thing turning on i just want to demonstrate the keyboard without switching you on turn off come off no there we have our fully unsheathed macbook pro that is such a nice looking little laptop but you know the problem with the nice-lookingness of it is i don't really want to touch it with my gross manhands because i know it'll just immediately ruin it actually on the note of immediately ruining it let's try and open it up and have a look inside and after taking a while to figure out that macbooks use pentalobe screws i ran into a bit of a roadblock six screws and then do we just lift it off oh i actually have an idea i'm gonna use this thing does it work oh yeah that please tell me that was the tool that cracked and not the laptop okay so i just looked at the ifixit video and you do need to use this little thing you kind of pop it on there and then use one of these bad boys in in here oh oh i fix it you are very smart but despite ifixit's genius it still felt rough this really feels like i'm taking a knife to a baby seal's face ah please just come off there we go yay but there was one thing left for me to discover the hinge there's something here keeping it down you should be able to there oh oh there we go oh there we go very nice wow it's open oh it doesn't look like i damaged anything oh one first impression those are some sexy laptop insides although there's not much of a cooling solution here but it makes sense considering that the m2 chip in here can actually run passively like it does in the macbook air so this may actually be an overkill cooling solution for it which is very promising in terms of thermals and noise while gaming other than that though the ram and the ssd are soldered down which really sucks especially considering that this only comes with eight gigs of ram and you can't upgrade it after the fact in fact the only way you can do anything about the storage and memory in here is by letting apple bend you over a table when you're actually ordering the device so upgradeability is just not a thing on this laptop at all which you know it's an it's an apple device obviously but it's still really disappointing to see uh anyway with that let's try gaming on the thing okay there goes half our ports nice hello that is a pretty laptop as i was setting up the little macbook i was really flexing my apple knowledge let's go up here and get some more about this mac information it's about as far as my navigating mac os knowledge goes the news app has the same icon as dota for some reason that's really weird the keyboard of the little macbook is fine it does feel like it has more key travel than it looks like there's space for so i guess that's impressive in terms of the track pad i like the size of it although even on the firmest settings i feel like it registers clicks too easily and doesn't give you enough haptic feedback which means it's easy to accidentally click when you don't mean to the aggressive lack of ports on the little dongle book is definitely an issue which means the little occasions usb hub from the last video already saves the day oh wait i was supposed to be talking about gaming well while i was struggling to install steam on the macbook i decided to have a quick look at the apple app store's game selection which aside from a whole bunch of phone games was barren wow you know a game selection's bad when the only two games in there that get you excited are more than 10 years old oh wait there's disco elysian that's cool oh we also have psychonauts too apple use spoilers and once steam was installed it didn't get a whole lot better even most of the games without that little circle of death next to them don't seem to work and despite steam constantly trying to convince me to just use a pc instead i eventually found some games that worked kind of cs go has launched but it's defaulted into windowed mode that shouldn't be much of a problem right i can't click on apply i can't apply the settings because i can't figure out how to resize the windows so that i can get to the button to click on it there is no way that's gonna work but let's give it a try holy crap it's actually worked what and after that stroke of luck first impressions were good that is the whole thing right we're loading into a game and this laptop doesn't sound like a jet engine about to explode from the exertion of it like every gaming laptop that is very promising but my excitement evaporated pretty quickly keyboard no how do i i don't want emojis why does that bring emojis up okay that is not a thing crash how do i shift now keyboard struggles aside we may be running the game at 2560 by 1600 but for cs go at low settings that is not a very good frame rate and it feels quite input laggy also the display isn't very good at motion rendering you can see there's quite a bit of motion blur when you look around even for a 60hz panel the motion rendering is pretty rough so it may be quiet but it's not running cs go very well let's quickly try some dota that's not a great start i just clicked on settings and it seems like the game crashed oh no it just took super long never mind now considering that we want to leave it at the native resolution which is quite high i am going to leave the settings a bit lower oh despite the quite high frame rate it still feels really input laggy and it's like a molasses-y feeling i can still last hit but it's against the bot and it just it doesn't feel very good so let's plug an external display in and see if that fixes it whoa even plugging an external monitor into it's kind of buggy for some reason initially when i plugged it in it wouldn't give me a 120 hertz refresh rate through the aces dongle but then i plugged it into a different dongle which gave me 120 hertz and then when i switched back to the occasions it now also gives me 120 hertz out so that's all weird i don't know what the reason is for any of that and then dota also decided to get in on the weirdness so i'm getting music through the macbook but no video over there and then on the display i'm getting just the mouse okay let me just un plug the display and then it breaks it there okay so i've unplugged it from the other display but now it looks like that okay let me try plug the hdmi back in and then maybe that helps i found so far with this macbook i've had to do everything three times before anything's actually worked so let's give it a try again we've just gotten a mouse again okay that's that's very good after that i tried to see if csgo is working hey well cs go works with an external monitor wow that is a lot better now it's quite unfair because this is a high refresh rate gaming monitor as opposed to the 60hz display in the macbook and it's a lower resolution which means we get a higher frame rate all of which will help the input lag but still it just it feels so much better go see if we can get dota running yay it's finally worked the way i fixed it was by changing resolution from default for display to scaled back to default for display and then it was fine yeah it definitely feels a lot more responsive it's not great but it's definitely better than it was before and one thing that i do really like about the little macbook is it's been so quiet through all of this i've basically not heard any fan noise from it which is a huge improvement over any gaming laptop now just to compare more directly i did try playing dota again on the macbook display with a more comparable resolution and yeah it may be retina sharp and have beautiful colors but wow is it not good for gaming now i also tried dirt but getting it to run on an external monitor was the most annoying of any of the games when you launch the game you have to do it without the external monitor plugged in and then you have to go into the settings once you're there you plug the monitor in and then there's like a 30 chance that the settings won't lock off and force you to use some very low resolution default setting but most of the time the settings locks you out so then you have to restart the whole process again and hope that this time the settings don't lock you out and you have to do this every time you want to play the game so you have to decide do you want to display struggle or use the monitor in the macbook that has the motion rendering and input lag over 90's plasma television now i'm just gonna stop myself there because it goes on like that for a while and at this point we all know that gaming on a macbook is like going to a buffet where most of your favorite food is just locked behind glass counters and the little bit of food that you do have access to is several years old and just keeps glitching through your plate but quite frankly i don't mind that apple treats non-mobile gaming like it's an std they may catch if they're not careful because i don't want apple anywhere near the games industry the one thing that apple is good at above all else is finding a way to charge unbelievable amounts for things and then having people still buy them so they're just gonna find a way to make gaming even more expensive and it's not like game publishers need any help milking their customers dry but if apple starts buying game publishers we may get apple exclusive games which would mean we'd have to buy a 20 000 macbook just to play league of legends or whatever can you imagine what would happen if apple buys a company like nintendo hey uh i just want to buy one of those new nintendo designed in california switches please the one that's made from brushed aluminium so it's disgusting after the first time you've touched it the base model for that is two thousand dollars whoa that is way too much money yeah but remember it smells neutral clean from the box yeah i guess you got to pay for that that makes sense oh by the way the base model doesn't actually come with any storage in it and you kind of need that for it to work uh but luckily we have new neural ssds and getting a 256 gig one only cost an extra thousand two hundred dollars that is insane i'm just gonna buy the base model and then i'll add my own storage but you can't upgrade it yourself because it uses the new neural ssds it's just an oem samsung drive i can see it from here yeah but it's got neural in it there is no way anybody's gonna pay that amount for it um they all did you know what no thank you i don't want it anymore okay well i guess you're not gonna be able to play the new smash bros then look at all these awesome screenshots without any actual gameplay in it fine let me call my bank oh yeah did you want to charge it with that you",

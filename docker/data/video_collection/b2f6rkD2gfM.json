    "transcript": "- Gaming laptops! They're loud, and this one's not super heavy. Still pretty heavy, but it's kinda small. And we're gonna check it out. (chuckles) (host groaning) Double-boxed it. Anything in first box? Oh, there is. It comes with a laptop sleeve. I really appreciate it when laptop manufacturers give you one of these, mostly because my girlfriend is really bad for marking up her laptop. And when she gets one of these for her laptops, she doesn't. Here, we have our power brick. How much power do we get? 180 watts. Dang, all right. She's a powerful one. It's going through a barrel connector, of course, 'cause you currently cannot do that through USB Type-C. Should be able to soon, but not currently. Guess what, guys. There's another box in this box. - [Andrew] Why? (host laughing) Oh, that's really cool. On the back here, this is like a painted piece, but it changes colors depending on how you look at it. Like, it's red to me right now. Are you seeing red at all? - [Bell] Yeah. - [Andrew] Right now-- - [Bell] It's like red. - Oh, okay. There you go. Yeah, that is a really cool paint job. Apparently, I don't know about this bit, but this color is only available at Best Buy. Otherwise, you get a dark silver instead of just black. Oh, we got stickers! Do we just sticker bomb it right out of the box? - [Bell] Absolutely not. - No? - [Bell] No, it's just awful. - No? We don't? - [Bell] Who are we, Nicholas Plouffe? - You're saying don't sticker bomb it right out of the box? - [Bell] No! - Yeah, this is a gamer laptop now. (chuckles) I'm sorry, Acer. There we go, just gained 10 FPS. Anything else in here? Oh, an international warranty, that's actually sick. Some of them, if you buy it in one country and then move to another and your laptop dies, you're (bleep). Hopefully, you aren't. Good job. So this is the Predator Triton 300 SE. And it looks pretty good so far. As for I/O, we have Thunderbolt 4, USB Type-A, and there's a barrel plug connector. Around the other side, we have HDMI, that's 2.1, excellent, love it, another Type-A, and a headphone-microphone combo jack. I do wish that they had included a little Ethernet dongle in this. Alienware does that. I really appreciate it 'cause then you can just, you know, plug it in, get to all your games. You don't have to worry about buying one after the fact. All right, let's have a look right here at this segue to our sponsor UGREEN. Thanks to UGREEN for sponsoring this video. UGREEN's 65-watt USB-C DigiNest Cube is the perfect desk charging companion. The charger includes gallium nitride technology to quickly charge your devices while being compact. It offers three AC outlets, two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, making it the perfect companion for your desk or on the go. As well, its six-foot-long cord allows it to be super convenient at further lengths. Don't wait, grab your DigiNest Cube charging station from UGREEN using the link down in the description. Oh, the paint on this is so cool. It's way more subtle on this part of the chassis than it is up here, but it, like, very lightly color shifts depending on the way it catches the light. I really like it, but is the chassis stiff? I was a little bit afraid there. Up here, there's, like, a tiny bit of flex. And normally, when that happens, it means the keyboard is gonna be bad. But no, not at all. This thing's really solidly built. Oh, dang, that is a nice display right there. This thing, 16:10 OLED 90-hertz, has G-Sync as well. And the best part, 1600p. That's 2.8K. This thing, oh, that looks so good. Now, if you are a pro gamer, you might want to, instead of going for the OLED model, there is an IPS version that's 165 hertz for you pro gamers out there. It's a bit heavy. Let's get the scale out here. I think it's 3.7 pounds. 3.8, okay. Gained a little bit of weight, a little bit of weight there. It's right on the cusp of portability. It's like as heavy as you can get and still be like, \"Oh yeah, no, I'll just one-hand it, take it around like this, it's fine.\" Oh, wait. Should we verify it as well? - [Bell] Oh God, this poor laptop. (host chuckling) - [Bell] Ugh, God. - [Host] I'm so sorry. - [Bell] Ugh, this laptop. (host laughing) - One thing I'm seeing that I don't like is how you get into this computer. So best way to do that is facial recognition. You know, open it up, boom, you're in. Second best way is to have a fingerprint reader in your power button. So you click that, and then it gets you in. You don't have to press two things. Here, instead, they have a fingerprint reader on the track pad for some reason, which is the worst spot to put it. Like, I guess you could put it, like, on the back here. That would technically be a worse spot to put it. But of the spots that I've seen people put fingerprint readers before, this is the worst location they could've chosen. (chuckles) It kinda works as a track pad. That's weird. It's like a really bad track pad there. (host and Bell chuckling) Anyway, let's go over the specs of this thing. For the CPU, we get an Intel i9-12900H. That is 14 cores, 20 threads. They're stupid fast. This is, what, like 5.5 gigahertz or something dumb like that? Five, only five gigahertz? Oh my god, Intel, I can't believe it. (chuckling) Here, we also get a one-terabyte NVMe SSD, also Intel Wi-Fi 6E, oh wait, no, it's Killer Wi-Fi 6E, which sometimes isn't amazing, but also, we were able to get like 50 megabytes per second download out of it before here, so that's pretty good. GPU, Iris Xe graphics and the RTX 3060, the laptop one, but it still is pretty good. Six gigabytes of GPU memory should be decent. And Bell just pointed out, the GPU, the 3060, is a 95-watt model, which is I think as powerful as you can get a 3060. Don't quote me on that. How is the keyboard? All right, all right, that's pretty good. It's the sort of keyboard where it's a bit softer and there isn't quite as much force required to press the keys, and there isn't, like, a whole lot of definition to the keystroke. But on a gaming laptop, that can actually be a good thing. Like, doing your WASDing, and you know, just generally hitting keys quickly, I could see that working really well on here compared to, like, I don't know if I'd want to write a novel on it, but I would certainly game on it. The track pad, although it's not particularly large, like, in this class of device, you can get a much larger track pad on, like, the G14. It still works pretty well, aside for when you put your hand over that little fingerprint sensor. It's the sort of track pad that you will not complain about. It's neither going to positively or negatively affect your laptop usage. Although, can I get a mouse? One thing that I missed before, going over the performance, is the memory. So in this one right here, we have 32 gigabytes, and it is 5200 megahertz, which is very fast and problematic. That means it almost definitely is all soldered down right to the laptop, and in a laptop like this, I wanna be able to upgrade my RAM. I wanna be able to buy it with 16 gigabytes, and in a year or two, slap 32 in there, instead of just having to go all in right from the get-go. All right, let's do \"Valheim.\" Now, do remember that I am recording this at the same time. But also, it's a 3060. If it can't record and game at the same time, they lost. This display is 400 nits peak brightness, and it looks fantastic. It's the sort of thing where you hear 400 nits, and there are a lot of displays now that are that bright, but when it's on an OLED, because of the contrast and how dark the blacks get, that 400 nits goes way further. It's way more impressive. So it looks like we can't quite max this out at 1800p. Let's just drop this a tiny bit. Oh, I have another idea. That got us like a couple FPSes. We went from like 43 to 50. Predator button! Okay, Lighting Profile, we don't want Default. We want Gamer profile. There's three zones of RGB. You're probably never gonna use them 'cause having three different zones looks kinda dumb. Just leave it. This is a nice blue. Mode, Default, no, Extreme! Wait, wait, which one's more, Turbo or Extreme? I'm gonna go Extreme, and then I know that there's a little Turbo button up here. I'm gonna hit that. (fans whooshing) Wow, that actually got us like four FPS. (laughing) Fantastic. I am seeing some tearing. So I believe that this panel, the OLED one, does not have a MUX switch for whatever reason, even though the 1080p version does, which might mean we don't have G-Sync as an option on this one, which would be very sad. I like G-Sync. 16 does G-Sync. This one doesn't. Okay, I'm disappointed. Hearing 90 hertz, you might be thinking, \"That's not fantastic.\" And although this does not feel like a 165-hertz display, it's a lot closer than you would expect, especially given that I'm only running at like 50 FPS right now. That's because OLED, the pixel response times are super fast, so you know, it just feels more responsive. I'm gonna drop the resolution a bit and see what it feels like with more FPSes. Okay, 1200p, we're getting 70, 80 FPS, somewhere around there. Not too bad. Also, do remember, you will get higher FPSes than this. I am currently screen recording. Oh, dang! This is friggin' sweet. In PredatorSense, you can change the boot logo. Oh my god, I need to do that right now. God, if this works, I'm gonna be so happy. (fingers drumming) God damn it! - [Bell] Oh, what the-- - Why's it not working? This is the most disappointed I've ever been in a feature that has absolutely no bearing on anything. Acer, fix it. (chuckling) Well, I hope that works later. I'm sad. Let's play some \"DOOM.\" Yeah, I've concluded that if you wanna play very frantic games, I think you can do it on this just fine. I'm bad, but that's not the computer's fault. I feel like that, if I was to just properly tune my mouse sensitivity, it would have a larger impact on my aim than, like, actually going to, like, a 165-hertz display. That said, I have noticed, at times, there's stuff that I feel like I could've gotten if I had a bit more FPSes than I currently do. Like, we're rocking 80 FPS right now. And I think not the display, but if just the game was running a lot faster, I probably would be better. Let's try that. We can. Oh my god, that's so much better. Holy frig, so the problem the whole time was just simply the frame rate. It seems pretty clear that the 3060 does not love rendering at this high of a resolution. So if you're, like, a hardcore gamer, I would say just simply get the 1080p panel, the 165-hertz. You will be very happy. Now, apparently, Acer has some fancy Dolby Atmos surround crap with this. Does it translate into good speakers, though? (upbeat dance music) Okay, it sounds pretty good, but I think it's lacking in the bass. All right. That's pretty decent. It's nice and clear, and I much prefer something that is clear without a lot of bass than something with mud just smeared all over the sound. But how does it stack up against the MacBook? Okay, so here's the Acer turned all the way up, and MacBook. (upbeat dance music) (host laughing) Never fails. Never fails. Yep. (chuckles) That's a totally different class. A final thing before we take her apart, Acer have apparently included a 1080p webcam in this, so let's give it a try. Hello, hello. I am looking at a webcam. It looks very contrasty but also sharp. This is a very challenging scene. It's struggling a bit with the exposure, if I'm honest. It seems like a very sharp camera. Yeah, so right here, we're doing fine. This looks fantastic. But then we move sort of like into something a bit more challenging, and it just has absolutely no idea what to do. While someone like HP is really good at exposing for just your face, this, although it's sharp, depending on your lighting, your results seem like they're gonna vary. To get in, it's just nine Torx screws. They're all the same length, so you can't screw that up when you go in. Let's have a look here. Oh, that's pretty fun. It's like a little roller coaster of heat pipes. (chuckles) So it looks like we have one plastic fan here, and the other one is all metal. Also in here, we can see our Wi-Fi card, our storage, which is upgradable, and our RAM, which is not. Well, we can't even see it. It's probably on the other side of the motherboard somewhere there. Also down here, we get a 76-watt-hour battery, which, for a device like this, how much battery life you get out of that really depends on what you're gonna do. So this CPU will murder this battery in no time at all if you let it, but at the same time, if you, like, turn your brightness down, don't look at too bright of scenes, put it in the quiet mode, don't use the dedicated GPU, you're gonna be probably getting like 6 to 10 hours of battery life, somewhere in there. So the Predator Triton 300, I actually really like it. I'm surprised how much I like this thing. It's quite a well-built little machine. Going into this, if I'm honest, I was pretty afraid that we'd just be like, \"Eh, it's like the G14 but not as good.\" But it really is a good laptop. (laughing) This model that we have right here is $1,950, which is pretty steep, but at the same time, that gets you 32 gigabytes of RAM, and it's pretty reasonable. What's a lot more interesting, though, is I went onto the Best Buy website, and right now, there's one on sale for $1,200. That's $400 off, which, if you're able to get this deal right here, that's a pretty frickin' easy buy. So that one gets you the 1080p display, 165 hertz, only a 512-gigabyte SSD, but you can replace it, and 16 gigabytes of RAM, which you will have to live with. $1,200 for a 3060 and a 12th-gen i7, that's pretty damn good. (chuckling) So if you like this video, hit Like, get subscribed, and let me know what gaming laptops you wanna see down below. I wanna try and get in some cheaper ones, see if they're any good, 'cause sometimes cheap laptops really suck. Oh, and have a fantastic day. Geez, I almost forgot it. Wow.",

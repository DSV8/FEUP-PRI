    "transcript": "you've probably heard the rumors or perhaps looked at the lease in fact oneplus has been slowly spilling the beans about their new flagship smartphone the oneplus 8 pro now the company is taking a different approach this time by launching two new phones the oneplus 8 and oneplus a pro and these phones are meant to replace the oneplus 7T and the 7 pro respectively so I'm here to give you guys a complete breakdown on some of the differences between the 7 Series and 8 Series some of the features they've added removed and finally discuss pricing on these new phones because this is not the oneplus we used to know my friends it's really not the Razer DeathAdder v2 the gaming icon that just got upgraded with a lighter body next-gen sensor and optical switches for maximum reliability and speed the classic economic shaped handles like no other find out why 10 million other users love the Death Adder down below alright so I'm gonna start with the a pro oneplus has addressed a few issues that I've had with the 7 pro so the edges on the display are less aggressive but not completely flat like the 7T the body is slightly taller and slimmer compared to the 7 pro however the camera bump is slightly bigger and noticeably protruded so I'm not a big fan of that the corners are less rounded which I like and the back looks absolutely beautiful guys I have the ultramarine blue model and while it is composed of Gorilla Glass just like the 7 pro they've added a matte texture giving it a really soft smooth anti-reflective look now you can pick up the 8 pro and 2 other color options one of them is glacial green and the other is onyx black they've still kept the alert slider on the side which is still warm up here features of oneplus devices and you might notice something different about the selfie camera if you recall the 7 pro had a motorized pop-up camera resulting in a nationalist design but they took a step back this time and when with a punch hole camera cutout on the top left hand side of the display I don't mind it at all since it is still the norm with modern Android smartphones but to me it's just really interesting how they bragged about the durability of that motorized camera last year just the same the oneplus 8 on your hand is a slightly smaller version of p8 pearl the design is basically the same with the exception of the display as the curve doesn't extend all the way to the edges like the a pro and I like that the back is a welcoming change over the 7T so you can say goodbye to that huge circular camera bump and greet yourselves with a subtle low-profile look just like the a pro in fact the eight looks very similar to the 7 Pro but I'm not a fan of this color this is the interstellar glow model that's super reflective and a fingerprint magnet but you can pick it up in different colors just like the 8 pro moving on to the display I guess we all saw this coming it's a 120 Hertz quad HD plus AMOLED screen spanning across six point seven eight inches versus six point six seven inches 90 Hertz with that same resolution on the 7 pro now do I notice a huge difference between the two yes but it isn't that significant and it shouldn't be your first reason to upgrade from the 7 Pro I should also mention that it doesn't stay at 120 Hertz constantly in fact when your phone is idle or when you're viewing anything static the phone dynamically shifts down to 60 Hertz and oneplus did that to preserve battery life they're also taking a step forward in providing a good quality display without sacrificing on color accuracy as they do come factory calibrated which is nice now unfortunately my review samples started showing a weird green cast on the top right hand side happy lowest brightness setting and there were banding issues as well now I did end up confirming with some of my colleagues who are testing the exact same phone but they didn't experience any of these issues so I guess I just ended up perceiving a dud sample but nonetheless this is a gray screen for content consumption and honestly I can't tell if there's a difference between the 8 pro and the 8 pro - that curved because watching content on the 7 pro is really not that great with that aggressive curve versus the 8 pro which seems to be a little bit better the oneplus 8 on the other hand features a 1080p plus display just like the 7T with the same refresh rate at 90 Hertz which is really disappointing because it doesn't look like they've upgraded anything here I would have rather preferred 120 Hertz at 1080p because that would have made a lot more sense compared to the 7T because there's really nothing new here I mean sure the display on the 8 is a little bit brighter compared to the 7T but I think oneplus just took an L here both these phones come with dual stereo speakers and they sound great I didn't notice a huge difference between the 8 Series and SM series and they still feature in display fingerprint sensors oddly enough the 8 Pro fell slower compared to the 7 Pro when it came to unlocking device plus the a pro had trouble reading my fingerprint as well I tried resetting and rescanning my thumbprint multiple times it just still feels slower compared to these 7 Pro which is just really weird the specs on these phones are as expected top of the line guys oneplus hasn't cut any corners here they both come with he Snapdragon 865 SOC 8 or 12 good bytes of RAM keep in mind that the 8 Pro comes with lpddr4 purses lpddr4 X on the standard 8 I'm not sure if there's a scientific way to test the difference between the two in real world but I'm gonna have to look into that a little bit later both also come with 128 and 256 gigabytes of storage with the 8 pro being slightly faster the battery gets a welcoming upgrade over the 7 pro and the 7T so the 8 pro has 40 500 milliamp hours and the aid gets 40 300 million powers and as always both these feature the fastest charging protocol that oneplus can deliver in this case it's work charge 30 T it's basically the same as the 7 Series however they finally finally managed to add wireless charging support only on the 8 pearl and I repeat only on the 8 Pro and it's fast guys they're calling it warp charged 30 Wireless which tops the battery on the a pro to 50% in 30 minutes and check this out guys the charger itself is a unique piece of engineering this thing comes with a fan to help dissipate the heat as it gets as a lot as 30 decibels which on paper might seem quiet but not ideal when you have it beside your bed there is a setting on the phone that can turn off the fan but that'll reduce charging speeds I spoke with oneplus on the backbones of this technology and it's quite fascinating at what they were able to accomplish basically they're pumping in more voltage and reducing the amps which then results in higher charging rate and inside the phone there are isolated charge pumps that reduce the voltage down to a safer standard that can charge the battery if you're interested in learning more I'll leave a link to an article by the verge explaining the whole process it's really good stuff now I should mention that you don't have to get that dedicated wireless charger to experience wireless charging on the a pro in fact this phone does support regular Qi enabled wireless chargers just keep in mind that it's not gonna charge as fast as the dedicated charger that oneplus offers now this phone also features support for reverse wireless charging so that's something that you're looking into it's it's nice to have and finally the a pro gets the official IP 68 water-resistant ratings so that's something that you were looking for it's here oxygen OS on the 8ne a pro look basically the same compared to these 7 series you've probably heard me say this before but this is by far my favorite Android operating system even compared to Google's offering there are tons of customization options we've got new dynamic wallpapers that look really good it's clean and simple to use they've had at a new feature though and it's called NEMC technology basically using advanced algorithms it converts 24 frames per second content to a higher frame rate that should result in a smooth playback experience think of it as one of those motion smoothness that available on TVs that convert 24 frames per second content to 60fps but you're now getting that on a smart phone now honestly I'm not a fan of this feature because if I shoot content in 24 frames per second I'd rather watch it in that frame rate because then you kill that cinematic experience now luckily you can't turn it off through the settings so thank you oneplus for giving us that option finally let's talk about those cameras the 8 pro features a quad camera setup so there's a forty eight megapixel ultra wide-angle lens a forty eight megapixel standard wide-angle lens and an 8 megapixel telephoto that's 3x optical zoom and up to 30 X digital zoom then there's a color filter camera which is really a dedicated camera but it can be used to create artistic lighting effects in real time according to oneplus which looks very limiting and quite frankly useless because these filters can be applied in post through a third-party software so I don't really see a purpose for this feature the 8 gets three cameras but they've made it worse this time so you get a 16 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens a 48 megapixel main sensor hands and a 2 megapixel macro camera that's right 2 megapixels so they've chopped the telephoto lens like what's found on the 77 Pro any a pro and instead they're using the main wide-angle camera to crop or digitally crop to get that telephoto effect honestly at this point I don't really know what to say guys in fact I just decided to take all these phones for a little photo shoot and just see how they stack up against each other let's start with that 2 megapixel macro lens on the standard 8 it's awful guys I mean they shouldn't be legal in 2019 the color balance is off obviously you lose a ton of detail it's a very questionable decision by oneplus in my opinion now moving on to the main sensors oneplus has improved white balance and that results in true to life colors out of the box but the implementation of this new sensor comes with major compromises dynamic range is significantly worse especially compared to new 7 pro and a 7T the colors looked washed out on the 8 series whereas if you look at the 7 Pro on the 7T there is a good balance of contrast and saturation generally I'd still pick the 7 Pro because the out of the box pictures look way way better than these new phones and if you look at this shot right here it's just so weird to see the 8 Pro get destroyed by its predecessor the selfie cameras are noticeably better on the 8 series but I really wished it oneplus improve the contrast factor that's what's missing here I didn't see a major improvement in low-light and who knows what software updates can do to these phones later on so definitely stick around for my long-term review when i we visit the camera on me hate series so how much do these new phones cost you guys ready for this the oneplus 8 starts at $700 and for that you get a gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of storage for an extra hundred dollars you get 4 extra gigs of RAM and twice a storage now the oneplus 8 Pro starts at $900 for 8 of RAM and 128 gigabytes of storage and if you only absolute specter variant prepared to spend $1000 on a oneplus fellow that's right oneplus did it they finally managed to come out with $1000 smartphone and I'm still in shock from learning that you see well this is not the oneplus we used to know people in fact they cannot be considered as the so-called mid-range smartphone manufacturer in these days because they've officially entered the elite smartphone market to compete against Samsung and the rest of competition and I can't quite blame oneplus for pricing their phones and $900 and $800 or $700 because if you really think about it when a smartphone manufacturer decides to come up with their flagship smartphone and if they're the first in line to hit the market in 2020 with a certain price point in this case its Samsung with the s20 because those phones start up $1000 it automatically gives other smartphone manufacturers to compete with that price points and while the a pro and the 8 are still less expensive compared to the galaxy s 20 series it just it's just a way how the markets gonna go and unfortunately it's us the consumers paying that premium which which is just unfortunate then oneplus will sell the 7T and the 7 Pro at much lower price points compared to the 8 and the a pro and I think that's a pretty good deal because these phones are still really really good and I'd still recommend them any time of the day but that's that's where I stand right now it's just I I don't know I can't give you guys a full verdict on the 8 any pro in fact stick around for my long term view of these phones later on I actually have some unfinished business because I have to review the s20 ultra which is in the works so I'll stick around for that but until then stay safe spend responsibly and I'll talk to you guys in the next one you",

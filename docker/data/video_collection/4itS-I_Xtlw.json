    "transcript": "today's video is going to be a quick follow-up to my recent can Intel Arc gpus Ray Tracer video where we talk about a very important setting for Intel's gaming performance [Music] now in that Intel GPU video Battlefield 5 using DirectX 12 was stuttering like a jammed fax machine it was some of the worst stuttering I've ever seen in that game which is saying a lot DirectX 12 Battlefield 5 is stuttery on the best of days but it was real bad with The Arc GPU to which a bunch of you commented saying David it kind of seems like you didn't have resizable bar turned on for the testing in this video now for those of you that don't know what resizable bar is it's a setting that allows the CPU to directly interact with the entire memory pool of the GPU at a time not just like small chunks of it which does seem like a very useful feature that apparently helps Arc performance a lot now despite the fact that I thought I had turned it on for the video uh it you were right it actually wasn't on and the reason I thought that it was on was long story short a confusion on my part between the bioses of two very similar gigabytes motherboards and a prompt in the Intel driver that again made me think that resizable bar was on but I went and double checked this weekend and it in fact wasn't on so in today's video we are going to switch it on and see how much of a difference it makes to the gaming performance so with that let's check it out [Music] now interestingly in the Bios of this gigabyte z690 udax motherboard that I used for the testing the resizable bar settings are kind of hidden in the annals of the BIOS let me show you when you go over to settings i o ports you can see that it doesn't say anything about rebar support anywhere and that's because you need to First enable above 4G decoding and then resizable bar support shows up so if you don't know what you're looking for it's easy to miss it which is not the case for another gigabyte motherboard I set up recently for GPU testing the x670 elite ax now this is the bios for the gigabyte x670 motherboard where if you go into i o ports you can see that resize bar support is actually on by default which is kind of what confused pepega Darvin because a couple of weeks ago when I set up these two systems for GPU testing I remember looking in the Bios of a gigabyte motherboard and seeing resize bar support was on by default so when I got the Intel driver prompt I remember seeing resize bar on so I was like yeah the games work it it clearly is on but I was thinking of the other motherboard by the way it's definitely on now not just David fever dream on so with that let's see how much of a difference that's made off the bat enabling rebar support just broke the Intel drivers that were already on the system it seemed to cause some form of weird GPU Amnesia because Windows just recognized the a770 as a basic display adapter so I then installed some updated Intel drivers on the system which means today's comparison has turned into rebar off versus rebar on with slightly newer Intel drivers on hey they updated the interface for Arc control I didn't think that was the most urgent thing that needed fixing with the previous drivers but what do I know I could barely figure out how to turn on rebar [Music] holy crap that has made a huge difference I I think the Baseline frame rate is roughly similar to what it was before but we're no longer getting those apocalyptic 10 second starters anymore making it a lot more playable now don't get me wrong this is by no means some Mount Olympus level Battlefield 5 dx12 gaming we're seeing here there's still a reasonable amount of stuttering going on and I've I've seen other systems run it a lot smoother than this but it is way better than it was before and the benchmarks confirm this big Improvement but it being a big Improvement does not mean I'd call a one percent low of 22 frames per second could that would kind of be like saying stepping on a Lego is pleasurable because a landmine is so much worse and the massive Improvement rebar brought continues with Ray tracing settings so clearly rebar does a lot to help Battlefield 5's stutter issue on the arc GPU but what about some other games GTA 5 was another one of the games that didn't perform as well as expected and turning on rebar does definitely give you a bit more frame rate but it doesn't make nearly as big a difference as it made with Battlefield 5. I was also interested to see how much of a difference it would make in a game which actually performed pretty well without rebar on control hmm even that's running better look at that Improvement in the one percent lows and an average of 94 frames per second with control using medium Ray tracing settings is a very good result so the moral of this story is if you have an Intel Arc GPU turn on a resizable bar otherwise you're leaving a lot of performance on the table having said all that I still stand by my comparison of the Intel Arc GPU to living with a very smart drug addict I was still getting the same ghost in the machine that I had without rebar turned on like the occasional crash and screen capturing barely working and stuff like that all in all I do think these Intel Arc gpus are very promising and I'm excited to see where Intel goes with them anyway thanks for watching this quick update and until the next video bye foreign [Music]",

    "transcript": "hello good people Eber here with Hardware Canucks and today is Radeon vii on Boxing Day and as you can see there are no signs of Radeon vii in this setup as you can see they're just components saying wide beside me because we decided to do something a little bit different or I guess something that probably makes sense and that is to do a built do a build featuring the Radeon 7 and this all started initially with an idea that we had in mind which was to set up a triple screen or triple monitor setup and I just wanted to quickly put together something that can power and drive the three displays three 1080p displays that is and I think by the time you're watching this video that video might have went live so if you're interested in checking that out link is right over here but as I was building that system I realized since it just aesthetically looked amazing so I thought I might as well just share with you guys because you know it is an all AMD system and it featured the Radeon vii so let's go over the components and all the other stuff right after this welcome the entire H series from NZXT we're in the most elegant case lineups with the premium construction you'll appreciate and the little details like purple USB ports per fret shroud floor and the iconic cable cover we've got an ITX option the h200 your standard ATX mid tower to each 500 in the big guns the H 700 all available with a smart device for RGB illumination and fan control or the standard variations with a smart interior to complement an easy assembly the Aged series is Hardware canucks approved and is something for everyone check it out below alright so let's kick things off with the processor I chose the Ryzen 5 2600X it is an awesome CPU for the price because you get six cores 12 threads you can also do a little bit of or clocking with it as well the 2600 is also a great option if you're looking for an alternative for the motherboard I chose the MSI B 450 tomahawk and the reason why I chose this particular boat is because the case of choice which I'll talk about later in the video matches perfectly with this board and the grey on grey color scheme it just looks perfect it's like match made in heaven that's what I want to put it that way but when you look at the final footage I think you'll probably understand what I mean talking about so that's the board we're gonna be using to cool the Ryzen 5 2600X I went with the castle 240 RGB from deep coal and the reason why wouldn't this cooler is because it was lying around the studio and I been barely haven't touched it at all so I decided to throw this into the build but interestingly enough the actual CPU block is also great in color and that happened to match the build as well so everything seemed to be coming together really well and you know I love the fact that it comes with also it also comes with RGB lighting so you can you know customize it to the colors you want although keep in mind that I'm not going to be using I'm not gonna using a lot of RGB lights in this build I just want to keep it as clean and simple as possible so that's the way we're gonna do it now in terms of memory I chose team groups Pro dark 16-gigabyte kit clocked at 3200 Hertz remember Ryzen does perform better with faster memory speeds so that's one of the reasons why I chose this and the other is of course the design and just the way how it looks it just matches the tomahawk board and the case really well it doesn't have any RGB lighting which is awesome and I don't know it just looks clean and minimalistic I love I love how these look I wish I had a 64 gigabyte kit that I can throw into my workstation PC but yeah these kits look awesome and I can't wait to put them in when we have to storage I had a lot of options to go with in terms of the primary boot drive but I decided to use this 960 pro and gave me SSD that I picked up for boxing day for a really good price and you know this also matches really well with the rest of the color scheme that were going for and of course you're getting faster we didn't write performance as well but if you're looking for something that's relatively new the 970 Pro is out in the market as well or the 970 Evo those are great drives as well and we'll leave links to all of the components mentioned in this build in the description down below now for storing my game library I decided to throw in a Western Digital one terabyte blue caviar hard drive now powering this entire build is be quite straight power 700 watt any plus gold PSU its semi modular and it just is adequate enough to power the Radeon 7 and the other components now you're probably wondering there's something missing here in the setup that's the case and the GPU first and foremost I can't really fit all that stuff in this small table so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bring these boxes I'm just gonna move them so that I can create some space to do my very short unboxing of they're waiting on seven I get this big box you know you unbox it like that or you open it up and there it is that's the way on seven and if you need to know everything about this card we actually did an explained video so you can actually check that out right over here we go over all the specs and the architecture and the disappointment in terms of why we haven't received Nabi yet but yeah if you're interested in that link right over there well that was a quick unboxing of the Radeon 7's enjoyed that but moving on to the case of choice for this build it is the Phanteks P600X and the reason why I chose this is just because of the color and the build quality and just a way how Phanteks is designed this case first and foremost are these swiveling sight panels that actually don't require thumb screws to get access to the interior so they're actually held by magnets which is pretty awesome and you also have all sorts of acoustic treatment taking place on the inside as well which is great and you have all sorts of modularity going on the interior design as well and I just love the color and just the way how it looks which is definitely something that has been going on me it's certainly an expensive case for what it is in fact if you're looking for an in-depth review or in-depth look at the p6 on our next link is right over here Dmitry did a fantastic job and so yeah there you guys have it so now having looked at all the components let's put this thing together guys as you can see the final build looks gorgeous I think the gray aren't great color scheme turned out to be an absolute success none not only in terms of component choices but I think just the fact that it nothing really particularly stands out in this build everything just blends in really well everything from the memory all the way to the CPU cooler and of course you had the weighty on seven which is to highlight for this build I left the LED lighting behind the motherboard and of course lighting on the Radeon logo to be lit because I think the red and the red really complements the whole PC it adds just a tiny bit of flare but I did turn off the lighting on VA i/o cooler so good because it just it just was too much I just love the fact that it looks very clean and minimalistic I love this bill to guys it's just really awesome but I cannot get into performance just as a least right now because there is an NDA of course but we will be doing some in-depth testing not only with premiere but we'll also be doing you know 1440p and 4k benchmarks compared to the RTX cards so definitely stay tuned for our full performance review on the Radeon 7 and if you guys are interested in any particular test that you want us to run on this new GPU I'd love to know that in the comments down below and this is going to be you know it's going to be something that I'll be using in the long term to see how this GP and of course this whole system just works in particular not just for content creation because that's something that this GPU is I mean potentially AMD's claiming that it can help accelerate rendering performance so that's is something that we'll have to wait and see if it turns out to be true but yeah let me know what you guys think about this build and of course if you have any suggestions for alternative components I'd love to know that in the comments as well I'm he bore with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content number here subscribe to our boot sequence Channel and we'll see you in the next one",

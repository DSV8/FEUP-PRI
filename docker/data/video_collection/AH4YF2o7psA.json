    "transcript": "WOO! YEAH! So you guys probably heard about this thing, this little guy right here... The NES Classic Edition. It's a mini little... NES In the fashion of the original But this time, it's got some games baked into it People were all fired up, all fired up They loved it! Makes sense, you know? Nostalgia, It sells. It came out around Christmas So I didn't have a chance to get my hands on one. Until... ...my good friends at Analog e-mailed me and said, \"Oh, you think Nintendo themselves are the only ones who can do a mini edition?\" \"We can do one, too!\" I made a video for them a while back--actually two. OHH Comes with the Gold Legend of Zelda Cartridge! AM I YELLING?! (Blows On Cartridge) I'll put a link in the description if you haven't seen that yet. But they shrunk down their package as well and altering a couple of other things... ...and they're ready to take on, the Classic Mini NES. This is not really a remake, In the sense that you can't put your old cartridges in here. But with the analog product, you can take any old NES cartridge ...throw it in here and live it up like it's 19...89. this thing is almost like a piece of art..if you've haven't seen one of these before You got Analouge up on the top, in gold Ohh This makes the third colour option I've had from these guys And it is quite a bit smaller The classic ports for your controllers..four ports One is for... The U.S.- the NES cartridge that you're familiar with And then the other one is for- check this guy out right here they included this as well Some original Mario that never made it over here I- I dunno, I can't read Japanese I believe these are called Famicom games This is what I'm talkin' about that guy right there Originally released in Japan as the family computer There ya go history lesson there's an SD card slot we've got analog ports and then we've also got HDMI so this is what gets people excited alright, cool an HDMI cable in the box! The wireless controller, alright so that's one of the criticisms of the NES Classic Edition The Classic controller has a very short cable",

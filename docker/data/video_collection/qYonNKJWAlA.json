    "transcript": "(car accelerating) - (gasps) Holy (beep) (Laughing) Oh heck yeah, we got one. The Porsche Taycan 4S, and she looks friggin' beautiful. So, for those of you that don't know, this is Porsche's first full electric vehicle, well I guess the Turbo S was, but uh, whatever. First full electric vehicle, and ours comes in at cool $160,000. Um, if you can't tell by my shirt, I don't normally drive cars like this. In frozen blue metallic, that's this color here. The rubberneck a-tude is level ten. Like every single person, the person in the van over there that's like waiting for someone across the road, they are just.. People that drive past, every single person that you go past, they're all just like... Look at it, it's freaking beautiful. Now, starting off in the front here let's see how the frunk is. Come in here, there's a little red latch there that you have to pull. (latch thumping) Up got it. And there's a respectable amount of space in here. I would say that you can probably fit, if you take like, one two-four and put it down sideways. You can take another two-four and put it on top. And then, hundred percent ready for the cabin parties. I'm sure that's what everyone (laughs) is using these for. (shutting frunk) Now, not only is this thing beautiful, but also is a real slippery boy. So, one thing that's super cool- down here is actual little doors that close across these radiators when they are not needed. To bring the co-efficient of drag down to .22. I'm not a hundred percent sure on that because those rims might bring it down to .25. But, either way incredible. Now, for those of you that aren't totally sure what the co-efficient of drag is, basically, the lower it is the better. Because that means, there will be less resistance as the car is moving through the air. I think, a Volkswagen Golf lands somewhere around .32 - .35. Prius is .28. So, getting .22, is friggin incredible. Now that said, we do have the rims off of the Turbo S. Uh, the ones that come stock on this have more of like a turbiney design. Which I think, helps out your co-efficient of drag. But... These things look really sick. That said though, the options on this car are friggin insane. So, these wheels right here, $5,300, and this bit of blue paint, is another $1,300. There is over $40,000 worth of options on this thing it's, friggin' (laughs) crazy. Speaking of options, Pano roof comes with the premium package. That's another eight grand. (Laughs) Uh.. But what is really cool is that right here, you get your charger you give that thing a little flick, and it opens up. And there's chargers on both sides so, you don't have to worry about how you pull up to the charger. I think that's just a really nice little touch. Moving across. The door handles they pop out of it, but they can stay in. Now, I'm always concerned about things like this, like being from out East. You have an ice sheet over it, you just can't open your car doors. But that said, if you all notice these it's in a heated garage. Like, it's not going to be a problem for you. But, you wanna get in, it pops out- easy. (car door being shut) Even the butt of this thing looks really good. Then again, one mild complaint that I have, is that these...these thick ole haunches, (Laughs) make it really hard to figure out just how big the car is. But, you'll get used to that eventually. Back here, we do have a spoiler. That does lift up at speed. And also, a trunk of course. (laughs) I like that they have the button here that's easy to find. And I also really appreciate that to close it, they have not just close, but close and lock. Just saves you a step. Nice touch. In here, we have the slate for this video. I think it's a lot of room. Brandon said it wasn't, but it's a sports car what do you expect? And also, a big ole charger. Oh, they give you the whole thing in here too. (laughs) I know that this comes with, a... tire repair kit, but I don't know where it is. Eh, that's something you can figure out in the owner's manual... When you have that problem. We also have some nice little cubbies down here to chuck your wine bottles. I don't know. If you have one of these you are probably putting like $1,300 worth of front.. wine in there, but you know. (Laughs) Rear seat room's impressive. So, this is behind the seat, and it's full back position. It's further forward when I actually get the driving position set, and I can still sit very comfortably back here. You also get heated seats, and some little air con. Very nice! Additionally, you also get cup holders, and a full-blownsies ski hatch. I can't show you that because it's hitting our camera, but you get the deal. (Laughs) There even appears to be a vent for foot heating. So, cool, I guess. My only complaint about back here is that there is no charging parts, as far as I can tell, for the rear passengers. (Laughs) Maybe that's an option, for like $5,000. Hey, future Alex here. Uh, I was too excited, and forgot to do the sponsor segue. But here it is! Sponsor segue to Pulseway. Pulseway is a real time remote monitoring, and management software. You can work from anywhere with their mobile app, and get a real time view across your entire network. Fix problems on the go, by sending commands from any mobile device, and you can even send commands with your voice. Automate repetitive tasks to find auto remediation work flows, and ensure critical patches are automatically applied. It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. So, try it for free today at the link below. (groans) Moving in here, this is a nice spot to exist. So, you know, as normally you get your seat memory. But, what I wanna test, can you fit an lttstore.com water bottle down in here? (shuffling) Beautiful! She's a pass. I love that for long road trips. Overall, this is a very nice spot to be. But, I do have a couple of nit-picks to get out first. Panel black, hate it. It always looks terrible after not very long. Now I've only been using this for about an hour, but my impressions so far, are that this is the most inscrutable infotainment, that I have ever experienced. I've watched like 20 minutes worth of videos, outlining how it works, and I still (laughs) don't totally get it. The climate control, it's never going to get better. Because I want a knob. What's wrong with just being able to aim your vents right here. Instead you have to come in here, and aim the vents to where you want them to be. Who thought that was a good idea? It does work, but oh my God that's stupid. (Laughing) Other complaint, no Android auto. Come on Porsche, apparently it's coming in 2022 in the 911, and stuff. But for now, only apple car play. I don't know why they can't have both. Apparently, it's for \"security concerns\" or something, but I don't know, I'm using the phone anyway. Just give me a little thing to be like, yes I understand this isn't exactly what you want I don't care, I want my Android auto. The map and navigation is at least pretty good. This is quite responsive and apparently, Google are the ones that supply the technology for it, so it's gonna be decent. Although I don't get to say, \"Hey (indistinct),\" and have it take me somewhere. We get a navigation display (laughs). This is an option, but I think it's pretty cool. So, this apparently goes to Porsche's rally heritage. Where you have, you know, someone in your co-drivers seat. Being like, four right over left two long into three right, don't cut over bridge. (Mumbling) And so on, and so forth. And the navigator here, gets to... Well, they pretty much just get to search up where you're gonna go. That's- that's kind of it. But, it is pretty nice that they have a full keyboard when you're driving. It's pretty useless, but at the same time, I think it's pretty freaking cool. Now, I do feel like there's more to cover in the tech here. But I need like another week or so to marinate on the actual usefulness, and how annoying it is to use. We're gonna do a full LTT video, and we will cover that then. I wanna drive this thing. Ha! Now, the first thing that I noticed, while driving this thing, is that the back up camera is trash. Oh my God, it's so bad. I can't tell if that's an Elantra beside me, or a skyscraper. And also, when you turn the wheel, it changes where exactly it shows you, which you think would be good, but it just makes it really hard to judge where everything is. When I was backing out of this car from Linus' driveway, I had to move my Golf out of the way, to make sure that I didn't damage the nice blue paint on my Golf. It does have a 360 cam. It's fine, but like, when you have $5,300 rims, it's not good enough. (Laughs) First of all, these seats in the driving position, I think I like it. It's kind of hard to say. There's fourteen adjustments, that you can do with the seat. As well as like steering wheel placement, and stuff. And I'm sure that somewhere in there, I can find the perfect balance. I haven't found it yet, but I think I will pretty soon. One thing this does that I actually quite like, is when you're going along, and you kind of like take your foot off the gas. It basically just keeps you at the speed you're going. I'm going up a hill right here, so it isn't. But it basically, just has auto-cruise. Now, it is kind of the exact opposite of one-foot driving, but I'm not a big fan of one-foot driving because you have to always have your foot on the gas. So, I'm personally a fan. As for comfort, I would say it is exceptional. Especially, given this is a sports car. So, this you do get, adjustable dampers. Awesome. I love them. I think everything should have them. At least everything above like, $40,000 should have them. And it also has an air suspension, so you can go up and down depending on, you know, if you are on a track, or you're going out to your buddy's cabin and his driveway is a bit less great. (laughs) This display in front of me, you got a couple modes. You can change it here from power meter to map, that just shows you the map in the center. And you can also do the extended map, which would be awesome for like, longer road trips. It's so freaking big. My favorite may be, is just reduced. You only get the speedometer in the center. I find that the steering wheel can kind of cut off the information on the sides anyway. Now, unfortunately we don't have Porsche's self-driving. It's called like, \"Innovate Drive\", or some crap like that. - (automated voice) InnoDrive - It doesn't matter, but then again, the adaptive cruise, and the lane keep in this, does seem to be really good anyway. And that's kind of all that I would personally use. One thing that I am really impressed with, is the pedal-feel. So I find in some electric vehicles, especially on the brakes, you 'll get the regenerative braking, and then, also kinda get into the real brakes. And there can be like a weird, nonlinearity there. And it's just kinda gross feeling. Where as in this, the pedal just... is awesome the whole way down. Now, that might just be because I've only used the regen. Apparently, this will do .4 of a G of regenerative breaking, which is like, fantastic. I think the breaks on this were like $4,000, so you don't wanna replace those too often. Oh yeah, there we go. That's the good stuff. You can adjust the volume by sliding right here. It's kinda weird. I would only use the steering wheel. So, this is Bose sound system, the most premium one is from Burmester, but I think it's safe to say, this one is quite good. (Upbeat music) Oh yeah! That is, that is good. So, how do I turn this off? (camera beeping) Yeah, so that is very good at being able to both have the highs being nice and clear, while also having the bass, but it's not like the muddy bass, it's like the nice clear distinct bass. Oh, we've got a corner here too. This is an excellent little time. So, let's see how this feels. Uh... It's my first time hitting the gas. Oh! Wow. Okay! The steering feel overall, I think is exceptional at least for an electric car. I can't really tell you how it feels until we've been on a track. I am nowhere near the limits of this thing. Like, you cannot do that legally, at all. But like, how direct it is, it just feels so good. Ah do we have like a tractor up here? Dang it, Lanley. Well, I took a wrong turn, and I can now confirm that if you go down like a gypsum, very banged up road, it is quite comfy, So, that's always good to know. Let's get this thing turned around. Hats off to Porsche's suspension engineers. It cannot be easy, making a car that is this heavy- I think this thing is like four and a half thousand pounds- feel this good. Okay, so launch control. Now, you take the drive mode button right here, you put it into sport plus. Foot full on the break, full on the gas. Okay, and lets do it! (car engine roaring) Holy (beep)! (Laughing) Ope, and now we are way above the speed limit of everything in Canada. Uh. ( Laughing) Oh my God. That was shocking. So, yeah. Uh, five hundred and sixty-five horse power available in launch control mode, and she kicks. Um, I have driven Teslas before, even on a track. And that was unlike any acceleration I've ever experienced before. That was way more immediate. Way more like, head jerk. Like oh my God, that is... Holy crap. (laughing) Oh my God, I cannot wait to drive this thing on the track now. Holy (beep). Oh yeah, it has like four hundred and ninety foot pounds of torque. I have floored it in a model S before, and I believe that has a faster zero to sixty time. But, the come on time of these motors, is way faster. Like when you go from zero to one hundred with this, I'm at like basically 0 throttle right now. (engages gas pedal) Oh my God! So, you might have noticed during the launch there, that there was, some pretty space shippy sounds. So, the electric motors do make their own noise. I think in normal mode you only hear that, but when you put it into sport plus mode, there's like a... sound actor, I guess. It's fake pumped in sound, basically. But it is quite fun like... (zooming noise) Very space shippy. I quite like it. I don't even remember what else I was supposed to do. I just wanna do that a hundred times. Well, I think that's about-oh my God. That was- that was fun. Hit like, get subscribed, uh... let us know what we can do different in these kind of videos. And yeah. I am very, very excited to try this out on the track properly for LTT.",

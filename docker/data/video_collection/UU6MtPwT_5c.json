    "transcript": "- Hey, guys. So the Apple event just ended. I'm gonna be making a separate video talking about all of the things that they announced, but I have a very special guest in this video. His name is Tim Cook! - Hi. - Hello. - How are you? - I'm doing well. How are you? - Really good. Good to see you again. - Oh my gosh, you too. Thanks so much for joining this fun little interview here, right after the event, too, so this is amazing. - Well, thanks for having me. - So how are you feeling, fresh off the stage, the virtual stage? - I'm feeling great. I always get so excited on days like this, for launch day. And today was just off the charts. - I mean, you get excited, but obviously we all do, too. And one of the things that I love so much is actually getting to go to those in-person events. And those were so much fun, but the way that you guys have made these virtual events kind of let everyone experience that magic that we felt actually being at Apple Campus is so incredible. So what has it been like for you guys creating this all new-way of launching products? - You know, it's so great to get such a positive response from people, and it's great to invite people here so that they can get a glimpse of what it looks like inside and pull back the curtain a bit on Apple Park. I'm just so happy with the response that we've gotten and how many more people we're able to show our place to and invite them into our home. - It's so beautiful. And even all those fly-throughs of California, I live here, and it was just so awesome to experience that. It was amazing. (laughs) - Yeah. You know, it's great to show places that really inspire you to think, and perhaps that they'll inspire other people as well. And we really did that across the board today. - You guys really did. And one of the things, obviously being such a huge Apple fan basically all of my life, this is so awesome to get a chance to chat with you. And usually, there's always one thing that's super surprising, and for me, this event was actually the iPad Mini. - The iPad Mini. - I love the iPad Mini, and I know so many of my friends do, and I have a lot of friends in the medical field that they use them. And I think what really impressed me was the huge upgrade that it got. So how do you see this Mini fitting into the whole iPad lineup? - Well, it's our biggest upgrade ever for iPad Mini. It is huge, as you said. And people use it in so many different ways. We wanted to appeal to all of these type of usages. People really love the power of having this incredible device in the palm of their hand, having the full iPad experience, not part of an iPad. What we see is people are using it in the classroom, they're using it in hospitals, they're using it to capture photos, to capture video. It's amazing all the use cases of it. When you have something so ultra-portable like this, it's incredible where it goes. I just happen to have one here. (Justine gasps) (Tim laughs) - Oh, this is such a treat! - Oh, it's unbelievable. - That's awesome. - It's really unbelievable. - Look at that. It's great. And with 5G capability, too- - And with 5G. - You really can take this everywhere. I sort of was joking on Twitter. I tweeted, I was like, \"I think I'm moving my entire business and all of my workflow to the iPad Mini.\" But it's wild 'cause I actually think I could. - Yeah, that's the thing that is so jaw-dropping about it, is that you could put so much performance in a form factor like this. It's really incredible. I think everybody that is an iPad Mini fan is really gonna have their day with getting one of these. - Yeah, even you would have some new iPad Mini users, I think. - Yeah. Yeah, I suspect you're right. - I am, of course, a huge iPhone fan, too, and you guys announced a lot of stuff here with the iPhone 13. And one of the things that, for me as a creator, that got me so excited is this new camera system. So how do you see the whole iPhone 13 lineup changing the way that people create content? - You know, things like Cinematic mode. This is like having a Hollywood rig in your pocket. It's mind blowing. The iPhone 13 Pro with three incredible new cameras, the best dual camera system ever on the iPhone 13. You're absolutely right, there's so much here. - Yeah. What's great, too, is I'm so glad that you guys released a pink iPhone because I was gonna be here... I was like, that was my number one question. I was like, Tim, can we please get a pink iPhone, and you guys did it. So you're off the hook now. (laughs) - I saw your tweet. I saw your tweet. I'm so glad that you're happy with it. - Yes! And I think that's the thing that's so fun, is you guys have all these really great colors, too. So it's like you really can express yourself, not only creatively by creating content, but you can choose whichever color you like, too. - You absolutely can. And all the colors are incredible. They even look better in person. - [Justine] The new Sierra Blue, big fan. - Yes. - It's gonna really complement that pink iPhone 13. - This is the one that I'm using. - That's awesome. - Yes. - So another thing, obviously, huge Apple Watch fan. I think ever since the beginning of I guess when the first Apple Watch came out, for me personally, it really changed the way that I worked out, the way that I sort of quantified my fitness, and even had competitions with friends. Has the Apple Watch changed the way that you approach fitness, or changed from your daily activities that you normally would do? - You know, I can't imagine doing a workout now without the Apple Watch. Pretty amazing to me of what I used to think I did versus what I really do. And the watch sorta motivated me to begin to do what I thought I was doing before, but I wasn't really doing. It's so great to get notes and so forth from customers where it's really changed their life in a material way. They're more healthy and more fit. Fitness+ has been out for a little under a year, and it's just amazing the idea of democratizing the world's best trainers and inviting them into your home, coming to where you are, or on the go. Now we've added more workouts with Pilates, and ski workouts, and one that I'm gonna be doing is meditation. We're really happy to bring all of these things to our customers. - Fitness+ was something that I was really excited when you guys announced this because I do a ton of workouts from home, on various digital platforms. And what I loved so much about it was a lot of these classes that I've done on other platforms, I feel like sometimes my time was wasted, and I feel like there is never a class that I have done on Apple Fitness where I feel like I didn't get a good workout, or it was engaging and fun. So whatever you guys are doing over there, congrats, and it's honestly so great. - You know, it's all about the people that we have in Fitness+, the trainers are unbelievable, and the integration with Apple Watch is just amazing in terms of keeping you motivated through the workout and helping you achieve your fitness goals. - Yeah, it's so fun. Do you have any favorite fitness workouts that you usually like to do? - You know, I've made a rule of not having any favorites. (laughs) - But that's the thing, I've actually been inspired by going through, and I'm like, I think I'm gonna try some tai chi now, like why not? It's an Apple Fitness option, so let's do it. Oh, you also announced some of the additional bike features. - This fall detection is a huge deal. I get several notes daily about people that fall detection has been activated on, and so now bringing that in terms of more cases, more use cases, is gonna be really a big deal. - No, it's really cool. And oh, another thing, too, the group fitness classes. - Yeah, yeah. - So before, doing group fitness classes was such a way for me to get motivated, so this is such a cool integration. And I'm really hoping that I can get 32 of my tech YouTuber friends to agree to doing a group fitness class. - You know, there's nothing like joining with your peers to do fitness because it pushes you to do more than you would do normally. So that's what Fitness+ is all about, is helping you get the most out of your workout. - Yeah, and it's just like everything integrates so well with the Apple ecosystem, and just being able to get those notifications directly on Apple TV. - Yeah, and you know, I love the digital badges that you can earn. There was one for national parks recently. You may have taken that. - Yeah. - Yeah, I love getting these. And even if I have not planned to work out for the day and one of those things come up, I have to go work out. It really shows that they work. - No, and it's super motivating, too, 'cause you're actually able to look and see the progress of your fitness. So during the pandemic, I never thought I was a runner. I started running just because it was something new and fun, and the Apple Watch honestly was that main motivator 'cause you actually could see the heart rate data and you could see the progression. And I think that's so inspiring for so many people. - You know, we didn't plan it like this, but Fitness+ showed up at exactly the right time for people because of the pandemic, and enabled them to go sample a lot of different kind of workouts for their home. Gotten quite a bit of feedback about that. - Also what I love, is I feel like it's not too advanced. There's classes for everyone. So it's like, my grandmother can work out, I can work out, and everybody in between. So I feel like you're really including everyone in that. - Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're a beginner or you're advanced, you can find something on there that is for you. - Also going into AR, so I'm such a huge fan of augmented reality, and I know you guys didn't talk much about it here, but with LiDAR in so many of these devices, what kind of big picture scenario do you see this fitting into people's lives in the future? - You know, I am so excited about AR. I think AR is one of these very few profound technologies that we will look back on one day and went, how did we live our lives without it? And so right now you can experience it in thousands of ways using your iPad or your iPhone, but of course, those will get better and better over time. Already it's a great way to shop, it's a great way to learn. It enhances the learning process. I can't wait for it to be even more important in collaboration and so forth. So I'm AR fan number one. I think it's that big. - Okay, then I must be number two 'cause I don't wanna claim your number one spot. (laughing) But I just think that the future of that... I always have so many big ideas that I feel like it's gonna really change the way that content creators create and consumers enjoy that content. - Yeah. I agree. I mean, simple things today that you can use it for, like if you're shopping for a sofa, or a chair, or a lamp, in terms of really experiencing it in your place, we've never been able to do that before until the last couple years or so. And that's at the early innings of AR. It will only get better. - I'm very excited. So one last thing. So everyone knows that I am a huge fan of Apple Stores. I love the experience, just from shopping, to the Today at Apple classes. And I also saw you there at the Downtown Los Angeles store opening. - [Tim] It was the last time we saw each other. - Yes! It was so amazing, that was so fun. And that store is just so beautiful. But how do you see this store and many others reviving parts of cities and giving back to communities? - Yeah, that store in particular, it's so incredible to be in a position to give back to the city, and give back to the community there. And this old theater, as you saw it, the before picture that you probably saw and the after picture are totally different. We restored it, we preserved it. It's an important part of history in Downtown L.A. It's the first motion picture theater with audio. It's a very important place, and it had been left just untouched for decades. So it was great to be able to restore it, and now to be able to have Today at Apple sessions and Creative Studios in the store and to be able to connect underrepresented communities directly with mentors and creatives in the community so that they can mentor their creative career, and so forth. This is really big. It really warms my heart. - Me too. And that's why I was so excited just to see it bringing life back into Downtown, and getting that foot traffic and getting people out and just really enjoying the technology. And obviously huge fan of Apple Store, so it was so good to see you there. And congratulations on the launch, congratulations on a successful event today. - Thank you. - And of course, we can maybe FaceTime later on the new iPhone 13s when they come out. - I will look forward to it. I'm already using mine. (laughs) - Oh my gosh. I will definitely also send you a group invite to our Fitness+ classes. No pressure, but the invite is open. - I'll look forward to it. - Thank you so much. - Yeah, thank you for having me on your program. - I appreciate it. - Yeah. - See ya. - Bye-bye. (mellow music) - Well, thank you guys for watching, and Tim, thank you so much for joining me here on my YouTube channel. This was so much fun. I have been a huge Apple fan my entire life, and one of the reasons that I've loved Apple so much is it was the first device, when I was very young, that I found that let me express myself, that allowed me to create in ways that I never thought were possible. And ever since I was a little kid, I've carried that through to today. So to be able to chat with Tim, who has been such a huge part of Apple and has really almost shaped our entire generation was really incredible. And also something that is kind of personal to me is Apple Stores. I love the Apple Store experience so much. Jenna just texted me to tell Tim that she said hi. She's like, 20 minutes late, but Tim, my sister says hi. (laughing) I'm gonna say \"You're too late.\" You're too late, Jenna! Anyway, I could talk about this forever, but I'm just so thankful and grateful for all of you guys who watch my videos and who support creators because you really do allow us to live our dreams and be able to just keep creating content. And it's just honestly so fun, and I might start crying, so I'm just gonna end this video right now. I'll see you guys in the next one. Make sure you subscribe. Bye! Subscribe for tears.

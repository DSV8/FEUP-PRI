    "transcript": "if you know the question why you ask what do I say right it should be fun the tomahawk gaming system oh let's keep this here and then maybe I'll bring the this will be fine right all right hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Hardware Canucks on my first video from CES so please be kind in the comments visiting Razer and seeing this new iteration of the Razer tomahawk initially when we saw it it was the Lian Li Apha rebrand but the Razer tomahawk not to be confused with that Tower is now something that has evolved into this really cool NUC iteration system that is going to be raised at Omaha a full gaming system that they will include the graphics card that will include the new NUC 9 series that we'll talk about later but they're also launching the Razer tomahawk chassis standalone version the n1 and as usual big thanks to our sponsors Razer fantex be quiet and Thermaltake for making CES 2020 possible so let's talk about the chassis itself it will come in four components as you see the shell by itself it's a 10 liter design so pretty compact following the ITX footsteps but actually quite quite a bit slimmer there's no power button no i/o yet but it will come in later we have tempered glass on both sides Razer only on the rear side as to not interfere with any graphics card that will be showcased on this side very clean industrial lines love the angularity of this really love the mesh design on the top currently no talk about if they want to include any mesh on either of the sides but love the design very cohesive beautiful frame they do include two 120mm fans for exhaust to the top and that should provide adequate cooling for the NUC nine and for the GPU itself plus there's a bit of insulation at the bottom to as the base plate does raise the whole chassis a little bit off the ground now let's talk about the actual internal components of that Tomahawks chassis so we have the actual sled it is two lists just basically inserts from the back really elegant approach we have the power supply it is an sfx unit it will be there not sure about the actual water jet but up to seven 50 watts that they're currently available in the market and we also have the daughter cart at the bottom so it might have an additional MDOT to slot inside obviously have the slot for the Nook 9 and for the GPU multiple connectors both for efficient power for the actual NUC 9 and the graphics card and plenty of length here to include any high end graphics card that you want to populate inside this case beautiful elegant entire system cnc aluminum tempered glass it is blocked off so careful with those fingerprints so let's bring in Mike so he can tell you more about what this whole new hardware iteration of CPU on the PCI card means for the future of computing okay so I really really wanted to talk quickly about the NUC 9 and Intel's new ecosystem so what this is it's almost a complete PC just on one single card that's connected to the daughter card with a PCIe connector now on here you have a motherboard you have m2 SSDs and you have a coffee lake ninth gen notebook CPU in this case is either than I $9.99 a thk the I 790 750 H or the I 590 300 H right yes there are mobile CPUs but that's to keep the TDP very very low now the idea here is to take one of these and install it directly into the NUC onto the daughter board pop it in like that and then in this case or in raisers case you're actually able to install a full-length GPU in there you're gonna see in our Nook coverage that in Intel's concept nook they can only install an 8 inch GPU into theirs so in Razer's case they can go all the way up to a 12 inch GPU that you install into the daughter cards so Razer's idea here is to build upon a nook ecosystem by creating what they call the tomahawk gaming desktop and now what that includes is a GPU along with the NUC 9 compute module that can include any of the CPUs that I talked about earlier and have this as a complete desktop that they either sell themselves or sell through some of their partners personally I think there's super super interest simply because of the fact that you can have a complete system that still has the three year enough nine warranty and it just comes in this beautiful sleek complete jassi's what cut cut right now it looks like this is going to be released in the first half of 2020 but what we also want to know is what would you pay for it we have in here a coffee lake notebook processor potentially a rtx 20 80 and a bunch of other components including memory and and SSDs that razor would include as part of their complete desktop system so pricing wise we were saying something around the lines of $2,500 is that something that you would pay for it or would you be willing to go above that for something that's this compact now as for the launch date that's TBD at this point in time but it looks like it's going to be in the first half of 2020 so I think that covers pretty much everything that we wanted to look at here at Razer but we're gonna have some additional NUC 9 coverage with more technical details coming right up so make sure you stick around for that I'm Mike with Hardware Canucks from CES 2020 eavers behind the camera Demetri is behind him and we have got four other guys from Razer right here I'm gonna see you may be the next one maybe not",

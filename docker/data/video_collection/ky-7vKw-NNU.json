    "transcript": "- It's a shorter circuit. The Nintendo switch is very portable but you know it's not portable. It's dock, way too big. You know what I wanna use instead, the ginkgo covert switch dock. It's like the size of a wall plug, but it's also a dock. Let's check it out. Inside the box, we got the manual, a USBC cord with a right angle connector, the dock itself, a weird sticker and travel adapters. USBC to switch, USBC to dock, HD mighta dock. Well, it's working, but it thinks the switches in the dock so I have to detach the controllers. Okay, that's a weird limitation, but on the plus side, the USBC port can actually charge and be displayed after for your other devices as well. Well, that's definitely more convenient than the regular dock, but it's also more expensive at $70 U.S. So, if you've got the moolah, and not very much backpack space, it's an option. Hey, you want more shorter circuits like this one, subscribe, hit the button below.",

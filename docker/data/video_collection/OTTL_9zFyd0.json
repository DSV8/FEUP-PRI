    "transcript": "in my last video looking at gaming PC listings online I found a PC on a UK based site called curries that had me mildly impressed okay I I can get behind this system however going by the comment section on that video Currys has farted in the Kebab of every person living in the UK so I decided to fly to London and buy a gaming PC from Currys myself to see if I end up with a stinky Kebab but before we do that it's time for a quick word from today's video sponsor that helped pay for this journey today's video is sponsored by epidemic sound if you've watched even a single one of my videos you've heard a lot of their music from hits like two here's another one foreign how about some sound effects epidemic sound offers a huge library of high quality royalty-free music and sound effects with a library that's growing by the week and you never have to worry about copyright claims sign up to the annual personal plan using my code david50 to get 50 off use the link in my description below and enter the code at checkout thank you epidemic sound for sponsoring today's video foreign fact maple syrup is the only thing you can buy in a Canadian Airport Currys okay so apparently it's just the Best Buy here's all the OEM crap boxes hell yeah I guess this is where the gaming lives so apparently in-store stock of gaming pre-built crap doesn't really exist in the UK so we're gonna have to order a summon online gaming PC physically inner Currys which is already soiling my Kebab a bit but luckily curries does offer next day delivery on their gaming systems which seems quite a bit faster than other UK based pre-built sites now in the meantime I did stumble onto a CeX which is like a used electronic shop now they didn't have any pre-builts other than just an old Optiplex but they did have some deals on used graphics cards and gaming consoles and stuff like that and it was a pretty cool shop would you look at that I finally got my hands on the PC all of you told me not to buy so let's see if it's gonna bring flesh eating bacteria into my life now aside from it not really having any print on the box which is good uh we do have handles on the side of the box which makes it really annoying to carry actually okay we've got some some pretty soft foam in here protecting the case it's good oh okay that just came straight out oh I think this is actually the E-Waste peripherals we got so let's have a closer look at these are ready to upgrade guide okay that's interesting it kind of tells you what all the parts are in the system and it even has a guide for upgrading like RAM and stuff in a laptop so this is I think what you get with any PC specialist kind of sub brand stuff and then there's some more just general little pieces that you need to upgrade a system with like SATA cables so I think they just chuck all the motherboard and case accessories into this box basically and we still don't get E-Waste peripherals let's open it survived being dropped on its head now I'm actually very hopeful that it survived me dropping it on its head because it's got the kind of like internal expandy foam stuff inside so it should actually be okay on the front we have this kind of metal effect pretty sure that's plastic that wraps all the way around to the sides so the only real gap for front airflow is this bit here that's been kind of cellophane off they just wanted to make sure that if you are the type of person that doesn't peel the plastic off of electronics that your system will catch on fire so that's a nice touch and you actually have to remember to also remove the plastic from the bottom front lip otherwise you're losing half of your air intake around the back we do have a very limited rear i o I hope these aren't USB 2 ports because if we just have one USB 3 on the back that would be that would be pretty sad uh but it's okay it's all usable and then here we have the graphics card which is relatively exciting we'll get into what that is a bit later we've also got some Wi-Fi down here and then the power supply which I think is also by Corsair but again we'll have a closer look at that a bit later and then again on this side we've got instructions in all of the languages on how to get your system set up the first time which again that's really nice I like that inclusion then we've gone for a bit of a bit of foamies hey there we go oh it looks so comfy on the bean bag wow that PC looks surprisingly well put together the first thing you'll notice is look at that we 've got dual Channel Ram we also don't get a relationship ruiningly tiny CPU Cooler which is very nice I don't actually recognize that cooler but it does look like it very much is a Cooler Master hyper 212 equivalent so that's a very solid cooler for the CPU that we have under here which is actually an Intel i5 12400f a very very good CPU and that is paired with an RTX 3060. this is a Zotac card that I've not had any personal experience with so yeah it'll be interesting to see how the temperatures stack up in this case but other than that we've got an SSD which I also don't recognize it's just got like a like a PC specialist sticker on it and then the motherboard is a gigabyte b660 ds3h which it's got a little bit of vrm cooling on it now aside from the standard gaming pre-built front fan Suffocation which admittedly on this case doesn't seem as bad as the worst offenders there is unusually little to complain about in terms of assembly but with that let's have a look at the back of the case oh someone put some real time and effort into managing this rear Cable Management this is the neatest PC booty I think I've ever seen look at all of that it's all zip tied down nicely the same goes for up here I mean that is like Overkill zip tying down to keep everything in place nicely now in terms of the power supply we have a Corsair cv550 in here which is like a little Berber Corsair power supply um it's fine it's not the greatest but it is one of the newer gray label ones so I don't think it's an immediate fire hazard they've even made it pretty easy to get your hands on the like SATA power connectors and stuff if you want to add your own hard drives or ssds in the back of the case I don't think I've even gotten close to Cable managing a system this neatly look at that very clean PC booty now that's not a great first startup sign just immediately seeing bull guard optimizing your PC don't love that we've also got bull guard secure browser wow Bulldog does have a whole lot of stuff going on all apps let's see so aside from GeForce experience we've got the kind of like gigabyte App Center so this is the control all of the RGB on it which yeah it makes sense that that's on here that does seem to be the worst of it so it's just an antivirus uh Windows 11 and some RGB software so it's definitely not Dell system loaded down but it it could be better anyway let's see what speed the ram is running at look at that that's very exciting it's actually running at its rated speed out of the box which is very rare for this kind of system and it's in dual channels so we don't have any immediately apparent just gunshots to the kneecaps of the performance of the system and on that note let's try and game on it gone straight up to about 75 on the GPU we've barely been playing that's not ideal but we are currently stuck in the hell heat summer of London so that may that may actually affect it with 1080p very high settings it's it's running very nicely like this is about as good a GTA 5 gaming experiences you can have at 1080p the frame time graph is very flat so there's no like weird stutters or anything going on Okay so we've been playing Battlefield 5 for 1080p High settings for about 20 minutes now and the temperatures have stabilized at an acceptable place especially considering with our highly accurate and scientific ambient temperature measurement uh we are at least 26 degrees Celsius here so yeah that's not too bad it does sound like the system's struggling a little bit in the heat we're not there's no throttling happening and we're not losing any performance that's it's good if it were to be like a dowel system of the same price it would have exploded by now and what's also a really good sign is that there's nothing that obviously knee capping any performance here uh the system is actually quite balanced in terms of CPU and GPU pairing at 1080p so here we have cyberpunk running a 1080p High settings and um It's actually kind of boring at this point because well everything's running perfectly fine the graphics gots a little bit unhappy that the fires of Mordor are burning inside this room and considering that it's not now after testing this system I was surprised at how little there was to complain about yes the graphics card did get a bit hot but we were pre-apocalyptic London Heat Wave so yeah fair enough now in terms of pricing I paid a thousand one hundred and fifty British Pounds Sterling for this system which translates into about a thousand three hundred and eighty US Dollars and remember that includes shipping and tax so taking all of that into account let me know in the comment section down below what you thought of this Curry's system and if you have personal experience with the curry system I'd also be very interested to hear about that also thank you very much to the awesome patreons that helped support the channel and make things like this possible which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching bye",

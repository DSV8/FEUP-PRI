    "transcript": "Before we get started I want to let you know that I will not be setting anyof the alarms off in this video. When you last went shopping for smoke detectors, did you notice that there were two different detection technologies availableto put your dollars towards? Let me tell ya, even though I shop for smoke alarms every otherWednesday it hadnt occurred to me. Thats a lie, this is just a silly setup. In fact I onlyrarely go shopping for smoke detectors, but the last time I did was to replace one of minebecause SOMEbody had installed the wrong type! The wrong type? Theres a wrong type ofsmoke detector? Well suboptimal might be a better word. See, the detector outside my bedroom is in a hallway that leads to the kitchen. And its right next to a return vent for the buildings HVAC system. Thats not ideal from the start but its hardwired and interconnected to theother alarms here so moving it isnt an option. Anyway, being almost in the kitchen and having kitchen air pulled near to it, I was getting nuisance alarms every time I made toast. AndI am not exaggerating. Every. Single. Time. And often when I dared to simply use the oven! Didnt even matter if I had put something in it yet. What was going on? Well, that smokealarm (which is now right here) used the good old fashioned ionization chamber for its smoke detection abilities. Its slightly radioactive! Now thats a tried and truemethod for detecting smoke, in fact in some cases it works a littletoo well, uh but these days its revealing its weaknesses and according to some theseshould be considered obsolete. I replaced it with a photoelectric smoke detector and not only have the nuisance alarms completely stopped but I will probably have more advanced warningof a fire should one happen. At least, depending on the fire. Ah! A nuanced discussion! Those go great withthe internet. Let me start out by saying that regardless of what smoke alarms you might havein your home the most important thing is that you have them and that you know they are functional. If you cant remember the last time you checked your smoke alarms, do it right now. Seriously,pause the video, make sure you have them, and if youre able to test them without setting off a central monitoring system, do it. Most every fire-related tragedy we hear about these days stems from a home without working smoke alarms, meaning those tragedies were almost certainlypreventable, and all too easily. You should have a smoke alarm in every bedroom, in locationsimmediately outside of sleeping areas such as hallways, and in addition to that there should be at least one on every level of your home. Consult your local fire authority for more specific recommendations and requirements in your area. Lets start with a bit of history. Smokedetectors are a fairly recent invention and the household smoke alarm didnt hitmeaningful mass production until the 1970s. We needed to clear two hurdles before the smoke alarm would be commonplace: First, a reliable and relatively cheap smoke sensor needed to bedevised. And secondly, wed need to figure out how to make some cheap and mass-producibleelectronics which could monitor that sensor and sound an alarm if smoke was detected. As ithappens, the principle on which these first smoke sensors operate was discovered by accident in the1930s by Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger. He was trying to invent something which could detect poison gas, which didnt work. But his device did react to the smoke particles coming from hislit frustration cigarette. Or so goes the story. The sensor used in the first commercial smokealarms and plenty that are still producedtoday operates on the same principle asJaegers experimental device. It is made of a pair of electrodes that span an air gap, andsitting below a hole in one of the electrodes is a teensy little bit of americium-241 which emits alpha particles by way of being, ya know, radioactive. As the americium decaysand flings out those particles, they collide with the nitrogen and oxygen atoms that make up the bulk of air and knock loose some of their electrons. This results in some charged gas molecules between the two plates. And with the help of a power source to maintain a voltage potential betweenthe plates, often a 9-volt battery, those now charged molecules become attracted tothe electrodes, and the end result once they move towards them is a lil bit of current flow. And I do mean a lil bit, about 100 picoamps. However, when somethings burning and releasing smoke particles into the air, once those smoke particles get between the twoelectrodes, they start absorbing or blocking the alpha particles coming from the americium. That preventsthe ionization of the nitrogen and oxygen molecules, which stops the flow of current betweenthe plates. A relatively simple electronic circuit can monitor for current flow andsound an alarm if it stops, and with the development of the MOSFET and its cheapeningin the 1970s, suddenly we had everything we needed to produce an inexpensive, automaticdevice for warning of the presence of smoke. Now, if youre anything like me, you might think that resorting to radioactive isotopesseems... a bit much. Its not dangerous or anything, alpha particles are easily stopped - the radiation cant even get through the plastic shell ofthe alarm. But, it still feels like a rather exotic technique. After all, we can seesmoke particles with our eyes. And our eyes work because of light. And since we cansee smoke using our light-sensing eyes, theres probably a way to use a light sensorto detect smoke. Indeed there is. All the way back in 1972, Donald F. Steele and Robert B.Enemark devised an optical smoke detector, which worked using essentially the same principle as modern-day photoelectric smoke detectors. Their idea was to put a light source and two light sensing photocells in a detection chamber which would allow air to freely move through it, but which contained a series of light traps to prevent ambient light from getting in. FYI,photocells werent by any means a new thing at this point - this wasnt groundbreaking tech, justa clever idea. Anyway, the sensors were arranged so that only one of them could see the lightsource. The second sensor had no line of sight to the light source, with a series of light-blockingvanes in the way. When smoke particles entered the chamber, though, light from the light source wouldreflect off those particles in every which way and become scattered. Think of it like a laserbeam in a smoky room. The second sensor could now see the light coming from the light source, thus smoke was detected, and an alarm is sounded. These early photoelectric alarms used two sensors as a means of testing the functionality of thelight source. If no light was detected in the first sensor, this would indicate that the light source had failed. Which was pretty likely as the earlydesigns used incandescent lamps. And no, they were not battery-powered, which is likely a reason the ionization sensor was preferred for so long. These days, though, a much simpler and way less power-hungry arrangement of infrared LED and single photodetector is used. The photodetector ispositioned in the detection chamber so that it cant see the LED, and every few seconds the detector will put out a little blip of light. It may also blip a visible LED on the exterior to give indication that itspowered on and functional. If it can't see the blip in the photodetector, then the air must be clean. If, however, the chamber has smoke in it, the smoke particles will scatter the lightand some will be picked up by the photodetector. That usually wont trigger an alarm rightaway, though. Modern designs are often programmed upon first detection to begin anadditional and more frequent series of blips to guard against false alarms. If, for instance, apiece of dust happened to float into the chamber, well you wouldnt want thealarm to go off just for that. So it will perform a routine where it checks a few more times in rapid succession for scatteredlight. It may also be looking for an increasingsignal amplitude and thus thicker smoke over time before committing to an alarm condition, thoughthats speculation on my part. In any case, if it keeps seeing light hit the photocell after a pre-programmed test period, it will sound the alarm. So, we have two commonly-produced and easily obtainable smoke detection technologies at hand: one using commodity LEDs, photodetectors, a bit of electronics and some plastic, and the other using some plastic, a bit of electronics,a couple of metal plates, and an exoticsynthetic radioisotope of americium. Why are we still making this second kin- [exasperation noises] Thats a good question, but before I move on to the pros and cons here, I want to share thatthe principle of optical smoke detection is as flexible as it is simple. While spot-sensing smokealarms work as Ive described, another option is to shine a beam of light across a large distanceand measure its received intensity. You can modulate that beam in some way to allow a sensor to pick up a signal through ambient light, and a sudden dropout of that modulated signal or simple intensity loss can indicate smoke. These are often used in buildings with large openspaces like atria, and in such buildings you might have seen a funny-looking device at one end of aceiling pointing across the building to another one on the other end, or perhaps a retroreflector. Theres a pretty good chance that was, in fact, a smoke sensor incorporated intothe buildings fire alarm system. Alright, with two very differentdetection methods, its probably no surprise that the two technologies respond differently to different kinds of smoke. This may in part explain why ionization alarms arestill on the market - remember how this one was sensing smoke whenever I made toast? Toastmakingis really just slightly burning bread, and even though I dont like my toast all that dark, little whisps of smoke are produced as the surface of the bread gets singed. These smoke particles arereally, really small though. So small that they can barely be seen. However, those particles arevery good at absorbing the alpha particles emitted from the americium, and so not a lot of that kindof smoke is needed to set off one of these alarms. These very small, often invisible smokeparticles are commonly emitted from things that are actively on fire. And this makesthe ionization alarm technology particularly sensitive to the flaming stage of a fire. Infact, even apparently clean-burning flames can set them off - that may have been why just usingthe oven was prone to causing an alarm in my case. Car exhaust can also trigger these alarms, whichis why smoke alarms are rarely recommended in garages. This has been a particularly puzzling thing to me as, ya know, cars catch on fire sometimes and I would think a smoke alarm in theplace where you keep your car is a decent idea. Anyway, while ionization alarms are really good arguably too good at detecting fine smoke particles, they are absolutely crap at detectinglarge smoke particles. If a room is slowly filling up with visible smoke, an ionization alarm mayvery well do nothing. You might think, \"oh, so what? You said its good atdetecting smoke from a flaming fire, and so long as its gonna wake me when a fires actually happening what does it matter?\" Well, most fires dont just suddenly happen. They start slowly. And in the initial smoldering stages of a fire, the smoke particles tend tobe the large, visible kind. If all you have in your home are ionization alarms, they may notreact at all to that situation. And thats bad! Studies comparing ionization and photoelectric smoke sensing technologies have routinely shown that in the smoldering stage of a fire, photoelectric alarms respond much more quickly than their ionization counterparts. Some experimentshave shown photoelectric alarms responding to the early stages of fire more thanan hour before an ionization alarm does. Early warning of such fires is obviouslyvaluable, and may give occupants time to find the source of the smoke and prevent a destructive flaming fire altogether. And lets not forget that smokeitself is very dangerous, with many fire-related fatalitieshappening due to smoke inhalation. In an Australian 60 minutes program which aired back in 2014, a photoelectric alarm was activated about seven minutes into a simulated fire, meanwhile three ionization alarms didnt respond at all to the very smoky test environment. Whichis astounding! A smoke alarm which doesnt react to a smoldering fire and a smoke-filledroom isnt a very useful smoke alarm. Some jurisdictions have reacted to thisnew knowledge by mandating photoelectric alarm technology and discouraging theuse of ionization detectors. However, not all of them have. Ionization alarms still havethat one narrow advantage; they do react more quickly to a flaming fire, and a photoelectric alarm needs large-ish particles which can be seen, so fires which develop suddenly may not trigger them rightaway. Because of this situational difference, here in the US neither the The National FirePrevention Association nor the United States Fire Administration take a firm position on thetwo technologies. They recognize the pros and cons but say that, since all fires are different, makinga recommendation either way doesnt make sense. And I sorta get that. If an ionizationalarm is better in some fires, well then maybe its good to have them. But there are several problems with fixating on that situational speed benefit. The first isthat fires which are suddenly flaming without having any smoldering action arent exactlycommon. Its not like they never happen, one possible case might be if a catknocks over a lit candle onto a tablecloth, but especially when people are sleeping, I don't think it's that common for a flaming fire to come out of nowhere. I spent some time looking for statistics and came up empty. If you know of a good source of information regarding this please share it below. The second and perhaps most important issuehere is that while ionization alarms are generally faster at detecting a flaming fire thantheir photoelectric counterparts its a matter of seconds, and not minutes. When a house fires going on it's not gonna be a nice clean burning fire for long at all, and smoke thick enough to trigger a photoelectric alarm will accumulate pretty quickly. Surely there have been cases in which the seconds mattered for survivability, but of course the counterargumentis that a photoelectric alarm may have given you an hours advancedwarning in a different situation. Now I can hear you asking; why notboth? Smoke alarms are pretty cheap, so why not have both detection technologies? Well, the smoke alarm manufacturers are way ahead of you offering dual-sensing alarms. Theres a problem with these, though. They arent exactly clear on how those sensorsget used. The packaging of this one implies that it would sound the alarm if either sensordetects smoke, but the included user guide doesnt clarify whether this is in fact the case. It simply says the alarm sounds when combustion products are detected. Some alarms like thismay not go off unless both sensors agree that there is smoke - and in that case, youre notactually getting any benefit at all as it will always be the slowest response between the twotechnologies. And the reason why they might be programmed this way has to do with the finalmajor issue with ionization alarms; false alarms. A smoke alarm which goes off when it shouldnt is a nuisance that most of us have dealt withat some point. And ionization alarms, thanksto their hyper-sensitivity towards certain kinds of invisible smoke particles, are particularly proneto false triggers - especially when placed near kitchens. False alarms arent just annoying, though, they are actually dangerous. That's because one of the most common ways people address a smoke detector which keepsdetecting erroneous smoke is to take it down or otherwise disable it. And a disabledsmoke alarm is exactly as effective as an imaginary one. Photoelectric smoke sensing is much less proneto false alarms. Theyre not impervious to the problem - as a matter of fact I had one myselfwhich developed a newfound sensitivity a few years after I first put it up and started going off whenever I used the dryer. However in that case it was an electric dryer which vented directlyinto the hallway right where the alarm was so it wasnt an ideal situation from the start. Ithink moisture probably killed it somehow. Anyway, as a more relevant example, since replacing this alarm near the kitchen with a photoelectric unit, I havent had a single nuisance alarm. Andthat was well over a year ago at this point. So where does this leave us? The answer seems kinda murky. Ionization smoke alarms work very well in specific circumstances, but hardly work at all in others. Theyre also more prone to false alarms which may make occupants more likely to disable them. Photoelectric alarms outperform them in smoldering fires and are less prone to false alarms, but they arent quite as good at alerting youto fires-in-progress. So what should you do? Personally, I dont think ionizationsmoke alarms present enough of a performance difference in active fires to justify their continued use at all. Since 2008, the International Association ofFire Fighters has recommended against theuse of ionization alarms, and as Ive alreadysaid, some authorities have taken action and mandated the use of photoelectric alarms. Infact, an ever-increasing number of authorities across the globe, including some US states. But ionizationalarms are still routinely sold in other places, including my home of Illinois. And unless you knowwhat the differences between the two technologies are, you probably havent paidany attention to this. Making matters worse is that many alarms that are out there in the wild dont make it clear what technology they use. If you takea look at the ones on your ceilings or walls, there may be no indication at all! Thesebrand new alarms, which are photoelectric, dont say that anywhere except the box! This brand-name ionization alarm does say its ionization on the back, so thatsgood I guess. The combo alarm also says its both. To tell what you have, take it off the wall and see if theres a label somewhere. Hopefully there is but if there isnt, well if you can see the insides of the alarm the ionization chamber is a pretty recognizable thing; usually it's some sort of cylinder and will havea radiation label on it, but its notalways possible to get at the insides. [voiceover] Two quick things; I was apparently wrong about there being a radiation label on the sensor body itself, and, speaking of the sensor body, the ionization chamber didnt quite look like what I expectedit to since apparently the outer shell forms one of the electrodes these days. Such are the perils of writing a script and shooting the talky bits before actually takingthe things apart. However, at least here in theUS, if its an ionization alarm theres probably gonna text regarding the fact that theresamericium-241 in there, with permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I dont knowwhat labels you might find in other countries, but if you see a warning about radioactivematerial, thats an ionization alarm. Now, there is still the fact that ionizationalarms may still be faster at alerting you toa sudden, flaming fire. It just doesnt look tome and many other like this potential benefit outweighs the various downsides of the technology. However if you think its valuable to have an ionization alarm just in case, my recommendationwould be to purchase a separate alarm and make sure to place it far away fromyour kitchen to prevent nuisance alarms. I personally wouldnt trust one of these combo alarms because it's just too unclear how the sensors actually get used in the logic - and two separate alarms are usually cheaper than one of these, anyway. For what its worth, I didnt replace one of the ionization alarms here because its far enoughfrom the kitchen to not be affected by cooking and having photoelectric alarms elsewheremakes me feel plenty safe. But when its no longer functional, I will probably go with a photoelectric alarm to replace it. I dont know if I would go so far as to call the ionization chamber an obsolete form of smoke detection, but its definitely flawed. The more peoplethat are aware of its weaknesses, the better. Before I go, youve probably seen recommendations to replace smoke alarms every 10 years. In fact, these days smoke alarms with single-use lithium cells which are designed to last10 years are pretty common - and in someplaces, those are the only battery-operated kind available. Now, the recommendationhas nothing to do with the americium. The half life of americium-241 is over 400 years, so the sensor could easily outlive you. Instead the recommendation is to guard against aging electronics causing unit failure. Im sorta on the fence about this, because 10 years is a pretty dismal life expectancy. But on the other hand, these are cheap and cheaply made so maybe its fair. What I wish were far more common was actually testing your smoke alarms withacanned smoke product. Commercial fire alarm systems get their smoke sensors actually tested this way. You might have seen someone going around with a little spray can of magic smoke and puffing it into the sensors while radioing someone else at the control panel who's looking for a response. It seems to me like cans of that stuff ought to be available for the home and that we should be recommending using it. I mean,Im sure you can find the stuff online somewhere but it has always seemed odd to methat we dont recommend that strategy for the home. Seems to me like actually proving operation of the sensor bit is more valuable than hitting a button and making sure it starts beeping. Butwhat do I know, I just make YouTube videos. alarmingly smooth jazz Let me tell you, eve - well, thats uh [clearsthroat] I wrote it as let me tell you but I wanted to say it as let me tell ya andits those little details thatll trip ya up. Well, that smoke alarm [clunk] which is now yeah. Consult your local file ath. File authority! Consult your local fileafloridaeyhamorffhhaffifceuuuigigrechoirmeninyourarea That knocks loose some of their electrons, resulting in some gas charged mole frark! When those smark smark porticles? That may have been why just using the oven was prone to causing this alarm. To alarm. Shoot. You didn't actually pause the video and check your alarms, did you? Well, here I am again tell you to do it. The video's over now, you don't have any more excuses. DO IT.",

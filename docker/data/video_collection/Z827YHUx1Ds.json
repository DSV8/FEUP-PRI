    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hey guys? How are you all doing? Really that's just great, you know. I'm doing pretty great today too because Microsoft Edge is now on the Mac. And we're gonna take a look at it real soon, but first, I just wanna thank fasthosts for sponsoring this video. And what's even more fun, is that fasthosts is giving away two tickets to two lucky UK viewers, to South by Southwest. Which also include flights and accommodation. All you have to do to enter the giveaways, click the link in the description and answer the techie test question. The question is, \"What year did Microsoft Internet Explorer first launch the Mac?\" We'll revisit this later in the episode so don't worry. So, back to this. I've been using Microsoft Edge on the Mac on and off for the past about week and a half or so, and I've also been switching between it and Chrome and Safari just making some mental notes. If you're ready, let's take a look. The big change with this new version of Edge, is it's now based on Chromium. So for the most part, it has a lot of Chrome in it in terms of the appearance and the underpinnings. This is the same for Windows version, too, but since I have a Mac, we'll look at the Mac version. But real quick, let's look at the last time Microsoft had a web browser on the Mac, years ago. It was Internet Explorer, and it used to run on the Mac operating system and it came out in 1996. - Apple has decided to make Internet Explorer, its default browser on the Macintosh. - [Crowd Member] No. - From 1997 to 2003. Internet Explorer was actually the default web browser in Mac OS until Apple replaced it with Safari in 2003. The last version of Internet Explorer on the Mac was version five, this was actually a pretty special release. And to find out why I highly recommend checking out Jimmy Grewal's blog. Jimmy worked on the Internet Explorer five project so he knows a lot about it. And on a side note, he has an amazing Apple computer collection as well and he has submitted some beautiful photos to our YouTube channel before but that doesn't do it justice. Go ahead and follow his stuff and check out his beautiful photos. They're amazing. So it's been years since Microsoft had a browser on the Mac. So now that it's back, now's the best time to install it. To install Edge, simply go to apple.com/edge, - Take two, mark. - Go to microsoft.com/edge and click download, then read every single word of the the end user to license agreement. Then, hit except, run the installer and you're good to go. By the way, I really love the icon. - [Crowd] Ooh. - But, when you open up Edge, you're greeted with a home screen which is customizable. It has different themes, as well. You can use the focus theme I highly recommend that. And I like turning the content off because the last thing I wanna do is scroll down and see a bunch of depressing news stories. You can also use the Bing search bar and you can pin websites to the home screen too. Taking a look at the user interface to no surprise it is very Chrome-esque. If you're a Chrome user, you'll find it very easy to learn because mostly everything is in the same place. Some significant changes to note include the reload button being rotated counterclockwise and the menu button dots run horizontally instead of vertically. Gosh, I sound like David Pogue. - Widgets, gadgets, not the same thing. - And the profile setting lets you sign into a profile and sync data between devices, and you can also import browser data from another web browser. Edge also has an alternative feature to Chrome's shortcut feature. Inside of Edge, you can click the instalL this site as an app button and Edge will throw a .app file into your Edge Apps folder. Now your website is basically converted into a simple app, with everything out of the way. And this is useful for web apps like Asana, pack even throw the app in your dock while you're at it. Now you have one click access to your web apps. There's also an extensions manager which has a link to the Microsoft Store where you can instalL third party extensions. But if you have a Chrome extension that isn't in the Microsoft Store, no worries with this little switch, you can allow extensions from other stores and then use them inside of Edge. Overall Edge is pretty solid. It never froze up on me or crashed. And I didn't feel like I had to relearn anything coming from Chrome. So that's really nice. But what about speed? Short answer, it didn't feel any faster or slower than and any other web browser I've used to be honest. But just for fun, let's just stress test it a little bit and take a look at some numbers will also test the CPU usage, memory usage and energy use. Let's have a look. The following tests are performed on a late 2013 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. It's running macOS 1O.14.6. The battery is fully charged and we're plugged into power too. I'll play three YouTube videos simultaneously in Edge, Chrome and Safari. And don't worry Safari, I know you don't support VP9 so I'll keep the videos in 1080p resolution, you'll get to 4K one day. (baby crying) Chrome's memory usage came in at 825abytes while the CPU was at 16.7 and the energy impact was between 15 and 24. Edge's memory usage came in at 920 megabytes. The CPU was 11.9 and energy impact was between 10 and 20. Safari's memory usage came in at 1,561 megabytes CPU was 10.7 and energy impact was between 36 and 70. In summary, Safari has the lowest CPU load, Chrome had the lowest memory usage and Edge had the lowest energy impact, while using only a little more memory than Chrome, and a slightly higher CPU load than Safari. But take these numbers with a grain of salt because your results will vary on different systems. Let's also use Basemark. This benchmark is comprised of twenty different tests and it takes several minutes to run. In the end is Safari scored 620.97 and failed to run the WebGL 2.0 test. Right, Chrome scored 716.59 and Edge scored, drumroll please, (rolling drum) Asshole. 770.81. So on paper, Edge scored the highest out of these three. But sometimes when I rerun these tests, the numbers do fluctuate and the numbers will also differ depending on what computer you run them on. So take this with a grain of salt. And by grain of salt I mean the whole Morton warehouse in Chicago. Honestly, I just think it's cool that a Microsoft web browser is back on the Mac. And back when I used windows more, I actually used the Windows version of Edge as my daily driver for my web browsing. And I thought it was pretty good. But to each his own, right? Download it, play with it. Let me know what you think. And if you have any questions about it, feel free to let me know, I'll try to help you out. And don't worry, I didn't forget about the giveaway that fasthosts is hosting. So, who exactly is fasthosts in the first place?

    "transcript": "- This sounds badass. (chair squeaks) We're doing it. Another chair, another Gaming chair. We're gonna unbox this thing. This is the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair, a $999.99 price chair. And based on the past year videos, we've done. You guys seem to enjoy the expensive, the fine things in chairs. What do we have here? I guess the first thing to figure out is how should we be unboxing this? I don't see any instructions just comes in a plain box. That's fine. No big deal. We don't need a big fancy show. Maybe this is how you're saving like $500. So far the packaging is definitely a little bit worse than the past two chairs that I've opened up the Razor Iskur and the Logitech Herman Miller Embody Gaming Chair But see what we got. What kinda goodies we got here? Mavix's M-wheels enhanced gaming experience. I don't know if there's a good method to getting the top of the chair out. No, this definitely What the heck! Typically, when the boxes have like the pull-off thing they actually tell you that. So unless I'm missing something it doesn't explicitly tell me that. So, you know what? I'm gonna blame instructions on that one. (box pops) I'll tell you right now, this thing pops. So the fact that it comes completely assembled, it's pretty cool. So that was a pretty subpar unboxing experience but at least it came completely assembled. So you don't have to mess around with that. I know the Razor chair we had to partially put together the Herman Miller Logitech Embody Chair just kinda rolled right out of the box, which is really nice. Keep in mind though, that's an extra like $500 up on this chair. Wow! So I'm actually not gonna lie based on their website. And just the way that the design elements are on the site. This thing looks way cooler in person than it does on the site. And I'm not just saying that. And also this material on the back rest here, this is nice. I need other people to validate the feelings that I'm feeling right now. So at this point, some of you guys might be wondering who is Mavix? And honestly, I said the exact same thing. So I went over to their website. I got a little bit of a marketing speak from who they are and what they're trying to do here. So let me just read it right off their site. Mavix is developed by a partnership combining a team with over 20 years of experience, designing ergonomic office chairs and a group of Endemic Gamers. Mavix is carefully crafted an ergonomic gaming solution that breaks the mold of previous Gaming chairs. So the next thing we need to do is sit in this bad boy right after a word from our sponsor. Thanks to Vessi for sponsoring today's short circuit. I'm actually wearing their shoes right now. I didn't even know they will sponsor for today's video. That's sick! Vessi footwear is known for being waterproof, lightweight, and comfortable. The shoes won't trap heat or air with the dynamax material. It'll keep your feet cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Lots of us here at LMG, wear them all the time like myself. So keep your feet dry by using code shortcircuit for $25 off at vessi.com/shortcircuit down below. All right, we're going to take a seat. We're gonna see how this thing feels. Does it feel as nice as it looks? Yeah, it does. It feels nice. This thing is sick. And actually it is very, very smooth. Even the reclining in its base form. I haven't touched anything, messed with anything. It is nice. It's not too touchy. It's not too, you know, rigid. It's not giving me a lot of pressure back but it is supporting my lower back, which is nice. And I'm sitting quite terribly to be completely honest. I'm not sure how well the white color will hold up over time with like, you know, you get your mountain Dew and your Dorito chip dust on it and stuff like that. But, man this thing feels nice. This is by far the comfiest chair that I've sat in for my first experience. My first impressions out of any of the chairs that I've looked at so far on this channel. So that's, that's cool. I wonder how it holds up with Gaming but first we should probably go over all the features that the chair has. So let's do that. So we're gonna go ahead and go through Mavix's feature nine functions. So the first been of course, like many other Gaming chairs the Headrest tilts, tilt down, tilt up actually interesting. I mean, sure. You know, why not? (chair squeaks) Woo hoo hoo (chair squeaks) It's supposed to make that noise. (chair squeaks) That sounds badass. (chair squeaks) That's pretty neat. So tall people can enjoy it and short people can enjoy. That's fantastic. a chair for everyone. Maybe not everybody, but it's more than a few people. So next step is going to be the infinite Locking Position recline feature, which I need to find again. Well, its not this thing. No, it's over here. No, maybe it's this. No. I didn't find the tilt thing, but I did find the ability to be able to move the seat forward and backward, which is pretty fancy (chair squeaks) Shimmy shimmy Woo. (chair squeaks) That's fun. it's pretty cool. What? So what did you do, you pull it up? - Pull it up. Wow, I feel like I'm gonna fall over this doesn't feel safe again very smooth, very comfortable. My lower back is still being supported, which is cool. The lumbar support system isn't quite in the right spot yet, but okay. I feel like I'm gonna fall over, but that's sturdy. All right. So next up is they're four dimensional Armrest. So this is actually a little spooky, but that's okay. It feels kind of wrong to be doing that but I think it's fine. Or I'm just like absolutely destroying the chair right now. It doesn't feel supernatural, but sure. Anyways, you can also go up and go down classic ofcourse. And can you move these forward and back? Interesting. Okay. So I'm sure you guys have seen other Gaming chairs where you can move the Armers forward and backward. It's a small chance that I'm doing it wrong, but hopefully not. It is cool that you can just and you don't have to press any buttons or whatever you just if you wanna change your armrest position, you're Gaming. You wanna straight ahead Game. So then the last main thing that we're gonna check out is their dynamic variable Lumbar support system. This is what Mavix is calling an Advanced Tensile Recovery fabric. This is why when I first sat on this chair it was super comfortable because this automatically adjusted to the way I was sitting rather than needing me to adjust it to me. So that's pretty cool. So the last thing that I haven't done I haven't done a true Caster test with these original Casters that are on the thing. You know It's nice. They're not the smoothest Casters, but I mean they're hefty. Gamers gotta play a Gamer game in a Gaming chair. Game, Game. Man, I think I could sleep in this thing right now because the chair is so smooth. I'm like naturally kinda all over the place. All right. So the only thing that's left is to get some other people to come in and give their thoughts. - Get the Gamer still going. - So do you like the tilt? do you leave your chairs like locked when you're Gaming or do you have them tilt? So my chair at home the whole thing is kinda just one piece. So it all tilts back This one's actually pretty nice I'm realizing cause only the back seems to tilt and your the bottom part where your butt is, stays the same. - When I'm at my desk, I'm usually holding a Controller and I know I'm gonna get a little bit of smack for that but I'm usually holding a Controller. So I want it to be angled in and I want my arms to just fall like this. - I think it's comfortable. - It's pretty good ,right?so - Yeah - Yeah so - I mean, I'd rather have a seat that's too wide than too tiny. - 800%. - Yeah. Fantastic. do you want to buy this chair for a thousand dollars? Ergonomics support and then actually a really comfortable chair? I will potentially maybe possibly buy one of these or I'll just take this one which I'm actually probably just going to do so thank you guys very much for watching. Make sure to like the video, comment, get subscribed and we'll see on the next one or other people will cause I'm gone. Cause I'm taking this chair. Bye-bye (wooh.)",

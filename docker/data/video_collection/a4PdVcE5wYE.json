    "transcript": "- Oh my goodness, you guys, right now I'm in New York for a little meetup here to see the New Max that they just launched. They announced not just one chip, three chips, the new M3, the M3 Pro, and the M3 Pro Max. (alarm beeping) And obviously as a huge Mac user, I cannot be more excited because for the past year, the M2 MacBook Pro has completely changed my life. It is my main computer that I use for almost everything. Even though I have the incredible powerful studio, with the amount that I travel, this MacBook can literally do everything that I need and so much more. So I can't wait to test these out. Speaking of testing them out, I haven't got to do just that yet, but I did get a chance to see the new color. It's the new space, black MacBook Pro, and it looks so fresh, I mean, check out this color. And again, this comes in two different sizes. We have the 14 inch and the 16 inch, and they also have a little gaming room where we can get a chance to play some games. Not only do we have new MacBook Pros, but we now have the all new iMac lineup, again, the iMac hasn't been updated since the M1, so now we've got the all new M3 iMac. There's so much cool stuff here. And again, this is like Halloween Eve, so it's so festive and I'm having the best time. Let's go check it out. (soft upbeat music) Oh man, this is the most fun Mac event ever, I mean, this is like a party. (upbeat music) This is so cute. Okay, this is a candy shop. There's a menu. So they obviously announced the new iMac with the M3 chip, and of course it is Halloween. So on theme, we're in the little candy shop with all of the colorful iMacs. Let's order some snacks. I made it a whole day without eating candy. Here we are again. (upbeat music) Is that decoration? That's decoration. You think it's candy? I don't know if that's decoration or not, but I don't even like candy corn, but I'm getting it. White chocolate pretzels, absolute fave. (soft upbeat music) Shopping, 14 inch MacBook, M3 Mac. Yes. 16 core CPU baby 120. That's a lot of extra money. Yes, eight terabytes solid save. Add to bag. Oh shoot, I have an iPhone in my cart also, let me remove that (laughs). And there we go. Estimated delivery November 15th and November 17th, can't wait. (soft upbeat music) So we have the 16 inch MacBook Pro and the new 14 inch MacBook Pro. These are the new M3s and this is the new color, It's the space black. I'm so excited that they announced this new color, 'cause I feel like it really freshens up the Pro line. So I just realized that I've been calling it the M3 Pro Max. It's the M3 max, but you guys know what I mean. There's three of them. There's the M3, the M3 Pro, and the M3 Max. If you do want the new space black color, this only comes in the M3 Pro and the M3 Max version. So if you do get the base model M3, you aren't able to get the new color. That is definitely a reason for an upgrade. It's also pretty incredible that the Pro and the Max chips, you'll be able to spec these out to 128 gigs of RAM. I was hoping that they would up the internal storage, but you can spec them out to eight terabytes, which definitely will be doing that as well. (soft upbeat music) So I am not gonna lie, I think this was one of my most favorite keynotes that they've done. Granted, it was very short, and they only announced a few things, but it was so cool seeing them do a spooky, scary theme. So I'm looking forward to getting a chance to get hands on with these devices. So be sure to check back here, subscribe like comments, and I will see you guys in the next video. I'm gonna go eat my candy. Bye.",

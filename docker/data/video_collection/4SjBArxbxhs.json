    "transcript": "What's up guys lew here, back with another video and as you can tell i've got an abundance of goods here on the table This is a good chunk of what's available in the android wear universe a lot of these i haven't even looked at yet The real purpose of this video and experimenting with all of these different smart watches is these guys right here recently launched the Mode system for interchangable watch bands Google actually sent out all this Android Wear goodness So that i could swap out some bands and see how their mode system operates we got the Moto 360 the Huawei what is the name of i think it's just watch Huawei Watch the LG Watch Urbane the Fossil smartwatch yeah, the Q Founder and the Asus Zenwatch 2 that one, Asus would rather be pronounced asus(asoos) but i feel much more comfortable saying Asus And then a bunch of bands. It's a whole universal program Interchangeable with a lot of different watches, whatever your style is and different styles of bands too I'm gonna unbox... (music) Holy jamoleos Smartwatch universe, practically For some reason, I'm gravitating towards the 360. I like the design since I first saw it. I can also see the interchangeable system there for the band that they've got on This one's got this nice leather band on it but you Might wanna switch out to a silicone band like this one. You know you might be at the gym Sweating it out you know-uh-doing the body pump Ok so Moto 360, Now set up as you can tell Objective here is to show off some new looks! This Italian leather over here in this tan color, in blue as well and on the side of the packaging, a little measurement tool For just how large your device is in this case, I am looking at a 22mm device There's also an 18. So you got support for multiple sizes of watch bands. These are pretty standard measurements in the watch band world if you are unfamiliar with them This is very smooth. The sporty vibe indeed This is the clasp. This is how it operates and as I push over you see it just kind of locks it in place like that There's this little nub here on this one. Slide it over Loosens up one side and just go ahead an pull out the other side Ohh look at this. A little tool is included in the pack in you need it Some pins for best fit. And just place it in there. Get it lined up You can really use your fingernail for this. You don't have to use the little tool Actually find it just fine with my hand And just like that you are now ready Fore the Mode system Lock that on there. That's too easy And the other side. So now we have a Moto 360 Custom perfect for sport. I will try this on. That's a comfy kind of fit there Line it up like this. Lock it down and now it's a completely different look honestly I mean it looks like a different watch I'll pick something like the Huawei watch here. Two little poles and that guy comes out This is acutally an 18mm system There you go! Boom. Boom Now you've got a leather Huawei watch Life is better with options Simple. Interchangeable. Modular Mode You can use a system like this to take the personalization even one step further so if you guys wanna check out Mode, I will have a link in the description You can see even more options than all the ones I have shown you here",

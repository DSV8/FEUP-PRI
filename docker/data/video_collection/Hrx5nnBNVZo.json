    "description": "At CES 2020 everyone heard about the awesome ASUS Zephyrus G14 but we looked for something more affordable.  It turns out that when it comes to AMD Ryzen 4000-series notebooks with the 4800U, 4700U or even 4600U, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 and A17 might provide an awesome combination of price, battery life and performance.

    "transcript": "tap-tap-tap what am i doing do I stop coming out of my no but first but first Hector's amazing look at that right there doesn't have to worry about spilling anything anywhere alright guys so here I am at a soos and what I have in front of me is Hector he's my helper today instead of Fred he's holding my water for me and he's making sure that it doesn't drop on this and this right here is a zephyrus g14 now you've seen this thing covered to death already at CES but there's a couple of things that I wanted to bring up about it first of all it has AMD's next generation for 800 series aap use in it and they are efficient they are based on the Zen to Architecture and you've probably already seen our video of those processors and you can actually find it right up here now that's all really really interesting but there's something else that I wanted to bring up about it and that is the fact that they are actually using the 4800 HS in this and that's a 35 watt TDP spec which is completely different from the 4800 that a lot of other people are going to be using in their notebooks and supposedly asus has a six month exclusive on that but first I wanted to thank our sponsors for this show without the help of be quiet thermaltake razor and fantex we would not have been able to attend CES 2020 now this is what I was super excited about for probably about the entire time that I was here at Asus this is the tuf a17 and there's also going to be an a15 that's a 15 inch version but this is the 17 inch version and what this does is it packs all of the same specifications as this higher-end g14 into a much more affordable chassis no it doesn't have all of the beautiful lines of the G14 but the specifications are literally similar other than the HS processor so let's take a look at this because we did have some really really critical feedback for tough gaming last year at CES what they've done is they've taken our feedback and your feedback and they've updated the entire design last year we noticed that they're tuf notebook the cover first of all it was flexing and it really didn't feel like a high quality device what they've done now is they've upgraded it to an all aluminum and it feels really really good there's a lot less flex and it also picks up a lot less fingerprints moving on to the inside unfortunately it really looks the same as last year you still have the fingerprint magnet finish over everything but the keyboard has been upgraded just a bit so it has a little bit better tactile feedback but in my opinion there still needs to be some work done on here in order for them to hit the same level of quality as something like the Y540 from Legion but we also have to remember that this notebook starts at $999 and it's probably gonna top out at around $1,500 on sale Black Friday you're probably gonna be able to find this thing for like 700 bucks like you were able to find the tough gaming this year now moving on to the interior specs that's where this really really shines we're talking about Ryzen 4800H processor and probably other SKUs or definitely other SKUs with lower end processors as well moving on to the display things get a little bit interesting because the 15 inch version of this notebook the a 15 has a VA panel with adaptive sync up to 144 Hertz on the flip side of that coin the 17 inch has that exact same VA and adaptive sync but it only tops out at 120 Hertz so I'm thinking that 15 inch model might be that perfect combination of size performance and everything else and speaking about performance let's talk really quickly about what we're seeing for specifications starting things off with the GPU it's basically what you're gonna get in those more affordable gaming notebooks it's gonna start off at a gtx 1650 and it's gonna make its way all the way up to the rtx 2060 we already know that the real start of this show is going to be the Ryzen 4000 series processors another cool thing about this notebook is the way that they've handled the battery situation so on one model you're going to have your standard hard drive and a smaller 48 watt hour battery on a different model they're going to be eliminating that hard drive and it's gonna be one full huge ninety watt hour battery that's supposed to give you all day or even longer than all-day battery life when it's paired up with those super efficient Ryzen 4000 series cpu so there you have it guys I know this one was a little bit short but we just wanted to quickly cover this because I personally think this is one of the more exciting laptops sure it's not all flash and dash like this g14 but it's something that a lot of you guys are probably going to look into buying because it's not so expensive so I think I'm gonna wrap this up here and say you know good job tough gaming because this right here is how you leverage a new technology into something that more people will buy so I'm Mike with Hardware canucks signing off from ASUS and I will probably see you in the next one good",

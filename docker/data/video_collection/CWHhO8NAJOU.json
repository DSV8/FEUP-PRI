    "transcript": "- Welcome back to TechLinked, filmed on our regular set where we film every episode. No, not again. I'm in the void again. We know a lot about Google's upcoming Pixel 6 and 6 Pro thanks to Google themselves. I mean, they're running commercials for the phones already. But a new and interesting detail has just emerged about the phone's Google-designed Tensor chips. XDA developers says their source has corroborated a recent Geekbench listing which indicates that Tensor's configuration of ARM cores is pretty weird. It reportedly has two very powerful new X1 cores, while most other flagship mobile processors only have one. And instead of three modern mid-range A78 cores, there are two A76 cores from 2018, in addition to the more normal inclusion of four low power A55 cores. But the cherry on top of this weirdness sundae, now I want a sundae, is the Tensor's Exynos modem from Samsung who helped with the chip's design. Samsung has used Qualcomm modems in the US for years because of network compatibility issues. And the Geekbench performance actually makes the Tensor look kind of bad, so I'm hoping Google has done some fancy optimization to make the Pixel 6 work really well, because they gotta justify that camera bar somehow. I know some people like it and they're entitled to their wrong opinion. After Austin Evans claimed the new PS5 model ran hotter than the old model, the internet cried out and Tech Jesus heard their prayers. Yep, Steve from Gamers Nexus actually collabed with another outfit that specializes in technical analysis, Digital Foundry, to test the two PS5 variants. And together, they found that in terms of performance, there's basically no clear difference. The VRM and memory module seem to run slightly cooler, while the SOC ran slightly hotter, but there was virtually no effect on real-world performance. Definitely watch their full videos to get all the cool details. But basically, if you can actually find a PS5 in stock, don't worry about whether it's the old or new one. Just don't let it run on a carpet. And definitely don't swaddle in a blanket because it's cold in your basement. The PS5 isn't like us. The PS5 is not a person. And the Wikimedia Foundation has banned seven users and removed admin privileges from another 12 users from mainland China, after a year-long investigation indicated they were editing Wikipedia articles to promote the aims of the Chinese government. The foundation called the situation an infiltration, accusing those users of trying to control Wikipedia edits so that they portray the Chinese government in a favorable light by manipulating elections for administrator roles and pushing for the use of Chinese state media as reliable sources. The banned users are part of a group called Wikimedians of Mainland China, who responded with a blog post slamming the foundation's claims. I will say though, if the government of China was involved in all this, there's actually no clear evidence because they're so efficient. And that's why I like them so much. Please don't abduct me. Now it's time for quick bits, brought to you by iFixit. They told me they wanna make sure you have the right bit for the job. because they care about you and your bits. iFixit has a repair kit for any situation, so you can take apart all of your electronics. There's the Mako with 64 small bits, the Mahi with 48 large bits, or the Manta, who's got all 112 bits. Watch out for that guy. Each kit includes iFixit's famous swivel-knurled screwdriver contained in a magnetic enclosed case with laser cut foam. Get yours at iFixit.com/techlinked. Quick bits. I mean, come on. Microsoft is annoying everyone with this TPM requirement for Windows 11, and now they're only making it worse because you can't even run the latest Dev Channel preview build in a virtual machine without TPM 2.0 enabled. So even if you just wanna try it out and see if you want to upgrade your hardware in order to run Windows 11, you can't because it's just not safe out there. Have you seen the internet lately? Have you been on there? AMD has reiterated that it is ready to make ARM-based processors if their customers want it. AMD and Intel have historically focused on x86 processors, but both companies have indicated a willingness to broaden their horizons, possibly because Apple proved with their M1 processors that ARM desktop chips can actually be good. Now, if only there was an ARM-compatible version of Windows to run on AMD ARM chips, because saying Windows on ARM actually runs, it's kind of a stretch. Yet another report has made Facebook look even worse. This one was written by former Facebook data scientist Jeff Allen, and claims that Facebook's algorithms pushed content from Russian troll farms to 140 million Americans who hadn't even expressed interest in the subject matter. Like the previous reports about Instagram being bad for teens, this one was written in 2019, but is only seeing the light of day now. Which is a real shame 'cause I wish I knew Facebook was bad all of these years, I would've told my mom to stop posting about sunsets a long time ago. Apple and Google are receiving criticism for following orders from the Russian government and removing an app from their app stores which was used by critics of Putin's regime for strategic voting ahead of this weekend's election. But the tech giants complied after Russia threatened to criminally prosecute the company's employees in Russia, so their hands are sort of tied. I mean, have you seen Putin? The man rode a bear. That might've been Photoshop, I don't know. He texted it to me, so. And Google parent company Alphabet has had some success with Project Taara, a system that can provide a 20 gigabit per second data link between two points using fricking lasers. The system was used to connect two communities in the Republic of the Congo separated by a huge river called the Congo. So I guess we ended up using lasers to help each other, rather than to shoot each other with. Looks like the future didn't turn out so bad, did it? But this episode will turn out bad if we don't end it now, so come back on Monday for more tech news, probably back on the regular set. Right, Linus? He's not even here, the disrespect. Is that him?",

    "transcript": "you know what i'm i'm so sick of gaming on this piece of crap four months ago i plugged a gt710 into a potato for this terrible joke in a video and i've just kind of left it in there since then which leads us to probably the dumbest video i've ever made we've got some beautiful potato death juice leaking out oh yeah that's that's looking real nice oh that potato looks like a mummified testicle i actually think i'm gonna need some valida action here ah yeah velita just stings so good so i think all that's really left to do here is we just kind of oh that does look suspiciously like the school lunches i would forget in my backpack for like three months in a time so it's put that kind of down like that now before we plug this very soil gt7 potato into a pc i just want to wipe the worst of the potato ectoplasm off the pcie slot just so that it doesn't immediately short out and burn my office down and then on this side we're just gonna kinda there we go i think that looks fine let's plug it into a system okay well i guess we just turn it on and see what it does okay well the fan's spinning it's a good sign although it is already smelling a lot more potatoey than before which i guess is a bad sign we are not getting a signal out i'm also real interested to see what's going on under that heatsink but we'll do that in a minute maybe this old fellow motherboard is broken no no it's not okay well i think this is easily the most important question i've ever answered on this channel if you leave a graphics card plugged into a potato for four months it will break it but with that monumentous question answered let's have a quick peek at the carnage under that heatsink oh okay well there's your problem i'm not surprised at all that this doesn't work anymore that is that's disgusting you",

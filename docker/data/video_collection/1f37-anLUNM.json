    "description": "Gaming headsets come in all shapes and sizes but a higher price sometimes buys you nothing but a brand name.  In this video we compare two of our favorites the Sennheiser GSP 300 and Corsair HS50 against two hopeful newcomers the Plugable HS 53 and MSI GH60. Does a higher price really lead to better sound performance and is an affordable gaming headset as good as an expensive one?

    "transcript": "all right hello good people I'm Dimitri and I love me an affordable quality gaming peripherals because gaming gear right now is getting super expensive especially in the audio realm and so you know for example I use the GSP 500 which is a over $200 headset so that's definitely coming off the table because in this video I want to compare headsets that are 100 dollars versus $49 so literally half the price on what you can get with these line up the GSP 300 by the way is my go to $99 recommendation for gaming headset make sure to check out a review all the links for a purchase things will be in the description below and the HS50 has been my recommendation for the $49 price point but there is now a new contender I've never heard of these guys before the pluggable Performance this is the HS 53 also a $49 pair and I wonder if there's any coincidence in the naming scheme but coming onto this side the msi GH60 I never knew MSI make gaming gear aside from like laptops and computer stuff but I'm guessing they're obviously in this space the GH60 is the first high res audio certified gaming product that is under $300 because the other one that I've reviewed would be the SteelSeries Arctis Pro but that's way too expensive so I'm actually curious to see how these perform against these let's begin right after this are you ready okay watch this so that is what the components must feel like inside the H500P Mesh by Cooler Master check it out in the description below alright so let me quickly go over the basics of why the GSP 300 and the HS50 are my picks for those price points so the GSP 300 it's a super lightweight headset it is plastic but durable there is no creaking when you stretch it around you can throw this around no problem it does expand quite large so if you have a larger head with potentially a lot of hair if you like to wear hat or a baseball cap this will go over it no problem and it also collapses into a pretty small headset if you're in a smaller head sizes we have a volume dial on the right side to control that the microphone is actually pretty decent it mutes when it's in the upright position and overall the blue color scheme is not really my thing but this is a for stay at home only type of headset you don't want to be wearing this outdoors sound quality is fantastic a lot of bass representation here good detail nice soundstage despite this being a closed bag design overall this thing can breathe you know there is some heat concentration in the ear cups because they are this pleather material but it is super comfortable design that is lightweight they sound awesome the microphone is good overall a really good balanced package now the HS 50 for the $50 price point represents a good balance - so the build quality is fine we have some metal parts in here they do stretch out quite nice they expand for larger heads the headband padding could be slightly thicker but sound quality despite this being like like a closed design it does have like a semi open soundstage which is awesome not something you'd expect from $50 pair which is really good for like environmental things you're not feeling like you're closed in you feel like your audio is slightly expanded the microphone is removable we also have volume dial and a mic mute on the left ear cup so nice overall package for 50 bucks and they're also super low profile and there are no color accents just the logo on the side which means if you could wear them outdoors be my guest so now how do the other pair stack up let's start with the g-h 60 at $99 price point so from a physical standpoint this is a gaming headset no doubt we have this fort earcup design aluminum black plastic glossy plastic textured glass on the interior and then matte plastic so they went all out with this particularly not knowing where to go in which direction so just they settled for everything I do like that the ear cups can rotate inwards so when they're on your neck the drivers can be facing up the headband is self adjusting kind of like on SteelSeries it's a good design from this implementation it should fit most head sizes and overall it feels like a durable piece the ear cups on here pretty thick they cover my entire ear we also have a replacement set with these like breathable material which is actually quite comfortable on the skin unlike many other breathable materials that we tried particularly from Logitech but here overall comfort with the gh60 is pretty decent headset is also pretty light because it is mainly plastic with a steel band up top there is no clamping force I could wear these for hours no problem now moving on to the other $50 pair the HS53 they look deceivingly out of their own price class this whole matte black design a lot of padding on the headband and the ear cups and this exposed brushed aluminum look on the side adjustment you know little pieces here but as soon as you feel them you kind of understand this is this is a $50 pair they look awesome but they don't feel that great the size adjustment mechanism sounds good but it's quite loose it doesn't really stay in position and also the main pet peeve of mine are the ear cups so it is deceivingly thick but in fact the leather just kind of wraps around the plastic housing so in reality the thickness of this padding is only about half and so it's kind unfortunately because they look like they're super comfortable with so much padding but that's not the case and also my ears touch the internal driver inside the ear cup which should not be the case for headset that looks to have such thick padding the one thing I will say about this design is that the clamping force is not too strong which is good because my ears are currently making contact with that interior wall so I can play for a few hours but then it starts to introduce a lot of fatigue on top of the ears because the your point is not exactly curved because the ear cups are totally flat so the bottom here doesn't have any support all the pressure and the weight is supported by the top my ears and somewhat by the headband to both headsets have inline remotes for volume control and mic mute the plughole performance one is actually detachable so it can be just as a standalone headset you can plug into your console and then have this thing as a standalone thingy that can break out into a splitter cable that is also included in the same idea for the gh60 but the inline remote is built-in all right so it's microphone quality time this is the GSP 300 by far the best one out of the bunch it just sounds most pleasing nice amount of bass in the vocals nice amount of detail - it's not too tinny and just sounds the most natural I would definitely use this to stream so this next one is the GH60 the other $100 pair weirdly this one sounds the worst out of the bunch because it almost sounds like the microphone is located inside the ear cup and not so close to my mouth because the audio is like kind of distant and not intimate also doesn't have much detail yeah just a really bad microphone on this guy alright so moving on to the cheaper pairs this is the HS50 from Corsair I like this microphone it doesn't have as full the body as the GSP 300 but there's a lot of detail it's not too nasally there is some like noise compression going on stuff but really like this microphone for 50 bucks alright so the final one is the HS53 from pluggable it definitely sounds better than the gh60 at half the price there's a lot more bass pickup it's clear the bass is kind of muddy which is totally fine for for vocals but it's kind of weird because it almost matches the sound signature of this headset itself but for 50 bucks it's quite good and it's also very sensitive so you have to be either lower your a vocal volume or move the microphone a bit further away but for 50 bucks sounds good and out of the four headsets which sounded the best to you let me know in the comments all right let's go a first competitive match with the msi GH60 let's see how they stack up so it has been a few matches nobody's complaining about the microphone quality everyone can hear me well I mean that is the expectation for $99 headset they are semi comfortable the audio quality is just on par the highs are there it's not too bass heavy the mid-range is clear so I can hear exactly where my enemies are and my teammates are around me in the environment in csgo so the GH 60 I'll continue using this for the next hour or so alright so after the first hour of my verdict for comfort is it's good my ears feel a little bit warm but there's no like fatiguing you know nature of like the clamping force being too strong or something like that the ear pads are fine they do concentrate the heat and that's the only thing that you have to worry about but for a $99 headset that is close back with a leather padding I mean that is expected all right so it's time for the HS53 so after just a few matches you can definitely tell this is a cheaper headset the comfort wise it's fine here the clamping force is not too much you can extend them I mean the build quality you can definitely tell it's not as good but the sound quality you can definitely tell that this is on the cheaper side because it just lacks any detail it's very muddy and bass heavy too not exactly what you need for competitive gameplay this is where the other headsets kind of excel you could go into the EQ settings if your sound card has that and adjust the treble really boost that for more detail because otherwise this thing lacks it now aside from having subpar sound quality this headset also lacks in positional awareness multiple times where I'd be confused as to where the sound was coming from where on any of my other headsets that is not the case so if critical positional awareness is your thing this headset the HS53 is not for you alright guys so it is awesome to see more $50 price points enter the headset arena for gaming but the HS50 still holds that spot because it's just built wall the sound quality is great the microphone is nice overall a nice balanced package whereas with the HS53 it's like a nice try the visuals are good the packaging is good the microphone quality is decent but the sound quality and the build quality they just fall short I mean listen to this one fall and something might break inside you know you don't have that good perception of build quality which is disappointing you have good perception of visuals and packaging but that's not what you're looking for in the long term but the main disappointment comes to audio quality because multiple times in like competitive matches in csgo my teammates were like dude did you not hear him walk behind you and I didn't so there was a lot of confusion in the audio situational awareness you know something that I'm normally used to hearing I wouldn't with this headset and that means that's a no-go for gaming and this is where the HS50 really shines because it has nice detail definition and a semi-open wide soundstage so that you can have this positional awareness that's not too loose and you can pinpoint where things are coming from whereas with the GH60 it's like a typical looking gaming headset the microphone quality is really bad for $99 I'm surprised the HS50 sounds better than that but this one in sound quality is awesome like the amount of detail you can pick out the bass is nice the mid-range is there it's not too sharp the soundstage is not like it's not too loose but this is a closed design so you can hear things quite close to sound quality is great builds nice comforts nice microphone is subpar and this is where the GSP 300 really comes out on top at the $99 price point because it kind of balances out all the features great mic awesome sound quality fantastic comfort and build wise sure it's plastic but no creaking anywhere and I'm confident that this will last you for a very long time and just to answer the original question of whether it's worth spending double the money in order to get the better audio experience for games in the instance of the GSP 300 versus the HS50 yes it is superior in every way but the HS50 is just fantastic value however when we take a look at the GH60 this one sounds fantastic it's comfortable but the microphone quality on here is just subpar the HS50 wins while the HS53 and 49 dollars also seem to be good value based on looks and the microphone quality but the sound quality and comfort is lacking so you spend any more on the gaming product really is dependent on the product itself so I'm guessing the search continues for the next best budget headset under $100 you know the $50 price point is awesome but we don't see that many options there and I'm guessing the $99 price point will be quite saturated but what if you're looking for a wireless pair make sure to check out our battle over there make sure to

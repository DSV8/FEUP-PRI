    "transcript": "- I got you a new GPU. - Yaaaaaaaay! - It's an ARC. (upbeat music) - Oh. It's easy to say we want competition. What's not easy is spending your hard earned money with an underdog company and your precious time fighting with an inferior product, fall for what? So your buddy can just go out and buy the actually good one and get it for a reasonable price. I mean, we all complain about Nvidia's pricing and we say that we want their stranglehold on the discreet GPU market to end, but if the steam hardware survey has anything to go by, nobody actually wants to be the one to buy something else especially an Intel Arc. And if the rumors or anything to go by Intel's discreet GPU division was already in a precarious position before these things were so difficult to sell. So, we've been challenged - The 30-day Arc challenge? - 30-day Arc challenge. - Okay, but only if Luke has to do it too. - I'm down. - So here it is. It's the 30-day Arc Challenge Part 1 baby where we are both gonna rip our superior GPUs out of our gaming rigs and for the first time ever on this channel perform a downgrade. I really hope this goes smoothly. Like this message from our sponsor, Boost Mobile. Boost Mobile provides you with unlimited data talk and text for only $25 a month, all on one of America's largest 5G networks. Click the link below for a limited time offer. (upbeat music) (logo swooshing) To ensure I couldn't cheat, you know, oh, well, you know, I didn't change out my VR rig and I'm not gonna drag my main machine out here, which I did do during the Linux challenge. When (indistinct) is demanded that I change out not only my daily driver gaming rig but also my VR machine. So Alex is here to help me perform one of the two surgeries. The choice is yours sir, and this is a bit of a trick question. Which would you rather? The small form factor machine or the hard line water cooled one? - Water cool. - Oh, crap, that might actually be the easier one. - A bit more fun too. I thought you were gonna take the small form factor. - I can take this one if you want. - No, no, no, no, no. By all means, you can have the harder one. Remember when I stole our first 3080 and I was like, don't worry, I'll bring it back - And then you didn't. - I still have it. What a deck. - Now, I'm a little torn right now. On the one hand, the upstairs machine I'm running a 4K monitor which frankly neither of these GPU it's okay enough. It's only 30-days I'll make it. But on the other hand, this machine is used for VR where consistent frame times are extremely important. - You're gonna need a bucket down here. - Which one should I go A770 and which one A750? We didn't have enough A770s to go around. - I think A750 in this one. - Okay, all right, I'll take this then. - I'm curious which one you got. - Oh, well if it says limited edition on it, it's the 16 gig I think, right? - I'm pretty sure they're both limited edition, they're like the same. - Then, I don't know. - Yeah, well, we'll find out later. - Memes aside when it comes to DirectX 12 or Vulkan titles, so that is to say newer games. At anywhere from 1080P to 1440p, ARC actually performs pretty darn well for the price. The issue is that Intel is up against literally decades of experience on both Nvidia and AMD's side when it comes to developing drivers for older APIs like DirectX 9 and 10. The other big issue is that their hardware doesn't actually have native support for some of those older APIs which means that they have to run them through a translation layer that results in a big performance hit. So, if all Luke and I wanted to do was play an 1800 do maternal, you know, and a handful of other newer titles, we'd probably be fine. The problem is that many popular games, even today were built for older APIs. Counterstrike, League legends,-- - Well, and even DirectX Games don't necessarily play very well. - Yeah, okay, alright, alright. He was pretty bullish on ARC until he actually sat down and tried to game on it. - Master Chief Collections did it for me. It was so bad. - Getting my machine out is a little bit of a chore because the USB fiber boxes that go to some of the other computers in the house rest on it. And also we put a big radiator behind it, yeah, so, getting at the IO is a little bit more challenging than it used to be. - Big radiator's not great. (Alex chuckles) - What I'm thinking then is, you're gonna pull from the front and then I'm gonna kind of, juggle all of that stuff in the back and make sure that nothing comes crashing down. - Okay, cool. - What could go wrong? One potential speed bump that I hadn't thought of before accepting this challenge, I have two full sets of peripherals, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and speakers upstairs and in the basement so that I can sit and game with my kids when they don't have a friend over who's using that station or whatever else. I have no idea how ARC is gonna handle that, like, cloning to 24k, 120 hertz displays. - Should be fine, - Sure, should. I mean, it should have had a great price to performance ratio if Intel was to be believed. I'm gonna tape all these together so that I don't lose track of which one's going to my PC 'cause I'm a smart boy like that. And Alex, I think you're ready to start pulling. - [Alex] Okay, is this just like fallout, or does it-- - No, no, it'll stop. They're stoppers. - [Alex] Okay. - Yeah, you should be good. - Do you have it? - Yeah, I got that. Okay, one, it's a little heavy and end. - Oh! - Goodbye. - There's a story behind that screw, my PC's kind of a ship of thesis, it has no clear beginning and end. It's kind of fun for me to keep little bits and bobs from previous previous iterations of the machine. And these thumbs crews from my Antec P160W case are the oldest pieces of this current iteration. However, I lost one of them but then I finally found it when we moved. So I put it somewhere safe with the intention of restoring it to its rightful place. - I'm regretting saying that I'd upgrade this one. - Yeah, yeah, you screwed up. - Yeah, doesn't seem too difficult but it seems like a whole lot of potentially filling your boss's computer with water, yeah. - Hey, do you like my cooling fan for my nick? - Oh, that is nice, yeah. - Yeah, I just kind of screwed a thing into like kind of a thing and it's like kind of on there. I can't believe I'm replacing a 3090 with an ARC. To be clear, we are not hard line water cooling this thing. And if we did it probably will take me forever to get around to changing it out. - Does anyone even have blocks for this? - I don't think so. The plan is just to bypass the existing card, take it out tubes and all, and then flunk it back in then we're done. What do you have here exactly? - This is my bypass idea. - Cool, all right, yeah, sure. I've actually done this before so don't freak out. (object thudding) (Linus chuckles) It's a wearable thing. Once I bite them, they start dropping things. Here's what we're gonna do. Gravity works, right? - Gravity's great. - So theoretically, if the bucket is under the computer the water cannot reach the computer. So we'll go car oil change stuff. - Yeah, easy. - Either, you know what, let's do both. - Okay. - Here we go. And 1, 2, 3. Oh, hold on. Okay, this one then. - Oh! - There we go. - Yeah, that one's a bit of a gusher. - Oh, I was going to, yeah, not that way. - Oh, okay sure. - If we flip it this way, it should be fine. - Can I help you? - Nope. - Oh, he's got this, he's got this. - What? - We also have to get these off. - I got this, or like, (Linus grunting) or like a towel or something. - No, I got it, I got it, I got it. Yes, for those of you who are just tuning in, the computer is vertical because the loop is full of water. But we need to remove a water cooled GPU from it and we don't want the water to fall all over everything. All right, whoa, oh my RGB cable. See you later buddy, you've been good to me. Some of you probably think that we're hamming this up a little bit. And that's fair, you know, we're making a video here. But if you feel that way you probably didn't watch the video where we tried like a couple dozen games on ARC and had problems almost across the board. - At least you have a buddy though. It's very nice that Luke is doing this with you. - Yeah, misery does love company. - Brandon just asked if we could run it at like 720, but the problem is that the frame times are the biggest issue and there seems to be hardware problems where whatever you're getting at 1080p is probably what you're getting at 720p. 'Cause it doesn't necessarily scale, it's like a problem with the scheduler and that's why you can't get more FPSs. - What are the odds, Alex? That since the last time we looked at it it's gotten way better and I'm gonna have no trouble this month. (Alex chuckling) Oh crap, are these both 8Pins too? Oh balls, I've gone ARC. And you know what they say once you go ARC, you've gone ARC. Two Intel's credit. If you don't have an exotic cooling solution to work around they've done a great job of making ARC a drop in replacement for pretty much any system with a discreet GPU. Compared to the RTX 3080, you can see it's shorter, the same height, and it uses standard 8 plus 6Pin power connectors which means I can actually take out Nvidia's single generation only 12 pin power adapter and go ahead and throw this boy in. - I think we have a problem. - What's up? - These are 8Pins. - Oh, these are not 6 plus twos. - No. - The good news is wherever those cables are could be where these cables are. - Is that at the office? - I don't know. - No. - That's the bad news, I don't know where either of them are. I thought we might have another sacrificial 6Pin, we don't on that doorstop power supply, no dice. But there's other good news. I have an ATX pin removal tool here. The plan for this one is pretty straightforward. In my emergency tech supplies bag, I found an old molex-to-6-pin-adapter. What we're gonna do is we're gonna pull these pins outta here and put them in here. It's gonna take a little bit of time but I happen to have an old ATX removal tool which is good for PCIE, and theoretically, they should all be about that quick. Yeah, this is a really good quality one. I got it from Charles, from Murder Box not what I was expecting to be difficult, we're already done the part that was supposed to be hard. PCI, Express, EPS, and 24Pin connectors all have these same little square pins in them and what you'll find is that they go into here, and then there's two little flanges on the edges that hold them into place. So I have a pin removal tool from way back in the day when modding your power supply with the thing that people did. It goes down into the connector and basically pushes those flanges down so you can extract the pin without damaging either the connector or the pin. What we're gonna do then is we're gonna take our connectors here, extract all the pins we need, put them into our sacrificial connector and we take our 8 pin and turn it into a 6 pin PCIE 'cause the other two pins are just extra grounds anyway. Okay, so you have these all numbered in a way that makes sense to you, and I can go ahead and remove them. - Yep. - Cool. I will only remove the 6 that you need. That way we can just leave this connector in here and it could be reassembled in the future. - No, no, that's a good thing. - You're clear, you officially have something to do. I'm gonna go look for another 6Pin in the meantime but this card can go in, this system can fire up. - Wick it. - Oh, there was one other thing I wanted to do while we were at it. My multi-controller USB card here appears to have died so I would like to replace it. The Sonnet one is even better, this thing is super cool. It's got eight USB-C ports on it. - [Alex] Oh damn! - And four controllers. Is that sick or what? Look, that's an M.2, that's PCA by four. So it's a buy 16 card that has a by four little riser here for half of the things. So, what that means is you can do, I think it's full 10 gigabit per second USB-3 times four on this card. - So wait, how expensive is one of those? - Oh, it's very expensive. The reason that you might want multiple USB controllers is that for VR applications, sometimes, whether it's cameras or sensors, having too many of them plugged into a single controller can cause problems. So I was using this old one from Sonnet but it's having some issues now because USB is shared, right? Which means that if you want to get the full bandwidth or if you want to have no interference from other USB devices that are connected, they actually do need their own controller - And luck, this just goes in, connect the power and it turns on, or it goes boom, those are the two options right now. Here we go. - I'm gonna feel like such an idiot when I figure out where my cables are. That's the thing about being in a new place is everything's perfectly organized, which means there's no hope when you don't immediately find something like that thumb screw. Fortunately, over the years I've gotten pretty good with this tool. - I'm proud of you Linus. - When we run overtime, people start to get pretty snarky. Since I'm doing both sides on this one I'm not gonna bother labeling anything. - All right, this one's all good to go back in. - Really? - Yeah. - Okay, we got this. Wait, why am I excited? Surgery number two complete. It's not like Yvonne needs a 6Pin for her computer, she's not getting downgraded. Okay, this one's done too. - You know how you went from type A to type C? - No, that's fine, I'll be back. (Linus and Alex chuckles) Hi, C cables. In the context of how much VR costs overall with the full body tracking set up, it's a lot of money, but sunk cost fallacy, baby, let's go. If this is what it takes to reduce the jitter on my limbs then-- - Yeah, you'll be having jitter other places now. - Yeah, super cool case though. It's the servers from Sliger. To my knowledge, it is still the smallest matx case. Here we go, it's ARC time. How exciting. - I'm excited. - Cool, (PC machine buzzing) that's fine. Oh, no, that is not fine. Oh crap, that is extra not fine. That is inside the computer. There's a cable and a fan. Where is it? Ah, come on, are you in there? Come here. (Linus grunting) Ah, yes, there's your problem. Okay, so is that - [Alex] Seems fine? - Cool, yaaay. And no extracting it from the cabinet. That's brilliant. Now I just need to put more water in this - Linus. - What? - You have mouse acceleration on. - This is the first time a mouse has been connected to this computer. - Still. - No, no, it doesn't matter. No, no, no, I won't take it. - Wait, do you have over scan on as well? - What? - Over scan? - Well yeah, but you just put a new GPU in. No, no, I do not have over scan. I blame Intel. - While he does that, I'm gonna properly set up this. When you're swapping between different GPU vendors it's really important to go and do a display driver uninstall, or DDU. That gets rid of the old stuff so in this case, we ran it on Nvidia, now it restarts, and we should be able to put on the Intel drivers now and it all works out fine. You should do it in safe mode. I never have, but you should. One fun thing about Intel Arc is that they have like a 1.3 gigabyte download for their drivers. So, that's very big. Nvidia's are like 500 megabytes now and that's like stupid large. One thing that's super important about Intel Arc and it also just reminded me of it is that we need to enable Resizable Bar. If you don't have a really bad time on ARC. - How to enable Resizable bar. Oh, you have to have CSM enabled, advanced PCI configuration, is there even PCI configuration there? - No. - Oh no, you can't use CSM with Resizable Bar. And this is an ancient boot drive that I just kept carrying forward with me. It's not a UEFI boot drive. I'm gonna have to reformat my whole computer for this. (Linus exclaiming) - We should BIOS update first maybe it'll just work. - I don't think so. - I don't either. - You have to disable CSM. I am so unhappy right now and I don't even know if the other machine is working yet. Oh, look at that, it just is. Well, that's good. It's funny, this video started out as will upgrading to ARC be a challenge? And ended up just being, hey upgrading your computer can be sort of a pain in the butt. None of the things I was expecting to be a problem like the dual monitor set up have been a problem. Things I wasn't expecting to be a problem, like, oh, now I gotta find my power supply cables, and oh, does my motherboard support this new thing? Have totally been a problem. Okay, it looks like Resizable Bar is already enabled on this system, so, we shouldn't have any issues. Another issue I hadn't foresee is I'm in the middle of working on my review of the G Cloud which I have no idea if Intels and coders will work well for a network gaming device, but I guess I'm gonna find out. - Yeah. - Yeah. I see you got Resizable Bar enabled. - Yeah, so that works. - But, - Well, I had to disable CFM. - Well, I don't know, - I don't think it's gonna boot. - I think it's gonna boot into my boot drive probably. - Oh, you put a boot drive in there? - Well, I have a boot drive on my keys. Oh, your USB, I see. So, that doesn't help me. - Well, it helps you if we need to reinstall Windows. - No, no, I don't want that right now. All my like stupid beat saber mods and everything are all set up exactly how I like it and like, it's pain in the butt to like back up a custom songs, and like it's obvious all solvable. I just like, I go find a directory, and then I gotta copy everything over. - Do you wanna explain to the people what having to disable CSM does? Why that's a problem? - Sure. Disabling CSM is a problem on this system because I originally installed Windows on an older motherboard using an MBR partition. Well, newer motherboards, UEFI motherboards want a GPT partition. You can convert an MBR to a GPT partition but the process is a bit of a pain in the butt and you can lose data. I found a thread though. Should we do that first, before we try for our fresh windows? So we enable CSM, and it should boot and then there's a link here, how to convert Legacy BIOS to UEFI In Windows. There's a tool, whoa, whoa, whoa. Apparently this has gotten easier. There's a tool called mbr2gpt introduced in Windows 10 that lets you convert Legacy BIOS to UEFI with just two commands, maketecheasier.com, shout out. Apparently this tool is in the advanced startup screen so, we need to restart while holding shift. - Okay, let's see here, mbr2gpt/validate. - Meanwhile upstairs, it's been 20 minutes and these drivers are still installing. That's a good sign. Even ignoring my missing cables, we're off to a pretty bad start here. We've got the one machine that has an older install of windows that's not compatible with Resizable Bar which is gonna hurt performance even more. And then a second machine that is completely compatible and just is crapping the bed, just trying to install the driver. You think it worked? - Maybe. - Okay. - About to find out. Enabled, enabled. If this boots, that will be incredible. - 'Cause it means we all get to go home. I mean, I'm home, but I get to enjoy my home. - We might have done it. - That's pretty good. That's pretty good what we're seeing right there. We like this. Oh, come on. (Alex laughing) It's bad magic. Come on, get it together. The fan's quieted down. Hold on, hold on. Maybe it's just a little confused, and it's going to the VR headset. I've seen that before. It's here, we did it. Holy crap, we're in, we hacked the mainframe and now I'm just gotta put that display part back in. Come on baby, oh yes, good, good. - It was there briefly. - Did that TV just turn off? - I think so, yeah. - Oh, there we go, we did it. - Hey, okay, let's go. This is not good at all. The only reference I can find to someone trying to run an ARC GPU and a valve index is asking if anyone else is having problems 'cause they can't get it to launch. - Yeah, I had a little bit of searching and the only thing I could find was someone that tried to use a rift with an A750 and could not, they would just get a display board and unknown USB device error - No for a month. I feel like this can only go uphill from here but maybe Intel find a way to prove me wrong. This sucks. - Unlike our sponsor. - No, Luke and I are still gonna game tonight. This is extremely choppy for me. Whoa, my FPS is at nine right now. - [Alex] What the heck? - This is not good. My GPU encoding just outright crashed so I'm back with CPU encoding. - [Alex] I mean it like works. - It seems to be kind of cut off though.

    "description": "HERE is the Fossil Q on Amazon:  Here is the tool kit I use:  This smartwatch is literally the best feeling smartwatch I have ever worn, and ive tried out a bunch! I enjoy the heavy, quality feeling, metal band.  This is a watch you would wear to a business meeting, and not so much at the gym.   Here is the First Apple Watch Teardown:  First Android Watch Moto Actv:   Tearing down the Fossil smart watch was much easier than I expected. Rpairs should be pretty straight forward. The band swaps out easy enough. As well as the head unit. Unfortunately replacement parts are hard to find. Let me know if you find any! And I will link them here for everyone else.

    "transcript": "One of my favorite Smart Watches is a watch made from an actual watch company, the Fossil Q. Ive tried other Smart Watches but their cheap feeling face and bands always leave me feeling like Im not actually wearing a real watch. And, well, now its time to do that thing I do with every piece of tech that I like take it apart. [Intro] As always Im going to turn the watch off first and then flip it over to the back so I can remove the 4 small Phillips head screws that hold the metal band to the brains. It was surprisingly easy to separate the two from each other. Its literally just the 4 tiny screws doing all the holding. Watches generally arent abused too much, so the 4 screws will definitely be efficientI was just a little surprised there wasnt more. Now the back of this watch is plastic this is because the wireless charging doesnt work through metal so its plastic out of necessity. You can see as I pull the black back off it has some yellowish glue and a black rubber gasket. This Fossil watch has an IP67 rating same as the original Apple watch, so huge thumbs up for water resistance. You can see the metal contact points from the wireless charger on the inside of the black panel. These just rest up against the two motherboard pins to transfer power. And then from the motherboard the power goes onto the battery. There are 3 ribbon cables here. The top two are for the LCD screen and the digitizer. And then the bottom tiny little guy is just for the battery. These are the same Lego-like connections that we see on every single cell phone. There are two T5 screws holding the board down. Remember, I always link the tools that I use down in the video description. So if you want one of these tool kits, click there. Ill link the watch down there for kicks and giggles as well. Now this board is soldered onto the watch frame. This could be a way to ground the board like you see in all the iPhones, but it is slightly unfortunate because it brings reparability down a notch. Either way you can still see all the important things from here and I can keep my watch functional as we review it. Down at the bottom we have the microphone hole and its ribbon connecter. It just gets plugged into the motherboard when the motherboard gets pressed back down into the frame. On the bottom of the motherboard we have this battery. It is a 1.52 watt hour and 3.8 volts. And the little spinning doohickey over here is the vibration motor for your notifications. As it spins you get the vibrating sensation on your wrist. Now the gold part you see here with the ribbon cables is the back of the LCD. It looks like this is the type of screen that if you want to replace, you have to break the old one out of the frame first. I did a brief search for replacement parts and I didnt find any, but Ill keep the video description updated if they become available in the future. The button on the side of the watch has 3 golden contact points on the inside and you can see the motherboard also has 3 pins that rest up on these contact points. So it can receive the signal from the button. Ill push the motherboard and the battery back down into place and make sure it clicks into the microphone plug. Then Ill get those two T5 screws back into place as well. And then clip the battery ribbon and the two screen ribbons down like little Legos. At this point the watch can turn onif it doesnt, the watch might need to be charged up for a few minutes to restore power to the motherboard. Make sure that the plastic back of the watch is lined up with the two charging contact points on the motherboard before putting it down into place. And then the whole contraption can be put back inside of the thick, heavy metal watch band and screwed into place. If you want to see one of the first Android Smart Watches ever built that I took apart a few years ago, go ahead and click that link on the screen. And hit that subscribe button if you want to stay on the bleeding edge of tech reviewed from the inside. I took apart the Apple watch as well. Thanks for watching. Ill see you around.",

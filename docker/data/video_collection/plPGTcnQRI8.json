    "transcript": "hello cat people Eber here with Hardware Canucks and if you recall last year right right around the end of October Lenovo invited us to China to take a look at their headquarters and see their testing facilities and see how they test our products and it was actually a lot of fun but at the same time they also invited us to give them product feedback on their upcoming products for 2019 I'm here at the airport heading off to North Carolina to lenovo's official headquarters here in the States to see what they actually have in the pipeline for 2019 so let's go check it out so we're here guys we're here in Raleigh Durham North Carolina this is gonna be a lot of fun you see back in China Legion were there for a workshop just to give them product feedback on their existing peripherals their gaming laptops there are pre-built desktop systems as well and you know we also wanted to ask the community for their feedback which is why we posted that video see if you're interested you can actually go check that back but we're here now we're gonna head we're gonna be heading to their headquarters to see what they have stacked up for 2019 and actually see if those valuable feedback actually made it into their new products so that's gonna be interesting let's let's get on board and and see what they have in the pipeline for 2019 all right so day one at the council is complete and have to be honest I am very impressed work for the product lineup for 2020 from Legion it's definitely exciting I really can't wait for you guys to take a look at it unfortunately most of the stuff that we talked about are still around and it looks like the product roadmap for Legion for 2020 looks pretty solid and I can't wait to get my hands on these new products all right so this is the y740 from Lenovo it's our mainstream notebook a lot of you guys really wanted some content around this baby so I'm here to provide you a little bit of context on what they're planning on changing with the next-generation design which is the 50 series car so currently were you know rocking the 40 series which is a Wi-Fi 42 Y740 that features the new RTX reviews and the latest Intel CPU as well so we've got a chance again like I said earlier to take a look at their next generation 50 series designs and it looks absolutely gorgeous so I just want to give you a little bit of visual context as what has changed so first things first the nose cam is actually getting replaced or it's actually being shifted to the top so they've actually increased the bezel on the top to accommodate that which is cool so that way you don't get this thick chin and I really like that I appreciate that you're getting front facing speakers which is awesome I mean that is just a must-have on a notebook for me personally the keyboards being refined quite a bit so they're taking some explosions from the ThinkPad series because you know if you're thinking about a laptop keyboard that's the one thing they'll come to my mind at least so they're definitely taking some inspiration from that to implement on the you know the next generation 50 series designs so that's awesome the trackpad is also being refined adjust a bit there also can be hiding a lot of ports to the notebook to make it more versatile for gamers streamers and content creators as well and yeah just overall they're you know adding faster screens higher-quality screens for the most part and just looking at this notebook I mean Legion if you think about it back in the day I mean I know five years ago lonoa gaming laptops wouldn't really not known for you know having the best quality and of course not the best performance out there but now they're definitely stepping it up with the lgion branding and i'm really happy to see a company like Lenovo taking you know a feedback from just the overall audience I mean does not just influences but also you guys so the feedback that you had from our previous council session from that video it's certainly been taken into consideration so they're definitely you know they're definitely open to that and that's something that I really appreciate about a company like Legion so we're just gonna head into the Lenovo customer experience Center here in the headquarters and apparently they have everything from the old-school ThinkPad notebooks to you know different consumer products and a lot of a lot of Lenovo guys a lot of Lenovo so this is the consumer stuff right over here they have a hold wipe of their phones and their you know consumer related items and then when you scroll back right over here you've got all the ThinkPad series which is pretty awesome and then you know big few notebooks hanging up there so I'm gonna I'm gonna shoot some b-roll and you guys can enjoy some of the montage let's do it all right so we wrap day 2 at the Lenovo Experience Center and it was an awesome experience guys I hope you enjoyed the b-roll sequence because I personally loved shooting all of the old-school IBM ThinkPads and just getting to feel them and kind of you know just it just brings back a lot of memories I remember my parents carrying one of those notebooks and it just I don't know it just has its own place in history for sure but what really stole the show was this IBM palmtop PC 110 it was just so tiny and very cute but the same time it's actually the first devices to rock an LCD 256 color display 4.7 inches actually to be exact and it also had four megabytes of RAM and a 4 4 megabytes of flash-based SSD 4 megabytes guys think about that 4 megabytes compared to you know terabytes of storage that we're seeing right now so we've come a long way in terms of history you guys and it's just really fascinating to see how technology has grown in the last decade or so and I'm happy to be a part of it for sure so Legion has actually planned some fun activities for the next few days before I get back home I think it's a good way to start off the next week so I'm actually really excited about that so now that the first two days of the council workshops are over we are going to have two days of fun first of all we're going to start today with an experiment if 'ti to kind of represent the savage side of Lenovo products and then after we're going to go go through like a geek themed escape route so you're gonna challenge you guys and see what you guys can do and see if you guys can break the record the current record at the geek themed escape room then tonight we are bringing you guys to a VR lab so you guys can try all different kinds of VR games so yeah we're gonna have lots of fun there that's a long list of activities that she has planned for us I don't know what you were thinking but I hope my body can handle it if if not then I don't know I feel bit if you guys be able to see me next week probably I don't know but yeah let's let's do this guy's well axe throwing was fun guys but sadly I lost which kind of sucks because you guys almost had the opportunity to win a Lenovo y530 but it was fun it was really fun now we're on to the escape room which should be even better so we are in the escape room actually yeah I don't know how this is gonna go this actually my first time trying this out wish me luck guys so we all didn't get out of the escape room unfortunately we were so close we were like 99.9% really close to the clue but it was just one thing that we didn't see and honestly was fun escape room I would do it again it's a great teamwork exercise to be honest and I think Mike and Demetri we should do it we should do it again as as a team our next stop is at the VR labs we'll see how it goes all right so I finished my little quick VR session and it was definitely a lot of fun guys yep beer is definitely something that you really have to try out for yourself to kind of experience the immersiveness but this is kind of a really cool place because it's a pretty large space with eight different stations and the interesting thing is you can have eight team players hop onto a multiplayer session and that way you can sort of get into you know interact and have a good time you know just kind of finding different enemies and whatnot so it's pretty cool if I just walk you through this little session here this is part two so it's four by four and look I mean as you can see it's good it's it's pretty awesome I mean it's something that you really have to look for yourself in when you look at the systems that are powering these they're fairly pretty decent I mean I'll just show you a quick demo on what that what they're rocking all right so this is one of the system's powering the HTC vibe and as you can see it looks pretty pretty dated but I mean it has to be a part where to to power something like that ooh interesting enough I don't if you can see notice but that that's that's Trident II RGB memory of it right there which is pretty awesome I don't I can take a little peek inside they'll be able to take a look at the specs but that looks like an arrow arrow GPU MSI hello hi hi there so it is the last day here in Raleigh Durham North Carolina and lenovo has a few things planned out for today before we head off back home I think we're gonna kick things off with go-karting which is gonna be awesome again this is my first time trying all these things and it almost makes me feel like I really haven't had a life but it's also to try these out guys so so yeah here's to more fun so that was an awesome experience guys I lost again but it was a lot of foot it was a lot of fun I can't wait to do it again with Mike and Demetri we should totally do it again man it's so awesome Thank You Liddell this was great take your gaming experience to the next level with Corsairs new harpoon RGB wireless gaming mouse with its advanced slipstream wireless technology experienced hyper fast sub 1 1 second connection speeds along with dynamic RGB lighting for some extra Flair check out the harpoon Wireless in links below our last activity for the day is actually watching a hockey game so I don't really follow that much hockey to be honest but it's fun to watch I prefer hockey over baseball and football you keyboard warriors can go as much as they want but that's that's my personal preference but today we're watching who's playing yeah well the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Tampa Bay Lightning so it should be a fun game let's see how it goes so that game when decently well the Canes lost unfortunately but it was a good game just want to say thank you 100 for making this whole thing possible I mean you know the first few days were great with all the product feedback and all that kind of stuff these after those we're we're definitely awesome and I can't wait to do this again so yeah that's pretty much it guys hope you enjoyed this little journey of me exploring raleigh-durham especially the lenovo and yeah feel free to leave a like' or dislike' down

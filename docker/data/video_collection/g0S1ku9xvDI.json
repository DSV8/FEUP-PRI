Check out Louis Rossmanns channel HERE:   He has a bunch of tutorials on basic board level repairs:   Learning board level repairs can help with data recovery, and fixing really expensive equipment for cheap. Most of your money will come from your knowledge and skill, instead of the cost of the replacement parts.

    "transcript": "I dont normally do board level repairs on my YouTube channel, but I have a friend who is exceptional at it. Today hes going to show us how to fix a MacBook that doesnt turn on and has been water damaged. Lets go. Were going to be checking out a MacBook Air that doesnt turn on and has a little bit of liquid damage on it. Were going to see if we can make it work. You just got to take the board out of here before we can get started under the microscope cuz if we dont, it will burn the black plastic over there. So this tri-c over here is the SMC reset chip. So the SMC is powered off of 3.4 volts, however if you try to power it before 3.42 volts is stabilizedSo this little 3.42 volts apply over here. It takes a second to get to 3.42. If the SMC tries to turn on before then, it will crash and not work. And thats what is most likely causing this to not turn on. So once we replace this and the corrosion parts around it, hopefully it will work again. So Im going to remove the old IC. Im putting some flux on which is going to help the solder flow. Were going to take off this capacitor which looks pretty nasty and then this chip which doesnt look very nice as well. Alright. Now Im just going to wick away some of the old solder here. Were going to add some fresh solder to the pads. Hopefully you guys viewing at home have steadier hands than I do, but if somebody tells you that you cant solder cuz you dont have steady hands, now you know not to believe them. Were going to take the chip off of one of my trusty donor boards. See, thats a beautiful donor board right here. So were going to remove the chip from this board. Okay, so this is going to go like this. Now the way I know is that pin 1 is over here and theres a little dot on the chip right over here that gives away that thats pin 1. And that chip got destroyed. Now that chip actually burned completely as I was putting it on like just went up in smoke. Yeah, thats a good one. Lets try this again. Yeah, you should. On live stream I cant add it so people just watch and laugh. Okay Im going to try to situate that right where its supposed to sit. And theres a little bit of a solder blob there, sorry. I put too much on the center pad which is a mistake which I know that nobody watching is going to make cuz you just watched me make it. Um hm. Now the capacitor that I almost forgot about. Were going to put that on there. And just to make sure that flows into place, add a little bit of flux and the capacitor will find its own space naturally. There we go. Alright so now we can clean it up with a little bit of alcohol. And the disgusting chip works fine, where as the clean chip almost killed my board. Its going to spin on and off, on and off three times before it finally finishes and turns on. But yeah, thats it. [Zack] So that was really fun for me to watch but I dont plan on doing very many board level repairs on my channel, but luckily we have guys like Louis here who have a TON of videos. How many videos do you have on your channel? [Louis] About 250 on board repair. [Zack] Thats incredible. And you do mostly laptops or cellphones? [Louis] Mostly MacBooks... Some iPhone data recoveries from you know, the ocean, the toilet, yeah. [Zack] Nice! So Im going to leave the board level repairs to him, and Ill stick with the component level repairs on my channel. [Louis] And if something is not fixable youll always get to see what we do to finish it off. Thank you to Kyle at iFixit for sending us this lovely souvenir. [Zack] And before we go theres one more thing I want to show you. Louis, what the heck is down here? What is that? [Louis] Um, uhhhhhhhh, spare parts? [Zack] That is the graveyardthe motherboard graveyard. [Louis] Thats all for you. Its your turn. [Zack] No, no way. [Louis] Yeah, take this. Its house fire maybe? [Zack] Wow that looks terrible. [Louis] Yeah, spare parts.",

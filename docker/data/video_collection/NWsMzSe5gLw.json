    "transcript": "- Oh my God. I love it. We got there. But, we're blurring all these shots because damn it, if we're gonna have to go through what it took to get here, then you're gonna have to go through it with us. - Yes. - Watch this damn video. (rock music playing) - Oh - Oh yes. (Kim laughing) He's stressed. Oh my God. - We're not out of the woods yet. - No. - I still need this to actually light up. - Right. - And then I'll feel. - [Callanan] Awe! - Yes. - No, that's just the monitor powering on, but. He was trolling. - Premature, - He do. Yeah, I'm a pretty big tik-toker myself actually. - Yeah, no no, I've seen your stuff. - Yeah. - It's pretty good. Yeah, I don't know even what now I'm doing on that platform, so it's fine. - Oh, more than me. I knew nothing about this. He just like comes into my office. - [Man In Phone] Hey Linus cap. Are you up for a TikTok real quick? - [Kris] Oh, it's a filter. Oh my God. I thought you were actually doing that. - And so I just look at this later and it's oh, that's what he was-- - Oh, thanks. Honestly, that's good though. - I actually do not know, - Okay, you physically don't know. - what I am uploading to TikTok. - But sometimes that's the best. - All our storage is showing up, our 2M.2s, our 2c is. All of our RAM is showing up, That's good. - Yay. - No keyboard detected. Press F1 to run setup. I just wanted to know if this thing would post, it does, it's beautiful. - Yay. - These are gonna glow too once we get into windows and we get the drivers installed. - Okay cool. - This thing is gonna be like. - It is decked out, I love it. - Do they still say lit? - I think so. - You think so? - Yeah. Sure. - But are you out of touch though? - It's gonna be lit, Yeah, hundred percent, hundred percent. (Kris laughs) - Where's your main monitor gonna be? In your perfect, magical fantasy world where does the big one go? - Uh I mean, probably over there. - Here? - Yeah. - And then this is where you're gonna stream from then, right? - Yes. - Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're just going to, placeholder these for now. - Okay. - Part of the idea here Kris is like, rather than picking things up and putting them down a hundred times, I wanna pick things up and put them kind of approximately where they're gonna go. - [Kris] Right. - Which leads me to, where on earth are these speakers gonna go? Like, what is the plan here? These are enormous. - They are. - [Callanan] I know. - Where'd the big monitor go? Where does it keep - It's right here. - Okay, perfect. Let's mount a thing to it. - [Callanan] I think you guys broke it. - I did nothing. I didn't touch this monitor until just now. - [David] This was working yesterday. - ASUS sponsored this video. Mini LED, Backlight, you got your Dolby Vision, AMD Precinct Premium Pro Thunderbolt inputs, True 10 bit, color accuracy Delta E of less than one. This is-- - [David] Damn! - God king of monitors. (David woos) Where the hell are all these monitors supposed to go though? - Originally these were supposed to be hanging from the wall. That's their original mount. - Uh huh. - Hanging from the wall directed in. - And Kris. - [Kris] Yo! - Yo, yo indeed. - Do you hate that? - Do I hate what? - Should I not say that? - No, you can say anything you want. - Sorry, - What? No, I'm just. (David laughs) - [David] How dare you say yo! - Are you more of a horizontal monitor kind of lady or more of a vertical side monitor kind of lady? - For reading chat, I like it - You twitch chat and that - I do like it like that. - Okay. And then you've got two of those. - I know. - So are we going horizontal and two flanking vertical monitors? - That would be cool. That would be ideal. - Okay. Let's do that. This has gotta go. - [Kris] Hundred percent, hundred percent. - So here, I'm gonna lift this up. Can you give it a little shove of love for me please? - Tell me when. - Are you pushing? Oh my gosh, Okay. - That's why I'm scared. - Go ahead. Go ahead. Okay. I love that your setup is gonna be so much nicer than mine. (Kris laughs) Not just mine now. - Really? - Like this is nicer than what I have planned at my new place. - Really? - So much better. - Oh my gosh. - Does that seem like I'm gonna hit the stud right about there? - [Kris] Oh, it's up here? - I think I'll hit it. Hold on, we got this. - Okay. (drill buzzing) - Did I get it? I missed. (David laughs) - More holes in the wall. - Where's the stud finder? (Linus and Kris laugh) (drill buzzing) - Take the drill away from this guy. - Yeah, there is water on the other side of the wall. - I'm sorry? - Oh yeah, there's a bathroom. - Water on the other side of the wall. - Oh, terrific. I am the tool. (Linus grunts) You ready for fun? - Yeah, just don't poke a hole in my pipes. Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical - Like be careful. Science in the home - Good good, He's losing it. (everybody laughs) I think you need water, food, anything? - Do you know the song? - [Kris] Yeah, I do. - Oh good. - You're gonna get copyright. It was so good. - I'm gonna be like Yvonne, I got something to tell you. I got lucky today and she's gonna be like what? And I'm gonna be like, we managed to put the correct arms on all of the monitors without knowing that there was any kind of difference, and that's very exciting. This is a not insignificant amount of weight that we are hanging off these toggles ladies and gentlemen. - Oh hohoho, wow. wow. Wow. That could have been bad, but it wasn't. Look at this mess. - Okay. They're not gonna stay like that. - Okay. - There's a plan - This could be an interesting gaze. Just not ergonomically friendly. - Okay. Now that's ergonomic, baby. You get that bean bag chair! - Yeah, right? Honestly though, that'd be a vibe. It looks so good, - Right? - Yeah. Yeah. Bringing tears to my eyes. - All right Callanan, you did good. - You did done, did it good. - Like we still gotta replace your TELES diaper genie. - [Kris] Doesn't it look like that? It does look like a little like diaper trash can. - Oh, I heard that from a Telus installer - [Kris] No way. - [Linus] Yeah yeah. That's what they call it internally. The diaper genie. Callanan? - [Callanan] Yep? - How close are we on those RGB strips? I keep forgetting about them. - [Callanan] I've been waiting. - You're waiting. - [Kris] Are you done? - [Callanan] Yeah. Well I said that and you're like, sick! - [Kris] Get 'em on in here. Come on let's go. - And then you guys went on another tirade together. - That tirade, it's not a tirade. - [Kris] It's not, it's a conversation. - We are not even that close. We don't have the mic arm set up. - Yeah. - She's getting an RE320? - [Callanan] You said to do it right? - To do it right. Nice! (beep) - ASUS didn't have white wireless peripherals. So you got the Strix Scope NX, TKL moon. And what is this guy? ROG Strix Impact II, moonlight white. Unfortunately, even though we sell mouse pads on our store. - Look, it's been a long day. I'm sorry. - I can get a mouse pad. It's okay. - I'm sorry. - It's the one thing I can get. - Okay. But you'll use one of ours, right? - Yes, hundred percent obviously. - Thank you. Okay. It's a nice, it's a nice desk. - I bet it is. - All right, Good. - I have no doubt in my mind. - Do you have anything that could qualify as decorative (beep) that we could put on shelves? You got anything? Help me out. - I have like one thing right now, that's it. Okay, this is the only thing (Linus laughs) that I have. So we can like put it up there or we can put it over there. - Why do you own that? - Don't ask questions. - Have you seen your wireless access point yet? - No. - Oh my God. ASUS sent this router. It's literally a Gundam themed... - Holy (beep) That's so cool. - I thought you might like that. - I love that. - [David] That is the sickest thing. - That's awesome. - Now you've got two decorations. - Yeah, honestly it is. - Trying to figure out why this monitor's not turning on, the HDMI cable is backwards. - [Callanan] Yeah, it's an optical cable. - Yeah. Kris, do you mind unplugging the other end? - Yeah. - Expelliarmus! Avada Kadavra! - Okay. You're plugged into the wrong port. - Oh no. - Did I? (everybody laughs) That's funny. - [David] Wow, did you get a white camera? - This is cool. - I tried color matching as best as possible. - I like it, that's really cool. - Gaming controllers, which the custom ones will be here at some point in the future. But currently they're grey. - That's fine. That's sick. - Okay. Instinct pro. So there's one for you and there's one for when you make a friend. - Now I have the motivation. - This better blow my (beep) mind for how much work it was. - [Kris] Oh! - [Linus] Okay. That's pretty cool. - [Kris] That's awesome. - Okay. - [Kris] That's awesome. - It might be worth it. - [Kris] It is worth it. - Ah, it's pretty cool. Wait, how do you want your camera positioned? Do you want it like off to the side? Or like what's your camera jam? - [Kris] Yeah. For the longest time I just had it facing me, but it's just because I was using a webcam, but I would probably prefer it off to the side. - [Linus] Oh, perfect. Well, we can do that. Okay. Wonderful. Where's my last thingamaboober? Get in there! (Linus growls) That's pretty damn adjustable. - [Kris] Yeah. - Okay. Camera's here. - Yes. - And then I've decided your mic lives over here when you're not using it. - Yeah, that's fair. - Oh! Oh God! - Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ! - What, What, what, what? - Nick scared the (beep) out of me. I just see you appear in the darkness. - It turns out you play the stalker role really well. - Yeah. - I can't even tell what I'm looking at here. Let's see the chair. (cardboard tearing) - Oh, it's so funky. - How much did this chair cost? - I like this chair. - This looks designed. - It is designed. - Oh my God. - I love it. - See it fits her perfectly. - I like it a lot. - We do have to put it inside. - Oh yeah. Right. - I'm kind of wanting this in here. What kind of vibes are you feeling about this diaper genie? - [Kris] I mean, can it? - Covered in like freaking drywall mud. - [Kris] Right? Like I can't man. Oh my God. - [Callanan] Makes you look more authentic. - Now you have a chair to collapse in when you realize your house is trash. (Kris laughs) Okay, so hold on a second. - Wow. - Why are we putting this on top of it? - 'Cause it's awesome. - No I really don't know if I agree with that. - [Callanan] I fell in love with the meme, okay. - What is the meme? - It's for Nick - What Meme? That's not a meme. No one's ever heard of Mongolian sheepskin meme. - [David] It's outlandish and crazy. - Like me. - It's not even comfortable. It's icky. - [Callanan] Well, it's not real because I was thinking about the animals, okay. - I'm thinking about the animals. Will someone please think of the Mongolian sheep! - I can't express how much I like this. It's ridiculous and I love it. - Okay. - It matches my hair. (Kris laughs) - Our cleanup game has devolved somewhat. - You know when you like clean a room and you're just like, everything must go. Do you need help? - No, I'm good. - Wow. - Never better. Here we go. - Oh geez. - I demand that he get some help. - Okay. No, no, you're yeah. - No someone needs, - No, I got this one. - Oh my Jesus. - I'll just hold this forever. - Yeah yeah. Okay. - This place is amazing. - I just wanna sleep in here. - ASUS ROG. You make pretty good stuff I guess. - Came through. I guess. - Well thank you for being such a gracious host. Thank you guys for being so patient, especially our editor. - Yeah, thank you guys! - What time is it? - [David] It's 12:30. - It's 12:30 at night. - I didn't even, I thought it was like 11:00 maybe. (rock music playing) - Oh my God. I love it. - [Kris] You're a liar. - I'm not a liar, shut up. (Kris laughs) (rock music playing) Wow, that's so adorable. You have a gold play button. (David laughs in background) - [Kris] You know, it's not much, but I'm working my way up. - Don't worry. You'll get there someday. Someday, you'll be on my level. - Yeah. - This is amazing though. - Yeah. This turned out really good. - The LED strips all work now? - They do. - The chair totally has a totally super human occupant. - This is my mascot. This is Pete. Yeah. - Have you been streaming much in here? Got the lens cap on and everything. - Yeah. Yeah. No, I have been streaming. Don't know what happened to this screen? This is the first time this has happened. I turned it on today and this is what happened. - I'm sure I can fix that for you. That's okay, I'm here. - Yeah, that's what I was hoping for. - Can I just say that you are delightfully retro? - Yeah? - You write on your hand. - Yeah, and then when I wake up in the morning, sometimes it's on my face. Yeah, I do. - 4,500? - I owe somebody money. Don't ask questions. (Kris and Callanan laugh) - Tell me about your Funko pops. - Oh yes. - Do you buy these yourselves or are they just all simp gifts? - Some are simp gifts, some I bought, I have other ones, but I'm a big fan of Game of Thrones and Star Wars and stuff. - Also, don't think I'm not gonna notice this weird thing. - Oh, one of my best friends gave me that. I forgot that was covered. That makes me sad. - You know what? - It's kind of fun. - I like it. - I like it. You know, I put it on my desk actually. 'Cause it's fun to play with. - Products like this make me think. (both laugh) - Just that. Full stop. I think it means like slow down with my creativity. You know? Maybe that's what it means. - Yeah. - I think she bought it on an airport. (David and Kris laugh) - You know what, let's find a place of honor. - Yeah, I actually really like that, yeah. - Yeah, okay. - There we go. I like that. - How's your air conditioning coming? - There's none. It's hot in here. - Also why is OBS on there? - I haven't turned that on yet. - Kris, what are you doing buddy? - No I haven't turned it on yet. I don't know why it's over there. - I ask you if you've been streaming, you go, yeah I've been streaming. I go, okay, let's open up OBS. Oh I haven't turned it on yet. - No, but not the TV, I haven't turned the TV on. - Like Kris. - What? - This camera is not plugged into anything. - I just didn't plug it in. I didn't wanna wreck it. - Wait so you haven't used it? - No, I haven't used that yet because I didn't know how and I didn't wanna screw it up and I didn't expect you guys to be gone for so long. - You were gone! - It's true. - I didn't go anywhere. - That's why this wasn't, this wasn't done. - This was supposed to be the big it's done, it's beautiful reveal. We've been gone for three months. - [David] Part three incoming. - No, there's no part three. I'm never coming back here. (everybody laughs) Yeah, where's the capture card? - I haven't touched anything I swear. - I believe you. Alright, let's go try and find your capture card. - Okay. - Why are you bringing me here? - I don't know. You just said, let's go get your capture, I don't know where it is. - I mean, it's not here. - I know. Wait where like the boxes are? - Yeah I guess. - In the box room obviously, look at this. This is my spare bedroom. Anybody can stay in here. It's really nice. - It's full of boxes. - Yeah. - Oh, by the way, is my hair better this time? - Actually, I was gonna say, when you walked in, it looks really good, but I was saving it. - Really? - Yeah it does. - Dennis will be pleased. Rate it, rate my haircut out of 10. - I would give it like a 9. - A nine, wow. - Wait was this done by a professional? (Linus laughs) 'Cause I see ledges. It's now to a six. - It's a 6 outta 10. (yelling) - That's exactly what my wife rated it. - But from the front it's pretty decent. - I found your Quest. - I have a couple of those. - Yeah, I mean, gotta have somewhere to enjoy your stepbrother content. - Listen, I make a joke. Comes back to bite me. I have a scandal. (Callanan laughing) - I wouldn't even be surprised if you had a horrible, horrible scandal. Pretty much everyone we've ever collabed with has had some awful baggage. - He doesn't know about my other account. Just kidding. I don't have another account. - Only kris.com. - Yeah. - Like what? It's just only Kris. - It's just me in an empty room on a chair talking to myself. - Are you actually trying to help? - Yeah, I don't know. - Wow. (Kris laughs) - I used to live in the forest. - This is a big can of bear spray. Oh, oh. There's stuff in drawers. Are you sure you didn't put a capture card in a drawer? - I don't think so. - [Linus] Wait, there's another camera here. - Can you, can you open this drawer? - Can I open this drawer? - Wait, you should get this on camera. - Oh my God. - [David] What is is? - [Kris] It's a snorkel. - Oh. Definitely not what I thought. Yeah, there's a lot of garbage in here. Drawers are not garbage cans. (Kris laughs) - Tell that to every girl because they know, if there's any girls watching this video. - Wow. You went there. - I did. I know your demo. (Kris and David laugh) Can't wait for him to open this drawer. It's my mustache drawer. - Oh, well this is terrific. I mean, you don't have COVID right, so. - No. - Okay. Well you know what? - I don't know. - You have to game. - What? - You have to play a game. - Why? - Because this is supposed to be the payoff. - Oh, okay. - I'm gonna lose the mustache, I think. - Yeah. Yeah. It's falling off. - It's more of an eyebrow now. - Yeah. Oh God. Unibrow? Wow Yeah. That's a look. I really like it. - All right. We're gonna play Lunch Lady. A game I've never heard of. - Yeah. I also haven't played since September 2021. Love it. I don't remember the controls here. - Probably W to go forward. - Well, yeah, but I didn't know if I could turn my flashlight on or off. Wait till you see this lady. She is everything every man dreams of. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Oh, - We have a med kit. - You know what we will have though is an almost uncut, we did take out some particularly unsavory bits, but we'll have an almost uncut version of this upgrade on floatplane.com. That's exclusive for our subscribers there. It's gonna be like, yeah, I think it's like hours long. I don't actually know how long it is but it's really long. - Oh, where is she? Where is she? Oh no. Where is she? - Wow, I'm liking the speakers. - Right? Yeah, the speakers are great. - Yeah. - There she is. Look, she's beautiful. Oh God. Oh Jesus. Oh no. Oh, there's no way to get outta here. I forgot about that. - And I think that's where we're gonna cut it ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much, Kris. This was a fun, it was an experience. - Thank you. - And if you guys enjoyed it, I don't know, go watch part one if you haven't already seen it, and failing that you can go watch the flow plane exclusive, which is the extended uncut version. We did have to cut some stuff. She's pretty foul actually. - I am. Watch it. - floatplane.com.",

On an iPhone I'm using the Carnets Jupiter application as an example here if I press run you can see that my Python script hello world has been run here I could type some other code let's say x = 3 what is X so if I press run the value is 3 the application that I'm using on Android is Pydroid 3 on Android I've got the script print \"hello world\" I could press play and notice the output is Hello World very simple script what I like about both of these applications is they support Jupiter notebooks what I don't like about Pydroid is there's a free and paid version and to get all the extra functionality you need to go for the paid version but you can do a lot with the free version and that's what I really like about the Carnets application it's totally free two fantastic Python applications but",

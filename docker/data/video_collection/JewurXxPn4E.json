    "transcript": "- Yes, they're from Sennheiser, but they're not, strictly speaking, earphones or headphones. They are that, but they're not just that. They're kind of a hearing aid, but not. The idea with these things, what are they even called, the Conversation Clear Plus, is, imagine a situation like I was in last night. I went to a crowded, loud bar that had live music. And I wore these things. And they helped suppress the ambient noise around me and enhance the people talking to me so I could hear them more clearly, and it worked. There was times where I took them out. It sounded worse in there and harder to hear people. The music was kinda too loud. (laughing) And it wasn't good enough to make me wanna listen to it over the person I was talking to. No offense, musician guy, if you're listening to this. Nice guy. But these actually have a place. So let's do the unboxing. It's a simple box. You get the charge case. And then in this section, I'm expecting to see a lot of normal earphone stuff, instructions. Looks like you can get these kind of fins. There's a couple more sets of ear tips, of course, a USB-C-to-A charging cable and some, like, warranty and (grumbling) stuff. This is a pre-release product, but this looks pretty final. I would think, if I open this up after buying these, I wouldn't be surprised to see any of this stuff. Pretty basic. Charge case is pretty big. It offers two extra charges. It really looks like it just has, like, so much extra space. And part of me wants to give them a pass on that just 'cause this product's a little bit different, but part of me says no. If anything, I'm gonna be carrying these around maybe more than a normal music-listening earphone, because if I'm the kind of person who wants or needs this product, like, I have a hearing issue and I rely on these things, I really want them to be pocketable, so it would be nice if this was more compact. Now let's look at the earphones themselves. They're pretty basic-looking, truly wireless earphones. They've got the little guy. There's a default size already equipped on there. I probably wouldn't wear it without that. It looks like really just exposed hard plastic. But you can see that this default sleeve is way more subtle and tiny than compared to some of these. Look at the wing tip on those. It's like, that's supposed to go in here? How deep is your in here? And then you can also see on here that they kind of are prioritizing this mic. So that's the kind of difference between these and normal earphones. Like, why couldn't this just be an app? Why couldn't they just update their algorithms on their existing earphones? Well, it's because these have more and better mics. And they do beamforming, so the fact that this kinda points out, I think, is probably a little bit core to its functionality. And they slip in like normal, and they look pretty normal. And we can talk about whether that's a good thing or not. But then once you put 'em on, you can hear yourself. It's kinda like you're in Transparency mode. And we can talk about whether or not that's a good thing soon. Okay, so who are these for? (upbeat music) The Sennheiser rep told me that there are, what did he say, 100 million people in the world who have some kind of hard-of-hearing issue. And then that figure's gonna grow to, like, 900 million in, I don't know what he said, by 2050, sometime soon-ish. And a lot of these people will never go out and speak to an audiologist, and many of them who do will walk out of the audiologist's office without buying anything because maybe hearing aids are really expensive or the process of getting one is really arduous and you just don't feel like you need it that bad or maybe you're ashamed. These are supposed to bridge the gap, where they're not as expensive as a lot of hearing implements in that space. And they're just not, like, as much as a heavy lift. They just kinda give you, like, a bit of a boost. But if you're gonna wear these for a night out or at work all day, they gotta be comfortable. So let's get 'em in and check out the companion app, which is optional. But first, a message from our sponsor dbrand, featuring Riley. - So our sponsor for CES 2023 actually dropped out, but dbrand footed the bill. The only catch is they want me to come out onto the streets and offer tech tips to random people for free. I'm not optimistic for how this is gonna go. Hi. - [Salesperson] Hello. - Excuse me, do you have any platform shoes for men? - [Salesperson] No. - [Riley] No? - [Salesperson] No. - [Riley] Do you wanna hear a tech tip? - [Salesperson] Sure. (salesperson chuckles) - If you are using Google and you put a minus sign in front of a word before you type it in, before you press Enter, it'll take it outta your search results. - [Salesperson] Oh. - [Riley] Did you know that? - [Salesperson] No, I didn't. Did you know that, Chloe? - [Chloe] I didn't. - [Salesperson] No. - [Riley] Do you want a tech tip? - [Shopper] No thanks. (salesperson and laughing) - Okay. (Riley laughing) You don't need any tech tips? - [Passerby] No, I'm not very techy. - You know how to use Google perfectly? - [Passerby] Yeah. - Can you do one thing for me? - [Passerby] What? - Go to ShortLinus.com. - [Passerby] Okay. - The reason it's optional is 'cause everything is adaptive on here. So you walk through different environments, and it'll adjust how aggressive of a suppression it does around you. But the app is definitely good to have because you can actually tune your preference in terms of what kind of suppression you want. There's actually a little slider that they give you where you get to adjust whether you want it kind of smooth or clear. Like, you can have it crispier and crunchier, where you can hear people a little better. But (snaps) you're gonna hear other sounds as well. On the smooth side, it kinda sounds like you're in a little bubble, almost like when you have ANC headphones on. Whereas if you put it onto the clear side, now it sounds like I have a microphone set up and I'm hearing the monitoring, so I don't know, if someone drops a glass ball on a table over there, it's gonna be as if it's, like, right in my face. (snapping) Things are just really, really boosted and picked up, so I kinda like it in the middle but toward the clear side. And to figure out what your preferences are, they have this onboarding setup I can take you through now. The first thing is you just hear speech- - [App] The show is a sellout. - Here and here. - [App] The weekend is always busy. That's why I got our tickets in advance. - And the next thing is setting how loud you want that. They're all pretty loud. This is the slider I talked about before. I find the best way to go through that is just to do the extremes. Like, do number one and number seven, and then do, okay, two and six, and then just go back and forth, which one do I like better, until you land on one. Ah. 14? Take me down. To the paradise city - But you can see there's actually other tabs in this app. So Relax is basically just, don't do any kind of boosting or helping me in any way. Just turn on active noise canceling headphones, so you get to just isolate yourself and read a book. That's nice, and you don't have to use the app for that. You actually just hold down, on the headphones, the button on the left, so the headphones is interesting because it actually has buttons. That Sennheiser logo is a button that you can click. It's pretty tactile, but also, this is capacitive. So there's actually quite a lot of interactions you can do with this thing. I actually just held the Google Assistant by double-tapping on that. If I wanna get out of Relax mode, I can hold down the button on the right side to go back to Conversation mode. And you can see there's also this little Clarity Boost button. I guess that's kinda like a temporary maxing out. And if I hold down the button on the right side, again, I can get into that boost. And I can toggle that off by holding it again. The other tab that you see in here is the Stream tab. And this is what happens when you listen to music or any other content on your device. So these are headphones, and they're pretty good headphones. We'll try them out a bit. And the cool thing is, when you do play music, I have a song playing now, you can actually decide how pronounced the music is. So I'm turning the slider to the left. And it's actually turning down the volume of my music so that I can more easily hear people talking to me. And I really like this 'cause you could turn your music down to a real background level and still have conversations with people and just wear these around and talk to people naturally, with your own soundtrack playing, which I think is really awesome. - [David] What's the soundtrack of your life, James? - Definitely \"Cotton Eye Joe.\" - [David] Mm. - (laughing) I had been married a long time ago. So if I go to the Earbuds tab, Earbuds controls, into Communication, you can see there's a short press, a long press, and the double-tap for the capacitive. And if I click into that, can I edit these? No, you cannot. It's just informational. That slider with how pronounced your music is, you can adjust that on the fly without using the app just by doing short presses of the button. That's kinda like adjusting your volume, so that's awesome. So what was it like for me to use them? Well, comfort-wise, they didn't bother me. I probably wore them for about two hours. And normally, earbuds that don't fit me well will hurt after the first hour. These are pretty low-impact. I like them. There was some weird things wearing them. Number one, people think you're wearing headphones, so maybe they're gonna be annoyed, although I think that is lessening. As more and more earphones have transparency modes, people get used to it. I don't think the stigma is as bad as it was. However, it would be lessened even more if they looked more like a hearing aid, like, if they had maybe the style like those Beats that just go behind the ear. But that would be a turn-off to some people, so trade-offs there. But you also can just hear, like, who you're talking to. As you turn your head, it'll kinda just like pick up the person you're talking to and make everything else just a little softer. And it's weird, like, I was sitting in between two people last night. And when I turned away from one person and they kind of left this pickup cone, the person over here would be magnified, and this person went even quieter than they would be naturally. So something to be aware of, there's a little bit of a learning curve when you're wearing these things. The other biggest issue is that it boosts your voice. So when you're in a loud environment that doesn't sound loud to you and you can hear your own voice nice and clearly, you think you don't have to speak up to talk to the person next to you, but you do still. (laughing) They're not wearing these. They're not hearing you as clearly as you're hearing them. And so a lot of people were leaning in and couldn't hear what I'm saying. So you actually have to feel like you're yelling, and to you, sound like you're yelling just to be at a normal level. And the thing that's really tricky about that is, at one point, I left the restaurant, got in the elevator, and Nick happened to be in the elevator. So I started talking to him, and he said, \"Yeah, you sound kinda yelly.\" Like, I didn't know that I had to, like, now tone it down because the sound that I was hearing in my own voice was constant throughout those different environments. So when you're not loud enough, people can tell you, \"Hey, speak up.\" You can see cues for people leaning in like they need you to talk louder. But when you are too loud, a lot of times, people just think, \"That guy's annoying,\" and they don't tell you that you're yelling unless you're really bugging people around you. So I think that's a potential bug, not a feature. I kinda wish you could adjust how much of your own voice you hear through these. Another weird bug I felt was, once in a while, probably five times throughout the night, suddenly, the adaptive would just kinda freak out. And it would change, and I could hear the background really loudly. And then it would just go back to Conversation mode without me changing any variables. I'm still sitting there at my table. I'm still talking the same person. And suddenly, these things are going wacky, going wild. So that's a bit weird. Maybe that could be improved, but it wasn't that disruptive. It didn't hurt my ears. My ears. Your mileage may vary. The best test, though, was that I took these off and decided to put them back in. After a couple hours, when I was confident that I had used them enough to make this video, I still put them back in 'cause it was easier to hear people. And I didn't want that musician in the restaurant making that much noise. I kinda wanted to turn him down, so they should exist. However, they are $850. - [David] Woo. - And I think that's a lot. It's definitely a lot for an earphone. It's not a lot for a hearing aid. So I think that's why they think they can get away with it. But I really think they should take it down to, like, 500. I think I would be more comfortable. But I guess we'll see if people buy these. As far as how good they are as a headphone, I would say that they are comparable to other truly wireless earphones in the $200 space. They don't suck, but they're not $850 good. So if you're spending that money, expecting commensurate audio quality, don't. That's a bad expectation. These are for talking to people. Very cool, though. I would love to see Sennheiser just have this as an app or a feature that they expand to every headphone they make. That would be cool, but as a product on their own, I still (yelps) think they're cool. I think some people should try them. These could really change your life. They're pretty expensive. They're kinda weird. I think it's gonna take a few years. It'll be a slow burn. But definitely interested in the concept, and I would consider this pretty innovative. It's like a new product category. So thanks for watching, guys.

    "transcript": "Captions By: iKingRPG I said PewDiePie 3,000 time go watch What's that you're not quite ready for the tech news? Are you mad?! The tech news waits for no man! begin. Turns out there's a reason that the windows 10 October update screwed up So many people's computers before, Microsoft was finally able to fix it So you might already know that Major Windows updates called B updates are released on the second Tuesday of each month known as patch Tuseday but Microsoft revealed in a blog post this week that the third and fourth weeks in each month while they're called C and D Updates which include bug fixes and non security related improvements so they can be texted a bit before the next month's major B release These are apparently rolled out to users who manually click the check for updates button in Windows settings meaning these users are unwittingly becoming essentially beta testers but Microsoft says that they view these users as Seekers who are looking for the newest features whether they're polished or not Even if that means that these features will delete all their files which is what happened to seekers who got the October update first Some people might be complaining about this whole BCD system, but really clicking that button is kind of fun It's like a kinder surprise. You never know. What you gonna get Yes After Qualcomm won an injunction in Chinese court potentially banning the sale of older iPhones in China Apple has announced that a software update is coming. That should prevent that from happening Qualcomm says iPhones infringe on two of their patents involving resizing photos and managing apps on a touchscreen display while the original injunction affected all iPhones Except the 10 s 10 R and 10 s max welcome Just went back to Chinese Court to try and get those newer phones banned as well Apple's software updates should change iOS so that it does not infringe on Qualcomm's patents But if China's courts disagree Apple says it'll be forced to settle with Qualcomm Which should make for some fun meetings like the ones where you see the guy that you just badmouth on Twitter in person? That's actually how I feel a lot of the time when I see Riley every day And AMD has released the latest version of their Radeon software catch li titled AMD Radian software adrenalin 2019 Edition much better than GeForce experience Experience what you know stupid anyway the new software's features Actually look pretty cool Real live allows you to create gifts edit video clips and automatically capture in-game replays The game and settings advisors will analyze your systems performance and recommend game optimization that you can make with one click and even suggest upgrades if your system is underperforming and Whatman wot Man has improved one-click Overclocking and under clocking that can be done with an in-game overlay and you can even use all these features with the AMD link mobile App, which also has voice control ability for some reason? Hey Radeon, show me my GPU temperature No reason it's time for quick beats brought to you by brilliant - the new way to master key concepts in math science computer science and Professional topics. Do you have someone on your list who loves to ask questions and figure out how things work? Well spread the love of science to your loved ones with brilliant brilliance thought-provoking content breaks up complexities into bite-sized Understandable chunks that will lead them from curiosity to mastery over 5.5 million members are already sharing their love and Curiosity for math and science plus the first 200 tech link viewers to sign up get 20% off So head to brilliant dot org slash tech linked and sign up today. I'm through the quick There's all the slide I can muster This is the blast radius tens of thousands of virtually identical bomb threats were emailed to places of work all over the US and Canada yesterday including the headquarters of call of duty developer Infinity Ward demanding twenty thousand dollars in bitcoins Are stupid various authorities are inspecting as many sites that received threats as possible and so far No, actual explosives have been found it appears This is an elaborate hoax and while it didn't injure anyone it did force mass evacuations from work places Which is exactly what I'm gonna do in a few hours Friday. Am I right people? That's a safest joke I could think of for that story after the epic game store said it would give developers 88% of sales revenue dis card has come to so some of their Namesake and announced that they'd give 90 percent of revenue from their game store to developers. The pressure on steam is building up I hope they don't bust about Ya IMAX has announced they're shutting down their last three vr arcade locations in LA Bangkok and Toronto as they Didn't quite take off the way the company expected but wait, if no one's buying VR headsets and the arcades are shutting down Where will I get a truly immersive realistic experience? Oh Yeah Facebook has surprised no one with the news of yet another bug that allowed app developers to access the unshared photos Unshared of 6.8 million people in addition to their Facebook stories and marketplace photos You could look at this as a breach of privacy Or you could see that maybe Facebook is just trying to encourage their users don't be shy show us your selfies Facebook thinks you look great. Riley: YEAH Razer has announced soft miner an app that will let PC gamers mine cryptocurrency on their GPUs while they're not using them pretty cool Except Razer keeps the funds and rewards the user with Razer silver Which they can only use to buy Razer products because why mine regular money when you could remind Razer bucks? It's better. It's got green LEDs One thing this episode has got no more news. You'll have to come back on Monday for that subscribe If you're gonna be there, I'll be there all the cool kids are doing it (no he's not)(oh wait he got dennis shirt) I'm cool",

    "transcript": "- So Apple TV+ is officially out. If you guys aren't familiar, it just launched on November 1st. Apple TV+ is a bunch of original shows produced by Apple. Which is kind of cool that Apple is now creating content. But are the current shows that they have, enough to subscribe for 4.99 a month? I think that's the question that is on a lot of peoples minds. And obviously this is brand new, it's just launched. So obviously they don't have the entire catalog of shows they eventually will have. They say that they'll be launching some new shows every month. Just look at the shows they currently have, right here, so there's \"Dickinson\", \"See\" with Jason Momoa. I watched the first episode and I didn't get through all of it because I really wanted to watch \"The Morning Show.\" So I started watching that. And it's Steve Carrell, Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and I'll talk a little bit more about that, but I absolutely loved this show. I thought it was incredible. Jennifer and Reese and Steve, their performances were so amazing. And I was looking forward to seeing some of the reviews of what other people thought, and I was really confused, because some of the reviews were not very good the people were writing. I was like are we watching the same show? Because the production value, the writing, the editing. Just the whole concept of it. I think maybe it pushed some peoples buttons a little bit too much. And they got a little upset about some of the content, of them being so brutally honest about what this industry is like. And how people are treated in this industry. I could go on a lot more down that road. We're talking about Apple TV. So let me continue along. From the makers of \"Sesame Street\", we have the Helpers. No, sorry, \"Helpsters.\" And \"Ghost Writer\", \"Snoopy In Space\", \"For All Mankind.\" And they'll have some more shows launching soon. But \"Ghost Writer\", I don't know if any of you guys have ever watched this show when you were younger. But it was one of my favorite shows. I didn't even realize that this was a show that they were gonna have on here, and I saw it and I was like what, Ghost freakin' Writer? I used to actually write \"Ghost Writer\" notes in my notebooks, and thinking that Ghost Writer would write back. So basically the premise in each episode is these kids used this Ghost Writer who helps them solve mysteries and crimes. I think there's probably not that much crime since it's a kids show. But there needs to be an adult version of \"Ghost Writer.\" That is a thing I'd be into. But anyway, it was kinda cool watching that show because I had a lot of nostalgia back when I used to watch it, when I was younger. And I think the biggest thing is, is there enough content for people to subscribe? The good news is that when you buy an Apple TV, or a Phone, or a Mac. You do get a year free of this. And I think right now it is so extremely early, that there really isn't a lot of content. I mean, I watched so much Apple TV this weekend, \"The Morning Show\" in particular. So I don't want to give any spoilers away. But this show is so powerful. And even Jennifer and Reese's performance in this, like seeing those two together was so incredible. I mean, being fans of all these actors separately, but seeing them together in such a powerful show was just wow! Right now there's only three episodes, but I watched the entire season in two days. I was able to get a preview of this season, and this show touches on so many aspects of this industry. It was crazy though, watching this. And I think for a lot of people it's going to be extremely triggering because there is a lot of stuff and they really do not hold back. It is incredibly honest and incredibly brutal. And something else that I really like is that they do show both perspectives. They also show the woman in those situations. But they also show the effect of Steve Carell and him trying to redeem himself. And just it, put me in a mood after I was done watching it. Mostly because of the issues that it brought up. A lot of issues that are not talked about very frequently. It's just so crazy because it's definitely not the show that I originally first thought that it was going to be. I thought it was going to be a comedy, I thought it was going to be funny and lighthearted. But it was honestly anything but that. It was deep, it was dark, it was moving, it was emotional. I mean, I definitely found myself almost in tears in some points. A lot of the parts that I mostly was able to identify with, is witnessing, I guess Reese and Jennifer and seeing them have to go on camera, when basically their entire lives, around them are completely crumbling. And it's something that the audience doesn't see. And it was really hard to watch, knowing I have been in very similar situations, where I've had to go on camera. I've had to go on live television. Just finding out some of the possibly worst news you could ever find out, and then you have to just turn on a dime. And be on, and be present, and be on camera. And do your job, and get through. And that is just some emotional turmoil, that is just, god, it just rips your freakin' heart out. Like you just have to completely just turn yourself into a character, and just throw all of your emotions out the window. I can't even explain it. One example that I guess I sort of feel comfortable talking about, I mean there's been so many situations, where this has happened. Where you guys have probably seen me be myself, but in my mind, I am somewhere else. Like absolutely somewhere else. I had to do a live show once after finding out someone had passed away who was very close to me. And it was just so traumatic. Mostly just because this person who had passed away, was someone also in the media. So having to see people talk about this person, and not know that I knew them. And had a relationship with this person. And just seeing the media just tear them apart. And just, oh my god! It was honestly one of the worst things that I've had to experience. Just because I had to be on camera, and inside I'm just being ripped apart. Knowing that I was in a completely different country, than where this person was. Where their friends were, I had no one to talk to about it, because I was around strangers, I was around people that I didn't really know very well. And then I had to go and be live, on a show, for an entire day straight. Not just the day, it was that entire weekend I had to do this show. So trying to process your emotions, but yet try to be on camera. It was just, oh my god and then just everywhere I look. In the news, on Twitter, absolutely everywhere. This was just being shove it in my face, and I had no way to even just process it. I just had to do my job, and then go home and hopefully try to process it. It was actually very hard, because even then I was at home still processing it alone, and not really sharing that on the Internet or anything. But there's just so many instances of that, that has happened over the course of the years, that I've been creating content. In the past couple of years, I think even for me and my sister and my family, has been some of the toughest that I think we've ever had to deal with. You know life has to go on, and how do you deal with that, yet try to continue to create content and continue to have this career. Yet also try to maintain your sanity, and deal with your emotions and deal with these things. And not let it affect your job. I don't have an answer for you, it's never easy. I don't know, this is a long-winded kind of story even though I'm supposed to be talking about Apple TV. But this show really did have an impact on me, and I think that, these reviews that people are saying about it, are I don't think they're accurate. And I think a lot of people may be coming from a place that say they don't like the show, because maybe they don't like the content of it and the honesty and just the brutal emotional rollercoaster, it's going to put you through. With all that being said, I think Apple TV+ is gonna be interesting. I think that it definitely needs more content. Obviously if you do have a subscription, right now for free, there is a seven day trial. So with that, you're able to actually check out some of the shows. Do some binge watching. I think it's gonna be interesting to see where this goes, because they need more content. They need to have access to higher production shows. I think 4.99 is still a pretty good price if they start adding more content monthly. I'm excited to see some more of the shows that they have come out. And I would love to know from you guys, what subscriptions do you guys already have? Because I feel like I have Spotify, I have Apple music. I have that Apple news, and I'll have Apple Arcade. Now I have Apple TV, and then Netflix and Hulu. I mean at this point, I don't want to do the math. At all, I don't even want to think about it. But what is cool is you, like I have Apple TV, on my iPod. Apple TV on my tiny little pink iPod. And of course, I also have it on my iPhone. And of course, if you've updated your Mac's to Catalina. You also have the TV app. And I also did a video about my Samsung TV. It was one of the ones that has Apple TV already integrated into it. So now Apple TV is available on so many more devices. This is really exciting, because there's so much great content there and to be able to have it across multiple platforms is amazing. So that's sort of my first initial thoughts of Apple TV. I love \"The Morning Show.\" I cannot stress enough how amazing Reess and Jennifer were in this show. Steve Carell was also incredible, because he's playing a really tough character. I don't know what these reviews are saying, but I personally enjoyed it. I related so much with it and it definitely triggered a few things in me that just made me remember a lot of things and how difficult life is. Not only just going through your day-to-day. But like being on camera and being a personality, because a lot of times you have to carry the weight of so much on your shoulders and yet you have to somehow figure out how to not let that show. So that's not just something that I think us on camera people will have to deal with. You guys have to deal with it too. You still have to go to work. You have to show up, you have to be there, and somehow deal with the tragedies that life throws at you. I guess this video turned weird, I'm sorry. But yeah, that show was just, it was really something. And I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys think of it. And I can't wait for them to have all the episodes out, so you can just really go through, and just watch it and just see it from start to finish. So I'm gonna go. I'll see you guys later. And that's all I've got for you today, Apple TV on iPod. (soft upbeat music)",

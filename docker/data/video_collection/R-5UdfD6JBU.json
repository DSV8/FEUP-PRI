    "transcript": "this right here is another viewer's broken gaming PC and this one's kind of sort of a basket case first off I wasn't expecting to work on this I changed my mind one of the reasons why I didn't want to tackle it is because it has an intermittent crashing problem which means we could spend hours potentially trying to replicate this issue being described by the owner I do have video evidence of it shutting off during some pretty heavy stress tests so we're going to try to replicate those here in the office I also think this system might have a dead memory Channel because if you notice the two dimms are in the innermost slots to the left closest to the CPU that is not where they should be and the owner told me that the system won't boot with one of the dimms in the outer slots so we're going to fiddle with that kind of after the fact we'll try to tackle the random shutting off first and then we'll deal with the dead memory Channel if that is what we're looking at are you ready stay with me introducing kyocsya's new xg8 series in vme ssds featuring 5th generation Bix flash 3D TLC memory and pcie 4.0 compatibility with capacities up to 4 terabytes and support for

respectively and are suited for Ultra FAST program OS and VM load times bundled with peace of mind warranties and at affordable price points qxu's comprehensive pcie 4 SSD portfolio continues to grow with products offered for a wide range of applications check them out including their new XJ8 drives by clicking the link below hi there this is the fixer flop playlist I'm not going to run through the same things I always do just know that what we do in these videos is free of charge if you live in and around Orlando Florida and you want a chance to have your system fixed potentially for free this is why we call it fixer flop we're not guaranteeing a fix but we will guarantee we won't charge you you can submit a form via the link in this video's description first things first I want to go ahead and power the system on make sure that it works as of now oh I didn't really turned on the front fans aren't spinning the rear fan isn't spinning either what is it going on here we'll uh we'll check that anyway while this is booting up I just want to say that if you want to check out any of our troubleshooting gear stuff you'll see occasionally popping up in these uh in these videos it's all Linked In the description along with some of our cleaning gear as well that you'll see in the pcdc and gcdc playlist alright so it boots up that's good um not going to be too worried about temperatures here just because we're going to leave the left side panel off but we'll definitely address the uh the fans not spinning a bit later in the video let's see if we can get the system to crash I believe the way that the owner was able to do it was by running furmark so it's possible this might be a GPU issue maybe a memory issue on the frequency side of things if we're running a manual overclock uh that could be something that we could easily change to get rid of that crashing issue let me get the keyboard we've got firm Mark open here and I'm going to run it in the default settings I'm just going to let this go for about 30 minutes if it doesn't if it doesn't crash within 30 minutes or an hour I'm just gonna I'm just gonna have to move on again I don't really have time to stress these inconsistencies it's possible this issue might pop up right away and if it's something we can repeat here then we'll try to tackle it but again I can't oh uh it it just completely powered off that didn't even last a second okay it's all starting to make a bit of sense now because he was telling me that it was inconsistent while he was playing games but anytime he fully stressed his graphics card the system would shut down now if this was a bad overclock or something of the sort the screen would just go black and you'd hear the fan spin up to 100 RPM that's usually what happens I'm not saying that this can't be the case here but for the system to completely shut off in the middle of a burn-in test that could very well be a power supply issue so I'm definitely going to want to check that we will check graphics card frequencies the GPU and memory will check temperatures as well the fans and the Shroud were spinning so it's not as though the card's getting too hot but we'll try our best to monitor those metrics before the system craps itself in another firm Arc run connected to our inline PSU tester here everything looks very healthy actually slew rate timings a ripple is very low so I don't really have a reason to swap about the unit at this point I've gone ahead and reconnected his case fans through some of the extra cables just hanging around and what I think I'm going to do now is try to replicate the issue again shouldn't be typing an issue since it uh yeah it happens so fast the first time and then we'll also monitor Hardware utilization and temperatures while we do it to see if there's anything fishy going on with this graphics card because the next thing I'm inclined to do is Swap this out completely alright so I've got MSI afterburner here to the right we'll open up furmark again and let's see I totally forgot that uh I didn't even get a chance anyway I totally forgot that it's gonna go full screen on me it shuts off so fast um I don't even think we're gonna get any accurate data from afterburner I think we're just going to go ahead and swap out the card that should rule out the guard entirely uh honestly and if the symptom persists then we'll know it's some sort of power delivery issue possibly motherboard related or even CP related I mean despite this being a strictly GPU intensive task we were running for Mark it's possible that there could be an issue with a CPU as well I've seen so many different things go wrong in these rigs over time I would not be surprised now funny enough I actually have a practically identical graphics card to slot in its place this should mean that we don't need to reinstall drivers my ddu just to be on the safe side but uh yeah these are both 60 hundred XTS so we'll slot this in Connect supplemental power and then get the rig posted hopefully it posts this card I have used in a previous build before and we'll run furmark again we got drivers reinstalled let's go ahead and start the test here yeah um running without issue I mean it's not crashing within like two seconds of starting The Benchmark so that's nice later and it's been a good while this thing is still running without issue so my graphics card is fine his entire rig at this point seems to be running without issue so that means the next thing we're going to do is remove my card which is scalding hot by the way we'll get his back in here and we're going to reinstall all drivers from scratch using ddu by the way you should totally ddu before installing the new card so you would just choose the option clean and shut down here at the bottom I will do it again just to be on the safe side alrighty here we go let's see if it works now pretty much the same thing now if you notice the system behaves slightly differently there the fans ramped up quickly and then everything shut off so it lasted about a second longer but it still turned off and I'd be willing to bet at this point that this is a hardware related issue with the graphics card the crossroads I'm at however involves disassembling this card do I do it and risk the owner of this card losing its warranty that is something that you shouldn't really be worried about here in the States but I'm I've run into many retailers who make a big deal about it and they just it just complicates the entire process I will consult with a viewer and see if he's okay with me doing that sometimes just changing mounting pressure of the cooler replacing the die checking that there's proper you know contact with thermal pads over the memory chips can fix stability issues with cards like these we run into that very same scenario already in this fixer flop playlist all right so uh and it's been a minute I was talking with the owner and there's a bit of story behind this that I wasn't aware of beforehand I asked him when the graphics card was purchased if it's something he could easily RMA he might prefer to do that versus me tearing it down and potentially making things worse for everyone he said that he doesn't know when the card was purchased because he bought the entire rig second hand from somebody on a Facebook Marketplace and these symptoms as far as I'm aware popped up right when he bought it so he was scammed long story short he tried reaching back out to the owner just now to see if he could get his money back and the previous owner blocked him so I told him to make sure that he left a negative review for that person on the marketplace and uh yeah just I mean what are you gonna do no you're not gonna sue somebody for something like this you're going to spend as much if not more in legal fees than you would just to get you know the value of the system back so it sucks it is what it is but uh he basically gave me the green light to go ahead and disassemble it now because we have nothing left to lose right so let's see what we can do so here we go then his graphics card will flip it over I have not disassembled one of these before but most of them are fairly straightforward we'll start with all these screws surrounding the back plate get this bracket out of the way and now I believe check on the side here I think we've got a couple more screws make sure everything we can remove is out before we take the Shroud off let's see oh that wasn't so bad so we'll pull straight away there flip everything over we'll disconnect these two cables one I'm assuming for RGB and the other for the fans nice so we'll set the Shroud aside and this is what will spend the bulk of our time analyzing here we'll see if we see any physical defects obvious things we could clean up I did notice right away there's a fairly large exposed area of the die that should be completely covered by thermal paste and it is not is it possible this card is just overheating so quickly because part of this die is not making well it's making contact with a copper cold plate here you can see but it's it's not filled with paste and the issue one of the reasons why you need paste actually the primary reason why you need it is because the paste fills in those small little like microscopic canyons in the different metal surfaces so when you put two metals against each other you have a lot of tiny little gaps and those gaps of air are inefficient for heat transfer so you fill those gaps those little again microscopic Canyons with thermal paste which is a much higher conductivity than air alone and so that increases the efficiency all around of heat transfer from the dye in this case here it does not look like there's enough paste there so we will address that I still want to give the Border once over we'll remove the smaller heatsink here surrounding the die and see what else we find got the back plate removed a bit of the thermal pad here thin strip peeled up but we'll fix that and just a few more things let's see are there any screws on this side holding that heat sink in place it doesn't look like it so this should just pry up but we want to be careful there we go it's sticky because of yeah the thermal pads so we'll go ahead and clean all this up and give it a once over I want to be very careful around these small smds on the GPU but just looking a lot better already okay so let's see if we can find anything alrighty and she's looking super clean now also cleaning the other side of this board I honestly I don't see any issues if we do have a dead short or something somewhere it's just not something I'm super comfortable with working on cards this new very small parts my soldering kit is just not equipped for a very precise work like this so I'm hoping that just by deep cleaning the board and re-pasting the GPU re-situating the thermal pads that we can get the cord working again and often that is all it takes that's what I'm hoping for I'm gonna go a bit heavier on the thermal paste this time just to ensure that everything's going to be covered again it's okay to have just a bit of excess it's not okay to have too little so yeah that's that's definitely more than we need then it's going to give us total coverage fosho and now just to tighten everything back down and the X bracket last we'll want to cross tighten this so that uh to make sure that the thermal paste spreads evenly this time so we'll tighten just slightly one corner then we'll move to another Corner tighten that slightly and so on and now we're ready to give this one final shot hoping it works and she goes once more and let's see what happens Crossing everything I got here let's click go okay it's not shutting off immediately GPU temperatures are actually looking pretty good that's 73 74c we'll see what this levels out to but this is a great start we're already way better off than we were the first time but uh yeah we do need to let this run for a good while just to be sure that it's stable enough to give back to the owner I definitely think at this point it came down to his graphics card just overheating GPU attempts were likely hitting 95 100 degrees whatever t-junction is for the 6800 XT almost immediately and that was causing the system to shut down because the car needed to turn off in order to save itself from pretty much just yeah blowing up so uh temperatures are still pretty high here and again we need to let this run longer but 83c is is still again what I expect to be a much better temperature than what we were getting before and I think this has to do with the fact that that die was not fully covered by pace so if it was from the factory it was just a pretty shoddy job by the way while the firm Mark test is still running and it's looking pretty good so far about 10 minutes into it we still need to worry about the Dual Channel issue here right now we're only running running in one channel that's because both dims are on the innermost slots that's Channel a typically and then Channel B consists of the other two slots so if you run A2 B2 or A1 B1 that's dual Channel but you have A1 A2 well the a channel is the only one being utilized so what we'll do is swap one of his dims into the outermost slots in fact we'll put these in the correct slots are supposed to be so the second slot in the fourth slot see if we get a post if we don't then I'll try my dims the dims that I know work here in the office if that still doesn't work then we'll have to swap his CPU out because I imagine at that point his CPU will have a dead memory Channel all right all right all right and would you look at that we've been running for about 30 minutes now and zero issues temperatures 11 at around 85 degrees Celsius that is awesome so uh yeah we just saved a pretty expensive graphics card here simply by tearing it down cleaning it up a bit and re-pasting that was all it took the last thing to do then is to check on the memory channels to do this with the system off we can very easily pull out one of these dimms and Slot it into the correct slot let's see should be that one right there so now we're running in slots A2 and B2 which I believe are recommended for this board if you have two dims and we can try powering it up again and when you know the system has yet another issue and it probably involves yet another expensive component so when I have the modules in the correct two slots we get nothing no post at all uh we don't even get lights on the motherboard which is quite concerning basically the system can't post it's powered on but nothing's happening so I'm gonna get my known working kit of ddr4 in here in the exact same Slots make sure that it's not a ram issue and then we'll focus on the CPU it's easier to swap the CPU out than the motherboard but I imagine this is CPU related probably just uh yeah dead memory Channel but same issue nothing has changed let's see I didn't notice before what CPU are we working with it is a ryzen 7 5800 X alrighty yeah this one I'm almost I I'm almost 100 sure I don't have um I don't even think I have an upgrade for this I think if I were to swap him out I'd be able to give them a downgrade then you have to weigh the pros and cons of not having dual Channel memory with ryzen which will noticeably impact performance but I don't think it's going to impact it as much as me downgrading into something like a 5500 which AMD was kind enough to send a few out for the fixer flop playlist but uh yeah 5800x is pretty much in a totally different League I also just noticed these brackets are super loose and this can affect mounting pressure over the CPU which can in turn affect temperatures and boost frequencies Etc the trips getting too hot so and there are a lot of issues with this rig but we'll tighten this down if you had any temp issues before on the CP side of things hopefully this addresses them now I do have a 5900x here and this would be a decent little upgrade form the issue is I pulled this out of a rig that had some problems and I never got around to fully testing the CPU itself which is why I labeled it with a little question mark on the top right I'm just going to throw this in there and see if everything's stable it might not work at all but this is really all I've got the you know without giving them a pretty substantial downgrade we'll probably just leave things as it is and I'll let them know hey if he wants to run dual channel in the future he'll need to replace that CPU I think I'm gonna end up starting a patreon or something and just have all those proceeds go toward Hardware because I've been buying a lot of stuff lately to keep up with how many things are wrong with these rigs that end up in this playlist let's uh let's see what happens shall we click the power button up front ah okay I think I realized why I put a question mark on that CPU for some reason I've ever seen this before in a CPU the system just boot loops I I don't know why like whenever it tries to load into Windows it just it just Cycles over and over after trying to load into windows I don't understand see like that's the splash page that's good now it tries to load WIndows that's good and then it'll freeze watch it freeze and well it didn't freeze there it just completely shut off and there you go the system completely reset itself like you have to start all over again and it just does that over and over and over it tries to throw itself in automatic repair it can't even get in there because it shuts itself off so fast so yeah I think um that 5900x is toast at least I was able to take this opportunity to verify that so here's our verdict then this is his 5800x and it does have a dead memory Channel I slotted in a 5500 off camera and I can get dims to work in any slot no problem heck we could even get the dims to work with the 5900x at least in the beginning at least it posted uh but that ship again has different issues bigger ones to worry about this chip does allow us to post and get into Windows we just cannot do so while any demitol is in either of the outermost slots on the motherboard you would think that it's the motherboard's fault because well it looks like a slotting issue but it's actually the CPU it's a controller in here that handles dual Channel memory that goes bad and we've had a few of these ryzen CPUs have that issue not necessarily Zen three closer to well actually this is yeah not Zen three but Zen two uh the 3000 Series and Zen plus we've run into that issue as well I don't have a chip that's anywhere near as powerful as this to replace this one with so what I'm going to do is put this one back in there and let him know that he has that issue it is affecting performance it's not the end of the world that Lisa's system now works and doesn't randomly shut off while gaming or stress testing his graphics card but yeah so not a total fix here but at least yeah at least it works for the most part I think I should go ahead and just uh bite the bullet then yeah buy like 10 ryzen CPUs we run into so many issues with these chips in this playlist so that might be the best bet I just I don't have anything close to I have a 5500 brand new but it's a 5500 it's it's not an eight core chip it's certainly not a high frequency a court chip so I think that the losses from the lack of dual Channel memory support on his 5800x are more than outweighed by the performance loss opting for a six core lower frequency counterpart in the 5500 I really hate to end on this kind of note because while we had a pretty big success getting that graphics card to to work again under heavy load the CPU still has that memory Channel problem and I suppose the the one good thing he can take away from this in that regard is that he knows it's a CPU issue so if he ever wanted to address it in the future he could very easily swap that out run dual Channel run four sticks whatever you wanted to do without issue at least now he can game again without a system randomly crashing and to that I'd say this was a moderate success we were able to fix things like cable management as well we addressed the mounting pressure issue that I expect we were having with the CPU both brackets on both sides of uh just the mounting mechanism for this noctua cooler were very loose which I think was going to impact temperatures if it wasn't already and then of course repacing the GPU was something that it just needed to be done from the factory it did not look good at all and just that I think just repasting was what allows the CV or the GPU now the graphics card as a whole to work without the random crashing with that if you or someone you know lives in around Orlando Florida and has a broken system I'd like a chance to fix it for free here on the channel you can submit a form via the link in this video's description and I'll get to you as soon as possible thank you so much for watching this far into this one your continued viewership is a huge reason why we're able to continue doing what we're doing here so thank you very much for that I know I mentioned patreon I might kick something like that off again we used to have a patreon but I felt guilty about not putting forth enough content there to make it worth your while I think what I might do going forward is just have a little patreon set up for videos like these where all those proceeds will go towards Hardware replacements for viewers so none of that money will go into my pocket and that will be my pledge to you there it will all go into parts for computers like these and if we end up with surpluses every month or let's say every year then we'll just do giveaways I'll put together systems with the remaining funds and we'll give them away to folks around the world I think that'll be a really cool way to to give back and to make things just a tad bit more exciting especially with all the new hardware coming out at the end here of 2022. thanks so much for watching consider subscribing if you have not already leaving a like and commenting down below I'll uh yeah I'll catch you in the next one sorry it's been a long two days my name is Greg thanks for learning with me",

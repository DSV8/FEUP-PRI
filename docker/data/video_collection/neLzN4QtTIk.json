Click here to start using LastPass:  The inexpensive Mi Note 10 has a top of the line 108mp camera. But how does it stack up against the 108mp camera inside the super expensive Galaxy S20 Ultra? The only way to find out is from the inside. It turns out that Samsung is the one who makes the sensors for BOTH phones:  Pretty crazy! There are minor variences of course. Like software and how the phone captures the images. But it is interesting to see the hardware from the inside.

    "transcript": "A portion of this video is sponsored by LastPass. Today we're going to take apart the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Pro with it's massive 108 megapixel camera. We're going to compare the internal hardware side by side with the almost 3x more expensive Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, which also has a 108 megapixel camera. We'll see if the camera sensors inside look different than each other. It should be pretty interesting. Huge thanks to LastPass for sponsoring a portion of this video. One thing that makes life easier is not having to remember a ton of passwords for a lot of different apps or websites. We all know that using the same password for everything isn't safe. And LastPass can help you stay safe and organized by remembering all your passwords for you. LastPass can fill in the username and password automatically so you don't have to write anything down or keep resetting passwords when you forget. LastPass can also auto-generate super long random secure passwords. There are plenty of other things to worry about these days passwords shouldn't be one of them. The app itself is free and works on computers, iPhones, Androids, and comes with unlimited password storage. There's free cross device sync and password sharing if you need to grant someone temporary access for whatever reason. I'll leave a link for LastPass down in the video description. It's totally free and you can start using it today. Thanks again to LastPass for sponsoring a portion of this video. Now it's time to take apart this Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Pro. Let's get started. [Intro] So I mentioned before that this Mi Note 10 Pro is probably the most feature-rich phone for the price on the market right now. And today we're going to see what all those features look like from the inside. Taking off the back is easy enough. I'll use some heat and be careful around those curved corners, because breaking a phone in front of everyone would be kind of embarrassing. The heat softens the adhesive underneath that glass and my razor blade can cut it away. Unfortunately this phone does not have an IP rating. Lack of water resistance is one of the downsides. Once the adhesive is cut all the way around, the back glass panel can lift up and away from the phone. There's nothing important attached to the back glass. There are 17 screws however, holding the internal plastics to the motherboard. Most of the screws are green which is kind of fun. Matches the exterior of the phone. Once the screws are removed I can flip up the small NFC pad and the rest of the side plastics can pull away from the device. The 5 cameras are what's really interesting inside of here so we'll keep going. The battery gets unplugged like a little Lego and then the exterior metal camera lens can pull away from the phone. We see the 4 flash LEDs two regular and two soft flashes. It also has a ribbon cable that goes to the sensors between the two camera lenses. With that out of the way we get our first look at all 5 cameras lined up here inside the phone. They take up quite a bit of space. The large main 108 megapixel camera is the one there in the center. If I slide over the S20 Ultra, which costs about 3x as much as the Note 10 Pro, we can see that the cameras themselves look to be about the exact same size. And both of them have the same physical optical image stabilization. We'll go deeper in just a second. A clear version of this phone would look pretty awesome. If enough people are interested, I'll scan this one in and make a teardown skin out of it. Let me know down in the comments. The loudspeaker can wiggle out. It does have the waterproofing mesh at the bottom, but inside the housing there are no little balls like we saw inside of the S20 Ultra. The SIM card tray does have a red rubber ring around the opening. Once again, no IP rating, but Xiaomi has at least taken a few precautions against liquid damage. The battery inside of the Mi Note 10 is massive and removable. Thumbs up for that. This guy is a 5,170 milliamp hour capacity. The Samsung S20 Ultra is a tad smaller at 5000. Once again, pretty impressive for a phone this inexpensive. If I peel away the battery adhesive plastic we can see the mill markings inside of the battery slot where this phone was carved out of a solid block of aluminum. And, more importantly, we can see the underscreen fingerprint scanner. This guy is probably the largest underscreen fingerprint scanner that we've seen yet. And definitely gives more credibility to the idea that maybe we'll see larger, whole bottom half of the screen fingerprint scanners someday in the future. Since the screen is AMOLED and because of that LED technology, it's transparent enough to let the sensors see fingerprints through the display. Even if we had a few of these sensors grouped together for a larger fingerprint sensing area I think it would be pretty useful. There is one more screw hiding up here under the front facing camera ribbon cable connector. That's the only thing left securing the motherboard to the frame. Once that's removed, the whole motherboard can pull away. There's a bit of thermal paste on the back of the board, which then uses the metal phone body as a heat sink. The circular vibrator motor down at the bottom is the smallest I think I've ever seen. And both the charging port and headphone jack are permanently attached to the motherboard and not replaceable. If we come up to the top of the phone, we can see the IR blaster LED. This is for remote controlling TVs and stuff. This phone has so much going on inside it's pretty crazy. Now let's check out the cameras. The bottom two cameras, the 2 megapixel macro and the 20 megapixel ultra wide, are not permanently attached to the top three cameras. Kind of interesting. They have their own separate housings. The 108 megapixel camera is obviously the largest of the group. Then above that we have the 12 megapixel portrait camera and the 5 megapixel telephoto camera. But today we're going to be mostly focusing on the 108 megapixel. The only two phones that exist with 108 megapixel sensors right now are this one and the Samsung S20 Ultra both of which are right here in front of us. Getting all the cameras lined up in one row actually looks pretty cool from the inside...like one giant shish kabob of image takers. Each of these image takers is made up of two main parts: the lens, which focuses the light, and the sensor itself, which is the part that we are interested in. The sensor portion rests underneath or behind that clear lens, which we can see here. The little colorful rectangle might look familiar. It's kind of just like that underscreen fingerprint scanner we just removed. Both of these rectangles receive light so they can take pictures. The clear lens on the exterior moves independently of the sensor. Now let's get the 108 megapixel camera out of the Galaxy S20 Ultra. If a 108 megapixel camera is your main concern or selling point when buying a smartphone, it might be interesting to know that Samsung actually makes the sensor inside of both of these phones. That's right. Samsung made the sensor inside of the Xiaomi Mi Note 10, as well as it's own Galaxy S20 Ultra. It's not that surprising actually. Samsung makes a lot of components for a lot of different phones manufacturers. Even some of the iPhones are using Samsung OLED display panels. Both 108 megapixel sensors are about the same size. And if I shuffle them around it would be hard to remember which one came out of which phone without looking at the frames they are attached to. And if I scrape off the copper shielding on the back of the ribbon, it's interesting to see that they both have the same style of manufacturing date and were made just a few months apart. Now, on professional cameras, these clear camera lenses would be made of glass. But since cellphone lenses are internal and protected, they can get away with being made out of optical plastic. Both of the 108 megapixel cameras in each of the phones have plastic lenses. When taking pictures, sensor sizing is important of course, but the size of the sensor is not directly correlated with how many pixels it has. For example, the sensor inside of my regular camera is physically larger than these cell phone sensors, but only has 20 megapixels instead of 108. Another equally important aspect is the software that's actually receiving and interpreting the images from the sensor itself. There are a lot of variables that come into play when talking about cameras. I just think it's super interesting that out of the two 108 megapixel smartphone cameras that exist right now, Samsung makes both of them. And one phone costs 3x more than the other. Of course the software from each phone does play a big part in the image quality from each camera. So you'll have to watch a few camera comparison reviews to see what the real life picture quality ends up looking like. But from an internal perspective, Samsung has made some nice hardware. Cramming 6 cameras into one phone...7 if you count the fingerprint scanner, is pretty impressive. Xiaomi has done a good job of building the Mi Note 10 Pro, and it's nice to know that we can get a phone that does everything at a price that doesn't break the bank. Once I get all the screws in place, and the back panel placed on, we can see that the phone still works and we can check out the camera, since the lens, you know, isn't exactly in place anymore. It looks like the macro and wide angle camera still work. But without that lens focusing light, everything else is just blurry for the 108 megapixel camera, and it just, you know, doesn't work anymore. But still, a pretty fun experiment. If you enjoy seeing phones reviewed from the inside, hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. And since we're all doing the social distancing thing, come virtually hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And let me know what you think of these two phones down in the comments. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

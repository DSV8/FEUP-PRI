    "transcript": "So you might recognize this device? I'm holding it is the iPhone Six-Plus From the bend test video that I did a little while ago, if you haven't seen that video I'll link it in the description But I think most you have, I have a feeling that most of you have, now the reason I'm holding it today is not just to show off how beautiful it is the purpose is to talk about this Which is a new case from a company called [Incipio] the Supposedly bend proof iphone case as you can see on the front here now I haven't chose to use the words bend proof It's actually written right on the front of the box innovative craftsmanship exceptionally strong defend against the bend now obviously I'm very skeptical about what this case is going to be capable of but I do have an unbent perfectly functioning [iphone] six-plus [and] we're going to put in the case and test that theory so let's go ahead [open] up the box and take a closer look at the case itself and Begin to speculate on whether or not it's going to be strong enough To Withstand the force of these right here So inside the package you basically have the case itself and that's it now the case doesn't look very Complicated it's got these metal [bars] on each side I was told at first they were made of titanium, but then I think it turned into just regular steel obviously any kind of reinforcement is going to improve the rigidity of the Device I'm pretty sure I could just bend that in half really the case has all the necessary cutouts for your headphone Jack charging port Your speaker as well as your camera on the back It's made out of a hard clear plastic and then the sides are a tPU style Plastic, so let's go ahead and install the 6 plus and as I mentioned this is a completely Functioning 6 [plus] powered on there, so you can see that so here we go again guys. We're Gonna see what this case is made of Now I don't I Don't think this case is going to do any it feels like it's bending quite easily be honest with you You can see I mean it's not tragic. It's certainly not like the other one But it is [beginning] to bend a little bit I Don't think it's been proof. I'll say that Obviously nothing has really been proof and they probably shouldn't be using that wording bend resistant. Maybe I do think The case is Enhancing the Rigidity a little bit Did not expect to find these results. I thought this thing would be weaker to be honest with you now again. You know what I? can bend it but It takes a lot of force I'm impressed. Let me do it one more time. I know there's so many people in the comments going dude I don't believe you can certainly bend in it It's harder man. I swear to be clear the case is bendable if you [ply] it or break it It looks like I've shattered the steel in there Yes, definitely when you go back and forth enough times you can break it But that doesn't [change] the fact that it is going to enhance Some up the rigidity of your device bend proof hell. No, I mean look at that I'm bending the damn thing right here It's obviously not been proof not a big fan of the wording but going to make it harder [to] inadvertently bend your [six] plus when it's in there And honestly a lot of it just has to do with the rigidity [of] the plastic as much as these Metal rods have to do with it [alright] Thanks for watching if you enjoyed this content make sure to leave a thumbs up down below And I will catch you on the next episode, later",

    "transcript": "- Hushme Personal Voice Mask. - [Matt] This is a gift from all of us to you. - Does this turn me into Bane? I was born in the darkness! - [Matt] Why'd you give Bane a Mickey Mouse's voice? That's the only voice you have. - This is a mask where you can have a potentially private conversation via Bluetooth, but without people around you seeing it. - [Matt] If you remember, we actually did a product like this, very similar, and it was so you could sing karaoke- - Yes! - Without everyone hearing it. - It was the mic that had the foams! Oh boy, too many straps. - [Matt] There's never too many straps, that's what I learned in Vegas. - Matt, I need you to just take it down a notch, please, take it down a notch. This looks so weird! This looks like, for a Cyclops, but with- - [Ken] Yeah, but with one ear. - One ear on the front. (Ken laughing) - [Ken] This is a headset that only van Gogh could love. - 'Cause he's got one ear. (laughing) - Yeah! (laughing) - Hey! - Oh, look, so the headphones are just magnetic to the back. This, while hideous, stupid, and ridiculous, I'm actually like not the worst person to try this. I spend a fair bit of my days on phone calls, and I'm always having to like walk around so that Jared doesn't hear about Jared 2.0, and he gets all like upset and cries or whatever. But if I had this on, I wouldn't have to worry about anyone's feelings. So, there's \"mask\" and there's \"headset.\" What, what? I don't even get it. - [Ken] Oh, wow. - [Matt] It works. - I don't think I got it right. This does not seem like the optimal way to Hushme. Matt, I thought you were the strap master. Are you a little outta practice? - My straps are a little bit more professional. So, you got these bad boys. - I don't like this. This is highly sus. Are you trying to say I look like Goofy? I gotta say, (Goofy laughing) my breathing is not great in this. It almost kinda like covers my nose a little bit. (laughing) (static crackling) It's Hushme time. So, I'm going talk for a bit right now with the Hushme on, and you can be the judge of what this sounds like. You have headphones on, and that seems sus. Matt looks great today. And Ken has a fresh cut, and honestly, it's looking pretty fly. - [Matt] Is this just me, or does it make him look like he has like a big old, thick mustache? - [Ken] It does. - How much can you guys hear? - [Matt] A lot of it. - [Ken] But, I won't hear you from the next room now. - I was speaking relatively loudly. Let's actually hear what that sounds like. This is the last time you'll ever hear my voice- - [Ken] What? - [Matt] This is way clearer than what we heard. (recording crackling) Oh wait, oh. - [Ken] Nevermind. (Ken laughing) - Can you present the next item of \"Mystery Tech\"? (easy-going music) Kind of heavy, alright. A non-descript brown box, exactly what I like to see out of the... Oh, Jesus. The Xebec tri-screen two. - [Ken] So, we did this once before. - [Austin] Yeah, yeah. - [Ken] But, it was not good. - [Matt] Yeah, and it was adhesive. - [Ken] It was one extra screen, not two. - [Matt] This is pretty much specifically for a MacBook. - How much is the Xebec? (Ken laughing) - [Matt] Remember when we had that conversation about upping the budget for \"Mystery Techs\"? - The problem is this is dumb. - [Matt] We paid $300 for the other one. This is 500 bucks. - I'm immediately upset. This thing is gonna suck! These things always suck. Alright, packaging, we'll give them, is cool. It's a chunky boy, but alright, alright. - [Matt] It's got multiple screens! - That's fine. So, as someone who does use a MacBook as my primary system, right? I dock when I'm at work, I dock it sometimes when I'm at home. I can see a scenario in which I'm editing on two screens, and I've got a third screen to watch. (chill music) Ow. I'm curious, these are quite small screens. So, this for reference is a 14-inch MacBook Pro. (upbeat music) Oh. Okay, well.. - [Matt] There's a kickstand. - Is there a kickstand? Okay. Oh yeah, you're right. Alright, alright. So I will say, from the front, you can see, it literally just sort of attaches, right? So you just kind of extend it, line it up with the top edge, and then it attaches. And it attaches to the top, so you don't have to worry about the bottom. So theoretically, that would be fairly close to universal. So immediately, way better design than the earlier version of this from the other company that we tried. Okay, so both are out, and I can... The hinges have some play, but they're not too bad. So, plugging one into the MacBook. Oh, Xebec is firing up. (upbeat music continues) The MacBook sees it, and there we go. Okay, so it immediately works. So hang on, let me plug the other one in. And I've got three screens on my MacBook. Now, one thing you would definitely need to keep in mind is if you're running three screens on your computer, these screens are pulling power from your laptop, right? So, I can see a scenario in which this is going to significantly hurt your battery, so you probably wanna be using this plugged in. But realistically, if you're weirdos, pulling out three screens in a coffee shop, you probably have a power adapter with you anyway. I'll say this works pretty well. And supposedly, so each of these displays has two USB-C and an HTDMI per. So theoretically, if I plug in a power adapter into the screen, it will charge the laptop, which they say is in case you don't have enough extra USB-Cs. The problem is so few laptops actually support two USB-Cs with video. Like honestly, it is a lot more limited than you might think, which is one of the reasons why I really hesitate. My big question here is not so much does this work, 'cause we can see it works. My bigger question is how easily portable is this? - Boom, boom, and close it, boom, and then take it on the... Oh, I don't like that. - It doesn't close. - It's actually hitting the laptop- - Yeah 'cause it's got a little thing. So, you're never gonna wanna leave this on. This is like 85% there. Especially if you got like a MacBook or something, you can just plug your iPad in and get a second screen. It's much, much easier. - Oh, yeah. (laughing) - You could have like your iPad on the side, either wirelessly or connected via USB-C. - [Matt] That's the same price, and you get two screens for this one. - Yeah, but an iPad actually works. - It actually has an OS on it. - Ah, the outdoors, what a lovely place to appreciate what's really important in life, gaming portably, thanks to the power of today's sponsor, the EcoFlow Delta 2, a one kilowatt-hour battery. I don't need to touch grass again. With up to 225 watts from our solar panel over here, you can juice this up from anywhere. However, the EcoFlow also allows you to extremely quickly recharge it when you're at home, using their X-Stream technology, by going from 10% to 80% in less than an hour. With up to 1800 watts of power, this is enough now to easily run my gaming setup. But realistically, with the Delta 2, this is enough to power pretty much any kind of appliance that you would plug into a normal household outlet. Actually, we're still charging technically 'cause the PC running with the monitor is about 70, 80 watts, and we're pulling 100 watts with Joanna in front of my solar panel. - [Joanna] Okay. - Excuse me, my solar efficiency's very important! There we go. Now, I'm plus 100 watts charging while I run my gaming PC. Thanks to the lithium iron phosphate battery, the Delta 2 will last a very long time. You can go from 100% to zero every single day for 10 years and the battery will still hold up. And if one kilowatt-hour isn't enough for you, you can expand this all the way up to three kilowatts, AKA a bigger battery than a lot of hybrid cars have. And using the EcoFlow app, you can also remotely manage everything, including taking a look at how much power is being generated by your solar panel, and of course being exhausted out through your very many AC ports. Now, you might see these ridiculous specs and think, \"That's gotta weigh 100 pounds!\" - Ah! - Well no, in fact, it weighs only 27, which means that especially with the built-in handles, it's actually really quite portable. With the EcoFlow Delta 2, what you're getting here is an incredibly powerful battery solution for pretty much anything you wanna throw at it. Whether you're gaming in the park, camping for a weekend, or you just wanna have a little bit of peace of mind knowing that you can go off the grid, definitely be sure to go check out the EcoFlow Delta 2 with the link in the description. And thank you very much to EcoFlow for sponsoring this episode of \"Mystery Tech.\" You know this is gonna be a good segment of \"Mystery Tech\" when Roboraptor's out here. Next item, please. Caught. The Mighty Mug? - [Matt] That Mighty Mug has been in the sink for about four years. - Who in this room is familiar with the Mighty Mug? 'Cause there's a huge backstory. - [Matt] We all watched Lou's video on this. - [Ken] It is literally one of my favorite unbox therapy videos of all time. - The moment that I first saw this was absolutely incredible. And the fact that that Lou video, when he's just like, \"Are you kidding me, what?\" - What? - Was one of the great YouTube tech moments in history. Wait, Kinsey, are you familiar with this? - No, I'm new to the unbox dudes. - [Matt] Would you like to come and experience this? - Unbox dude? (laughing) - Okay. The unbox dude, okay. Take a look at this mug. I feel like I'm presenting a magic trick right now. A regular mug. You see that little kinda rubber bit on the bottom, right? Whack it. - [Matt] Well, you pushed, you didn't whack. - So imagine this, you're sitting there, drinking your coffee. (metal clinking) Okay, that was a bad example. - [Ken] No! You broke the Mighty Mug! (casually humming) - It works! - Wait, no! - Also, you gotta hit it once and let it reset a little bit. - Reset- - 'Cause if you hit it a second time, it goes flying. - [Matt] You're gonna reenact Lou's video. - That I haven't seen? - Yeah, and we're gonna coach you, we're gonna teach you how to do this, okay? - [Kinsey] Okay, okay. - [Matt] You're just gonna do a lot of \"What?\" - What? - [Matt] No. - [Austin] Like a bit more like- - What? - [Austin] Yeah! - [Matt] Yeah, oh whoa, whoa, whoa! - What? Is that, is that, how, is that how he does it? - [Matt] You're basically Lou. - To really properly do this, this should be full of some sort of like mystery liquid. - [Matt] Why does it have to be a mystery liquid? - Thank you for letting me experience the Mighty Mug. (laughing) - [Ken] It's a relic of the past. - (gasping) Did you just drop this on the table? Is this a PSA 10? - [Ken] No, it's a PSA 8. - I have never ever opened these before, but these are Topps' Formula 1 cards. Now, I'd say about half the people in this room right now are pretty big Formula 1 fans. - [Matt] Hmm. - The other half is Matt and he's not cool. - How am I weighted 50% of this room right now? What are you trying to imply there? - This is not a cheap box. How much did this box cost? - [Matt] I believe that was $350? - [Ken] Something like that, yes. - Alright, the seal has been broken, friends. - [Matt] Now you gonna be going to the bathroom all night. (casual music) - Alright, I have the odds. A foil refractor card is 1/11,000. - [Matt] Oh my God. (laughing) - Another one's 1/25,000. These odds are ridiculous. - [Matt] They're slightly better than me getting a girlfriend. - [Ken] Married or not married? (Matt laughing) - Alright, let's go for a 1/20,000. We're gonna get rich today, boys, I can feel it. (casual music continues) We've got ourselves Richard Verschoor. Matteo Nannini. - [Matt] What, wait, what? That just sounds like someone's forgetting how to say my name. - We're gonna get something today. - So, this is a one-of one, so you just pulled a one-of one. - One-of one! - Oh! Kimi 1/1! Retirement season? Let's go! - Does that mean I get a bonus today? - Careful, careful, careful! - I'm looking. - Don't breathe to hard on it! So, you think that card paid for the whole box? - Probably, yeah. I mean, it's 1/1, right? - Shoot. - Good thing I get a $10,000 bonus today. - [Ken] I call dibs on this one. - What one? There's no item! Okay, you can tell that Ken cares 'cause he's actually walking it over. Are these San Rio Hello Kitty/ Razer collabs? - [Ken] Yes! - I'm about it. Let's go! Alright, so we've got the Razer Kraken BT \"Hello Kitty and Friends\" Edition. And then, we've got the Razer Goliathus Mouse Mat and DeathAdder Essential. - [Matt] That is a mouthful. - I literally know none of these except for Hello Kitty. - [Matt] Cinnamoroll! - Oh wait, what's the little grumpy dude on the side? - [Matt] Matt. (everyone laughing) - This is the DeathAdder Essential, which I know is there lower-end mouse. In fact, I think this is actually what the Pikachu mouse we looked at was based on. It's fine? (clicking mouse) I think I'm a little bit more excited for the headset. Well, I'm looking forward to this screenshot being on the internet for the rest of the time. Behold, my friends, the Hello Kitty headset. - [Matt] Oh, let's go. - Hello, Austin. - [Matt] Why are you talking to yourself? - [Joanna] Hey girls, this is Austin. (laughing) (everyone laughing) - It sounds a little sus, but I like it. Wait, wait, stop the show, stop the show. - [Matt] What, what, what, what, what, what? It's a micro USB, isn't it? - It's a micro USB. - [Joanna] No! - A micro USB. They spit directly in our faces. - Oh! Let's go! So, you know what the issue that I have with this is? They use the base of the Kraken Kitty. 'Cause the ears look the same, but it's like a molded version of it. And so, I think they also compromise the inner lining a little bit, so it's like hard. (gentle piano music) - The voice is the worst. It's literally like, \"Bluetooth is connecting.\" It's not even Hello Kitty being like \"Bluetooth, yay!\" - Nah, I- - \"Bluetooth!\" I'm gonna watch episode seven of \"Hello Kitty and Friends: Supercute Adventures.\" (gentle piano music continues) (laughing) Oh boy! Oh, no one can hear what I'm hearing right now, that's kinda awkward, isn't it? (magical music) - I'll call them Cinnamoroll cinnamon rolls! - These don't sound good. (laughing) I think the design of these headphones has actively made them worse headphones. - The mouse pad I'll take. I don't even want the mouse, I just kinda want the mouse pad. (laughing)",

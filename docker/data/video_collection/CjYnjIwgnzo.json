    "transcript": "in today's video I pit an 8ish year-old gaming pre-built I knife battled off Craigslist against modern games but first today's video is sponsored by be quiet's new pure wi 3 fans if you have a hankering for some big boy fans chasing them cooling gains but you don't want to take out a mortgage on your house the pure wi 3es are for you they even come in a highspeed spec for those of you trying to cool in elephant's foot or whatever so if you're looking for high performance fans without the High Cost Check out the be quiet pure wi 3s using the link in the video description thank you be Qui for sponsoring today's [Music] video so this is what happens when lenovo's Engineers do gamer drugs this is the Lenovo Idea Center which I think it's funny that they still use the idea Center naming culture for something that looks like a Mandalorian helmet now this one's quite used as you can tell it's from the Intel quadcore Dark Ages and it's supposed to have an i76700 in it but from the outside it looks like this one's been modified by the previous owner so I'm not sure it still has that CPU in it on the front is the armored Core face bit with what looks like actual ventilation off to the sides of it and then we even get some carbon fiber effect with does that light up no it actually just looks like some some Arrow veins we've got down here there's heavy ventilation off to both sides which is good to see and there's even more on top underneath this handle now I think that the graphics card lives here so this is where it should pull in air and then we've got our worn down power button over here but generally it's like soft touch Plastics which are holding up quite well considering the age of this thing next to that a reasonable front IO with USB 3 and a supercharge Port around the back there's some interesting layout things going on the graphics card is lying face up so it pulls in air through the top the motherboard looks a like it's the original one and B has usable IO even if not spectacular and next to that peeking through the bit of ventilation is the not terrible looking CPU Cooler and on the back the power supply is almost definitely user upgraded to this Corsair small form Factory unit which means standard sizes although I think it is not captive ooh that's exciting that's like a Founders Edition card really exciting this is a Founders Edition 10 series card which makes this a big day for me I've always wanted to see one of these beasts in the wild going by what's going on here I'm going to guess it's a 1070 but we'll find out when we turn the system on we've got a bit of a whoopsie the power connector that little side bit isn't fully plugged in but I'm pretty sure the power supply was user replaced so luckily Lenovo is not going to have to get the firing squad ready for whoever built this system and then underneath all of that we've got our Lenovo red motherboard over there with two sticks of RAM and a cooler that's got a little bit of a Cod piece going the actual heat sink only extends to about here this is just a shroud to kind of like direct air out the back and we've got some storage in the front here which looks like it's been user upgraded that is a Samsung 870 and a fan in the front and then around the back there isn't a whole lot going on we've just got our aftermarket power supply and that's about it but with that brief overview let's see how this almost 8-year-old system which is like 5,000 years in PC age holds up at the hand of today's gaming I got got to say for a system that's meant to be small it's very much not it's so big uhoh that lights up I'm not going to lie it looks pretty cool and then because we knife battled it off Craigslist we've just got a clean windows 10 install on here we don't even have Graphics drivers so they just installed Windows and then didn't touch it again which is good we like that then we can install all our own VD on it so CPU wise yes here is our 6700 so it's not a k variant so we're not going to be able to overclock it but we do have our four cor and eight threads we've got 16 gigs of RAM running at 2133 MHz oh no it's got a 1 TB SSD in it and a 3 TB H and once the drivers were installed I also confirmed we do in fact have a GTX 1070 in here with its 8 gigs of video memory ooh the BIOS is a US useless example of patheticness we're not going to be able to do anything about the ram speed directly in here but a jedc kit may give us a bit more RAM speed later down the line okay gaming now for some quick context to see how this system runs games more or less from its Heyday we've gone GTA 5 at 1080p High settings and it's running pretty well we're not getting huge amounts of frame rates like this kind of settings we usually well into 190 frames per second with all of the stuttering and stuff happening which isn't happening here but if anything it leads to a much better gaming experience it feels very smooth and responsive and yeah this feels good and we'd probably get way more performance if we fixed whatever is causing the weird utilization going on here my bets on the ram speed at 1080p High settings Battlefield 5 is putting so much more more load on the system than GTA 5 was and it seems like the uh the GTX 1070 and the 6700 are a match made in heaven look at that very very similar uh usage there and with the higher utilization comes quite a bit higher power draw and temperatures especially on the graphics card now Battlefield 5 is getting quite long in the tooth at this point so let's get to the newer games oh he's he doesn't know what's happening oh right in the face okay now it's CS go 2 at 1080p low settings we're getting about 130 frames per second and it you know it feels good it feels like gaming is happening it's very playable uh you can see we don't have any like large fluctuations and frame time going on yeah this is this is a very playable result but oh oh there we go uh but luckily with CSG go 2 we have a secret weapon that despite this not being an RTX GPU we can use yes Fidelity FX super resolution we're going to get quality so that we don't lose too much visual Fidelity let's see what that does very little that's interesting I do think we're running into some slight memory bandwidth issues here uh cuz we don't have full utilization on either the CPU or the [Music] GPU ooh again the founders Edition card no not super happy temperature wise in this case cyber Punk running at medium settings and 1080p I mean 50ish frames per second that is that is not terrible it feels pretty good there is quite a lot of motion blur on though let me turn that off this is with the game natively running at 1080P and uh they have been updating the Fidelity FX implementation quite a lot on here so again we're quite hilariously not going to be able to use dlss despite this being an Nvidia card we have to use Fidelity effects I yeah that just tells you so much doesn't it um okay so let's start off with quality and see how much that helps yeah I I'd say that may have helped slightly uh it's not a huge difference but it it feels a teeny bit smoother and in the canned Benchmark there was a decent jump in performance so it helps more in like interior environments and stuff but let's go up the increments here and see at what point the CPU becomes a problem so let's go to Performance Fidelity FX wa that's made a very big difference so now we've actually run into a little bit of a CPU bottleneck here and I mean it still looks fine it's a little soft when there's like movement happening but it feels really good like this is this is smooth compared to the early days Fidelity FX is getting wildly good I'm kind of assuming by what's going on there with the utilizations that we're not going to get more performance going to like Ultra yeah see we're losing quality quite a lot but we're not really getting any more performance so now it's down to the CPU being a problem um and it's capable of about 70 to 80 frames per second I then very excitedly tried the new Dynamic resolution scaling option which lets you set a bunch of the parameters around how the scaling oper Ates but I couldn't get any better visuals with similar performance to any of the presets that were already there at which point I decided to drop a j DEC Ram kit in here to try and get more performance before we try some more current games for Ram I'm using the trusty Patriot jdac kit that they sent over a while ago cuz hopefully this will give us quite a bump in Ram speeds in the system so this is a 2400 MHz kit which I don't know if that looks like something lovo would use but it's just pretty generic ass looking Ram oh um what it turns out between the 6700 and the motherboard in this Lenovo system the max supported Ram speed is 2133 megaherz which is pretty outrageous but there's not a whole lot you can do about it so let's try some more games oh Resident Evil 4 doesn't mess up about this is with quite low settings but because of how dark it is is you can't really tell and it's lots of frames are happening here this kind of makes the the kind of MacBook Pro gaming demonstration of this game quite a lot less impressive considering that yeah this is very much crushing [Music] it Starfield we're doing 1080p medium I don't know if anybody's still playing this game but I I am I am curious to see how it holds up on older Hardware not very well clearly 107 ooh o wow that was a big lag Spike my word I then tried some real aggressive FSR settings which didn't help as much as I was expecting but dropping all the settings down to low with 50% FSR resolution scaling did so with all the settings at low using 50% render scale with FSR this is a playable result even with space battling these settings are holding up pretty well and it's not like Starfield looks great on the best of days so you're not really losing out that much are you now considering when the last of us first came out it was a bit of a Widow Maker this 1080p medium performance is much better than I was expecting from the 1070 but despite the reasonable frame rate there's still quite a heft to the inputs which isn't great luckily AMD will save us uh I don't think quality is quite enough to eliminate it it feels better better for sure but I think we need to drop it a little more maybe balanced I love how they all say that it's similar to Native okay so with balanced it doesn't feel like we're drowning in maple syrup anymore and Visually it still looks pretty good even with a visual Safari game like this that previous like native rendering uh like input latency is way too much this feels a lot better it does stutter a bit when there's like big changes in scenery but this is a big Improvement and again thanks to AMD we can use our old Nvidia graphics card to play some Last of Us the final thing I did was repaste the Majestic stock GTX 1070 to try and improve the temperatures now on a side note I think this may be the best looking stock card ever I don't know let me know in the comment section down below but anyway tearing the card down was a huge pain in the butt because it's got like a million screws a bunch of which screw into the back of other screws holding the thing together and once I finished tearing it down down the thermal paste was real dry but finally repasting it after all these years didn't make much of a difference and with that what did we learn in today's video well clearly AMD does more to make old Nvidia graphics cards usable than Nvidia does which is really not surprising and brings me to the end of the video If you enjoyed it subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one and until the next video [Music] bye-bye [Music]",

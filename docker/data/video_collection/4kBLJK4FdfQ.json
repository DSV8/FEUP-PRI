    "transcript": "- What's up guys? Lou here, back with another video. And as you can tell, I'm on the dance floor today. That's not actually what this is. This is a gaming setup which is outlandish. Intentionally outlandish. Three OLED displays. When one OLED display is not enough, get three. They're 65 inches apiece and powering the pixels is no joke. That's what this guy's for. Which you may have seen in a previous video. I actually had to beef this thing up in order to drive all of these monitors. So now it's running three GeForce GTX Titans. Three! This is about the ultimate experience. Right here is a seat where you can sit and enjoy all of that power and I'd like to invite each and every one of you to come give it a try. We're talking about this guy right here. (whooping) We're talking about the hot new title, The Division, from Ubisoft. So I want to give a big thanks to Ubisoft for sponsoring this video, hookin' me up with The Division so I can check it out. Virus, breakout, the world has gone to shit as you can tell from this visual right here. Few people, yourself included, decide to pick up arms. - I'm Agent Faye Lau. Division. Activated the same time as you, part of the second wave of us going in. I don't know what happened to the first wave, but unfortunately there's still lots left for us to do. - Vigilante justice. The Division. That's you now. You're a vigilante. This experience right here has been immersive to say the least. Because when you sit here, and you have this peripheral kind of experience where the left and right monitor are things that are happening on each side of your vision, it really is a different type of experience. Now, this particular game is a great one to use on a system like this, because it is the latest and greatest in graphical prowess. In order to get the most out of a game like The Division and run everything in ultra settings, you're gonna have to have a fair amount of horsepower as I mentioned earlier. But as you'll see here I've got the ultra settings turned on, I've even got it running at 60 hertz. So what you're gonna look at in this video right here is some 60 FPS 4k gameplay. This is like the Arnold Schwarzenegger of gaming, right here. This computer, when it's not actually, this PC, when it's not in here in the office, it's hanging out at Gold's Gym. I've played through the first little bit of the game, attempting to experience the environment to the maximum capacity, especially if you can throw some graphics cards at it and run it in ultra mode. So, hopefully I informed you guys a little bit. Hopefully you'll head out and check out The Division. I hope you guys find it as impressive as I did. It really is a unique experience. And if you could sit in this chair right here, let me show you how it looks. If you could sit right here, and as I said, listen, you're all invited over as long as you bring pizza.",

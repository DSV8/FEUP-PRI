    "transcript": "What's up guys? Lew here, back with another video. Today we're looking at a toaster. I know, it's crazy and unexpected... but this is not any toaster. What is so special about your toaster that you should be in front of the Unbox Therapy audience? They said to me: \"We've got a transparent toaster, my friend. We've got a toaster where you can see the progress of your toasting in real time.\" The thermal glass technology. You can see through it, and you can see the level of toast... Toastedness. Toast is an important part of people's days, it's in the morning to kick off your day with your toast... ...and perfect toast- God knows what it might do for your life. Automatic rise and fall, countdown timer, thermo glass technology, perfectly even toast. What does the back say... Oh my goodness, look at that... Intelligent glass panels, browning control, defrost and reheat functions, countdown timer, removable crumb tray, sound notifications and illuminated control buttons - You can even use it at night. Night toast might be better than day toast! Let's jump inside this box and toast some toast! This is a big boy, this is the toaster for tech heads everywhere. People who want more, who demand more. That's not your grandpa's toaster right there, it's got like a little tint to it... Oh ok, crumb tray... It looks like we've got ourselves a European appliance here, you know what that means... ...time to pull out the trusty transformer. Oh... It's already... ...calibrating itself or something here. Now you know, the real move here is you never take the end piece, you reach in and grab something, something fresh from the middle, protected by the other bread, it's a technique that's been used for decades... Controls are over on this side right here, I don't know if you can pick those up, Jack... ...defrost, there's a reheat button - you can put it back in here and like rejuvenate it... That seems strange, apparently, you can do it. Then, of course, this button, probably the most important, is where you select the amount of toasting. I think I'm gonna go for a medium, a four. I've been told that there are other glass, transparent... transparent toasters on the planet... I like entering like that... Transparent... \"What's up guys, Lew here...\" Anyway... But this one is different because its thermal glass, the glass is doing the toasting. Which gives you that crazy balance. Let's... I don't know... let's boot it up let's do it. Level 4, or 4 minutes, for something... In order to give accurate feedback on this toasting quality I will not be tainting my taste buds with any kind of extra spread - there will be no butter, there will be no peanut butter, there will be no jam and most importantly there will be no cinnamon sugar and a little bit of cinnamon sugar... ... a little bit of cinnamon sugar, on some freshly toasted bread... probably'll change your life. Oh we're done. Now... that's a little lightly toasted for me. Super even, obviously, but we're going to have to... we're going to take another bath. Let's give it a three this time. I think this is gonna be perfect right now... No... I think that's flippin' perfect... What do you think? Very hot. It's a hell of a toaster.",

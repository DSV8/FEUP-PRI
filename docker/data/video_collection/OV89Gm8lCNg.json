    "transcript": "(upbeat pop music) - Hey guys, it's Justine, and we are here at the Snapdragon Summit and I'm joined by Cristiano, the CEO of Qualcomm. Now this is so exciting for me, not only do I get a chance to see you and talk to you, but we're here at the Snapdragon Summit. So how is this event for you so far? Well this event's been great and look, this is one of the most favorite events for Qualcomm. That's where we announced the latest and greatest Snapdragon from the 8 Series. Snapdragon has been and continue to be the platform that really defines the pace of innovation and mobile. We've been working very hard to make sure that it really represents what the premium smartphone experience is and we're excited to tell everybody about what Snapdragon 8 gen-2 can do. - Now obviously people can see everything online, but for the people here, what was the kind of idea behind coming to Hawaii and and getting to really experience this in such a amazing location? - It is a great place, isn't it? - It's so great. - We're very excited and I think why we like it, nobody complains. I haven't heard anybody say, \"Oh, I don't want to go to Hawaii.\" It has a reason, Snapdragon, it's been really utilized globally, and it has been the premium in mobile processors everywhere and Hawaii seems to be an easier location for people from the United States to come in, from people from Asia to come in, whether we always have partners from Japan, from Korea. We used to have a very big delegation from China. Hopefully they'll be here next year and then, adds to the fact that nobody complains about coming to Hawaii. It has been really a premier event for mobile technology. This is where mobile innovation happens. It is about not only what we show but our partners can show some of the use cases we can demonstrate and it's an opportunity for people to stay with us a couple days fully immersed in mobile technology and I think that's why people keep coming back to Tech Summit in Hawaii. - Yeah, and it's so fun 'cause you just run into people that you may have only met online or you've been fans of their work in their YouTube or journalism. So it's like everyone is here and you get to see them all and learn about all of the new tech. So speaking of new tech, what are some of the highlights that you guys have announced this week? - The Snapdragon 8 gen-2, besides the speeds and feeds have been some of the fastest mobile processors in the industry right now, one thing that is different is how much experiences are changing by AI. One of the fastest growing processor areas in the Snapdragon platform is AI processing, and you see now AI defining every experience. We talk about connectivity and we're talking about 5G and Wifi 7 plus AI. And what are some of the use cases enabled by AI? When we talk about camera, besides a great camera, we now talk about cognitive camera because you have a lot of AI processing. Same thing for sound when you think think about lossless sound between your device and your earbuds, also enabled by AI. So one thing that is different is how pervasive AI is, and we have some new technology, I'm gonna go a little bit technical, but it's the ability to also create AI processing that you you can continuously do the computation for the use cases. And with that, we announce something called microprecision AI. We announced a new way of doing the processing using integral four that you can have 60% improvement in performance per watt, which means you can use AI and not compromise your battery life. - What's so interesting is I feel like the AI buzzword is just being tossed around all the time, and sometimes when people are saying it, I'm like, \"I don't think you actually know what you're saying.\" Like that does not apply. So for you, what do you feel like AI actually is? - Great question. With AI, the way I would define it is you have now the ability to do a lot of parallel computation. You have access to data and you can do a lot of inference from that data. So one of the things we're gonna be talking about is how you think about AI in terms of the specific use case. For example, in connectivity, when you think about your 5G connectivity or Wifi connectivity, you move around, you are using your radios, any connector to the internet, but the device is learning about where you are. Do you have a good signal at that particular point? Usually you'll drop a package or you have a glitch. Can I increase the power at that particular location? So all of a sudden you start to have seamless connectivity because the device is learning about you and what you're doing into the computation, you now can make a decision and how how you apply the modem. Same thing with camera. The easiest way to describe AI in a camera is you take a picture a night, the system knows that that's water, that's the ocean and it's blue, so it should be blue and we color the picture for you so you actually have the ability to take a picture at night with no light as if it was daytime, and countless examples. But really, it's about making everything intelligent. You said something that I like. I think the AI word has been tossed around a lot. The AI started in the data center, in the cloud. You have all this data go to the cloud, you do computation, you see things when you do a simple Google search and recommendations that come for you. But the real scale of AI is gonna happen in the devices, what we call the edge. Whether you make your phone intelligent, your car intelligent, your camera, your music device and everything. And I think that's what we see, probably the largest opportunity for AI, that's what we call own-device AI. - It's interesting, I didn't even think about giving it more power to be able to get better service. I honestly never thought about that. So that's actually a pretty unique use case. One of these cases that I recently saw was I got a chance to go to Microsoft and see how they were using AI for the voice isolation feature. Blew my mind. - Incredible, isn't it? - I mean it was like we were yelling in the background and you could not hear anything but the person's voice. So that for me as a creator, I was like, \"This is game changing.\" - What I like about that, it's really resonating with this whole conversation about our experience. It's not the technology for the sake of technology, but everyone of us right now, we bring in a Teams call or a Zoom call and all of a sudden you have somebody, you have a dog like my dog had participated in a number of meetings because he will start barking in the background or keys or anything, and the ability to simply take that away, and people can really say, \"Wow, this will change my experience.\" And and I think that's just the beginning. I don't know if you saw their other things we're doing, for example, Microsoft Teams, which means you have your camera and if you move around, somebody comes in, you have another person join you or you stand up, the camera will track and follow you. And that's just some of the cool things that we can do of artificial intelligence in those devices. - The eye gaze, that one was so shocking. So for anybody that's not sure of what I'm talking about, if you're actually looking at the webcam, you're making eye contact with a person on the other end, but most of the time, you're looking down or looking at yourself or looking at the other people. So, the eye gaze AI was one of my favorite new features. - And a lot of people are gonna like that because you're looking down or you're typing or you're looking at the other side of the screen and I think that can be corrected. - So another kind of buzzword that I feel like is tossed around a lot is the \"metaverse.\" What do you feel like this, the metaverse, actually is right now and what do you see that future of the metaverse being? There's so many different metaverses right now that it's kind of overwhelming. Like what is that gonna look like? All right, so Justine, we're very bullish about it because I'll step back and talk about what exactly the problem we're trying to solve before I get into the Metaverse. It's about the merger of physical and digital spaces. Right now we're connected, everything's connected, this is your most connected device, and there is a digital twin of everything. There's a digital twin of yourself, there's digital twin of your car, there's digital twin in your device and everything in the cloud. And the ability to merge physical and digital spaces, it's very transformative and it's going to happen and it's going to get a very big scale. Now this is gonna materialize in different ways. So specific to your question when you think about the metaverse, some of the things we're doing with our partner Meta, with the Oculus Quest, now the Meta Quest, they just announced Quest Pro, you can have a fully immersive experience in VR and you can see from a consumer standpoint, that could evolve into social. The way I described this is if you go to Facebook or Instagram and and then people will put up a picture or a video and it's in a notification and you go see it, but I can see an environment that you could interact with other people virtually and those things are gonna get better, the content's gonna get better, resolution's gonna get better. So, there is a social application. There's a gaming application, fully immersive. But that's not only that. The metaverse is also going to develop on the enterprise side. For example, you can see of somebody which is a technician and somebody comes in with a car and you want to do maintenance on the car, you can have the ability to look at the digital twin on the car, overlay that information with augmented reality devices and you can use that as a tutorial or training or access to information. Fast forward, since we're talking about cars to something that we started to see in some cars right now, which is heads-up display. Think about a heads up display evolving in display in your windshield, all the information about safety and security that's very relevant for you or even where you're gonna find a parking spot or things like that. So all of those things are being developed and I think the future is going to be one that we are gonna be able to blend physical and distal. And of course, from virtual reality, this is gonna evolve to augmented reality where you're gonna have fully immersive glasses. We're maybe 5 to 10 years away of having glasses that you can wear and can do many of the things that you do on your phone. But it's easy to see from a technology standpoint that it's possible something as simple as a phone call, that you can have this conversation like you and I are having when I can see a hologram of you and vice versa with fully augmented, immersive, augmented reality glasses, and I think we're just at the beginning of this future. - It's so exciting. And as a creator too, just kind of getting my mind thinking like what can I do for my viewers to give them a really cool augmented reality experience. Like you said, like they could actually be sitting next to their favorite creator and having a conversation or they could be in their room and now they're magically transported into my office and watching me film a video. So there's so many fun things and you're talking about fixing cars, this can also transfer into like healthcare, teaching people how to do surgery. There's so many different implementations that it's so fascinating. - I think across every industry, but also, so for example, how people consume sports or concerts, the ability to be present in a concert or into sports even though you're watching from your home. I think there's some multitude of opportunities and we're just at the very early stages of building those devices and having the ecosystem formed. - Now you guys, Qualcomm, it's such a huge company and I think that you guys do so much more than even I ever realized. So for everyone at home watching, can you give us kind of like a little overview of what types of things that you guys are in because you're in so many different things that I think people don't even realize it. - We're doing it a lot. - It's so fascinating. - Alright, so the way I would describe Qualcomm. Qualcomm is probably well known for what we have done in the mobile space. I think smartphone is our most beloved device, our inseparable device as mankind, largest development platform platform. And we are close into our processor's powers, close to 50% of all smartphones in the world and there's a lot of people in the world. So, that's kind of the main thing we do. The other thing that we do as a company, many of the technologies that we use today and started using in the history of cellular, 3G technology, 4G technology, 5G technologies, all invented by Qualcomm. And we have been a company that's been really focused on creating technology to solve some of the most challenging problems. And one of the things that we did when we build our mobile business is we realized that the next computing platform needs to fit in the palm of your hand. And that device needed to incorporate every single consumer electronic device. What's the best camera in the world, the one that you carry with you all the time, and that's the camera on your smartphone, same thing as your music device, it's your video device, it's gonna be your productivity device and so forth. And with that technology that we develop for mobile, we saw an opportunity to take the technology to every other device. And I think that's what we do in today. So we're the company providing the connectivity to the cloud, the processing and the artificial intelligence for those billions of devices that we have around us. And if I provide some concrete examples, besides phones, you now find Snapdragon into Windows PCs, you find Snapdragon on tablets as a processor, you find Snapdragon sound earbuds, you find Snapdragon wear on smart watches, we also entered the automotive space. There's something called the Snapdragon digital chassis, which is, it's funny Justine, the reason we entered that market is because we realize that people will go into their car, they buy a little holder, they put the smartphone right there as they're driving. Well, why are people doing that? Because there's more information that is relevant to them for their phones than what you can get on the car. Say, let's just go into the car. So right now we are working with, most people don't know, but we working with 29 of the global brands, virtually every brand in the world is using with Qualcomm to connect the car to the cloud, the digital cockpit experience, and then ADAS in autonomy. But we're not stopping there. We are also working with companies that are doing devices for the metaverse, virtual reality, augmented reality devices. Of all the devices that exist today, which is over 40, all use Qualcomm technology and processors. And we have been expending into what we call the IOT space, industrial IOT. And you see us in healthcare, in retail, in industrial, in energy, in a number of other markets. We're busy, but it's an exciting future ahead of us. - I'm exhausted just hearing you list off all of those things, but you guys are such a massive company and you just most recently became the CEO a few years ago, so congratulations. - Thank you. You've had quite the history of Qualcomm and now you're kind of leading them into the next era. So I'd love to hear about your past. - Yeah, I've been born and raised in Brazil, went to engineering school in Brazil. I got job at Qualcomm in 1995 as an engineer and became CEO June 30th, 2021. And I love this company, it's been a great journey. I think I've been fortunate enough to participate in every transition of wireless. I work in wireless and the cellular industry my whole life and I've seen that some of the technologies that we have developed and we thought about we can do this at Qualcomm had really changed the world. I think that's the motivation that we have in this company to come to work every day. We really like being in a position that we can change the future with technology and that's what we'll continue to be doing. - So I have a lot of younger viewers that watch my channel, and I feel like for them, just seeing people in high power, what did they wanna be when they were younger? And that was something that I was always curious, did you have a career choice in mind when you were younger? Like, \"Oh, I always wanted to be this\" - That's a difficult question to answer. I always liked math and physics and chemistry, science. I like that. When I decided what I'm gonna do when I'm going to go college, I remember my dad said to me, \"Son, you can do anything you want as long as it's medical school, law school, and engineering school.\" So then I said, \"All right, that's easy. I like math, I like science, I'm gonna go to engineering school.\" I did, however, when I was in school, I really got very interested in communications and wireless communication. I saw this huge potential of radio communications. This is at the time that there was not cell phones yet. And I think the opportunity for radio communications for everyone to carry a phone with them all the time. So I got interested in that, ended up following career in wireless and here I am. - So do you have any advice for any kids now looking to get into any types of specific fields? - I'm very passionate about STEM education. I think there's a lot of opportunities in technology. We look at how much technology there is around us but I think the future is yet to be invented and I'm more excited than I've ever been about some of the advancements in the area of communications, the area of computing, the area of artificial intelligence, and I think STEM's a great career. - Yeah, for sure. And with 5G, I feel like that is now pushing things even further because we're gonna be able to do things so much quicker. As a creator, this is great. I can do camera to cloud, I can upload my videos faster, but what other types of areas do you see 5G affecting? - One of the least understood capabilities of 5G, we talk about it's very high speed and no more congestion, you can have a gigabit of data, you have very low latency which you can play games in the cloud and you're not gonna have any delays. We talk about consuming video now, and the way the video was designed to be consumed of its full frame rates. There's all those things associated with speed. But one of the least understood features of 5G is the fact that you can have on-demand computing. I'll explain what that means. You are now connected to the cloud with a very big pipe. It's a very high speed connectivity. It's a very fast response time. So think about your device, whether it's your smartphone or your PC, it's now connected with the cloud as if they were a single device. So now you have unlimited computing power, and that's why for example with 5G, people that had to have a big workstation and they're doing a lot, especially for example on the creative side, you're doing a lot of applications with a lot of computation, they can do on a laptop using the power on the cloud. So basically, 5G will democratize computing power. You can have access to as much computing power as you want using the power of the cloud. And I think that's gonna be the next game changing feature of 5G. - Speaking of gaming, that has changed the gaming landscape because now you're playing your video games on your phone basically wherever you are which is incredible 'cause you don't need a console, you don't need your high-powered PC and I think it's really changing the game. - Yeah, mobile gaming is the fastest gaming segment right now, and think from a developer standpoint, you now develop a mainstream game, you put it on the cloud and it's not just the consoles. Anybody that has a phone will be able to play that game. It's a much larger market. So I think that 5G streaming of games is gonna fundamentally change the gaming industry. - Yeah, I remember what people used to think mobile gaming was just playing like little tap games. I'm like, \"No, I'm playing Halo right now.\" I don't know about you, this is really so great because me and my sister also, Hi, Jenna, we travel a lot, so like we're able to play basically wherever we are. We used to travel with all of our consoles back home for the holidays and now we don't even have to do that. So, it's so awesome. So now looking forward into the future in the next couple of years, what are you most excited about? Just when you said the next couple of years, I think I'm very excited about the work that we're doing in transforming PCs. You and I talked about some of the use cases that Microsoft demonstrated. I think the next generation computing for the future of work, we're very excited about that. That's a whole new market for us. We expect to get scale in '24. The other thing that I'm very excited about is all of those cars that we've been working on with technology for assisted driving autonomy, they're gonna start coming into the market in the '25 to '26 timeframe. And I think the last thing is, I believe that phones are gonna be here for a very, very long time, but in a couple years we're gonna have our companion glasses that go alongside our phones with augmented reality and there's so many cool things we can do. - Oh, I can't wait. I'm even thinking even further ahead, like actually contact lenses. I've seen prototypes of things like that. Like that's thinking way far in the future, but the whole glasses tech, I'm super excited about that. It's gonna be really cool. Thank you so much for joining me here. Is there anything else that you wanna tell them about Snapdragon or anything else to add? - I think just watch the stream of the Snapdragon announcements. I think we're very proud of Snapdragon 8 gen-2 and hopefully you'll find that in the phone next time you're gonna go buy a phone. - Awesome. Well, thank you so much for chatting with me. This was great. - Thank you. Happy to do that. - Thank you. (upbeat pop music)",

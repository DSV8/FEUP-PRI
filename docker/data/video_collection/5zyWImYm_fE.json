    "transcript": "our journey to Japan starts the way every journey to Japan should start with an Onsen and then head straight to the ridiculous akiabara District to build a gaming PC but before we get into that today's video is sponsored by the node or by its new underground street fighting name Akamai lenod Akamai is your One-Stop shop for Linux based Cloud Computing Services and Krav Maga technique related queries just look at this long list of Linux based Cloud Computing Services they offer I can tell you're impressed and this combined with their competitive pricing and award-winning customer support makes the node a no-brainer Choice sign up using the link in the video description to get a 60-day hundred dollar free credit [Music] thank you our first stop is big camera which is a huge Electronics chain that you can find all over Japan which is by no means a dedicated gaming PC hardware shop it's just like an Electronics place but this one in akiabara may have a decent selection so let's go check it out when you get to the PC gaming floor of big camera you're immediately greeted with some fancy mood lighting and a wall of gaming laptops but after my initial Euphoria I noticed something concerning here you can buy some super expensive Dell XPS action it's about 2 000 Canadian dollars for a system with a 1650 NF so apparently it's not just a Dell tax this Galleria gaming system with a 1660 super in it is going for about 2 000 Canadian dollars and this much more baller system with a 3700 and a 470 TI it's 400 000 Yen this system with an RX 6400 in it it's a thousand seven hundred card okay now in all fairness it's more like a thousand 500 CAD but it's got an rx6 in it but then things got a bit weirder now this doesn't really make any sense compared to all the other pricing we've seen because these Alienware systems I mean I'm struggling to say are reasonably priced but a lot more so than the others quickly growing concerned that my tiny akiabara gaming PC was gonna bankrupt me I headed over to the custom part selection hoping for some better pricing wow these prices are about as all over the place it's a roided up Jim bro I'm really hoping we can find a deal somewhere big camera then managed to distract me from its anomalous pricing by luring me in with its voluptuous peripheral selection no way they have a spunk proof keyboard that's so useful what's really cool about these shops is that they actually line up all of the headphones plugged in so that you can try them out to see if you like the way they sound you can even try out all the keyboards and I found her next pair of headphones so I think we found the mouse that we're going to use for the gaming setup and it comes with a mouse pad there's even a headset and look they've got the laptop Corral and after that spectacular find we realized that big camera had like no PC cases available for some reason so we decided to take the scenic journey to another PC shop and here nestled in the bosom of waifus we have a harambe memorial restaurant next we're heading to tukumo which is a more dedicated gaming PC place so hopefully we'll find a good selection of cases here to Kumo is a magnificent shop which would bring a tear to the eye of even the most jaded PC tech Enthusiast and we were starting to see some promising signs for our planned tiny gaming build okay so this is starting to look promising we've got some ITX systems so this is the first ITX motherboard we've seen with pricing but that's way too rich for my blood undeterred by the singular very expensive ITX motherboard we decided to head upstairs to establish what kind of ITX case selection we have to work with Yes we finally found a case selection this mini ITX system you can kind of you've got just drive me so below this exciting new fractal design case they have that look at it it looks like a 3D printer on a spaceship but then we found very promising tiny option with a handle and you can get it in red for a reasonable price wow that price actually doesn't make my butthole pucker in terms of power supply we have an option for this little guy apparently it's 80 plus gold 600 watt and it's going for about 120 Canadian dollars but unfortunately the graphics card prices were still obscene so we decided to go looking for some used parts interestingly takumo also has a used Branch a little bit down the street from the store we just checked out and on the first floor their full system pricing was already looking a whole lot more promising than any of the stuff we've seen before although what peaked out at me from inside the cleverly concealed systems was a little bit worrying but luckily the numbers upstairs were also a lot smaller and the parts a lot less Intel stock coolery oh this process is so much better I mean it's by no means cheap but it's way better than the new pricing satisfied that there were cheaper options available we headed to lunch and then found even more PC shops first we headed it into a soft map which is another several floor monstrosity of a tech shop a labyrinth that can easily be used for abandoning unwanted family members this place seemingly has everything from used iPhones to holes full of PC Hardware soft Maps got a Spider-Man RTX 4060 TI it's just a shame it's on the 4060 TI and not a better graphics card new and used camera gear there's a floor dedicated to Apple users they even have a massive collection of trash can Macs they've also got a bunch of used graphics cards here in softmap 980 for about 200 CAD oh little baby be quiet fans but despite a seemingly infinite supply of new and used graphics cards at variously eye-watering prices they had a weirdly tiny ITX case selection although they did have something we were surprised not to see at any of the previous shops so we finally found a case with a bunch of anime crap on it it's just very big I don't know how I'm gonna fit that in my suitcase so Anna's had the idea of us just making our own one we find some decals and stick it on that little aluminum boy and with Anna's genius idea we left the soft map and stumbled onto an even bigger tsukumo there's a Razer gaming store in the basement where it belongs and seeing their big ITX case selection had me convinced I don't know man looking at all these case options that little John's bow still still really feels like the way to go having decided on the case I then found a new graphics card which is price didn't make me want to lose my lunch up all over it and it was likely gonna fit in the tiny John's bow case and then after spending a bunch of time picking our motherboard and CPU option exhausted we headed off to find the final piece of the puzzle a waifu sticker for our case right next door there was a shop that looked real promising but then I noticed something oh wow those are definitely sex toys I think we may be in the wrong shot but after that it was hard to find a shop that wasn't just wall to wall physics-defying anime booba here are some very appropriate mouse pads Anna's looking at some more very appropriate stuff oh wow that is real appropriate you can get some data alive in this pop-up shop the other problem was none of the places sold stickers they were nearly big enough to understand all their stickers are just these tiny ones I mean the same goes for this one eventually with our innocence thoroughly destroyed we gave up and just ordered a decal off of Amazon and then headed off to buy the last parts we needed so that we could finally build our tiny gaming system oh and at the end of all of it we spent a thousand five hundred and fifty CAD including the peripherals that looks like a pretty good haul with all its rain proofing on and they packaged the case in a really smart way they kind of attach this handle with straps so you can really easily carry it [Music] oh they actually taped it down under here [Music] the CPU platform I ended up going with Intel which meant I did have to make a couple of motherboard sacrifices oh the motherboard comes with a driver disc which is nice and retro although it's also disgusting because it seems to have Norton on it unfortunately with the Intel system we couldn't afford the luxury of a built-in rare i o Shield so we get this unpainted separate one like it's 1875. [Music] and here is our little it export although ASRock did skimp on the i o remember that guy cpu-wise I'm using the I5 12 400 I've just got bored of shopping around it this seemed like one of the better options at the shop we just ended up buying everything at [Music] LGA 1700 are such chunky CPUs [Music] oh don't you just love an m.2 SSD the fact that you can plug a tiny thing of super fast storage straight into your motherboard just somehow never gets old to me [Music] caving and buying everything from had quite a small selection of 16 gig ddr4 kits but this should work with that noctuar cooler which doesn't overhang the ram slots so I'm not sure why I mentioned that uh this motherboard has those stupid side seesaw Ram mounting clips which is a trend that I hate about as much as I love m.2 drives oh it's so cute little and brown and it looks like it's not so little that it's not going to be able to cool anything hopefully now this noctua nhl9x65 was the only low profile cooler they had in stock so unfortunately I couldn't find anything more exotic and I slightly forgot that the Intel CPU came with a stock cooler um wait all right okay so now I'm just gonna censor the thermal paste application for you whiners out there [Music] and there is the very cute little core of our system ready and assembled the Pooh Brown fan does match the kind of silver aesthetic of the motherboard quite well and hopefully it matches the red case maybe now the only problem with this very convenient packaging is that it may take me a while to cut through all of this turtle death to get to the case but you know at least we got a handle wow that is so neatly wrapped the work of a real professional I'm so excited to build in our T8 handle Case by John's bone [Music] oh it's got a nice Sparkle to it as well that looks like a really nice paint finish thank you [Music] oh that's such a cool looking little case I think thermals are potentially going to be horrendous but not necessarily we do have a top exhaust fan which will pull air through the bottom of the case but the graphics card is going to be right up against that bottom mesh hopefully it doesn't block off too much of the ventilation in the bottom so that the rest of the components can breathe hilariously the T8 does technically support full ATX power supplies but I decided to go for an sfx unit instead so there's more room for air to move around inside especially considering that the power supply is going to be sitting right over the CPU Cooler so I think the sfx was the right choice in terms of front i o we get two USB 3 ports and quite a nice little power button [Music] oh and that's a really stupid mount now considering the internal layout I'm definitely going to mount the motherboard first then the graphics card and then maybe the power supply last it's a nice touch that we have a dust filter in the basement oh forgot IO Shield [Music] okay so this little John's bow case has immediately raised several red flags the first one is the the front i o looks like it's gonna get in the way of the graphics card hopefully the GPU we got fits in here it should according to the specs on johnsbow's website but that looks a bit weird and then the other concern is that the power Supply's intake fan is going to be right over the CPU Cooler which is pulling air in this direction so we're gonna have two fans that are going to be sucking and blowing against each other which sounds like a great time for every context except the one that it's happening in but at least it's got a nice red paint finish which that's the only thing that matters right foreign and with that I think we're ready to pray to the Lords of PC Building that the graphics card is actually going to fit in here [Music] thank you oh it's a power color card I didn't recognize the books I thought it was like some random OEM that you only got in in Asia but no it's a power color card now I ended up going with the good old RX 6600 because quite frankly it was just the best value I could find if I wanted to go with a newer graphics card I'd have to spend double what I paid for this card and we're gonna get some pretty good 1080p performance out of it now this is a very basic power color version we don't even get a back plate but it was one of the shorter ones so uh yeah hopefully it'll fit although having seen it compared to the case I don't know okay well that's not a great start okay now this is potentially going to require some serious angling but foreign that's close maybe I need to remove the SSD caddy first oh well that's just really stupid the front i o cable which I just struggled for 20 minutes to plug in is threaded through this so I can't get it out without having to unplug that oh little case you're quickly rubbing me up the wrong way maybe it being shimmied out of the way is enough oh oh oh no I think it's stock oh it's very stuck now ah okay okay I think we're good I've scratched the case and the graphics gone but oh it's in oh I can barely fit my finger between the front of the graphic Squad and the case but you know a tight fit is often a good thing and at least it's wedged up against some ventilation so that should be fine and this is our little local Japanese sfx power supply which is fully modular and it seems like a reasonable power supply [Music] oh that sounded awful [Music] this is what the inside of our little John's bow system looks like it's actually not as bad as I was expecting the CPU Cooler does have I think more than enough breathing room over there but now comes the scariest bit we need to see if this system works because well I didn't test any of the components all right first we need our official Razer Hello Kitty peripheral set and random pink keyboard [Music] oh wow that is a crappy pink keyboard these are easily the best looking headphones I've ever seen why would Gamers not want Hello Kitty and friends on the headband and a gamer bow oh that's all I've ever wanted I don't know if this isn't Peak gamer I have no idea what is [Music] oh yeah that is one hell of a gaming setup now we do still need to add the final glass panel to the side with the red waifu sticker we found but that's gonna come later first we need to fire up the system and see if it actually works that is a terrible sign it's plugged in right no that's not the problem either uh despite the nightmare Prospect of having to dig around the cramped little case again I actually managed to diagnose the very embarrassing problem quite quickly I'm so stupid oh I plugged the front panel headers into a front USB 2 port hey hey I was just stupid very good and without her having skillfully added the final touch to the side panel it's time to admire the Majesty [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] now to test The Thermals of our little red gaming system I'm going to use Battlefield 5 because it's just very evenly stresses the system as you can see and at 1080p High settings we're getting lots of frame rate like this is this is a lot of Battlefield 5 happening thank you [Music] temperature wise the GPU isn't doing too bad we've barely ever gone over 80 degrees Celsius whereas with the CPU the highest we got was 91. we still haven't gotten any thermal throttling like the system's just been running as is the whole time so it might be quite hot and loud but it's not hot and loud in as bad a way as it could have been and even when pushing the CPU just a bit harder using cinebench we still peaked at about 90 degrees Celsius which is hot but not quite the Hellfire I was expecting considering the fan kerfuffle in this case oh and the Hello Kitty peripherals tripled my average KDA and unlocked the Subscribe achievement which just like that brings me to the end of another video thank you for watching bye [Music] foreign [Music]",

    "transcript": "Okay, so the galaxy fold we're at the point now where Samsung has recalled all the review nuts out there and they're gonna try to Fix it and just relaunch this whole product and a little bit clearly There was something wrong with the fold at least the original devices and they're gonna do what they can to resolve this whole thing But as I sat here thinking about the situation I thought how did we get here? like how do we get to the point where Samsung was putting out a device like this that felt so unrefined and so rushed out into the market and I just thought about the sequence of events that basically put Samsung in this position where they were almost Forced to do this, so in 2018 They were rumors like a lot of rumors that Samsung was gonna put out the first folding phone It was like hey, you know, that's cool That's the first new type of phone technology that a lot of people were interested in But at the same time there were rumors that a competitor kwame was trying to do the exact same thing But they were trying to beat Samsung to that title that title of the world's first foldable phone But then in late 2018 there was an accusation of theft there were some South Korean prosecutors that were charging some executives for selling the technology of bendable OLED screens to a Chinese competitor and one of those competitors that were purchasing this stolen technology was a company called BOE They're one of the suppliers for Huawei phones in fact They're making the bendable OLED screen for the upcoming foldable huawei phone the mate X so fast forward this whole thing - I guess 2019 February where the galaxy folds is launched at the Samsung event and no one had seen this phone prior to the event is pretty cool that they'd kept it secret but it's 2019 Leaks are everywhere. We see phones like six even eight months before they get announced How did Samsung keep this phone under wraps this entire time? And it makes me think of one or maybe two possible scenarios One possibility is that maybe very few people had access to this phone like maybe their test group was really small and they just wanted to keep it very Contained very secretive so that it wouldn't get leaked The other possibility is that maybe this device just got off the manufacturing line like it's not fully tested But they just want to show it out to the public so that they could be first and then they would take that time after the event to sort things out and then kind of deal with the aftermath but in either of those cases There's not a lot of testing involved and we've seen the results. We've seen these devices now I fix it did a teardown of it. This is a very fragile device It's kind of weirdest at how easy it is for crap to get into the phone like up front under the display There's a little bit of a gap stuff can get in there and then on the back There's a gap that runs along the whole length of the hinge that stuff can get in and once it's in there It's very likely that it's gonna stay in there And that's what the cause of a lot of these problems are I'm not talking about like the peeling of the protector It's that when stuff gets into the phone, it busts the screen from the back the hinge mechanism looks robust And the panels themselves are supposedly rated for like two hundred thousand folds. It's not the hardware like individually all the parts are great It's just that when you have moving parts like this and they're all combined when there's one point of weakness The thing will fail and in this particular case, it's the fact that there's no ingress protection There's just so many places that dirt and other particulate matter can get into the phone and break things so this is where things get a little bit weird when you look at the problem that this phone has It's not like some obscure problem dust is a very real thing it's everywhere and if they had done some proper testing and I'm not talking like super extensive testing like Actual testing of this device in real-world scenarios not just like folding the screen with machines But actual testing in people's hands, they would have picked up on this I mean look at the number of review nuts out there that have had issues from stuff getting into the phone It's clearly a pretty common occurrence. But the reason why this happened is because Samsung is Samsung They're a company that feels pressure from the market from the consumers to do things quickly And sometimes they take shortcuts and sometimes those shortcuts don't pan out but other companies like Apple for example they don't feel that same kind of pressure at least not to the same degree, like like air power for example, they Wanted to launch something and they tried for a while to make it work and when it didn't work And it couldn't make it happen the way they wanted it to They just axed the product that obviously that's just a charger but Samsung really wanted to be first this time around and honestly I feel like they should have been first. They're one of the pioneers in OLED bendable technology and they deserved it they deserve to be first and when you have pressure like qua way that was going to release a bendable phone of their own like Think about how they feel do we really want that company qua way to come out first means like hey We have the world first bendable phone. They wanted to be first. They took a couple shortcuts to get there and That's where we are right now. We have a recall on a product now There's a part of me that feels like you know Samsung They should have done this but there's a bigger part of me that just feels bad for them. They got backed into this corner they got pushed into the situation where they had to rush it and try to be first and Now we're in a situation where it might look bad for the company, I mean I think Samsung is doing the right thing to recall it and try to do what they can to fix it But it also affects the public kind of Perception of what folding technology is like for any folding phone that comes out in the future people will question its durability and reliability Just because Samsung a huge company messed up on their launch but that's what we have and I genuinely hope that Samsung is able to resolve whatever issues they had with that phone because Playing with that phone is one of the coolest things I've been able to experience in quite a while in tech. Okay Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs. We liked it subs if you loved it. See you guys next time You",

    "transcript": "- So as you may have heard, this week marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. But what you may not know is the story of the iPhone actually dates back all the way to 1977. (upbeat techno music) Not only is this month the 10th anniversary the iPhone, it is actually the 40th anniversary of the Apple II, which I have right here, in this bag. Now I've never seen one in person, so I'm a little excited check this out and fun fact, the tech inside this was mostly design by Steve Wozniak, but in classic Steve Jobs form, he actually took the spotlight and debuted in 1977 at West Coast Computer Faire and yes, Apple did build and sell the original Apple I a year prior, but really this was the first Apple product geared for the masses. Now unfortunately, this sweet leather bag was sold separately back in the day, but that shows you Apple was still milking people for leather accessories from the beginning of time. Now what I notice immediately, is this apple over here on the bag is fully intact. There's no bite out of this. From what I understand, Apple actually added that bite so people would not confuse this with a cherry or tomato. Let's crack into this bag. Gotta be careful. This is a vintage piece of tech. Hey! We got some... (computer bangs) This is the Apple 2. Man, this is much, much different than computers we see today. And again, I never seen one of these in person so this is really, legitimately, my first experience with this. Ah! So unlike Apple products today, Apple actually wanted this to be really accessible to the users so you can upgrade parts, you can add iO. Not like anything we see today with Apple, where they charge you millions of dollars for RAM. Now for reference to how far things have come today this had a one megahertz processor. One freaking megahertz. And for contrast, you'd need about 2,000 of these to equate to the computing power inside most phones today. Now something interesting with the Apple II is there was no floppy disk drive on this machine. So the way you accessed data or really did pretty much anything was through add on peripherals, like this guy here. You can see we have a whole slew of additional ports and lanes, so it's kind of similar to how you'd add a video card or a PCI SSD, to a modern computer today. But the attention to detail on this is kind of crazy. What immediately stands out to me is the Apple computer logo right smack in the middle and I'm willing to bet that this was more than likely intentional because of how OCD Steve Jobs was. On the left, we have the power supply followed by the speaker below that. I'm going to pop the top back on. Hopping over to the keyboard. I'm actually not sure why there is a BELL text on the G key. Why is there a BELL? From a quick Google results, the BELL key was actually activated by typing control G. That's a holdover from old typewriters and teletype machines that actually had a little metal bell in them. Moving on to the keyboard. This has some nice click-y, tactile response, very similar to a mechanical keyboard. In addition to the BELL key, there's also a REPT key, which I would assume means repeat, but also unlike any computer keyboard we see today. That's crazy! There's like the at symbol on the P, so it's a shift @ P TLD TODAY. Now, funny story, we actually used to have a disk drive that we thought would be a great idea to turn into an SSD, throw it in dream desk 3 and then give it away. But that left us without an option for the Apple II. But not to worry we have the Apple II C here which does have a floppy reader built-in and will allow us to play The Glorious Oregon Trail. You may be a banker from Boston, be a carpenter from Ohio.. Immediately my mind goes to basketball Celtics or Cavaliers. I don't think I want any of those. Be a farmer from Illinois. That's the Bulls! - [Announcer] Greatest mascot in the NBA. - I don't even know what four was but I selected three. What is the first name of the wagon leader? Austin Ekans, Rich, Terry Crews, Kanye West. So you're going to Oregon. I can fix you up with what you need. Man he's selling me drugs. I charge $40 a yolk. That's some expensive eggs right there. Now loading the wagon. You see those sweet color graphics, that's actually a fun fact. The Apple II was able to output color graphics. So that's actually why Apple did the colored Apple logo. It was a way to market that, hey, this machine can output color. S for shoot, nope. B for blasts, D for dead, shift. I did not buy any ammo. Terry Crews, no! Kanye West has a fever. (laughs) Kanye West just died. Rich just died. - You're dead. - I'm dead. Terry Crews just died. - No! - That's everybody, right? Here lies Austin Ekans. (laughs) Well, that's the darkest Oregon Trail game I've ever played. Now from there, let's fast-forward from 1977 to 2007. This is what a popular smartphone looked like before the iPhone. Shout out to the Sidekick. And when you think back on what people assume the iPhone was gonna be, I think they really just pictured an iPod with a phone built in which would have been terrible. Luckily though, we got this which over the past 10 years has transformed into this. Now hopping back to the Apple II, besides the sweet retro color or paint job, how is this iPhone and the Apple II, two very different-looking machines, the same. Really what I think you have to ask yourself is what was Apple trying to do with these products. When they Apple II first came out, it was often referred to as an appliance computer, just like those things in your kitchen. Steve Jobs really wanted people to associate the Apple II just like they would have blender or a toaster, not in the way that would make you food but more so that it was intuitive and would make your life easier. Flash back to before the Apple II, this was the modern-day home computer which had crazy switches and lights. Honestly, it really didn't look too invited. I think that was the purpose and why the Apple II looks the way it does. It was meant to be simple and something that you wanted to use naturally Now think back to the iPhone. From it's beginning stage, iOS was so simple a baby could use it. So, really, when you look back at the Apple product, over the years, it's kind of always led to this. The simple appliance computer that is meant to make your life easier. So basically, what Jobs and Wozniak dreamed about all the way back in 1977, has evolved into what you maybe watching this video on today.",

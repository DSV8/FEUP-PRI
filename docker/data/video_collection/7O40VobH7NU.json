    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going guys? Dave2D here. So, the P20 and p20 pro are the phones you probably know by now because of their cameras. The P20 pro in particular has the highest score in smart phone market right now So, I am gonna focus most of this video on the P20 pro not so much the P20. Still a great phone, still a great camera but my experience that I want to talk about it is with P20 pro. Okay, before getting into the camera i want spend like a minute talking about the phone as a whole AMOLED screen is really nice, its bright and colours are on point. At first i was disappointed at the lower resolution. It's not a 1440p screen Its a 1080p screen. But i think they made the right choice because for one that extends the battery life and image looks really really good on this screen, despite the lower resolution and the other thing that i really like about this phone is the battery life. They claimed it to be a 2 - day battery. But, I wouldn't go so far as to call that. But it'll easily pass One day of battery life even with Heavy use. The Kirin 970 in here isn't the Fastest chip out there. The SnapDragon 845 is Faster.",

    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin, how's it going? Backlit Gameboys are a common sight these days, and at first glance, this one's no different. But there's a slick feature hidden here and this time, we'll see what it's all about. [ Music - Intro ] This DMG comes courtesy of Roarke's Retro Corner, who kindly sent it my way to review. Roarke specializes in custom modded Game Boys and this one serves as an example of his work. It features a new reproduction shell and buttons, along with a blue glass screen cover and matching Hylian shield from the Zelda series. Of course, a backlight's been installed along with a bivert module for better screen contrast. But this is no ordinary screen. Instead of one color, it has RGB LEDs, which can change the backlight to a variety of colors. Okay, that in itself may not be all that special, but how you change the colors *is*. Instead of switches, it uses a touch sensor installed in the upper-right corner. That means no holes had to be drilled in the case, so it's a completely seamless and stealth mod. Simply tap the sensor to rotate through the colors, nine in all. It also controls more than just the backlight. You can tap and hold to turn the blue case LEDs on and off. Finally, it'll remember the settings you last used, even if you turn the console off or take the batteries out. I'm told this module was done in partnership with Shawn from the YouTube channel \"sjm4306\", who played a big part in its development. His channel is awesome, by the way. I'll include a link to it down in the description. Overall, this Gameboy is just really well put together. Everything fits great and there are no blemishes or issues with the way parts fit. Backlight installation on these can be tricky, but this one looks perfect! It's exactly what I would expect if I were buying a pre-modded handheld. Roarke offers lots of customization options, and he tells me he's happy to entertain specific requests. A Game Boy modded like the one here goes for about $120 US, which I think is quite reasonably priced compared to others who offer similar services. If you're just interested in that touch sensor module to install yourself, it's available separately for about $20. There's been an increasing demand for retro handhelds, but not everyone is interested in or able to perform the work involved in customizing one. So I think a modded DMG from Roarke's Retro Corner is a great option for someone who maybe doesn't have the time or skills to build one themselves. I owe a big thank you to Roarke for sending this Gameboy my way to review. I'll include a link to his site down in the description. If you like the video, I'd appreciate a thumbs-up and be sure to subscribe. You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram at thisdoesnotcomp, and as always, thanks for watching.",

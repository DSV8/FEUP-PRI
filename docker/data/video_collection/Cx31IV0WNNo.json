    "transcript": "What's up guys. Lew here back with another video, and today... I'm gonna talk about something that I care about. It's very dear to my heart This is the concept of wireless charging It is one of my favorite features on smartphones, YET... So many models still don't include the feature. Today... We're gonna talk specifically about wireless charging for the iPhone, the iPhone... Great phone... So this lil' guy in front of me It's a case, you can live on wireless charging universe like me Let's crack this open... I suppose the benefit is... You also end up with... A case! In this case... You get a case! So a little bit of protection there. And it's from The folks at Spigen. And they make... (Drops on the floor) Fairly reputable cases in the first place Here it is Your favorite, Jack! See this little plating in here that says: \"Wireless charging\"? That's essentialy what's gonna enable This activity. And then this little guy here clicks right into the iPhone And then it's out of your way, you don't notice it The case itself it's available in a couple of different colors So, soft part to touch your phone and hard part to protect it WOW! I think it looks pretty good, like kinda rugged but not too bulky Regular iPhone 6s about to be converted into wireless charging version Easy alright. Now let's maneuver- There you go! Look at that! So, you pull that out.This is all the magid, right here, this little ribbon Up like this In. And that's that Nice and flush, I like that Does it wirelessly charge? Cuz' that what you want! \"Why a lamp Lew?\" Let me break it down for you. This lamp... (Yelling) Isn't like any other lamp! (Yelling) Am I yelling Jack? It's a very special lamp. Which, as far as I know it's the world's first lamp to feature wireless charging Look at that! You see that? I made a video about it! Should I turn on the lamp first? The suspense is kil- Now the lamp is on Moment of truth OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAGHHH Pick it up Jack! Regular iPhone... With a case... And a wireless charging built in Drop it down OOH What planet do I live on? Now... It doesn't even need to be an elaborate wireless charging lamp There are really cheap wireless charging Dock... Station... Platforms. That exists on amazon. Well, I like the lamp As well. Because, well i don't... I like lamps You come home from work Had a rough day... Tough job, the boss, well... He is an a-hole \"You think this place is fun?\" \"Think you're here for your own personal enjoyment?\" That's me as a boss by the way You come home late at night You had a few drinks... I'm not judging ya You're tired The lights are off. Someone is already sleeping in the bed Probably a model Last thing you wanna be worrying about Is your cable This is you now This is the future you. You ready? (Drops the phone) OOH",

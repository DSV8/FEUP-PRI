    "transcript": "- Hey guys Justine and Jenna. Today we are in my kitchen, but we are not baking anything. - Thank goodness. - We're unboxing (groans) a new LG gaming monitor. But that's not it! - But wait, there's more? Where do I put? - A regular-- - Where do I put? - A regular monitor for, oh my goodness, for my regular needs. Super excited to try this one out. Now let's put this back on the ground. So Jenna already unboxed that one, so let's unbox as surprise. This is a gaming monitor, I've been doing a lot of things around this place. I'm redoing my office, I completely painted this entire place, it's super exciting. And we need a new gaming monitor for the gaming office. So-- - This is my left hand and you're using your right. - I'm ambidextrous. - This knife is garbage. - What are you using? That's a cooking knife! We don't use those to unbox! (laughs) You are are a monster! - You haven't provided me with any alternative knife! - (gasps) Any alternative knife. (Justine laughs) - Oh! - Wow! So these are all the things that-- - [Jenna] Put it up. - Okay? - Oh, that's lovely. - [Justin] That is lovely. You raise me up Is that Josh Groban? I am a huge Josh Groban fan. (laughs) - It's an inside joke, you guys weren't here for it. What's happening? - We need that, there's pieces I there, stop. - [Jenna] What's happening? (laughs) - I need to get this out. - Now I have Josh Groban stuck in my head. - Shall we put this on the ground? And take them out as we, let's move this to the ground and then we can lift it out. You raise me (Jenna laughs) - [Justine] You gonna raise my spirits. - That looks, raise your spirits? - Whoa! Oh, it is curved. I've been chatting with LG, I've worked with them in the past and this is so exciting because they were like, we wanna send you some stuff for your new office. And so this is actually a surprise because I didn't even know what they were gonna send. So this is the 34 inch, curved gaming monitor. - This is beautiful, oh I'll help. - This is absolutely massive! - [Jenna] Uh, I'm not helping. - [Justine] Not at all. - I couldn't get my little hand--- - It's okay, this is so nice. - Okay, you hold that, you hold that - Oh my goodness. - 'Kay, don't move - The Lego Movie 2 game is gonna look so great on this. (laughs) This looks so good! (dog barking) That's my dog! - My favorite thing about LG monitors, is how-- (dog barking) loud the dog is. (laughs) Wow the red looks cool. - Oh, it does look cool. (dog barking) Mathew! - [Jenna] Hey. Mathew! - [Jenna] Do you hear? You're getting full named. - You're getting full named, 'cause you're bad boy. - Stop it. - What is your favorite thing about-- - My favorite thing about the LG monitors is how simple it is to put them together. You literally go like this and you give it a little screw in, like it says on the poster behind us. You don't need anything. - Oh yes, look, no tools. - And then, although, me trying to do this by myself on the 34 inch, ultra wide monitor. (laughs) (Justine laughs) I was like, I can do this. (monitor clunks) (Justine gasps) I know. - Oh my goodness. - Ooh, ooh. - This looks so freakin' great. - No way. - No way. - Way. - Maybe I want one of these now too. - Ooh, accessories, so what else comes in the box? - Well, this a power brick. (packaging rustles) We have another power chord. - USB. This is for your cable management. - HDMI. What's this? - [Justine] What's this? - What's this? What's this one? - What's this, hold on - What's this-- - We've go two USB ports, we've got HDMI, two HDMIs and then we have something else that says, do not use. - [Jenna] No way. - Yeah, it says services only. There you go. - There you go. - Take a nice load off. Let's plug in. Whoa! - [Jenna] Oh my goodness. - I need a moment. (laughs) (Jenna sighs) (Justine sighs) I'm gonna get my computer. - Wait, - Where's my dongle because-- - I want one of these monitors. Where are you gonna put this? - I'm going to put it somewhere. 'Kay. - This is, it's gone like this. - Oh my goodness. Let me throw some content over there. Whoa! - Looks gorgeous. - Okay, we're gonna watch one of Johnathan's videos because his videos always look incredible. Super high quality. - [Jenna] Look at this crispy content. - It is super crispy. Now let's see what my un-crispy content looks like. (laughs) - [Jenna] Wow, it's weird, 'cause you're on the screen and you're here. Oh my god. - I'm super excited about this, I will give you guys a little view of it when I have it set up on my desk. But right now we have to open up the other monitor. (upbeat music) - You're so short. Oh god. (box contents clatters) (Justine gasps) Oh god. (Justine yelps) - Oh, I'm falling over, I'm dizzy. - Me too, I-- - Look at this. - Turn this way. Look at this easy, easy. - [Justine] You gotta just get it in there. - I don't wanna hurt you. - Wow! - Oh god. - Okay. So one of the things that I am excited about that Jenna bought up is that it does have Thunderbolt, so this will work really well with your back book or even your iMac Pro. - So this is just the power chord, - Unbelievable. - It's much smaller than, it doesn't have the brick. Also has the joystick button. - (gasps) Look! No way! Oh, - Looks good! - I'm loving this, this is gonna be so great. All right, there's one last thing, I don't what this is, but LG sent this and it has my name on it. So I'm not sure, I have absolutely no idea what's inside of here. (packaging rustles) That's actually my logo, they have my actual logo. Okay, look at this! - Ooh, wait, look at al this mess. - Look at my little name. - That's so shiny and beautiful. - This is cool. (gasps) Whoa, look at this! They're are little, tiny figures. Is this me? This is me, it's got my little name on it. (yelps) This is so cute. - Those are rally cute. This is a very premium box. - This is extremely premium. All right, what is this? - Are those overalls? - I don't know, oh my gosh, it's a birthday gift! Happy birthday Justine, LG OLED TV team has prepared a small gift to celebrate your birthday, we made this jacket with your name written in Korean. - No way! - No way! - [Jenna] That's cool. (Justine gasps) - Oh my gosh and my name is on the sleeve. My name is on the sleeve. Look at this, this is so cute. - [Jenna] This is really cute. - I absolutely love it. - I love the box. - Well, looking forward to setting these up and I'll give you guys an update later. I'm so excited to show you my black office. Maybe I'll give you a little preview, there's nothing in it yet, but some things will be, soon. (electronic music) It's, (chair clatters) I'll do that again. It's all set up, this is such a great monitor, I'm super in love with it. What's great about this monitor is it's USB-C and it's Thunderbolt, so I can just plug this directly in to my laptop and here we are. We're here ready to edit. So let's open up some final cut. This looks really great, I love having this much screen real estate, look at this timeline, look at this time, would you look at this timeline. I wonder if I could just like? (chair clunks) Oh, I'm lounging now. If anybody really saw what, this is all you're seeing it, this is what I'm usually like. There's a new version of software for my Earbuds, that are ready to download. I'm so excited to edit on this, I haven't got a chance to set up my gaming area yet. That's going to be coming pretty soon, so I'll looking forward to showing you guys where that new monitors gonna go. Gotta a lot of stuff happening right now, here's a sneak peak. Just give them a look quick like, just give them real quick look in there, just like a real quick look. Okay, yeah, you're done, you're done, you're done, you're done, you're done, you're done. So excited about redoing my office, I can't wait to show you guy, that will be coming very soon. I know, I basically have this really terrible problem of when I get something absolutely perfect, just how I like, I like to destroy it and and completely start over. Which is what I did with this place. So look for all those fun things coming soon, if you guys have any suggestions for things that you like to see me make videos about, leave those in the comments below. And I'll see you guys in the next video, bye.",

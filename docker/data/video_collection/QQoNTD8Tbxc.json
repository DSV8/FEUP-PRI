    "transcript": "hello everyone i'm Dmitry with Hardware Canucks and recently we got our participate in a fantastic collaboration featuring some of the tech tubers from canada from the GTA toronto area which was so awesome and tell us to experience the new Samsung Galaxy s7 phone as an entertainment device given it's too fantastic elements of beautiful screen and it's water resistant features so make sure to stay until the end of the video to learn how you can win a brand new Galaxy s7 and so we get to hang out with Carl coonrod Matt Moniz can nuptse and Patrick from mobile syrup and just the you're there an awesome bunch and Eva was there and with me to participate in the s7 showdown and capture our angle of the entire adventure and so we were first inside the telus store and Eaton Centre Toronto to shoot the introduction for the main video where all of us were encouraged to bash on other contestants to create this competitive atmosphere and it was really awesome to see everyone in their element with creating this video I do not win today's challenge Ivan be sorely disappointed with myself everyone's looking pretty soft so I better come out on top I'd need breakfast I normally don't eat breakfast so what I do and I like to think that I'm known for fighting wasting integrate my cat into my reviews today we're here I'm gonna crush these guys in our major competition I've been training my whole entire life for this day he jumps I'm going down and so after we were done inside the telus store in Toronto it was time to hit the streets and then over to the headquarters of tellus which was just a few a few blocks away and this is where things get a bit interesting where we get to take out the s7s shoot our journey on our walk experience slow-mo and hyperlapse and at one point during our walk there was a beautiful view of the CN Tower we're just passing by was Front Street and I started recording in slow motion trying to reach for the CN Tower and this is what happened to this batch is a little bit hot there you see it yeah yeah and then right over here as a scuff so once we get inside the tower this is where the elevator of youtubers looks like close walk over there is also me around hiding before talking to a camera so you just pray that up in this video now so the first challenge but the s7 showdown is navigating the oily with the s7 which was actually a lot of fun and you have to go through an obstacle course as you get water gun by three other people so we were outside of this challenge which proved to test our Canadian business because it was cold and we were eventually about to get wet but that is the track behind this I'm going to try to use the oly is the finish line which is right behind me here remember those the fastest get the old look he is wet so now I'm wet but I'm the only one that got it through that ramp into the pit that's right so after we were done there we went up to the 30th for which had such an awesome view and holy crap the auto focus on the s7 is absolutely amazing it literally just snaps and focus not just for pictures but for video as well so the next challenge for us is to wear the gear VR play some creepy VR demo walk through this little obstacle course with the desks as our teammates helped out with directions on where to move and how to navigate across these tables which will be changed for with every new run and in the very end look what we got we got a nice friendly panda you can give it a hug whatever else villa and so that is a wrap until tomorrow morning and so after we're finished with the first two challenges the next morning we got to do a little bit of work out bright and early 7am we want to pursuit OCR which is a fantastic adult obstacle course so there's a bunch of ropes lots of bars you can climb on and everything and a really good way to test out to see if you know you think you're out of shape which I thought I wasn't but it turns out I am you know maybe perhaps it's because Carl standing there and just looking really buff and you know maybe me standing right next to Carl may not be so good for consonants so much movement yeah but you look good you've got a good shoes and a nice shirt yes and so after we completed all of our runs I came in third which is not bad you know right in the middle there I'm the median in this group but it was awesome for tells to encourage this type of athletic involvement and throw a little bit physical reality into my face which was needed who's definitely needed and to wrap up this entire experience with the giveaway is a fantastic way to finish off the s7 showdown it's been great collaborating with our Canadian content producers and tell us and tell us awesome involvement from you guys in 2015

    "description": "Watch the FIRST VIDEO HERE:  The Drone I use in this video:   This cabin was built 20 years ago by my Grandpa (Jerry) and from day one it has been infested with mice. There are a few reasons for the mice. One... the cabin is in the middle of nowhere in a field. So mice are all over the place. But two, my grandpa used reclaimed wood that had some holes in it that allowed mice to expand and make into comfortable little homes for themselves.  Well... WE wanted to use the cabin too. So we took it back this summer with a four day renovation project that sealed up all the holes and got rid of all the mouse skeletons.

    "transcript": "[Music playing] So weve been hiking for about 30 minutes now, through snow thats probably about 2-2 feet deep, so we have to use these things called snow shoes which kind of disperse our weight across the snow and make it a little bit easier to walk. Right now were heading up to Grandpa Jerrys cabin, which is my grandpa. And this is Jerrys daughter right here, who just so happens to be my mom. And were going to go check on the cabin, because if you remember about 6 months ago, back when it was warmer and not snowing outside, I came here and we mouse-proofed it because the mice had been taking over for the last 20 years and we kind of wanted our cabin back. So lets go check it out. [Music playing] So last summer we took 4 days and completely sealed up the cabin from any mice entries possible. And so now were going to go in because its winter and mice like warm things just like anybody else, and were going to see if theyve reclaimed any territory. So one thing that theyve done since I was here last is they put in new flooring. So this is some kind of vinyl flooring that they laid down. Remember when I was here in that last video we just had the cement. We ripped up all the carpet and then put the carpet outside. And I think this vinyl stuff is working out pretty well. It looks really good with the cabin. So this is that back room. This is where I had the cut out of drywall. So they painted over that and it looks like they added some texturing too. We got the baseboard I dont think I touched the baseboard at all when I pulled that piece of drywall out to check for the mice. And then over here inside of the bathroom, this is where we had the biggest problem and we didnt actually seal this up yet because we put the concrete, we sealed up that hole that lead to the outside. And then we pulled out some of the ceiling. We pulled out the shower. We left that out because this was like the worst spot because we werent going to seal it up until we were sure all the mice were gone. We have some of our leftover construction supplies. And I dont see any sign of mice droppings yetmouse droppingswhatever you call them. And here is a mouse trap we left inside of the house to see if there are any more mice coming inwith peanut butter. Mice actually like peanut butter side note. And there are zero mice inside the trap. So this mouse trap works by the mice going inside of that little hole right there, and they can walk up that ramp, but as soon as they are inside they can squeeze themselves out this side of the hole where the ramp kind of goes down like that. They squeeze themselves through, get the bait, and then they just cant get back out again. So if you remember in the last mouse trap, this thing was just full of dead mice. Which means, I think we were successful. That 4 days of renovation got rid of all the mice. We were victorious, we reclaimed our territory, and theyre not coming back. They repainted all of this. Over here we had to pull out some of the wall because we found a hole from the outside coming in. And so right here it looks like we got to touch up that plug a little bit. But this has all been repainted. Inside of the closet looks good, and we have the fireplace here and this is where we had a bunch of leaks coming out of the ceiling. They were just kind of like running down the back. And youll have to watch that other video to kind of understand some of what Im talking about. But we took down all the drywall up here and all the way down the back side of it, all the way down around the base. And it looks like there is no more leaking out of the top of there which is good. Ill have to fly my drone around the roof of the cabin and see if that black stuff is still solid. I can get my drone pretty close to it and its in 4K so we can zoom in pretty far. Ill put that footage here and we can check the actual black water proofing stuff around that base. So this is that ladder I watched my grandpa build back when I was a little kid. Its got little handholds here that you can climb up. And this is the attic with that carpet I showed you outside on the fence in the last video. This is the attic area. Were probably just going to throw away these mattresses. They were back in here when the mice were overrunning the cabin. So one fun little trick, if you have chocolate covered cookies - these are actually called Tim Tams - and you bite off either side of the end, you can use it as a straw. And then the whole cookie gets soggy. So good! I think the flooring option is actually a really good choice. Weve got a little bit of carpet here, there are just like the carpet squares. And then the vinyl flooring, it is more of like a plastic instead of an actual piece of wood, so its going to last a lot longer. We can sweep it, and plus if snow gets on it, its not going to be damaged very easily like normal wood would. Ha! Wood would. So if you remember one of the main entries for the mice was underneath this wood pile, like they were getting in under that shower. And you can still see at the base of the house here, we have that wire grate and we have the sealant that we have sticking it to the concrete. And then one of the other big entry points was right here on this corner. And it looks like were still solid. No holes. Looks like the mice havent been able to get in anywhere. So I think we were successful. So if you wonder why the heck we were using snow shoes that whole time, its because when youre walking in the snow without them you go up to your knees, and thats not very easy to walk in. Snow shoes make it so much easier. So I think operation save the cabin was a complete success. Super stoked about it. If you go back and watch that other video, we were finding mice in the walls, in the ceilings, mice droppings everywhere. It was insane. So Im super glad that we were able to take back the cabin and now its safe and sanitary for everyone to use. And by everyone, I mean my family. So thanks for watching this follow up video. Its definitely good to know that all our hard work paid off. I think Jerry would be pleased with the jerry-rigging that weve done with this cabin. Hit that thumbs up if you enjoyed this and if you want to see more projects like this in the future. Thanks a ton for watching and Ill see you around. [Music playing]",

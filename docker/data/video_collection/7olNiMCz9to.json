    "transcript": "[ The comments being read snarkily ] ...the rest of that comment was really insightful, thanks for sharing. OK, could I have been a little more clear? Ill show you Sonys system later on, but if you Yes. Yes I could have. But, this is in fact later on, so perhaps maybe we shouldnt jump to conclusions so quickly. Tell you what, Ill work on being a little more precise in my choice of words. And perhaps you, dear viewer, could refrain from jumping to conclusions quite so quickly. If we put our minds to it, together, we can enhance our understanding through complex thought both on the part of the speaker, and on the part of the listener. And thats how the world gets better Alright, this video is coming at you in three parts. As we discussed in the last video-- NO WAIT, wait wait wait. The ding was way too loud, lets tone it down. [ Ding sound from Jeopardy! ] Much better. So as we discussed in the last video, were gonna take a look at some of the waveforms coming from the components of this Magnavox (which is really a rebadged Philips because Philips couldnt use that name in the US due to its passing similarity to Philco, I guess, but thats a stretch) CD player. That will be part one. In part 2, well take a look at a Sony laser pickup and discuss the differences. Plus I will tear this one apart to expose the laser diode and photodiodes. And in Part 3, well discuss why Sonys pickup solution would become the default standard, used to this day in optical drives. Well begin with Part 1. And Part 1 will be quite a bit different from most other videos. Thats because much of it is unscripted. Off the cuff. Just gonna wing it. Yeah. But first, a few corrections. As usual, the Internet has provided answers that I did not find, and has revealed some mistakes and false assumption from the last video. Of course. But thats OK, we all make mistakes, and now Im gonna tell you what we learned thanks to the diligent research of more knowledgeable people than me. Remember its OK to not know everything. And its OK to ask for advice from professionals. And thats h-- Let me reveal the most dumb mistake, and it was right on screen. The best kind of mistake. I had been assuming that pin 10 was the output signal from the focus chip, and that it would be a binary stream from the pits and lands. Boy was that wrong on many counts. First, its not pin 10 that does that, its pin 3. And its labeled right here on the datasheet. Pin 3 is also labeled to decoder, which I missed, and most importantly its a sum of the outputs from all 4 photodiodes as illustrated right here. Yes pin 10 also gets the sum of the 4 diodes, but unlike pin 10, pin three has an amplifier, equalizer, and another amplifier to boost the output. Hm hmmm. I want to give a big thanks and shoutout to Zim0256 who not only created the helpful diagram that I used on a few occasions but who also gave more complete info on what is going on. The Motorola processor is a custom chip based around an HC08 microcontroller, and it is in fact the decoder that is doing most of the work. I couldnt find its datasheet because the P on the end was limiting my search results. And to think, we just learned about minding our ps and qs. Anyway, in fact the decoder is handling all the raw data; undoing the eight-to-fourteen modulation, isolating the subcode, and all that. It even digitizes the output from pin 3, which at this point is still analog which well see in a moment. It sends the extracted subcode to the processor so it knows how to handle the disc and respond to user requests. Really, the processor is just managing the living and breathing tasks of the machine, such as the user interface, display, and other goodies like popping the disc tray in and out and getting the whole process going. Speaking of the disc tray, a few people had asked how the machine can tell that the disc tray has been pushed in manually as opposed to someone hitting the open/close button. Some other people noticed this strange button switch near the decoder. These two groups of people are discussing the same thing. To the right of the disc tray is a little series of levers that rest on top of this button when its assembled. Little nubs on the bottom of the tray will cause this to push down on the button in either the open or closed position. This not only tells the processor that the tray has reached the end of its travel in either direction, but it also means that it can detect if the tray has been pushed in, as the button will be released (and thus the switch opened) as soon as the tray is moved out of its open position. OK, its time for the script to be put to the side. Ive got a sort of odd setup here, because I need to see both the oscilloscope screen and what Im poking on the board, so were gonna do some picture-in-picture editing magic and throw the scope screen up high. Excellent! And you know what, maybe well throw another camera up here so you can see what Im doing. Even better. All the cameras! All the tripods! Well this is awkward. Itll have to do. As promised, were gonna poke around on some of the things here! Now I brought my laptop here so I can actually go and look and see what Im looking at, and youll notice these, uh, wires that Ive soldered onto chips underneath. Ill bring up the image of that. Part of the issue with this player is that it has to be--the ribbon cable between the drive and the board is very very short, and theres pretty much no way to operate this unless its assembled. I really dont know how people would service these things, cause it, ya know a lot of the a lot of the stuff that I wanna see is underneath the CD reader like the, uh, the tracking and focus chips are basically directly under here. Thats not helpful. But we can see what else we can take a look at. I did find, just from poking--at one point I found the raw datastream. I think it was one of these guys. Unfortun what is happening here? Oh. Well this is kind of interesting, whats uh I wonder whats on this line, lets see if I can figure it out. Notice that were on a really long time scale. I think this is the subcode. If I can hopefully get the... trigger Im...eurgh Im really...have no experience with a scope. So, just. Just so ya know. Lets try Oops thats what I meant. Thats what I meant! The other way Oh! Its probably you, OK. Yep, OK. Ha ha! I found it! So this here is the waveform thats coming from the amplifier chip from the au, from uh the TDA8808T augh that one, that one. So this, this is the amplified output of the oops, of the pits and lands. So this is the raw analog signal coming from the disc. And if we look a little closer you can see if I touch the disc see how thats Oh. Well Ive killed it. Great. Great job! So if I kinda just touch it you can see the--it slows down a bit. Let me zoom out a bit. Oop--zoom out a bit. See that? It just completely--it gave up there. That click sound you heard I believe is the laser kicking up all the way. But yeah so this--this isnt the raw output from the photodiodes but this is the amplified output coming from pin 3, going to the decoder. The output from the photodiodes is very very small, this is if we take a look and compare the voltage level theres almost nothing there. And its so noisy I cant see anything. These all should be the same. Theres nothing there. Which is a shame because I really wanted to show you that! Oh well. Wanted to show you some interesting stuff, and I think that we saw some interesting things but not as many as I was hoping. Well, with that disappointing segment out of the way, lets move on to the part that I didnt forget about. To see how Sony handled the optical system differently, we need to get our hands on a Sony CD player, hopefully of similar vintage to this Philips one. Oh perfect, a Sony CD changer from 1992! Now it doesnt really matter that its a changer, theres still a standard CD mechanism in here, its just on a pivot and will happily pop up and fall down to greet or say farewell to the disc it plays. It works in tandem with the disc tray, which rather than just being an inny-outty operation, its an inny-outty with rotational flair. Now I embarked on the frightening task of getting this mechanism out of this player. Armed only with an ordinary screwdriver, I went hamfisted and started unscrewing stuff, before I realized I hadnt filmed the close up segments of the laser tracking a disc. After undoing what I had begun, I began once more. The screws are the enemy! Be gone! Or, be twisted counterclockwise sufficiently until such time that they can be gone! Having gained unrestricted access to our prize, I loosened the four screws holding it in place. But it wouldnt budge. Yet more screws needed liberation, until finally I had successfully removed the crown jewel from the temple of forbidden technology. And, uh, here it is. One of the big differences youll see between this and the Philips mechanism is everything is much more integrated. In fact this one chip here, if the datasheet I found is at all correct (link below) has 32 k of RAM built in, does the EFM demodulation as well as the CIRC error correction, handles the focus, tracking, and spindle motor (using this chip as a driver to handle the power), extracts the subcode, provides a data output for the DAC, and can even do such exotic things as double-speed playback and variable pitch playback (assuming the player its inside has those functions enabled). Did I mention its bilingual? Its interesting how just 4 years time managed to integrate functions that are spread out via multiple chips on this Philips machine into just this one chip on the board of the laser pickup. But that makes a lot of sense. See, this Philips board only works with one mechanism. Because its driver components are part of the main board design, anything but a Philips CDM4 pickup wont work without at least some modification. But for the Sony machine, this ribbon cable is essentially just proving a power, ground, a communication bus to the CPU, and a datastream for the DAC. This component can be completely redesigned, and so long as it accepts the same inputs and produce the same outputs, the main board really wont care. This allows Sony to make production improvements and even radical changes to this mechanism and how it works without disturbing the main board. You can see how Sony played a modular approach via the markings on the board. This one board was used in many different players, with different components marked FOR X player only. By my count it was used in at least 5 players. Really, Sonys markings are just a lot more helpful. Wondering which one of these is the DAC? Hey look, its labeled right here. And youll find a PULSE chip on the bottom. Im pretty sure these are 1-bit DACs, based on some vague research. Im sure someone will correct me if Im wrong, and Im counting on it. And the fact that theyve labeled these jumper connections on the top of the board for what they are sure is helpful. That wouldve been nice, PHILIPS. Anyway, back to the laser because thats the real difference. First, gone is the swing-arm. Instead, the laser is mounted on a sled, which moves linearly with the help of this rack and pinion drive. Now, you might suspect that this drive arrangement does not have the precision to track the disc. The floating arm of the Philips system means it can move subtly and precisely to track an off-center disc. But this brutal, inelegant plastic gear train cant possibly be used for the tracking. And it isnt. Just like the Philips system, this lens is floating and can move up and down. But unlike the philips system, this lens can also move left and right. With the help of a diode I have laying around, you can see that the laser can move quite a bit to either side. Lets take off this plastic shroud to get a better look. Ah this one is perfect for showing this. Yes. OK, Im sure you can see these rectangular coils surrounding a vertical structure. These coils will push the lens upward if a voltage is passed through them. But if you look very carefully, youll also see a pair of circular coils on the outer edges. When a voltage is applied to these, depending on the polarity it will attract itself to these handy magnets placed on the sides, or it will push itself away. This causes the lens to pivot either left or right, depending on which way you slice it. The best part of this setup is that the lens is completely independent of the sled that its riding on. If the sled moves a bit, it doesnt care--it will just react to that movement as though the track of pits its... tracking has moved slightly. That means that the sled only has to move in coarse steps, and the lens will take care of the rest. But thats just one significant difference. The other is in the photodiode arrangement. You may have seen the term THREE-BEAM LASER TRACKING before. Or something like that. In these systems, rather than using only four photodiodes like in the Philips system, we use six. In the middle are four cells arranged actually exactly like the Philips system. These are used in an identical fashion for focus--an elliptical reflection indicates an out-of-focus beam, and its orientation indicates if focus is near or far. But to correct tracking errors, two additional diodes to either side are monitoring for an off-center beam. In these systems, a diffraction grating splits the laser beam into three. In reality it splits it into infinite beams of increasingly weak intensity as they deviate from the center but we only care about the center beam and the two immediately surrounding it. Now, when tracked correctly, the outside beams shouldnt land on the stream of pits. They should instead land just outside of them, which will thus cause them to reflect the featureless boundaries. The reason this works to track the stream is that if the track deviates, suddenly one of the tracking diodes will start seeing the datastream. Thats not supposed to happen, so the player will react by nudging the lens in the direction of the activated tracking diode. This system is certainly more complex on the hardware side, but given how simple the trigger is--no need to compare ratios, simply see if a single thing is happening--its probably a lot easier to implement. However, this make me wonder if this system is fundamentally worse at tracking discs. See, Ive heard anecdotal evidence that the original Philips single-beam tracking is superior at tracking scratched or damaged discs. And with the knowledge of how the three-beam tracking works, that kind of makes sense. Imagine a scratch appears just next to the datastream. If that scratch is bad enough, it might bend one of the tracking beams towards the raw datastream, causing the lens to deflect for a defect that isnt really there. With the Philips system, it wouldnt see this scratch because it only has the one scanning beam. It would ignore it and thus be unaffected. Now of course, these conventional systems arent remarkably inferior. They can tolerate scratches pretty well, too. But it makes me wonder if there is truth to the anecdote that the swing-arm servo, Philips single beam tracking whatever is indeed superior. One last thing before we answer why this became the standard. Im not afraid to tear this apart and find what inside. So first, you can see the actual laser diode here as opposed to the Philips machine where its housed in this plastic. This, like in the Philips setup, projects the light sideways where it hits a prism, get shot up at the disc surface (which the floating lens helps to keep tracked and focused) and it gets reflected back, goes straight through the prism, and lands on this little chip here. Now this is interesting, because on this machine we can actually see the backside of the photodiode array, unlike on the Philips machine where we could only see the board. If I keep going to remove the lens and get everything apart, you can see the prism in here. Take a look, it does a great job of reflecting light at a 90 degree angle. And now, lets see what we can see of the photodiodes. Well, dont get your hopes up--they are pretty much microscopic. To be fair, we are dealing with laser light focused on microscopic pits, so its stands to reason that these are probably pretty small. I dont have a microscope handy --yet-- but I do have my ridiculous macro lens setup so I could get these extreme closeups. You can definitely see that these are three clusters, with one used for data capture and focus control, and the two to either side for tracking. To show how small this is, Ive placed a dime next to it for scale. For a more International perspective, how about a micro SD card? And just for fun, heres the point of a safety pin. These really are tiny. So now, why did Sonys floating lens and stepping platform become the de facto method of reading optical discs? With more photodiodes and greater mechanical complexity, you might think it to be inefficient. Well it may be inefficient in some ways, but in most ways its in fact much more efficient. First, lets take size. If we look at the Philips system, youll notice that the entire laser pickup is essentially behind the disc. The pivot point for the swing arm has to be farther to the rear of the player, otherwise it would simply rotate around the circumference of the disc, and that wouldnt be very helpful. This off the bat limited its potential to miniaturize. And boy, did this get smaller quickly. Portable CD players burst on the scene in 1984. And they would only continue to get smaller, with one CD player featured by Techmoan actually being smaller than a CD. And that was in 1988, the same year as this Philips machine was made! In fact, this very mechanism is larger than it needs to be. If these parts were shifted downward, it could be no longer than the distance here. And this laser platform could get smaller. And smaller. And smaller. Until eventually youre into modern slim drives for PCs which have the tiniest of lenses and thinnest of assemblies. And the PC market would only continue to make this Philips system harder to justify. In fact, one fatal flaw of the Philips reader would make sure it fizzled into obscurity: its mass. Imagine in a portable player, which can be set in any position, or even moved around while playing, that it had this swinging laser pickup. Its so loosey-goosey that its doubtful it will track very well. And its mass also limits how quickly it can move. When CD-ROM drives appeared, and getting faster and faster and faster, the laser would have to be able to wiggle itself back and forth at frequencies in excess of 10 kilohertz. Thats easy if youre just wiggling at small piece of plastic back and forth, but a lot harder if youre wiggling this big swinging thing. And so, Sonys three-beam laser tracking would be miniaturized and improved over the years. Developments in anti-skip functionality meant that CD walkmen could be tossed around without fear of skipping or glitches, or getting stuck repeating a bit of the track. That was accomplished simply by reading the disc at faster than normal speeds, creating an intermediary data buffer between the disc and the processor. The DAC could have upwards of 40 seconds at its disposal for the laser to get back on track and resume the datastream. Which, thanks to the timecode, is easy to piece together if a problem does arise, thus eliminating the effects of skipping. And of course, later on the wavelength of light would change to red, packing the pits closer together and creating the MUSE high definition laserdisc. And then later the DVD, an obscure digital video format you might have heard of. Later wed say, enough with the red, in with the blue and wed be packing upwards of 25 gigabytes onto a slightly different silver plastic thing, after we briefly reenacted the videotape format wars of the 1980s. Because why not. But were getting ahead of ourselves. Theres lots more to talk about. When we next check in on optical disc technology, well discuss the Yellow Book, the standard published in 1988 that defines the specifications of the CD-ROM. Then well talk about some writable disc technologies like CD-R and CD-RW, and then, if interests persists, we might dig a little deeper into the DVD and some of the follies of its development. Such as how this logo mysteriously features a disc for a solid state memory format. Hmm. Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed the video! If you missed the first two videos on the Compact Disc, you can check them out in the playlist on Digital Sound that will quietly pop up above me. So serene. As always, a great big thank you to every who supports this channel on Patreon, especially the fine folks that are scrolling up your screen. If youre interested in pledging some support to the channel to help it grow, please check out my Patreon page. Thanks for your consideration, and Ill see you next time! [ everyones favorite, gloriously tacky music plays ] Hey one thing, my most viral video to date was about how Sony used the tracking servos in a CD player to create the copy protection scheme in the original Playstation. You might want to check that video out, but be warned that there are a number of annoying things about the flow of information over there. It goes into a lot of detail about the PlayStation and some of its history, and the comments on there (if you dare to look at them) indicate that many people were not happy about it. So if you havent seen it, check it out, and apologies in advance. Ha, and another thing! So if you didnt know, theres a second channel - Technology Connections 2 - where I upload weird stuff from time to time. And I just uploaded a video of a couple of CD players that are very similar but have some unique differences.

    "description": "The MetallicGear Neo Pro might look a lot like an Apple Mac Pro but there's a reason for that:  the cheese grater design actually increases airflow while also decreasing fan noise.  Meanwhile the MetallicGear Matrix uses a unique ARGB light panel on its front that looks amazing without adding much cost.    A special thanks to Phanteks, Thermaltake, be quiet! and Razer.

    "transcript": "I mean easily this is my pocket mm-hmm well hello good people I'm Dimitri and let's check out what metallicgear has to offer in the new year and as usual big thanks to our sponsors Razer Phanteks be quiet and thermaltake for making CES 2020 possible 2020 my friends is going to be I feel like is going to be inspired by what Apple has recently launched and this is the neo pro obviously this is going to be called maybe the cheese grater case and this is something that we've seen mock-ups of in the past from previous companies and now we have that from metallicgear which is the budget brand powered by Phanteks and this is something that I'm personally really excited about because this mesh isn't just for looks of course the aesthetic element is part of it but airflow and silence are two so the mesh is actually quite large in terms of letting air through but the way this mesh is designed it's also blocking out a lot of the noise don't worry about the dust there is a dust filter it sits behind the cheesegrater plate as you can see it's a fine mesh so it is very nice for airflow it will catch any dust that passes through the cheesegrater front and we have a pretty capable interior with the neo pro that can house an ATX motherboard we have dual 120 s and 140 Miller fan support at the front we have a dual hard drive cage in the front as well that you can pull out goods for SSDs and hard drive cages these cases will be included with a rear exhaust fan and 120 mil and for $59 this looks like a really good budget solution that actually looks pretty sick both in silver and black models as for the AO is pretty standard dual USB threes audio jacks power and reset buttons the frames are based on the newest Island design but without the top fan mounts but we still have a nice tgd mount without the thumb screws on the side now they've been relocated to the rear so the whole side is beautiful and like for $59 this yeah I would rock this a really good budget option if you want that whole mac pro look nice affordable system - and this is the new matrix as you can see the matrix in the front is pretty cool we have seen similar designs from in wind but unfortunately those cases were really expensive so the new matrix surprise surprise given metallicgear's budget orientation is $89 so actually pretty affordable if you're going for something that looks this different in this unique I have asked them about how many effects and presets will be included and they told me many they will be money to satisfy your digital argb goodness in terms of tempered glass we have the side mount just like on the neo pro that also has a thumb screw at the back for that clean aesthetic and the front panel here is also glass it's not plastic so don't worry about scratching that whole thing also the airflow here is a little bit more restrictive versus the probe but they have spaced out the panels so that we have reasonable air flow coming into the case given what this case is designed for then your matrix does have this hole ventilation up top more budget-friendly orientation dual 120 mounts and the same i/o as the neo pro dual USB threes and your color buttons so you can cycle between different presets all through physical buttons this does not have software which is something that we actually appreciate I was asking to see if there'll be like a clock version where you can see what time it is if you see any emails notifications whatever nope none of that it's all physical based and let's just change up some color laughs hello I mean the actual color and the uniformity of each individual square is absolutely beautiful this is what I would expect for an $89 case hmm now that you know about neo cases the neo Pro and new matrix you might want to spice up your case with neon LED strips and these have launched already last year you can use these flexible LED strips to potentially highlight things like your motherboard to potentially highlight certain other areas of your enclosure this is really interesting so check this out this is a 90-degree little connector that you could potentially mount to a motherboard standoff or a fan so you have a little bit of flexibility on where they actually go giving you these sort of beautiful right angle connectors for these LED strips and in this particular case highlighting this motherboard very well and I like that there they don't look perfect because they almost look like those neon lights that you actually would see on the street and they're never perfect like for example this little run is not exactly straight and I think that gives you a little bit of a character for the case they are available in different lengths which is cool so you can customize depending on what hardware you want to highlight if you cool things over here as you can cut the actual strip to length depending on what you want or you can also daisy chain them because they all have the initial tip and the end tip into which you can connect and daisy chain multiple strips they start at $14.99 all the way up to 2199 a pretty cool way to customize the interior of your system or the exterior whatever your heart desires and this my friends is the exterior example using those neon strips right besides something that I did not expect to see at fantex is the new evolve sound bar these are still in prototype stages but they have evolved from the evolved sound mini that we saw at Computex but that looked like the evolved speakers and these are kind of after the evolve shift and the shift X enclosure which is something really cool they can be stacked together like this in stereo mode they can be also used individually in a soundbar profile if you're after that because they can be placed down I did not expect to see speakers from fantex I guess you didn't either they sound pretty good nice base profile obviously a RGB two that connect to the system you can fully customize and sync what you have on the interior of the sound bar to what you have on the actual enclosure I guess we're there I guess we're there a RGB speakers yeah alright good people that is it from metallicgear and some additional Phantek's goodies in the suite let us know if you want us to review this actually really want to thanks so much for watching we'll talk to you in the next video",

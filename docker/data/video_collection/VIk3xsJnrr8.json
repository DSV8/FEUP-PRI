    "transcript": "- Welcome back. I'm James Strieb, your host for... (snickers) This is stupid. Linus took our spot, so now we have to do this. You like curtains? (chuckles) - [Riley] This looks great! - NVIDIA is buying Arm for a reported $40 million. If you're not familiar with it, Arm is a big company. They're the company behind the architecture that powers the processors inside the most popular smartphones, and even some supercomputers! Although NVIDIA is better known to many consumers as the maker of gaming GPUs, (laughs) they've also invested heavily in artificial intelligence systems like their autonomous vehicle platform. This acquisition of Arm could help NVIDIA become a leader in the AI space, as it foresees its partnership with Arm as a way to gets its technology into smartphones and IoT devices, which are increasingly using on-device machine learning. Think about how your current phone might use AI to enhance the photos you take, because your normal ones suck. - [Riley] Oh, I see. - You're a good person. The merger should be finalized within a year and a half, and NVIDIA says it'll still license Arm technology to a broad range of customers, even if they don't wear leather jackets. - [Riley] That's nice of them. - TikTok may have found new life in the United States, as reports indicate that they've agreed to partner with Oracle, based out of California. The U.S. government had originally threatened to ban TikTok because of national security concerns due to the fact that it was owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, and not necessarily because of the thottery on there is off the charts. (Riley whistles) - I mean... - [Riley] It's stratospheric! - Since then, TikTok has been searching for an American buyer, and although Microsoft and Walmart and Google were all in the mix for a while, those talks reportedly broke down. Oracle isn't as well known in the consumer side of things as the companies mentioned, as they typically sell their products more to large businesses than individual consumers, but the deal could help Oracle's branding, and the company has stated it anticipates creating a 20,000 new jobs-a in the United States. (laughs) - [Riley] Wait. 20,000? - That's a lotta jobs. For some reason I'm picturing TikTok command center, like what they have at NASA, except all the screens show meme videos. - [Riley] Sir! - And they're all- - [Riley] There's a developing meme off the starboard bow! - Look at this portrait mode monitor! Starboard bow, hooah! We've already seen a lotta phones that try to do something more interesting with their screen than just have it be just that standard, flat, candy bar shape, and LG have unveiled another take on this trend. Called the LG Wing, it has two OLED screens, one stacked on top of the other. The top one looks conventional enough, but you can rotate it 90 degrees to reveal a second, smaller screen underneath, with the whole thing resembling the letter T. LG calls this Swivel Mode and apparently has big plans for it, such as using it for camera controls when you're taking a picture. It's like a built-in selfie stick. - [Riley] Ah! - Hmm. Though of course there has to be actual developer support if we want to see the future really take off. It's a cool idea though, LG. Thank you. You would do well to remember though that putting a second screen on something doesn't mean people will automatically rush out and buy it. Remember the Wii U? - [Riley] Don't- - Exactly. - [Riley] D'oh. - I never saw one in real life. - [Riley] Really? (James snickers) - Now it's time for the Quick Bits, brought to you by the Drop Sennheiser HD 6XX headphones. That's double X, baby. With over 60,000 sold, they're one of Drop's all-time bestsellers, and for good reason. You get the same drivers from the HD 650 for natural bass and balanced midrange, plus a detachable six-foot cable with a 1/8-inch plug for everyday use. It also comes with a 1/4-inch adapter for when you need it, and it's all backed by Sennheiser's long-term support. Click the link below and join the Drop right now. Name one bit that's better than the Quick Bits, huh? I'll wait. You can't! (chuckles) A massive data leak from Razer has exposed customer addresses, contact information and order details. Good thing I don't buy their crap. - [Riley] Okay. - Just jokin'. I don't, but... Fortunately, there were no passwords or credit card data in the leak, but hackers could use the info to reach out to victims with phishing scams and actually sound believable because they have their order information, so if you ordered anything from Razer, you might wanna read every email using this face. - [Riley] Yeah, that'll work. - Wait a second, this just in: AMD has just released the designs of their RX 6000 graphics cards inside of \"Fortnite\"? - [Riley] Huh? - God damn you, 2020. The Twitter announcement was enough, okay? You can go onto the Creative Island in \"Fortnite\" and check it what it looks like. It looks like a normal graphics card. - [Riley] It's got three fans! - [James] Wow. - [Riley] Whoa. - [James] I guess we're gonna have to wait until October 20th? - [Riley] 8. - 28th, October 28th, for the real announcement. Wow. There's nothing on this paper. (chuckles) The Oculus Quest 2 has leaked in an official promo video. An officially leaked promo video. It doesn't quite confer much except the physical design and the fact that it's been upgraded from a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 to a Snapdragon XR2, which is designed specifically for AR and VR hardware. It's also got 6 gigabytes of RAM, up from 4, and an almost-4K display, which means nearly 2K per eye. - [Riley] So close. - Too many air quotes. Ah, okay, more details are expected at Facebook Connect on September 16th, like the device's refresh rate and whether or not we'll need to let Mark Zuckerberg eat our souls in order to use it. - [Riley] My guess is: yes. - He's got a big tummy. Microsoft's xCloud streaming service is set to go live tomorrow, and there's a pleasant surprise for those of us who are planning to take advantage of it. More than 150 Xbox games will be available to play, up from the 100 originally reported. It's certainly good news, though unfortunately \"Flight Simulator\" isn't on the list. I mean, nothing says realistic flight like trying to look at a 747 cockpit through a tiny phone screen, but hey, woulda been nice, okay? And U.S. Customs has some egg on its face today after putting out a press release about how it seized a large shipment of counterfeit Apple AirPods at JFK Airport in New York. Problem is it doesn't look like they were fake AirPods at all. Instead, Customs and Border Protection tweeted out photos of what appear to be actual OnePlus Buds. So if you thought I was a jerk in my review on ShortCircuit of those and you said, \"Just because they have stems doesn't mean they're ripoffs of Apple,\" hah, you're wrong. I was right. - [Riley] What? - They are totally blatant ripoffs and the government agrees with me, okay boomer. So that's our show. Tune in next week, when we will have our regular set back. And why do I have two cameras? It's weird. - [Riley] Two is better than one. - I'll just look in the middle of them. Goodbye, everyone. - [Riley] Don't do this, James.",

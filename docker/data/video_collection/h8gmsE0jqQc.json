    "transcript": "- This may look like your typical 17-inch PowerBook G4, but nope, it's a rare prototype. And we're gonna explore today. (upbeat music) Hey, guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken, and I have before me a prototype of the first 17-inch PowerBook G4, the PowerBook5,1. The first PowerBook G4 17-inch came out in 2003, and Apple made 17-inch computers for several years after that. And the final 17-inch notebook product Apple made was the MacBook Pro in 2011. And that was discontinued in 2012. So Apple hasn't made a 17-inch notebook in about 10 years. This was the beginning of it in the prototype stage. So I gotta give a special shout out to DongleBookPro for loaning me this unit. And we're gonna have some fun with it today. So we'll start by looking at the exterior and see how things are different compared to a retail PowerBook G4. Then we'll open up the lid and look on the inside, and then we'll actually open up the computer and really look on the inside. And then we'll plug it in and boot it up and explore it a bit. So if you're ready, let's go. This aluminum is a lot more raw compared to this. And you know, I'm not an aluminum machining expert, but I'm guessing this goes through anodization and probably some other treatments that the prototype doesn't go through. And there's probably some different reasons that Apple has for that. But a main reason I would guess is, why go through the time and money to manufacture those nice finishes and processes on the chassis and the materials if you're still just testing the product? There's not always a good reason to do that if you're just in the earlier testing stages. And this happens with a lot of Apple products. In fact, my iMac prototype has a smooth plastic outside as opposed to that textured frosted plastic look of the retail iMac G3. So there's several stickers on this thing, for example, LCD Assy, which I just love that abbreviation, but it's short for assembly. And there's a barcode and a number. My educated guess would be that's for tracking parts. And then here, you have display housing with a different barcode and a different number, 035. And on the backside, there is even more fun stickers, including the fan favorite FCC warnings saying that this device is not passed FCC testing because devices emit signals that could cause interference with other machines and other communications, so they have to go through testing. And if they haven't gone through testing, typically, there's a warning on there, which really means you can't sell this thing yet. There's also the Apple Development Team, looks like some sort of asset tracking tag. I've seen this on many different prototypes. Sometimes they'll have different team names on there, and the labels will be in different colors, and there's always a barcode on there. And then usually, one of my favorite stickers to find is the MediMac sticker, which was Apple's internal team to assist people with prototype testing. An interesting thing is, even though I've seen these stickers before, I can't recall seeing a MediMac sticker that specifically said Apple Prototype Development Support. And here, the address is kind of mangled here, but that does say medimac.apple.com. And then down here, just like we saw earlier, three more barcodes for different parts. As you can probably see, I have part of the logic board exposed here. This would normally get covered up with this little cover here. And then the battery, which is also a prototype battery, a DVT sample, would be here. If you take those out, you get that red logic board. Apple likes to use different colored boards for prototypes just like in my iMac prototype. It's more of like a yellow brown board, but the retail version has a green board in it. And we'll open up this thing soon so you can get even more red goodness. On the hinge here, we have another bar code like we saw earlier with other parts, but we also have some handwriting. And I really like seeing handwriting on prototypes 'cause it really just drives the point home, \"Hey, there's real people at Apple working on these things. They're not just like some big magical Willy Wonka factory.\" But anyway, so here it says P84, which is the internal code name for this product. And Apple, a lot of times, will use letters and numbers mixed together. And this one is P84. And EVT is an abbreviation for Engineering Validation Test, which is a stage of prototyping. And essentially, that stage means you have a working prototype now, but now it's time to make maybe 10 or 20 units or so to actually start testing it. So Engineering Validation Test, EVT. So on the inside, we have yet another fun sticker. This is the configuration sticker, which has little filled in squares, which indicate what parts are being used in this specific build of the prototype. And also, there's another barcode here, indicating the top case part. And yes, the top case also has that kind of smooth, shiny metal. Even the trackpad button has a different shine and feel to it compared to the retail version. The bezel is also shiny, has more of that raw aluminum kind of feel and look. And the word PowerBook G4 is not on the bezel. That would happen a lot with certain prototypes. The names just wouldn't be on the product at all. Sometimes there's like a little space for the silk screen to be applied, but it's just empty. And sometimes it'll just be X'ed out with literal Xs. But in this case, there's just nothing there. And the keycaps also have little indentations on them, but the indentations seem to be equally spaced in multiple areas. So my theory is, that was some sort of durability test, pressure test for testing the keyboard. And you can see those little indentations if you look really closely on the keyboard. And I just think that's really, really neat. So if we take a look at the inside, we can see much more of that awesome red board. So this is where the keyboard in the top case was. And you unscrew that, and it comes right off. And voila, the logic board is there, along with the hard drive and the optical drive, which also says DVT3 on it. That is Design Validation Test. A fascinating thing about prototypes, kinda like the handwriting thing I was talking about earlier, you can really see the sort of like human MacGyver-y moves that are done with these builds. Because if you look at the wiring and the tape, it's not necessarily sloppy, but it's definitely not as neat as it would be in a retail product because it really doesn't have to be in this earlier stage of prototyping. Another cool thing, speaking of handwriting, this top case here, under this cable for the trackpad, the label says sample on it with a number. And it looks like it's written in pen. So let's get it put back together and boot it up. And just to manage expectations, prototypes don't always have internal software left on the hard drive because the hard drives are either nuked or there's a completely different hard drive in them anyway. All right, time to boot her up. Here we go. Hard drives kicking in. I definitely hear some extra like (beeps) noises coming from here, not sure why, but prototype. (laptop buzzing loudly) So here we are in Mac OS X Tiger. Let's take a look at the About panel, 10.4.11, and the build number, 8S165. That is not anything special. So this is not an internal build or anything, at least judging by the build number. But for fun, let's take a look at More info. And as I expected, the serial number is completely blank. That's pretty cool to see. But this also does confirm it is a 5,1, which was the first PowerBook G4 17-inch Apple sold to the public. Another thing I haven't seen before is the Power On Self-Test failed. Usually, it says passed. I don't know if it failed just because it's a prototype or maybe something else is actually wrong with the system. Hard drive wise, there's nothing really noteworthy on here. There's a couple third-party applications like DiskWarrior. And there is a Developer folder in the root of the hard drive, but there's nothing in there except for the Extras folder. There is the Mac OS 9 Applications folder and the Mac OS 9 System folder. So the classic environment is installed. You can run Mac OS 9 apps inside of OS X here. So yeah, I'm not too surprised that there's no crazy special software on here. But if you do wanna get your fix, go ahead and check out my iMac episode. There's some cool internal software and documentation on that hard drive. And also, my buddy, Greg, loaned me his iBook G3 prototype a while ago, and there was some cool internal stuff on there as well. So definitely check out those two episodes. They were a lot of fun, and I have the links in the description. So I think it's really cool to see these prototypes. It's kind of a time capsule, showing you how Apple was developing certain products and what they were thinking at the time because it kind of just humanizes the products and reminds us, \"Hey, there's actual real people with real lives that work on this stuff, and that's their job.\" And I just think that's really cool to see. So again, special thanks to DongleBookPro for loaning me this unit. And feel free to check out his channel. I have a link down in the description. If you wanna see some more cool prototype stuff, he's the guy to go to. And feel free to subscribe for more tech episodes coming out every week. I love making episodes about rare and retro tech, new tech, and of course scam tech. And hey, if you liked this episode, you know what to do. Thanks, and I'll see you next time. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat music) (bell chimes loudly)",

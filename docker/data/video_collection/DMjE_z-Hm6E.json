    "transcript": "- Hello, welcome to this is The Future of Technology, because inside this seemingly innocent white box is the very first phone that has a camera underneath the screen. You've see the notch, you've seen the hole punch, you've seen the forehead, but today we've got the under display, not fingerprint sensor even though it has that, but the under display camera. - I mean, don't get me wrong, this concept is really cool, but now let's see how well it actually plays out, because we have, now theoretically, not quite 100% screen-to-body ratio. We now can have close to that. - So we're going into this blind, pun intended, we essentially don't know anything about this besides some of the basics of the tech and the fact that this is the first commercial device. This ships with a screen that is overlaying the camera. And a lot of people have been asking for this for a long time. And it's interesting that ZTE is the first one that is the one who does it, which often is the case with these Chinese brands. OPPO's usually a pretty big trendsetter when it comes to things like these. - That's a nice little swirl action there. - That does look nice. - With my naked eye. I can see, well, my glasses, I can see a little bit of a shadow, so see if we can see, oh yeah. You see right there? - [Matt] There it is. - There we go. So you can see a tiny little bit of a shade underneath the screen, but mind you that is what the screen off. It's a 6.9 inch display. - Having used the mini for so long. I hate how big this phone is. You can actually see like the pixels are a little different. - Whoa okay, so that's not what I expected at all. So we take a very close look at the top of the display here. It's going to be really hard to see on camera but essentially it looks like there's like a little like patch over where the camera is. Is this better or worse than you expected? - It's about as I expected. Okay, so I didn't think this was going to be all that great. It is a brand new technology. It's the first one. There's going to be growing pains, 'cause it can only get better from here. It's not that bad but one thing I immediately noticed is as soon as you go into this, it's got this black bar here, which to me defeats the purpose of it. - Yeah, I will definitely agree. - I just don't see the point of that. So like-- - They're hiding it. - Exactly, it doesn't have any speaker grills on the front. Why do we have the chin then if that's the case? - They need the display drivers for the actual panels. So essentially when it comes to OLEDs if you want to have essentially no like forehead and chin you almost need to tuck the display circuitry around which is expensive and difficult. - Yes and it's something that like Apple does really well with folding their board. But one thing that's driving me crazy with this right now, what the visible screen is squared off up top and round here. The screen itself is rounded up top but when they're adding that in there it's nitpicky but they went through the trouble to make that a thing and then they half-assed it by just making it squared off. I can see, it looks like a like 50 pixel by 50 pixel square over the camera. Now this is certainly not a terrible thing. I will say that having a little bit of a like slightly different looking screen on that part is better than a camera, right? Like this is a step forward though the question is what happens when we actually open up the camera? So normal camera now let's flip it over and see what happens. Ready? Little animation there. I mean, this looks fine. - So that's my point, I was thinking, That looks fine. - Little fuzzy, little fuzzy, let me try beauty mode. Oh no, beauty mode was already on. Okay hang on, so mad flare though, with the light behind me here let me shade the light, there we go. So, all right, let's take a look at a photo and see what it actually looks like. Oh okay, well, first of all, stop burning in watermarks. I hate (groans). That drives me crazy. Oh, actually wait a minute that's terrible, why is that so soft? - And this is the point that I was trying to make is that even ZTE's cameras are just not that great when you compare them to other things. - There's clearly a sacrifice you make on two ends when you go for a setup like this. First of all, they're using, I believe it's some kind of like electro chromatic sort of essentially it's almost none of it's necessarily another screen but it's essentially, it's another layer that can turn on and off based on the voltage that's being applied to it. AKA when you're using it as a normal phone you've got that screen part which is over the actual selfie camera. So you can see that there's a little bit of a difference in texture. Like the actual screen itself like the pixels look different but when you go to actually use it with a screen on with the actual screen on, then what you see here is that the selfie camera gives you below average results. But what do you get in exchange? Because I mean, if we treat this, not as like a look at the future, which it certainly is, I mean, this is going to give you a good look for what will almost definitely be a feature in future phones. But if we look at it as this is the Axon 20 this is the phone that you're going to go out and spend your hard earned shekels on right now you're going to get a phone, which has, at least on the selfie side, a compromised experience. - So this is much better in video mode than it is, I think in the actual, just like the regular UI. - I don't have a problem with the screen. I think that's actually, I would much rather look at a very slightly like shaded, slightly weird section of my screen versus a camera, which is sitting always there whether it's whole punch, whether it's notch, whatever. I am okay with that. My only concern is the quality of the selfie camera because I'm not really to give up that much form over function. - Yeah, I agree. - I'm curious, hang on. Let's try this. So there are other things that are built into this phone that are not just purely based around the camera. One of which are the speakers, which supposedly are I mean, there's obviously a speaker on the bottom but are also through the display. So let's actually crank it up and see how it's sounds. (upbeat music) It doesn't sound terrible. - It sounds like one speaker. - There's nothing wrong with that. But I will say when I'm watching a video I'm not noticing any real stereo effect, it very much seems like it's got one good speaker and like the barest hint of a little bit of like that glass actually vibrating. - It doesn't sound bad, it's definitely not stereo. - When it comes to hiding devices in tech and gadgets underneath the display, nothing in my opinion has actually been flawless so far. So any in-display, fingerprint sensors so far that I've tried, has always been at least a beat slower than one that would be on the side or the back. Finger move too fast. Yes, it's kind of slow. I'm used to using like the Z Flip one. The Z Flip one is incredibly fast. Most of the physical ones, like the pixel are just like I mean, I could just do this like 10 times and it's done, but this is like way, way... - One of the things I think is promising for this technology is why does it have to be right there now? Theoretically, you could just stick the camera right here. Always be looking in the middle of the screen because when people are trying to like live stream or do Whatever, usually they're looking at their own screen, they're looking at themselves. That's a really interesting idea. Imagine being on a Zoom call and you're staring at the person in the middle and that's where the camera is mind you, the way this technology is. And I'm sure it will be for the foreseeable future when you do have that camera on it has to go opaque. So you'd see a little camera dot in the middle but when that could go away whenever. So let me give you a little demo of the quality that we're talking about. So we're gonna switch over to video mode and make sure that we're set up to 1080 P 16:9. Sounds good to me. We'd go for high efficient, less space occupation. So, this is a demo of what the video looks like from the front facing camera on the Axon 20. So, I kind of come around here. It looks fine but what I'm really noticing here is just how especially when you look at the lights, obviously the studio lights are always a little bit challenging when it comes to a front-facing camera but do you see how like sort of streaky everything looks and if they get a little closer to myself, you see a smooth everything is. Now in context, let me show you what it looks like on these Galaxy Z Flip. So I'll flip this around here. For context this is what a front facing camera on the Galaxy Z Flip looks like. So this is taking advantage of a hole punch so that there's essentially nothing in front of the camera. It is very natural as I look up to these lights, you can see that there's still, of course, some of that sort of flaring. So this is certainly not something that the Axon, what we were showing is very much like the worst case scenario. - But if you look at me, I don't have any lights in here. I don't have any of that ghosting that the Axon does. Like it's actually sharp around my head, around my shoulders. All right, I mean, look this is where we shoot here is a worst case scenario for a camera like this because you have all those lights that are aggressive but I mean, you can be the judge of how much quality you lose compared to what I would say it's a very average, hole punched display. Now for me personally, as of right now into 2020. I still think that I would rather go with a very small hole punch that is always there. That is still like the Z Flip kind of shows small, not really huge and in the way. And in fact, some of the Samsung, the more recent Samsung phones have even smaller hole punches I'll take that without taking these sort of sacrificed image quality that this provides. However, I think with the ZTE, with the Axon 20 what they're doing is this is the very first generation of something like this. If this is where we're starting I feel good about it from a screen-point perspective. - It's definitely a great place to start. I mean, I'll use the Silicon MacBooks. Again, if that's where we're starting, we're in a good spot to start. Is it noticeable? Yes. Is it a great camera experience right now? No, but it's for a lot of people, good enough and it only gets better from here. I'm glad that someone did it because it just kind of opens the door for it's something that people are going to see and say, okay, well I want this now. It kind of like opens the flood gates. - Look, as of right now I don't think I'm going to go tell you to go out and spend your cash on an Axon 20 for the camera. It's a cool feature. I see why this is the first gen, I see where they put it on a upper, mid-range phone because I think this is the spot where you're probably willing to accept a little bit more of these compromises compared to if this was like a 12 or $1,300, like ultra premium flagship. I like the technology, I like the idea of it, to me though, at least as of right now it feels like it's a touch too early and these sacrifices that you're having to make don't quite make up for the benefit of having that all screen display. When really in reality, you have a little bit of a chin and I mean is a hole punch that offensive? I don't know. - I mean, I'll tell you from like an OCDs standpoint, it's driving me nuts. Like I said, the fact that the chin is not symmetrical with the forehead, then there's the rounded edges versus the squared off edges. It does have like the slightly different screen there. It's a lot of like little nitpicky things, but as a whole, I don't like it. But again, I'm glad that this is where we're at for version one, because I can't stress this enough. It only gets better from here. - So, what do you think about the under display camera tech inside the ZT Axon 20? Let us know in the below, make sure to subscribe to This Is for more complaints about incredibly cool future technology. And until next time we're going to shoot our full at next episode on the front facing camera of the Axon 20 because clearly this is the kind of quality that you've come to expect from out of this gloriously wonderful high quality channel, right Matt. I feel like this is slightly better than we normally do. - [Jimmy] Put Matt's head on the camera. - Oh, look at that, so smooth (laughs). - I like that that's the joke, now what color is Matt's head today? - Thanks for watching, we'll catch you next time.

    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] I am a professional. I have a feeling we're just gonna have to pry this lid off. (lid clanking) Do they just not want people opening these, it really is like an Apple product. (Ken breathing heavily) (beeping) (upbeat electronic music) Hey guys, how are you all doin'? Really? That's just great, you know who's not doin' great? This poor sucker of a hard drive. You know, I plugged it in recently, and it didn't quite work, I'll show you what happened. However, there is hope because the hard drive might be okay, the enclosure might just have some kinda power failure. So, we're gonna use, this guy, the NexStar TX by Vantec. Now I was going to get a Rosewill version of a drive toaster, that's basically what this is, but I got one of those lovely, this may cause cancer in California warnings, and I'm like well, that sounds great, I don't want that, so this one didn't have that for some reason. And we're gonna use it to try to get that drive extract, well we're gonna try to extract the drive from that enclosure. And then pop it into the drive toaster, and see what we can pull off of it. Now, this is an old Firewire 800 drive. I used to video edit off of this thing, back when Firewire 800 was magical. Not so much anymore. So it's been, needless to say, years since I have even looked at the contents of this disk. I have no idea what's on here. I think we might be in for a little surprise. Let's get started. All right, so step one of this whole process is to get the hard disk out of this enclosure. Now, much like an Apple product, it is completely sealed off. However, it is not as sealed off. We have these rubber feet on the bottom that hold up the device, but they also conceal the screws. Hopefully, it is really easy to just peel these suckers off. There we go, and it looks like it's just a little bit of adhesive. So that can go right back on if we need to. Now, this is an Iomega product. It's funny because I actually have another story about an Iomega drive that I almost destroyed. I'll tell that in a little bit, but yeah, I don't think Iomega even exists anymore, do they? Did they get acquired and the name got removed or something? Do they not use the brand name anymore? I don't know, but yeah, I think that Iomega got acquired or something like that. I used to buy their products quite a bit, come on baby, that was a sticky one. We bust out our good friend, Phillips screwdriver. Open this baby up, that is way too small. If I had a nickel for every time I heard that one. Oh, my other Phillips screwdrivers are not in this box I have over to the side, so we'll just use one of these little interchangeable bit do-hickeys. (plastic clanking) See if, there we go, that works, that's happy. How come, like every time around, this time of year, I have to undo an enclosure to extract a drive? The last time I did that around this time, it was with an SSD, and Druaga1 gave me his wonderful wisdom. Yeah, it's like this time of year is cursed with enclosure and drive issues. That's weird, I didn't think the Krazy Ken Curse was that timely and organized. (screwdriver clanking) All right, well we got the screws out, but it still feels like it's sealed up. Great, whoops almost forgot, before I go any further, let me show you the wonderful sound this thing makes. It's not that bad. (hard drive thumping) Turn it on. (hard drive whirring) And as you can hear, it's just kinda going (imitates buzzing) not workin'. Okay so I'm doin' my best here with my amazing 3G signal that I'm getting, to find out how to actually open up these suckers. Now, a lot of the videos either don't show the steps all the way and they have a massive amount of dislikes or they do show the steps, and it looks like we're gonna have to stick knives into this freakin' case to pop the bottom off. So, I don't know how much additional research I really wanna do because I have a feeling we're just gonna have to pry this lid off, kinda like the old Mac Minis. The screws are out, but this thing, (fingers thudding) will not budge, so we need to pry. You know, originally, as a joke I was just gonna smash this thing with a hammer to open it up but I'm starting to think that's what we might actually have to do. The only problem is, the contents that we need to extract from this freakin' bulletproof case are very fragile, so we need to be careful with that. Honestly, if I have to pry the case open and damage it, I don't care because the enclosure doesn't seem to work anyway. I just want the hard disk out of here in one piece, please. And, okay. (screwdriver clanging) Something a little more durable, I think is doing the trick. This is a very bizarre case. Okay. (hard drive lid clanking) And (speaking foreign language), there we are. So here's the disk, it looks like we have a couple more screws to take out, but I'm gonna guess that the hard part is over. Ooh, I should never say that. (hard drive thudding) The nice thing about this particular disk assembly is, again, I don't have to worry about putting it back together because the thing doesn't work anyway, so screw it. Or, unscrew it (laughs). That pun was so good, I'm proud of myself. Okay screw, fine, stay in there, I don't care. What the heck is this? What is this, come on. It's like there's always screws to undo but every time I undo them, there's still something else retaining the enclosure. This is like a freakin' puzzle box. This kinda reminds me of the time I disassembled the Mac Color Classic which coincidentally is actually sitting like four feet away from me. Yeah, that was a fun time, that thing was kind of a bitch to open too, and even worse, I had to get that thing reassembled because it needed to keep working afterwards. For this, I don't know, I really don't care if I just break the whole thing, as long as the disk is good. I should probably have eye protection on. I'm just gonna look away. (hard drive snapping) Ah, I can't get this freakin' thing open. I don't know if this is due to something we've already taken apart slash broken but look at that. Oh, okay so the screws were holding this in place. Okay, so this is kinda just loose, which is good, now I just need to get it out of here. Okay, so I'm lookin' up some other videos on the Tubes and most of them show the important parts of the procedure outside of the camera frame which is genius cinematography. So I guess we're just on our freakin' own. But from what I am kind of gathering, from the genius cinematography, is that this side probably comes off as well, and you don't take the disk out of the bottom here. (hard drive thudding) Oop, well that was probably stupid. But you take it out of the top. So, over the top it is. (screwdriver clanking) I don't like to do it this way, but I've been spending so much freakin' time with this thing already, it's like come on man, just open. (screwdriver clanking) Man, (sighs) never buying one of these things again, but I think the brand doesn't exist anymore anyway, so whatever. (screwdriver clanking) Okay, it looks like there's some little notches there. (screwdriver clanking) Are they on the other side? Yes they are. I saw some other videos where people were cuttin' these open with knives, it's like what the frick. (screwdriver clanking) (Ken groans) (hard drive snapping) (Ken groans) Cheese and rice, and this is also adhesive. What, (hard drive lid clanking) do they just not want people opening these? It really is like an Apple product. Well, there we are. Looks like it's a Samsung disk. (hard drive snapping) (hard drive enclosure thudding) And there it is, the remains of this beautiful work of art. Wow. (hard drive enclosure thudding) Seriously. So like, who on the board or the product design team just got together in a room and was like, hey, let's design the thing like a puzzle box and no one can get inside of it, ho-ho! Yeah, I don't know why they thought that was a good idea but, regardless, we have the drive out now. Three and a half inch, and if I did my homework right, we should be able to just slip this into the toaster and everybody should be happy. Let's open this thing up. (plastic ripping) That was a failed attempt. (plastic ripping) (screwdriver thudding) Oh, now I went through the cardboard, okay. (plastic crinkling) This is actually pretty decent packaging for a freakin' 15 dollar drive toaster. Installation guide. (plastic crunching) (objects thudding) (box thudding) (speaking foreign language), there we are. (plastic crinkling) Look at that, just (lid swishing) This is satisfying. (lid swishing) I can have fun with that. So, we have USB 3, and DC. Now, if you'll recall, the enclosure I had earlier is USB 2, so this is gonna be way faster. Not to mention, this is gonna be way easier to use because we don't have to do any assembly. You just (mouth pops) pop the disk in, and you're good to go. Now, the advantage with the other enclosure is you can actually turn an internal hard drive into an external hard drive and it's pocket-sized, but I don't really care about that. I just want access to, for example, internal drives just, you know, (mouth pops) pop 'em in there. (drive toaster thudding) All right, so we got the power, undo the little twisty twist. We can do this, trust me, I am a professional. I am HowToBasic, no I'm not, just kidding that'd be a disappointment. USB 3, this is type B, the type A. Alright, power. We got a little switch on the back there, and a little light on the front. (button clicking) It's blue and red, that must mean something. So, let's actually get this hooked up to a computer. Here we are, all hooked up, well almost. (hard drive thudding) All right, where is the port, where is the port, where is the port, all right where are you, where are you, there you are. Okay, all right little NexStar. Let's see if you were worth it. (hard drive clunking) Inserting the breakfast pastry. Power up. Ooh, it's spinning. Dude, if this works I'm gonna crap myself. Enter the password to unlock the disk Spica. Spica, all right, that just really dates this thing. Yeah, I used to name my disks after stars and stuff, yeah that was years ago. All right, gotta figure out the password now. Huh, well, yeah. All of that just for nothing, okay, yeah, okay. Would you excuse me for a second? Just a second, yeah. (Ken yelling) Son of a (beep), mother (beep), Lorem ipsum (beep), hippopotamus (beep), alakazam. (Ken breathing heavily) (Ken laughing) (hard drive brushing) (hard drive clanking) (hammer smashing) (pieces clanking) (hammer smashing) (pieces clanking) (pieces clanking) (Ken groaning) (camera popping) (Ken laughing) (pieces clanking) (Ken laughing) (Ken screaming) (Ken laughing) (scraper brushing) (Ken yelling) (Ken laughing psychotically) (Ken breathing heavily) Bird, bird, bird, bird. Bird, bird. Bird. Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird, bird. Bird, bird, bird. (bird chirps) Bird! Bird, bird. (bird chirping) Bird. (Ken heavily breathing) (hammer clanging) (Ken heavily breathing) (hammer clanking) (Ken heavily breathing) (hammer thudding) (Ken heavily breathing) (snow crunching) (get me a salami) (Ken heavily breathing) (hammer thudding) Admittingly, I lost my cool here. I'm guessing this is not the best way to fix the hard drive. Yeah, that's busted. Well, (hard drive brushing) on the bright side, however, I now have a one terabyte hard drive that has nothing on it. I could use this to store my research, to store my videos, to help further the advancement of mankind or just let it sit in the closet and collect dust. Terabyte is still good, it's not too bad. (hard drive thumping) So, how can we go out on a high note? I mean, this is kind of a high note, this is like a mid note, let's go out on a higher note. It's story time with Krazy Ken. (rock music) So I was kind of alluding to this earlier, and some of you may know this story but, long ago I had another Iomega product. It was actually the first Iomega product I ever purchased. I forgot what it was called, but it was an external hard drive. Firewire 400. The funny thing was the shape. Me being the good, kind, church-going Krazy Ken that I was, I didn't know much about alcohol or booze, so I'm carrying this hard drive around completely oblivious to what it actually kinda looks like. And I was at a birthday party one time. A birthday party when I was gettin' together with some of my other geeky friends, and I had the hard drive with me. And someone was like, and again, this was like back in middle school, they were like, is that a flask? It struck me, that hard drive looks like a flask. Iomega shaped their hard drive to look like a flask. So now it lives in infamy as the 'Flask Drive'. And that, ladies and gentlemen and ladies, is my story for you today. I'm calling this a win. (upbeat electronic music) I'm a little cold now. Oh, I hope I don't get sick. Thanks for tagging along, catch the crazy and pass it on. It's contagious.",

And when its as simple as having a car charger in your vehicle, there is no reason not to be prepared. A car charger is something almost every one needs. This one looks just like any other car charger, BUT it has some special features that are life saving.   This car charger features a built in seatbelt cutter, as well as a spring loaded window breaker, that works impressively well.

    "transcript": "This car charger could literally save your life. The title is not click bait. This is actually one of the coolest things I saw at CES this year from a company called Ztylus. Im not exactly sure where the z comes from, but it is called Ztylus. [Intro] Driving is always dangerous. Accidents happen. Your car could slip off the road and go into water, a river or a lake, or there could be a flood. And the only problem with that, besides the fact that your car is not a boat, is that when your car is under water, electronics and water dont mix well together. So your electronic windows and doors will stop working. This car charger breaks windows automatically. And Ill show you how it works. In addition to the dual 2.4 amp USB quick charge ports, this car charger has a built in seatbelt cutter and a spring loaded window breaker. The razor part is pretty self explanatory. Seatbelts can get damaged during car accidents and stuck, pinning you inside of the vehicle, which may or may not be on fire. The window breaker is actually hidden pretty well inside of the car charger. Most people never really what it is when its plugged into your car. When the tip of the car charger is pressed against the glass, it will compress a little bit, loading an internal spring, and then firing this metal spike violently through the tip into the glass window with a very concentrated force. And since glass is very brittle, the whole thing will shatter. This is the internal spring and the metal spike inside of the car charger. Its pretty magical. And you dont have to be strong to use it. Just press down and it does all the work itself. So weve seen that the little car charger works on small little squares of glass. But, does it actually work on a real car window? Lets find out. I happen to have a spare car door here like everybody does. And were going to test it out on this window. Alright so we have the car door right here with the glass window on this side. And we have the car charger right here. Were going to come in and were going to press this up against the glass on the inside of the window and see what happens. Ready? Threetwoone. That is crazy! And at that point, you can just press it all the way out. Thats insane. So if that was your drivers side or passenger side window, you would be totally able to get out of your car in an emergency. Now if you are under water in your car, if you break your window, waters going to start rushing in so theres no way to get out easily until the water has filled up the inside of your car. It will be like fighting a waterfall. So you just have to sit there and be patient while your car fills up with water and then exit after that. So lets say that youre in your car and youre in an accident and the seat belt is jammed; you cant get out of your seatbelt. So we have a little razor cutter on the tip of that that I showed you earlier. Were just going to take it, put the seatbelt in there, well see if it cuts well. Oh wow. Thats actually easier that I thought. As long as theres tension on the seatbelt, you can cut pretty easily. Lifesaving technology is my favorite kind of technology and thats why I liked this so much at CES. Im going to put a link for it down in the video description right below this video so if you want one of these, in case youre ever in an emergency, you can get one. Thanks a ton for watching. Ill see you around.",

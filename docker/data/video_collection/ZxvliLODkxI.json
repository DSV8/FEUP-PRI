    "transcript": "- Yo guys, Jonathan here. First off, thank you guys so much for the incredible love on the latest video featuring Henny Tha Bizness. Honestly, creatively, this might have been the most fun I've had not only shooting something, editing something, but kind of taking a step back away from the front of the camera and directing it. So it should be no secret that I have a huge passion for film and cinematography but I think I also have an equal passion for music and music production, so to have someone like Henny and then Ken freakin' Lewis together, using technology as that means to bring two immensely people together, for me was such an amazing experience and seriously, I'm sitting there holding the camera and you could not slap the smile off of my face. With that said, I think I got kind of lost into the story so much to the point where I almost did not want to include my voice whatsoever. It was just kind of one of those situations where I'm sittin' there editing everything, watching it come together to the point where the story essentially told itself. The entire process from flying Henny and Ken out to shooting to editing to get it up on YouTube was all within a 24 hour window so kind of sitting back and watching that, I think my biggest self critique was not including enough of the educational aspect. There was a ton of feedback that I 100% absolutely agree with wanting to see what was happening on the iPad display, especially with someone like Ken Lewis, who's track record is about as legitimate as it gets. He's a multi-grammy winner. He's mixed, engineered, produced, written songs for everyone from Kanye West to Mary J. Blige to Fun. The list is absolute insanity. So to have someone like that in the room, not only with his knowledge but just reacting, having a pure, genuine moment mixing on the iPad for the first time, I think is invaluable. What I did was kind of put together a looser, more kickback, educational feel style video, kind of similar to what I did with the editing on the iPad Pro video. I'm not 100% sure if I'm gonna leave this up publicly. I might switch it to unlisted and link it back to the original video for those that want to see more of that educational side but if you guys dig this, and you think it's worth leaving up, let me know with a comment down below and also drop in a like and with that said, let's go ahead and check out Henny mixing with Ken Lewis on the iPad for the first time in his life. - So what I had is basically three different ideas. I had the piece with just kind of like the drums, the swing part and the bass and the sample, the string sample. - Right. - And then it gets funky and you take the string sample out and it kind of has the pianos and synth as part of the different part of the sequence and then throughout we can try to figure out how to bring those lives in. - So how do you think you're gonna start the record off? - Probably with the string sample as a solo. So if you take the pen, let's copy it out so if you grab the whole thing right down here, you have three different functions right, yep, to copy that and you just kind of drag it around that whole thing. Yep. - And then just repeat? - Yep. - That's dope. - Then one more time. - Yep. - All right, now this is kind of like how you get back-- - Oh okay. - And forth up there. - That's easy. - And say for instance it was string sample, if we just wanted to go maybe eight bars, you can always just spread it out and take out the pieces that you want. - So if I just draw like this, everything but the string sample and mute. - Grab. - Remove and then remove, come on. There we go. So now we have an arrangement. (gentle upbeat music) - Then something comes in there, maybe the bass. - Maybe a bass and bells. - So you can literally take those, you can drag over. - Oh I see. You mean that? - What I do is, undo's up there. - Mm hm. - I just take that, drag it over one and then-- - Where am I? Where's the drag? Right here? - Yeah, well, just in the middle of it. - Oh I see. - Yeah. And then just repeat it. - Ah smart, I see what you're doing. Let's do the same thing with the bells and see how that hits us. - Okay. - Repeat. Top play. (gentle upbeat music) - What if we want to bring in the loop on-- - Okay. - Right there? - The drum? - Yeah. - We have this as an eight bar loop so then repeat that so we want-- - And then you'll cut it again. - Yeah, so if you go up here and play from there. (upbeat music) - Bap, right. - Yep. - So - We're looking right at that one. - So here's the cut piece. - Do I need to select this first? - Yep. - Okay. - And now on any line you just cut it and then you can go back to there, or go back to select and then delete. - And remove. Top and let's see how that feels. (gentle upbeat music) - Now if you want to go all the way out right there... - Ah nice, okay. (gentle upbeat music) - Let's save that synth lead for the-- - Yeah. - Let's save the synth lead for the hook. - Okay. And maybe the pianos too. - Yeah. - So... - Oh I see, this removes the whole arrangement. - Yep. - Gotcha. All right so the synth lead, maybe we'll cut this, cut this much more out. - Yep. And sometimes you can just tap on it if it's the whole piece. - Ah okay, it's in pieces-- - Yeah. They should be in either four, eight bar pieces. There you go. - Okay, let's see, let's see what this gets us. (gentle upbeat music) - Look at that one more time, alright? - Yeah. (gentle upbeat music) - You can do it while I'm doing it. (gentle upbeat music) Maybe drop now. So, now, going back to where we were. Sometimes you can just do that. - Ah nice. And then would you, you do that and then you use the cut tool or you selected the cut tool? - I went to the cut tool, put a line and then-- - That automatically does it? Yeah. - So now we have... (gentle upbeat music) I don't know if that was it or if we wanted-- - I think-- - Yeah. We just let that loop rock through it. (gentle upbeat music) That's good enough for a set up. - Okay, so... (gentle upbeat music) - Nice. (gentle upbeat music) - So if we wanted that, I think from that point we can start to figure out the-- - Right. - The mix, right? - Yeah, this is plenty to dig into. - So, now, we have sequence window, mix window. If you double tap, (gentle upbeat music) this is all your effects. - Okay. - So you have these normal effects that BeatMaker comes with. - Right. - But all these third party people make these other effects so if you're saying, you know, compressor. I'll show you where it is. EQ show you where it is. - So it's just like I can select congas. - Yeah. - Add effect, go, maybe I want a dynamics processor. - Mm hm. - And then... (gentle upbeat music) How do you fast forward? - We can-- - Maybe loop a full section, let me just get a vibe for the whole thing and then we can see how that fine tooths itself. Yeah, that's probably good right there. (gentle upbeat music) - [Henny] See all those down there? - So where's the mixer? Oh. (gentle upbeat music) - Sometimes you get even more detail with the pencil. (gentle upbeat music) - Now is there a meter that shows... Okay, it's like right there, yeah. So I just need to keep going. (gentle upbeat music) So full mixer's here? - There's a company called Klevgrand that makes some really cool third party ones, right, so we want stereo widening. They have this thing called haze, so say for instance we went... That's where we want right? - Yeah. Ah yeah, just like... Mm hm. - I literally just increase frequency. - That's great, yeah. It's kind of like waves spreader. - [Henny] Yeah, do it with one finger. - Okay. - [Henny] Good. - Ah very nice. So you can get really fine tuned into the frequency range you want. - Yeah, and the mix. - And how do you bypass this in Compare? (gentle upbeat music) There you go. Yeah, that's nice. - And if you want to take the mix down out of it. - So that's like a wet dry kind of parallel balance and then if you want EQ, are these EQ? - [Henny] Or how much of, I guess... - Yeah, I hear what it's doing. (gentle upbeat music) Nice, okay. (gentle upbeat music) Where's the wet dry? (piano music) That's nice. - [Henny] Yeah. - That's dope. (gentle upbeat music) Ah thank you. - [Henny] Oh. This one. (gentle upbeat music) - Are there different types of overdrives you can select? - Let's see, there's a few, let's see where's the... Fuzz. (gentle upbeat music) - Yeah! The fuzz. - Can you automate on the fly? So like if you armed... I think it's too complicated-- - Right and you can so-- - But if I armed this and in real time I could just manually record it. - Yes, that's what you call midia, effect midia, I think that's how you do that. - Yeah, let's hear that in the whole mix. And then if I just wanna adjust a level, this is it? - [Henny] Yeah, yeah. And it's there. (gentle upbeat music) - Is there a way to set it automatically to the middle? (gentle upbeat music) - [Henny] You gonna reset it? - Ah, there it is, yeah. (gentle upbeat music) Nice. Now, if I wanted to add a second plug-in, I just hit that? - Yep. - Where's the... (gentle upbeat music) - [Henny] Reverb? - I want to um, that's what I want. (gentle upbeat music) Is there like a tap delay you can select? Yeah, this is actually it, it's good left and right, it's already on. So if we do... (gentle upbeat music) - [Henny] Let me hit this, every once in a while. (laughing) - Always prudent to say. - Right. (electronic music) - Ah let's see, if I want to get back to that, okay. So I can bypass the fuzz and just-- - Yeah. - And just forget what it's doing without it. - [Henny] Yep. (electronic music) - That's nice. (gentle upbeat music) So at this point, we basically have a basic arrangement of, I've kinda got a feel for how the plug-ins work. - [Henny] Okay. - Let me go to the full mixer and just pull all the faders down and get an idea of just how the faders are-- - Let's go. (gentle upbeat music) - How about you start from jump and that way you'll have the whole sequence so bring this all the way back and... - I just keep it looping like that. - Okay, okay cool. (gentle upbeat music) - That's the master. - Up. (gentle upbeat music) I can just do this with my finger too right? - Yep. - Ah that's really nice. So let's loop a section that has everything in it. That way I just know I'm not... - There you go. - Works. Alright, so all faders down, I'm just gonna start building a mix from scratch just getting basic balances and see how the functionality is. Can I turn the speakers up without any problem? (man talking in the background) Oh okay. That's it, yeah. I got the drums. I like that. (gentle upbeat music) - You always start with drums? - No, it depends on the song. But usually. - Okay. - Usually I like to blast it like stun volume for about 15 minutes. Get all of my basic balances together and then start to pull in the more musical elements. (hip hop music) (gentle upbeat music) Leave some room for the vocals. - Yep. - The bell's are in. (gentle upbeat music) Let's see if I remember plug-ins. Oh yeah, gotta select that. And then is it here? - Audio effects, yeah. - Audio effects, boom. - So if I want... Is all compression under dynamics processor? - Yeah. You know Klevgrand makes some little cover stuff too like... (bells chiming) - That sounds more my speed, okay. I have no idea how to use this but let me find out. - Kind of a squeeze function. - Mm hm. - Input output. - Does it have... (bells ringing) Does it have a tack time? (bells ringing) - [Henny] Is that more your speed? - I'm likin' where it's goin', I'm just gonna add another compressor to it. - Okay. (bells ringing) I just want to-- - What do you want from that? - I want to take down just the initial attack. - Okay. - So it's not so sharp and more of the resonance of the bell comes out, than the initial like mallet hit. - Okay. - You know what I mean? So super fast attack and release higher compression and just get a little bit of reduction so that that mallet strike isn't so attacking. - Sometimes this goes up and down. (bells ringing) - There we go. - You can't filter it. - I just wanted it so the compressor's only looking at more of a high frequency and less of the low frequency. - Gotcha. - But it's not a crisis, let's just put it back. (gentle upbeat music) I'm also gonna try a spreading effect on that. - [Henny] Okay. - Not that one, this one. No. Yep. - That one? - And what do I, ah down here, perfect. I want stereo one, I want a stereo delay. Does this do really, really short delay times? Like four milliseconds, now it's only on tempo. - [Henny] Yeah, uh yeah, that one's only on tempo. - How do I get rid of this? - The three dots? The effects. - Perfect, let's see what else we got here. Modulation delay. (bells dinging) Hear it widening now? - [Henny] Mm hm. Dope. - That's nice. I kind of keep it away from the drums and the vocals and... Back to the mixer on solo. (gentle upbeat music) That way you can kind of keep it lower in the mix without it getting in everybody's way. (gentle upbeat music) I mean the drums sound really good. I probably wouldn't do anything to 'em but I want to see if like maybe brightening them up a little bit is gonna help or not. Usually a little saturation. Not that much. That's the push the output through effect. (Henny laughing) (gentle upbeat music) I kind of like it for this though. (drums beating) Let that kick hang in a little longer, make it a little more grittier. (drums beating) Now it's just hitting a little hard. - [Henny] I wouldn't normally do that, it's cool. - But see, doing that you lose a little bit of the low end of the kick. - [Henny] Yeah. (drums beating) - Let's see if, uh, right back. (drums beating) Now we get the grit and the bottom. - [Henny] Uh huh. (gentle upbeat music) - That also brings a little bit of that shaker out of the loop too, you know what I mean? - Yeah. - We didn't really hear it like that before. (gentle upbeat music) I want to try one more thing with that and it's here and is this the band for that? - [Henny] Yeah you can just set it-- - Just need a bell. (drums beating) - [Henny] Mm. Little space in it. - Yeah, just coppering out that sharpness in the snare. (gentle upbeat music) - You guys want to stop and see what it sounds like from the top? - Yeah, let's do it. And then I'd love to give the mix bus a try and see what kind of mix bus stuff they have. Now let's see, I'll get back to the-- - Take that whole piece and drag it out. - There you go. And where's the stop start? Okay. (gentle upbeat music) There we go. (gentle upbeat music) - So what I like to do here is... (gentle upbeat music) - I think we're pretty good with where we're at. - Now how do you feel like, you know your whole first take on the iPad? Is it something that... - I never really thought I would be doing this on an iPad, so-- - But from your experience? It's very much, it's very capable right? - Yeah, I mean the thing I love about it is it's all tactile and I come from old school analog. You know you have 15 foot mixing consoles in front of you and those have gotten smaller and smaller but I'm still on an analog board and one of the reasons I'm on an analog board is because it's all tactile and I can touch it and work it and get the feel for that musical connection that turning the knobs gives you and moving the faders gives you and it feels like one of the things that I have always disliked about the mouse that's kept me analog for so long is that that tactile experience and being able to look at the whole console and just grab whatever you want to tweak on the fly and to me this is like the best version I've seen so far of that in the box. - Wow. - I mean I haven't used the Raven, so the Raven might be this or who knows? But the raven is multiples more expensive and a much bigger footprint and you can't stick it in your backpack. So this, I am definitely gonna be like taking this to the beach and putting the headphones on with the controller and sitting there for hours at a time just making music and my favorite part is the tactile response of it, that I can just scroll around and I can very easily select everything that I want to do and I don't have to use a mouse to do it. That's me, I love that. And it seems like their effects packages and their plug-ins are super usable. - Yeah and it's only getting better. Developers-- - I'm sure as third parties come on board and... - It's awesome...",

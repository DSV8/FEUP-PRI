    "transcript": "yo you got a minute it's up you got a package from Razer huh what exactly is that I have no idea man but I'm just gonna leave it on the desk so feel free to take a look at it when you have a time okay all right bye all right so this looks like it's the new Nari Ultimate by Razer feel every battle you've got a cool sound wave our presentation over here the future of gaming audio and merging early haptic technology this will be interesting you've got a bunch of stuff here and assume that's the headset so let me pull it out check that out it's pretty cool looking okay so with the Nari Ultimate Razer's really trying something different by integrating haptic technology within these headsets so basically it's based on audio cues from a game engine so whether that's you know firing gunshots or blowing up stuff within the gameplay you're gonna feel a little bit of that vibration on your ears and I think that's gonna be certainly interesting to test out so yeah let's check out the Nari Ultimate right after a message from our sponsor evolved with the times consider nvme storage today the new RC 100 brings affordable nvme storage into your hands with various capacities in this super compact form factor that points directly into your motherboard it's extremely powerful and utilizes the Sheba's advance through the flash memory for awesome speeds so you can be a happy user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme drive to consider check out below all right so after examining the headset a bit closely the first thing that sticks out to me the most is the size of the Nari Ultimate's I mean it is huge almost looks like it's gonna crush my skull or something and this type of design has been embedded within Razer Nari series of headsets so it's not like it's a revolutionary step in terms of design they almost look very much identical to the other Nari headsets that Razer's offering now given the size of this headset is also been on the heavier side as well coming in just a tad about 400 grams which is a lot and you will definitely start to notice the heaviness once you start wearing it for longer periods of time and let's be honest here for a sec you're not gonna wear this in public transit just casually moving around here and there because it's just not practical that being said I do like the gunmetal gray finish on this headset it does add a nice stealth appeal the body is mostly constructed out of heart plastic materials but it is put together really well there are no signs of creaking which should be expected considering this thing costs $200 you heard that right the naari Ultimates there are $200 now if you watched any of my previous headset reviews you know me and my relationship with headsets featuring self adjusting headbands it's really not my thing as the metal frame above the headband can cause reverberations when it gets in contact with anything and it is very much noticeable with the Nari ultimate it's not a deal breaker but it's something worth noting razer has also implemented a few other cool add-ons to this headset to make it a bit more appealing so first up the ear cuffs they feature cooling gel infused cushions to reduce heat buildup over intense gaming sessions so for instance if you wear this headset first thing during the day and if you plan on using it for multiple hours you're gonna notice that cooling factor for around 10 to 15 minutes around your ears and it's actually pretty cool but as hours pass by that's gonna fade out eventually because heats obviously gonna start building up and it doesn't stay consistent but the good thing is that the cooling gel cushions actually absorbed the heat really well so I can actually wear this for longer periods of time at least during my period of testing so that's pretty awesome it's nowhere closer to the active thermoelectric cooling solution that we were able to test out with the HB mindframe headset if you guys are interested in checking that out I'll leave a link right over here but that's a nothing's powered by USB and it's you can adjust how active the cooling should be through software which is again pretty amazing cool tech next up is flexibility and the Nari Ultimate can be comfortably placed around your neck with the ear cuffs rotated 90 degrees so you can easily maneuver your head around if you're taking constant breaks here and there which is pretty nice I should also mention that this is a wireless gaming headset and it communicates with your PC via this included 2.4 gigahertz USB receiver kudos to Razer for making it low-profile unlike some other wireless headsets we've taken a look at in the past plus there's a built-in storage compartment within the headset to safely store it which is awesome now you can also use the nari ultimate in Wired mode and that can be done by connecting the included 3.5 mm audio cable to an Xbox one or ps4 controller or even your smartphone provided that it has a headphone jack to expand usability but I will mention that haptic feedback does work in Wired mode it's just that you have to make sure that there's actual power on the headset because that technology is powered by the battery cells built inside the headset so that's something to keep note of if you run out of battery you're definitely gonna miss haptics I should also mention that when you're using the Nouri ultimate in Wired mode it is going to disable RGB lighting permanently which is a good thing but do note that you can't adjust the intensity of the haptics in this mode since it requires synapse 4 then however if you fine-tune that in software and then switch the wired mode the settings will carry along automatically the included USB cable can only be used to charge the headset and while you can still use the headset while charging the cable by itself is not long enough so I had a tough time routing it behind a PC or even you aren't using my friend IO connector so that was a little bit uncomfortable so you have to make sure that you charge the headset on a regular basis because this cable is it's not long enough now in terms of buttons on the left ear cup there is a mic mute button also Game Chat Balance dial that can either increase the in-game volume and decrease the voice chat or vice versa and I like this inclusion then you have your power button a microUSB port to charge that had said I wished if it was type C but that's just me there's also an analog connector to use headset in Wired mode switching over to the right ear cup you'll notice the volume dial and do note that it actually doesn't sync up with the main volley mixer on Windows 10 so what I would recommend is max out the volume within Windows and then use this dial to adjust the volume on the headset and now on to the microphone test and guys I'm really impressed with the quality coming out of the Nari Ultimates I mean I am I system running in the background my heaters turned on and it does a really good job by starting that in fact I'm typing on my mechanical keyboard featuring romaji switches and as you can hear it does a really good job isolating that now I will mention that there is a little bit digital compression taking place with my voice so it doesn't sound as boomy or there's a lack of bass with my vocals so it doesn't sound full but that's I guess the nature of all the background noise compression that's happening and this also Wireless so that's another factor to consider the microphone is non removable but it is retractable so it goes back to the headset and there's a little LED indicator around the tip here so when you mute the microphone when you activate the mute button it turns red which is a good visual indication as to whether or not if you're you know you're muted your conversation during a chat or something like that but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think about the quality is it impressive for $200 all right so let's switch gears and talk about the key selling feature of the Nari Ultimate and that is Razer's hypersense technology so essentially they've implemented two advanced LP haptic drivers developed by Lowe felt that converts sound signals into dynamic touch sensory feedback in real-time in other words you experience haptic feedback on your face or vibrations if you want to call it another way depending on the type of content you're consuming but it doesn't end there in fact these drivers are fine-tuned to cover a wider frequency range unlike some other haptic drivers that just cover a narrower range and on top of that they provide a stereo feedback so for instance if you're listening to a music that's more guitar based as the artist is strumming the strings you physically feel the vibrations as he's doing that and it's actually pretty amazing there is one issue though if the music you listen to has a large bass track the haptic feedback will be pretty constant for example with starboy from the weekend the vibration didn't stop through the whole song and it was kind of annoying however gaming on the other hand is a whole other story the haptic feedback really adds that extra layer of immersion I tried a few titles like battlefield and overwatch and man when you're firing gunshots or when you even hear explosions the background the haptic feedback feels powerful and in some cases real on top of that it's balanced on both your left and right channels as well so if something blows up on the left and if you shift towards that side the feedback transitions easily onto your right channel giving it a great sense of positional awareness and those haptic drivers are dynamic meaning if something blows up farther away from you it's not gonna sound as powerful or it's gonna sound it's gonna be present but it's gonna be a little less powerful compared to when something blows up you know a little bit further ahead of you or something that's closer to you is now on the downside this technology is more dependent on the volume as well so if you increase the volume it's gonna be more powerful but as you decrease it it's just gonna fade away very fast so that's something to be noted now does that mean that it's gonna take a hit on sound quality it's really hard to describe that especially when you're gaming because for example in battlefield 1 which a fast-paced game everything just happened so fast so it's really hard to break it down because you have you know great audio quality but also this haptics just sort of fuse together giving you this really interesting immersion effect and again it sounds great but if I were to just describe it from a sound signature perspective just but especially when listening to you know songs or anything like that these headphones are more bass heavy and they don't necessarily crush the high frequencies but the mids could do some work because you know if Razer could tune it a little bit to give it a little more body to the sound that would have been nice but overall they sound pretty good it's not like revolutionary or anything like that but again I think the main star of the show with an Ori ultimate is the hypersense technology moving on to battery life and I'm gonna say it's decent so with the haptics and RGB lighting turned on expect up to 8 hours of battery life but with those 2 disabled you can get a little bit over 20 hours which is still a little bit on the lower side so you have to make sure that you plug it in every night so that you can use it the next day I did wish if Razer included some sort of wireless charging method especially if they integrated you know Qi charging it would have been nice to sort of place it on a base station or something like that oops I just hit the keyboard and the last thing to cover here is Razer synapse off we're all at all it's a pretty good experience with controls for things like 3d spatial audio and all the other features you'd expect another nice addition is the ability to control the haptic feedback intensity which I ended up setting to 60% in games and 20% for music setting it to 100% at times did feel a little bit too powerful but I'm glad that it's at least customizable the lighting tab allows you to adjust the brightness of the LED and of course cycles between three different effects like static breathing and spectrum cycling I still don't understand why RGB lighting should exist on a headset but it is there if you need it and it is nice and subtle the output is diffuse evenly and when you turn it off it doesn't really show that there are LED lit in the first place so that's pretty cool the one thing I feel that was missing is a battery percentage to read out since the small icon just isn't good enough to tell exactly how much is remaining and so guys this brings us to the conclusion and the Nari Ultimates by Razer is certainly an interesting product for 2018 because for one the main key selling feature of this headset is Razer's hypersense technology that actually gives you a dynamic real-time haptic feedback when you're gaming and it's just awesome it's it doesn't feel you know as consistent it's actually responds to different frequency ranges within a gameplay and you really have to feel it for yourself in person for other content consuming stuff like listening to music it's it again depends on the type of genre you're listening to in some cases it gets a little annoying in some cases it's actually pretty good but I really have to get props to Razer for actually trying out something new or you know trying something different with their gaming headset and I should mention that Razer isn't the first brand to implement this sort of technology on a headset we've seen other brand startup implement this on other gaming peripherals and you know the community has received it had they have received an interesting feedback in the community so there is a price to pay for this headset $200 is a lot it's it's it hurts but if you're looking for something with a little bit more immersion that will give you that that extra oomph when it comes to gaming then sure the Nari Ultimates is certainly worth trying out provided that you're okay with sacrificing some of the corks that I mentioned earlier in the review so that's it for me thank you so much for watching let me know what you guys think about the nari Ultimates would you actually consider spending $200 for a headset that gives you a real-time haptic feedback if so I'd love to know your thoughts in the comments I'm you birth hundred connects thank you so much for watching make

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we are checking out the brand new Echo Show 10. I'm so excited about this because I've been such a huge fan of all of the Echo Show products since the very beginning. A huge thank you to Amazon for sponsoring this video. Let's un-box and get to it. (upbeat music) What is up? Dude, look at this! Oh, this is cool. This is gonna be real cool! Let's plug in, set up, and get going. What if I, oh! Things are happening already! (mystical music) Hey! What's up? Nice tilt action. This is cool. All right, let's get you all set up. It's previewing the motion. It's saying don't move or unplug your device. (upbeat music) \"Now use the slider to set the position. \"This is where the screen will face when not in use.\" That's nice. Hello? Alexa? Are you there? - [Alexa] Yes, I'm here. - I don't even know (gasps). Alexa, take a picture. (beeping) (camera clicks) Like, look at this. See that? It's beautiful. Really my best work. Alexa, follow me. - [Alexa] Following is now on. - This is gonna keep me entertained for a very, very long time. So this is not gonna be her final home here in the office. I'm gonna actually put this in the kitchen on my center island, which is gonna be a perfect little home for you. (upbeat music) One of the things that I love so much about using the Echo Show is how much it helps me with my productivity. And also if you guys don't know, I like to shop on Amazon quite a lot. I mean, I basically buy pretty much everything from Amazon. So this makes it super easy to not only track my shipments, but I can order things just with my voice. I can add things to my shopping cart. And this is also a really great kitchen companion. I wouldn't say that I'm the most incredible chef ever, but I have the ability to ask my sous chef any questions that I want. Like, Alexa, how many ounces are in a pound? - [Alexa] One pound is 16 ounces. - See? I would've never been able to figure that out without her. Another really cool thing is you're able to actually get recipes. And the fact that this has motion control, if I'm trying to cook and do things around the kitchen, I can constantly have this device follow me. So if I need to be able to have access to the recipe that she's pulling up on her screen, I can easily do that. Alexa, how long should I cook some baked chicken for? - [Alexa] Here's what I found: it is recommended to bake untrussed chicken in the oven for 10 minutes per pound at 500 degrees Fahrenheit, and to rest for 10 minutes, until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Was that helpful? - Yes! Alexa, what should I make for dinner? - [Alexa] For dinner, here's a few recipes. - Slow cooker ribs. That looks interesting. I think I'm gonna go with the pasta. And now I have this recipe here. I can save the recipe. - [Alexa] Recipe saved. - Even add this to my shopping list. - [Alexa] Okay, I have added all ingredients to your shopping list. - Like, what is life? I can also have full access to my shopping list if there's something else that I want to add other than everything that I need right here to make this recipe. Alexa, add Yerba mate to my shopping list. - [Alexa] Yerba mate added to your shopping list. - So you can see that not only did I add that, but I've also got everything to make that pasta dish. Many of you obviously know this device as an entertainment device, so you can watch videos, movies, you can watch Twitch. You can also use it to play music, which is one of the top things that I also use this for. This is also a really great smart home hub. So you can connect your lights to it, and anything else that is Alexa-enabled, you'll be able to control with your voice. For me, I basically use it to control most of the lights in my house. I also listened to a lot of audio books. So this is also connected to Audible. I'm able to pick up where I left off on any books that I'm currently listening to. But the number one thing that I really, really use this for is staying connected with my friends and my family. I'm gonna call my sister now, so I can give you guys a demo of how not only the tracking works, but what it looks like when you're actually on a call and you're moving around walking. - [Alexa] Calling Jenna Ezarik's Alexa devices. - Yeah, let's go get her. Let's go get her. (bright beeping) Is that Jenna? - How's it going? - [Justine] Good, look at me, look at me! Can you see me? - Yeah, I can see you. I can see you, I can hear you. - [Justine] Yeah, well look at this. (upbeat music) - [Jenna] Mine doesn't do that. - [Justine] Yeah, cause you don't have an Echo Show 10! - [Jenna] Whoa, that's cool! - Yeah, and it even will zoom in on me. So like if I'm over here, I'm just chilling. It's like, yo. - Huh. - [Justine] It's pretty cool, huh? - That's pretty cool. Maybe I need to upgrade mine. What are you guys doing over there? - You know, stuff. - [Jenna] I do. - [Justine] Oh. - Whoa. That's pretty cool, I'm jealous. - You wanna see my fridge? Let me show you. - [Jenna] Sure. Any Yerbas in there? - Of course. (laughs) - [Jenna] (gasps) Look at all those drinks! - Tyler made apple pizza with apricot jelly jam and homemade bread. Homemade dough. - [Jenna] Oh my gosh. - Tyler from the other room said that he's bringing some for you later, so stay tuned. Hey, do you wanna see my microwave? (upbeat music) (laughs) - [Jenna] That's nice! That's very nice. - Thank you! That's nice, isn't it? - [Jenna] Okay, well I've got to go. - That was fun. I'll see you later! - [Jenna] All right, bye! - Bye! Well thank you guys so much for watching. I had so much fun checking out this new Echo Show 10. I'll put a link in the description if you guys want to check this out, or any other Echo Show products. I would love to hear from you guys, though. What is your favorite Echo Show product? Do you have some, do you not have any? And if you don't have one, which one is on your wishlist? If you guys enjoyed this video, make sure you give it a thumbs up and hit the bell so you'll be notified when I post a new video, and be sure to subscribe. And I will see you guys in the next one.

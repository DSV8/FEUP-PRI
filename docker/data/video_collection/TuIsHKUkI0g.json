    "transcript": "- One of the advantages (graphics swish) of Kali Linux, is that you can run it on different types of platforms. (soft music) As an example, here, I'm running it on an Android phone. Rootless installation of Kali. Didn't have to root the phone, simply runs directly on Android. I could run it on a Raspberry PI as an example. Here, I'm running it on the Windows 11 computer using WSL. Here, I'm running it on the Windows 11 computer using VMware Workstation Player. I could use parallels on a Mac as an example, to run Kali. Many, many options. You could boot off a USB stick. (graphics fuzzing) (electronic music) (graphics fuzzing) Now, rather than boring you going through all those options, use the links below if you wanna see my other videos, where I'll show you as an example, how do you install Kali on a Raspberry Pi. Or, how to dual boot using a USB drive, or how to install it on a phone. In this video, I'm gonna show you one of the newer options, where you can very easily and very quickly get Kali up and running on Linode. Now, please note that this is a sponsored video. (soft music) I wanna thank Linode for supporting me. Helps me create more content, helps me buy phones, such as this Android phone, to demonstrate how to install Kali. You can use the link below to get a $100 60-day credit. So if you wanna sign up for a Linode account, use the link below. Linode isn't the only option. But this is a very simple installation. Let's see how long it takes me to get Kali up and running on Linode. Okay, let's get started. Go to Marketplace, and select Kali Linux. Very, very simple installation. When you scroll down, you'll be asked to create a VNC user. We're gonna use VNC to connect to the remote server running in the cloud from our local computer. I'll show you firstly using screen sharing on a Mac. You could also use VNC Viewer on Windows as an example. So, I'm gonna specify a password. We're then asked, \"Would you like to install the Kali Everything Package?\" I'd like to do that, so I'm gonna specify Yes. If you don't do that, you'll just get a minimal installation, which is fine, if you want a lightweight server. But if you want all the tools, then select that option. I'm gonna set up VNC to access the Kali desktop. That's what we wanna do. I'm not gonna set up a SSH public key. I'm not gonna set up a token. I wanna keep this very, very simple. The image that we're gonna use is Kali. For the region, select a service close to where you are. In my example, it's gonna be London, UK. You could use a dedicated CPU. I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna use a shared CPU. Be careful. You cannot use the small node if you go for a full installation. In other words, if you select Kali Everything, don't select a small node. Select something with enough disc space. So in my example, I'm gonna go for Linode 4 gig, shared CPU. That gives me 4 gigs of RAM, 80 gigs of disc space. That's enough for the full installation. I'm gonna call this kalicloud1. I'll specify my route password. And that's it really. You can click Create Linode to create to the Linode server. (graphics fuzzing) Now, a few things to be aware of. The server is now being provisioned. You can connect to the server using SSH, as soon as it comes up. But you need to give it time to install all the required packages. So in my example, I'll paste in that SSH command. It's not gonna work because it needs to be provisioned. As soon as that's provisioned, I'll be able to access the server. But it won't be ready, you need to give it time. In the documentation, we're told that you need to give it 45 to 60 minutes to get set up. You need to wait for the installation to complete, and don't power off or restart the Linode server. Okay, mine's running now. So, let's try and connect to the server. I'll put my password in. And notice we're told that this is a minimal installation. If you see that, you need to wait. We going to see a command that allows us to set up the SSH tunnel, to allow us to VNC to the server. You need to wait 'til you see that. If you wanna see the progress, you can launch the console. And what you'll see here, is that it's busy downloading the software. So, you've basically just gotta wait for the software to install. We told in the documentation that we need to wait until we see the login prompt. So, you can watch us if you like, but at this point, I'm gonna pause the video, and go and get a coffee. It's gonna take 45 minutes to 60 minutes to install. (graphics fuzzing) (airy music) (beans shuffling) (graphics whoosh) (coffee trickling) (droplet plops) (graphics fuzzing) And there you go. We can see a login prompt. So, now that that's been done, I'll go back to my Mac console. I'll exit out of this session, and SSH back to the server. Log back in. And notice we're now told how to connect via VNC using the SSH tunnel. So, all we need to do is copy this command. Linode have made it really easy. Because literally, we just gonna copy that command to a terminal. So, I'll open up another terminal. And I'll paste that in. And press Enter. (keyboard key clicks) I'll put in my password. So, back in the documentation, (graphics whoosh) we're told that we (keyboard keys clicking) can connect to (graphics whoosh) our local host on port 61000. So, use \"Your preferred VNC viewer application.\" What I'm gonna use in this example is a screen sharing app on (keyboard keys clicking) my Mac. I'm gonna connect it to localhost:61000. I'm asked to put in my password. In this case, I'll remember it. 'Cause it's just a test system. (graphics fuzzing) And there you go, we've got Kali Linux up and running. Now, I don't like the look of that. So, I'm going to upgrade this server. So, what I'll do is, I'll close that connection down. What I'm gonna do is look at the Kali Linux FAQs for the GUI. And what I'm gonna do is install the latest version of the GUI. So, I'll copy that command. And I'll put that command below. But basically, I'm gonna paste that in. And essentially, what this is gonna do is upgrade the Kali installation, and give me the latest version of the GUI. While I'm waiting for that, I'll exit out of my WSL instance on my Windows computer. And what I'll do is open up a command prompt. What this will allow me to do as well, is connect to the server. So on Windows, I could use the same command to access the server. So as soon as this is finished updating, I'll do that. (rewinding electronic music) Okay so, software has been installed. I'll do a pseudo shut reboot now to reboot the server. I'll open up the SSH connection. And then open up screen sharing. Connect to the local host, and log into the server. And there you go. So, you can see that I've got information gathering, vulnerability analysis, all the tools that you would expect running directly on the Linode server. What I'll do on the Windows computer. So, I'm controlling this Windows computer from my Mac. I'll connect that connection. And then what I'll do on the Windows client is run VNC Viewer. localhost:61000. I'm warned that the connection is not encrypted, but that's fine because it's encrypted across SSH. I'll put in my password. Quality's quite bad. I'll change that to high quality, click OK. That looks better. So under applications, you can see the same thing. And what you'll notice is, whether I'm using Windows or Mac, it's mirroring the information from one to the other. So, what I've got here is a connection from my Windows computer to the Linode server, as well as from my Mac to the Linode server. Both using SSH connections. If I wanted to close that, I could simply CTRL+C on the Mac. And notice the connection on the Mac is broken. No longer got a connection. But the Windows connection is still up. And in Windows, I'll press CTRL+C to break that connection as well. And what you'll notice, the connection is now broken on the Windows computer. So, I can simply break those SSH connections, and I no longer have access. If I connect back again, put in my password, my connection is restored back on my Mac. I'll do the same thing in Windows, connect back. And hopefully, my connection will be restored on the windows computer. And there you go. I've got the connection restored on Windows, and on my Mac. Okay, so that took a bit longer than I anticipated, but I've now shown you how to set up a Kali Linux virtual machine on Linode. Be aware, please, are some of the caveats. Number one, you're gonna get charged for this device, whether it's on or off. If you don't wanna be charged the fee for the device, then delete it. You need to set up the SSH tunnels. You will need to wait 45 minutes or 60 minutes for the connection. If you connect via SSH, and you don't see this option telling you how to set up the SSH tunnel, then you need to wait. You could also go through the console directly on the web interface, and wait for the login prompt. That's the way that Linode recommended you do it. Now, as mentioned, you can install Kali on a phone. You can use WSL. You could use a virtual machine, you can use a Raspberry Pi. There are many options. But you may wanna run Kali in the cloud. And this is a nice, easy way to do it. Very, very simple, ready to get this up and going. Hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, please like it.

    "transcript": "(eerie noise) - All right. I got to the park and I'm about to have my very first flight with a DJ FPV. It could happen could have had to happen. I don't think it was entirely my fault but let's just get into it. This is the DJ FPV. (dramatic music) - So ever since drones reached the mainstream, it became an easy way for videographers, and photographers, to get perspectives, they could have only dream of, or, you know would need to rent a helicopter for, at the same time the first person view or FPV drones, and racing drones were slowly establishing their presence. - We live in the age of drones. - A new sport is emerging at breakneck speed. - It was a niche DIY community at first, then drone racing league started popping all over the place, eventually it got picked up by ESPN, but that DIY culture, still remained a big part of the sport. Nowadays, FPV racers, started using their hard earned skills, also for filming purposes, and creating this new trend among drone pilots, which is cinematic FPVs Now the world's biggest consumer, drone company DJI, is ready to hop on that trend, and is releasing its first FPV drone. The drone is bundled together with DJI's existing goggles, and the brand new controller. The whole $1,300 kit is tailored towards experience FPV pilots, but also newcomers like myself, looking to up their drone game. So let's take of look at how DJS FPV kit compares to the rest of the market, and also let's find out how easy or hard it is to learn to fly FPV's in less than two weeks. So the first selling price of the system is the simplicity. No need to know how to build your own drone, calibrate motors, get the transmitters right, get the balance right, It really is as plan and play as it gets. The drone is heavier than most FPV drones and that's due to this hefty battery. But the battery, is also a big selling point for DJI. It has a runtime of 20 minutes. And if you're used to standard drones like you know Mavics or Phantoms or Parrots, you might think that this is short, but if you're used to FPV drones, this is actually a significant upgrade, from what you normally get, which varies from three minutes, for a very tiny drones, to around 10 to 15 minutes, for larger activities. It's also DJI's intelligent battery, meaning that this charge is after a few days when not in use, to maximize the slice. Another plus for you who just don't wanna deal with proper battery etiquette. So usually in my drone reviews I often spend a lot of time pixel peeping, talk about image quality of drone cameras. What you need to know is that it shares the same sensor, as the mini two, except this FPV, can film 4k at 60 frames per second, instead of 24 frames per second. So you can slow down footage for those thrilling close calls. And if you ever want it even slower you can also shoot slow motion, at 120 frames per second at 1080P. And overall the camera's really good. It is great in good light, and not so great in low light. Also it has electronic image stabilizer built in. I do wish you used a better camera, with a larger sensor, but I get it, It's DJI's first that free drone, and if it ends up being successful, it's safe to assume, we'll see a more diverse lineup in the future. The camera is mounted on a one axis gimbal, and it has a super eye view of 150 degrees compared to 83 degrees that you normally get on that magnitude for example. You can also actually see the ends of your propellers, in your footage, which is great for gauging how close you are to certain obstacles while flying, but obviously not so great for overall aesthetic, in the final clip. You can either choose to remove it in post-production, or apply a lens correction in the menu in the goggles, which will also get rid of these very, very distorted edges. But I personally kind of liked that Look, even with propellers in there. The biggest difference between DJI's FPV and most other FPV's, is the image transmission. First, DJI FPV drone, is relying on digital transmission, which had introduced in December of 2019. Most started FPV drones drones, they rely on analog transmission. The downside of analog transmission, is that it doesn't allow for long distance flying, but it is very low latency, which takes precedence over range. However, DJI is using its audio sync technology here, and from my experience over the past few weeks, like always, it's been great, but it's actually hasn't been as good as with some of the other DJI drones. At a few random points, I did notice some certain appearance with the image, where the image would get pixelated, and I would just have to stop for a few beats, before I continued flying. And these goggles were into these last year too. And they look interesting. I'm getting a very Christopher Nolan Neo, bad meniscal vibe from it. I can't help feeling like a complete idiot wearing them, but Peter said, it looks badass. I'll just trust him on that one. There's the joystick, and a back button, and the record button and the display is eight, 10 P, at 120 frames per second. It really looks crisp and smooth. Lastly, there's this new controller, that is almost half the size of other FPV controllers, and it looks good, and it feels good. You can pop the back so you can adjust the tightness, of the joysticks as well. And there's this optional motion controller, which I'll be honest, I didn't have time to test, or any interest in testing it, I just feel more comfortable with a standard controller at this point. but there's one thing I can tell you about both of these is that, neither charge with a USBC, to USBC cable just use BA to USBC cable, and it's infuriating, I just don't get it. So once again, this whole kit will cost around $1,300, compared to some other options online, you can definitely get away with spending a lot less, until you feel more comfortable, flying an FPV. Tiny Hawk makes some of the best beginner FPV drones, and they're started $99, without a controller and goggles that is. But he feared the level, where you feel already comfortable flying, I think that this price is comparable for what's out there. Okay. That should cover all the horror things you need to know. If you have more questions, be sure to drop them below. But yeah, let's talk about the flying experience of this thing. (uptown music) So there are three modes you can fly this drone in, normal sport, and fully manual. Normal is basically how you fly any other DJI drones, and the speed is capped at, 50 kilometers per hour, conversion here. Sport mode is simplified FPV mode, and it's a lot faster than normal mode, which speeds up to, 97 kilometers per hour. And the drone would hold altitude in both of these modes, and kind of balance itself out. And lastly, there's this manual mode, which allows you to do the things like this. It can reach speeds up to 140 kilometers per hour, and it has acceleration of zero to 60, in under two seconds. Here, you'll have to get comfortable, controlling your altitude, and the throttle yourself, which is what FPV Kyle call ACRA mode. And I'm nowhere near being good at. Okay. Before we go any further, I have to stress this again. This is my first time flying an FPV. I always had an interest in it, especially once I started seeing FPV races, transitioning into the cinematic FPV world. Like that footage looks so cool. And DJI isn't aiming this drone races, but for people to get comfortable with FPV's or trying to make that step into the FPV world, but were maybe discouraged by the DIY aspect of it all, like myself. And DJI is really trying to kinda hold your hand throughout this whole process, until you become more comfortable with flying in a fully manual mode, which obviously takes hours, and days, and weeks, of flying through just mastering. But it's not to say that you cannot have fun with other modes. You might pass two weeks with it, I've been making baby steps getting more comfortable with the manual mode, so instead of me telling you about it, we'll talk to someone who's actually good at this stuff. - The pacing felt actually pretty on point, - That's Razor Kunyama. He's been flying FPV drones since 2017, around Bay area. - It's it feels surprisingly similar. It's about the same weight as my usual drone, has really good forward flight characteristics I would say, I think that's due to the aerodynamics of the body, but yeah, it felt pretty good in terms of FPV, the digital transmission is working great, for the area that we're flying in, even behind some trees, compared to analog, it's pretty clean. Great being able to fly 20 minutes, compared to the usual three to five. - So what do you get on your drone? - About three to five minutes and maxing out at about, the same speed as well. So it's impressive that you can reach the same speed, but achieved 20 minutes. I think there were a few differences that were, not really flight characteristic related, but mainly just the buttons, and switches, and setting all that up. But once they, I think, they allow a bit more options, to kind of mimic, what we're usually used to, I think then it'll probably be, just about perfect. - One thing I forgot to mention is that this drone also has obstacle avoidance sensor which is not that common for FPV's, but they only work in manual mode, as you're getting more comfortable with flying, and they don't work in sport boat as you can tell by that crash. And if you lose control, or need to come to a full stop, there is an emergency brake, on the controller which I obviously didn't have time to press here. And it's entirely my fault for crashing a drone. I wonder on a tree without knowing what's on the other side, and I am surprised though, that the drone didn't automatically turn off the motorist, but it kept ramming itself into the ground, and I think most damage came out of that. DJI's tell me that this shouldn't be the case, and hopefully it's just an early software bug, but it's a pretty serious one number. And if you're like me and you wreck this drone, you can replace a lot of the items yourself, that includes the top housing shelf, which you get in the box, arms, propellers, and gimbal and camera module. I replaced all of them except the gimbal and the arm, since I didn't have extra ones. And all of those replacable parts, can be ordered from DGI directly. Actually, I think it's easier if I just show you this list, which has every accessory, and every item as per kit, that you can buy separately, from DGI and the prices too. And overall, the drone feels extremely responsive, like an FPV drone. For someone who loves their mini two because of its size, and how it feels in the air, especially in sport mode, the transition to FPV, didn't actually feel that daunting. Again, I'm nowhere near the level I want to be, but my initial anxiousness, disappeared rather quickly. So I have to admit, I'm completely hooked. Like every time I walk around the city or go anywhere, all I can think about, is where I can fly this drone, which little look I can try to, squeeze it in, and so forth. But it sounds to me that I'm more hooked into the FDF flying any FPV, not exclusively this trout. will I get this myself? Is actually a loaded question. Yes, it's very pricey for it to be my starter drone. But again, DJI accumulated, some of its best tech in it. It is such a simple system to use, and for a newcomer, it is much more approachable than some of the other options out there. And there are also other standard issues when it comes to any drone. Laws in your country, the area you live in, how much you actually get you sign it in, and you'll need a few more batteries, so the price goes up, also you probably assumed this already, but I should point it out just in case. The system isn't really portable. I'm actually surprised DGI Isn't selling a carrying case already. If you're familiar with FPV drones, I think you cannot go wrong with the VJ FPV. It does everything right. And it also allows you to depend on your preference. Do you like mounting a GoPro instead of using the built-in DJI camera, or maybe you just enjoy the DIY aspect of customizing your drones. For me, it's been an absolute blast of flying this around, and yeah, sometimes it's also been very stressful, but rewarding. But for many of you, myself included, it might be worth spending a little bit more time, in FPV simulators, before spending a little bit more money on this whole kit. But once I feel ready, DJF has got to be on top of my list. Hey everyone, thank you for watching the video, and that's first, and second is that I have crashed my second reader unit, DJI FPV, and I feel absolutely terrible, and sad and demoralized, but yeah, AMA in the comments.",

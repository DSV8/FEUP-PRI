    "transcript": "hello everybody I'm Dmitry with Hardware Canucks welcome to another CES video I've just arrived - Lian Li you know meeting up with the people who have designed the case of the year for 2018 so around on applause here we have their Debauer in the background it's really cool to get the brief with the people but first huge thanks to our sponsors Thermaltake Phanteks Corsair Razor and MSI for making this trip possible alright so the first item on the list is this desk the DK-04-f so the cool thing about this desk right now is that they have a new liquid crystal layer applied below the glass so that you can go from foggy to crystal with a press of a button hey who took the remote where's the remote mint or is it the oh it's right here so right now we have this remote but the eventual control will be sort of integrated into this touch panel that also has some fan control and LEDs that you'll be able to connect from your main system but check this out boom I hope that worked yes now it reveals the entire system below it so the desk itself has not changed much but they did have a new power supply that is sole purpose is to trigger the crystal rotation because that you know of the press of button it turns the crystal 90 degrees which is why we can not see them and see them again and because this crystal layer the actual glass is a little bit foggy by default so it's not crystal clear but the foggy is the unique element and that's the original desk it is fully motorized so we have the control box here we can set four different presets and yeah that is the dk-04-f take suite so we are of course treated with some beverages here at Lian Li but Roman here what do you have what type of saying they have in Germany yeah we say that three beer are also a schnitzel so I would agree all right the Razer Edition is ready let's go check it out so this is the case of the year the O11 dynamic razer edition a few changes here are of course the LED strips on the side spending that entire glass illuminating that middle Razer logo and this corner edge which looks awesome they of course have added the neon the standard sort of reference style illumination under glow for all Razer edition cases obviously all that money and research and development for the Razer green USB ports have not gone wasted that is also here and this new sort of coating that is fully black so if you're going for this whole matte black design and some LED the Razer Edition 11 dynamic may be your choice and it looks like you know the old leaven dynamic has been so popular among the water cooling community that ek has designed their own water block that goes onto this entire front panel and their multiple cool elements here is because this whole thing is completely transparent basically which is very difficult to do we also have this multiple distribution plate so you can see how the liquid goes from one place to another from your GPU to the CPU and we also have a flow meter and a pump built-in so a lot of cool things inside this front water block from ek for a particular for the O11 dynamic Lian Li's also going to be releasing an all-in-one cooler so this one's different because the pump has been relocated from your traditional space over here all the way up top where your reservoir so the pump is stronger which means that you know the flow rate of the liquid will be higher and therefore performance will be better but the you know the concern right now is because of this extension so if you populate fans right here it will cover the whole thing and there's also a bit of length extension about 30 millimeters but this is what looks like installed inside the case so if you have the fans pushing air through the radiator it's not really an issue but what if you mount these fans on the other side then this whole space becomes a little bit you know awkward but what do you guys think about this design of course a stronger pump means better performance so yeah we'll see you when this thing launches and another interesting aesthetic element is this water block cover so it's magnetic just attaches inside to reveal the ring of illumination which looks really nice and even and soft and removing it gives us a little bit more of that if you're into that and then the last two cases are pretty impressive so this is the tu150 and the slightly larger 11 ROG edition with a bunch of other model names attached to it but first let's check out tu150 this really nice compact ITX enclosure that tries to go ahead after the market who want a handle yet still have this nice compact element with full graphics card support SFX and SFX L power supply on the interior and 175 millimeters for CPU tower clearance which is awesome so airflow is kind of covered because we have either 120 or 140 millimeter fans at the front and then the rear section as well so airflow will be linear it is Chad you know kind of targeting towards airflow users air cooling users but you can still maybe do a 140 120 all-in-one for the front the GPU section we have three slots over here so that's not really an issue and because the SFX SFX L power supplies are mounted above that's not really an issue for clearance we also have this low space beside the motherboard for cable management and a to reveal an SSD which is cool so there are some visual elements in there and my favorite part aside from the handle like if that's into you you can remove the top panel and that is where all your cable management is sort of routed through so that's a really unique way to hide the cable so they're not behind the case making it pretty slim and yet gives you you know more channels than normal to just basically hide everything that you need from the power supply and then finally we have the O11 ROG certified revision 2 so it's basically the O11 dynamic that's been sort of enlarged both in height and width to support let's say 120mm fans at the back so that's awesome if you want to have a little additional airflow over here or installed radiators or fans there the actual bottom section has been expanded so you can mount a giant radiator in push-pull situations and the really clever band bracket that is installed from the case on a little bit of an angle so you don't need to fiddle around with like trying to insert it from the top that's appreciated in terms of the rest of the specifications it simply follows the same O11 dynamic Mattel the motherboard trace like indented so all the rubber grommets are on the sides for easy cable management they have installed new covers on the side mount which means that you can either cover them up or for a little SSD action or open them up for that you know traditional side exhaust the ventilation design on the top has been changed to kind of complement this whole ROG direction and in the front we now have additional IO at the bottom so two additional USB 3 ports alongside that's you know original iOS facing over here with type C and color combination control for the RG Edition and they're still kind of debating on where to install the LEDs potentially either at the bottom or on the side so let us know what you might prefer this is going to be a premium edition so of $1.99 versus the 129 for the O11 dynamic which means that the exterior paneling is all going to be aluminum and like steel on the previous versions and we're gonna have this included vertical GPU brackets so you can install multiple GPUs vertically and it looks like a robust combination so you can mount the the whole base to the actual frame and you can even remove the little piece of the back so that if you do have the card that is closest to the side panel it's not going to interfere with whatever I oh you're trying to plug into it so a nice clever design alright guys so that is all from Lian Li has been great to meet with Roman and look who shows up and gates very nice that's how you randomly meet here yes at CES all the time little somewhere but yeah thanks so much for watching it's great to have these fellows in here and I will see you guys in next video yeah",

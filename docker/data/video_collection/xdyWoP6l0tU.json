    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is. Matt, phones are folding now and I like it. - Yeah, technology never creases to amaze me. - Creases? (ken laughing) Creases, you... (Matt laughs) (beeps) So I just got back from spending some time with the brand new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, which for the record, can I say is a terrible name? I keep wanting to call it the Galaxy Z fold. - But there was already a Fold. - Yes, it doesn't fold, it flips. So, essentially what you're getting here is a folding display. With the Z Fold it's actually a glass display, and we'll get into your crease in a minute, but I think there's a legitimately really good use case for folding phones. And specifically with the Z Flip, I think it's the best folding phone yet. - How do you think it stacks up to the Moto Razr, because that's really the only one-to-one comparison we have right now. - So, I went to the launch event of the Razr, what, two or three months ago, and on top of it being, by far, the worst launch event I have ever gone to with terrible lighting and Diplo playing 10 feet away from where I was trying to record my video, the Razr itself, hardware wise I like the design, but the execution isn't as good, and the specs and the performance are nowhere near on the same level. - Just looking at the image of the two of them, I like the Razr more than the flip, just, again, looking at specs aside and everything like that. - Well the thing is, with the Razr, it has the nostalgia, right? I mean, I dunno about you, but I grew up wanting a Razr. - [Matt] Again, the Moto is the only one that actually looks different. - Just before we go really deep into this, there are essentially two styles of folding phones right now. There is what Samsung has done with the Galaxy Fold last year, which is-- - With the hotdog. The hotdog. - Okay. Essentially, it's a phone which is roughly the same size as a standard smart phone except it opens up to be essentially a small tablet. Or there's the Razr or the Z Flip, which is essentially, when you open it up, it's the same size as a normal smart phone, but when you fold it, it's roughly half the size, which, can I just-- - Hamburger, hotdog. - Okay, I actually like that. My biggest takeaway with the Z Flip and the Razr as well, but mostly with the Z Flip, is that is a more useful form factor. And now, I know that I'm very much probably in the minority here, I think a lot of people prefer to have something different with the Fold with that huge screen, but for me, I actually like having a phone which is smaller. - I'm with ya on that train of thought. I mean, me being, I draw a lot and everything like that, as soon as the Fold was announced, I wanted an S Pen with it. And I thought this is a place where they can kinda differentiate the S line and the Note line again, because how long has it been since there's really been a difference between the two lines? - Yeah, yeah, my main thoughts going into this, just so we're purely from having hands-on time with all three of these phones, but more recently, of course, with the Z Flip, it is the best folding phone yet. Now, it is also $1,400, but it's the cheapest because the Razr is $1,500 and the Galaxy Fold is $2,000. - Are we really gonna award them a point for being the cheapest of the most expensive phones on the market? - No, but it is coming down. I can see a year from now, folding phones hitting the, maybe 1,000 to $1,200 market, which is very much in the same sort of realm as a lot of major flagships. In fact, what they also announced yesterday or the day before, depending on when you're watching this, is the Samsung Galaxy S 20 Ultra, which is the super high end standard form factor flagship. And that is also starting at $1,400. So, we're in that sort of same ballpark, even though, and I'll get into this a little bit later, but the Z Flip actually does lose out on some features. Looking at the Z Flip versus the new Galaxy S20s, it does not have the same processor, it doesn't have as much memory, it does not have 5G support. It also does not have as big of a battery, and it does not have the same cameras. You are making some sacrifices for the form factor. - I get that there's, it's a new technology. With how much you're not getting, the Flip should be the same as maybe the S20. - Like $1,000. - But for 1,400 bucks, it's already obsolete. - Well, I mean, yeah, it depends on your perspective. - Everything right now is 5G, 5G, 5G, and you're buying a phone that's not the current technology just for a novelty. - So, one of the things with all of these folding phones is that you actually have to split the battery, especially with the ones like the Razr and with the Z Flip, because you have two fairly small component areas where you can put things in, so it has a pair of batteries which combined are 3,300 milliamp hours. I'm curious to see, I actually think that that should be okay. I don't this screen or anything about this thing is gonna be crazy power hungry, but it won't be great. It'll be fine, and if you add 5G, I just don't think it would be able to hold up as well. - Well, I mean, yeah, that 3,300, because if you're closing the phone, the screen is turned off, correct? - Yeah, yeah. - So, your screen on-time is what kills your battery. - Look at the Razr, the Razr has a much larger screen on the front. And obviously, if you look at the Galaxy Fold, it had a proper, actual real smartphone screen. You can use the Galaxy Fold closed, mind you, it's a very weird, small screen, but you actually can use it properly closed, whereas the Z Flip is not like that at all. - It's interesting with the Fold, because last generation of phone was, everything was how can we get the bezels to be smaller, smaller, smaller, and now you have the fold, which has the largest bezels of any smartphone, I think, period. - I like the look of the Razr. And in fact, the way they do the hinge is pretty clever if you're not Jerry-rig everything, and that the entire screen, because obviously, if you have something which opens and closes, there has to be a little bit of tension with the display. So essentially with the Razr, the screen actually goes in and out a little bit, so if you look on the bottom of the phone, it actually moves. - It actually lifts up, and you could see to the other side from underneath. - Which helps when you open it all the way up, the hinge kinda pulls it taught, so it's pretty, I mean, there's a little bit of a crease, there's not much. This does not happen on the Z Flip. In fact, I think, actually, Samsung has a much better sort of hinge in that not only does it have little fibers to keep dirt and dust from coming in, there's essentially no real area for the screen to kinda lift up. But on the downside, it means that you do have a crease. Kinda feels like you've got a screen protector which is slightly bubbly or whatever in the middle, but it's not bad. - So, the biggest complaint right now about any of the folding phones is how fragile they are. - So, in addition to those little fibers inside the hinge, the hinge is also much, much more durable, and it's very well enclosed. So looking at it, I don't think you're gonna have a lot of issues. Mind you, it still probably won't be as good as a standard sort of, what do we call it, candy bar style phone or whatever? The normal, the Galaxy S 20. - The slab. The slab, but it feels way better than the Galaxy Fold, and especially the Razr. With the Z Flip, I'm actually not super concerned with durability, first of all, because it has the best hinge of any of these folding phones, it has the most durable display. But also, think about it, a normal smartphone sits in your pocket with the screen exposed always, whereas with these phones, unless you're actively using them, as soon as you close them up, the screen actually has some pretty decent level of protection. So, while yes, I do have some concerns, any time you have moving parts you're introducing some risk of failure, but I actually feel reasonably confident that these phones will at least last for a while. - Jerry-rigged makes the joke like, make sure you vacuum out your pockets for dust, whatever, but there's still the things like lint or your keys in your pocket. If they were, for whatever, 'cause they're not full seals, there's still a gap there. - The Z Flip is close to a full seal. - It's close. - Not quite, but it's pretty close. - But lint could get in there, stuff like that. And if that's in there, in your pocket, grinding around on the screen, that could be a real problem. - Now obviously, I have not spent enough time with it. I just got 30 minutes of the hands-on. It feels significantly better than any other folding phone that I've tried, it seems to be, while not super up-to-date with 5G and all the specs of the Galaxy S20 for example, it is the most up-to-date spec. I mean, the Razr, for all the things I give it for it looks so cool and everything, the spec is terrible, the camera's garbage. There are major, major issues with it just fundamentally working as a phone. The Z Flip, while yes, you're losing out on some things, still has Snapdragon 855, still has Android, still has wireless charging, fingerprint sensor. It still is a pretty up-to-date phone if maybe not quite cutting edge, but it's still completely usable and it has good cameras which I think is a complete deal breaker for any phone, folding or not. So, while I don't wanna completely just say, \"Hey, go out and spend $1,400 \"on the Galaxy Z Flip right now,\" if this an interesting form factor to you, I think this is, by far, the best way to get into it, and really kind of experience something which is significantly different than any other smartphone out there. - If you're wholeheartedly endorsing... - I'm not, no, no, no, I am tentatively endorsing it to people who are interested in this form factor. It is the best version of this phone, not for everyone yet. - So then, what happens to the Galaxy Fold? Is that, - Oh, it's old. - is that even a thing that people should consider now? - No, you should not buy then gen one Galaxy Fold, but I say that more so because I think the gen two is coming. - Ignoring even gen one, what do you think is the better form factor? Is it hamburger or hotdog? - I like hamburger right now. I like Z Fold right now, Z Flip, flip. - Flip. - Flip, flip. (beeps) I think the Galaxy Fold and phones that actually have that sort of full tablet style experience, there's definitely advantages there, and I do think that we'll see that continue to evolve. Who knows, at the end of the day, that may actually win out as the ultimate form factor. For me though, I'm not a big fan of huge phones, and I think that the Galaxy Fold is kind of a little unwieldy already. If they can kinda slim it down and gen two, gen three kind of gets to become a little bit of a better compromise, I'm totally down with it. We'll see how this goes over the next couple years, but as of right now, beginning of 2020, I'm a big fan of the hamburger, not the hotdog. This is gonna be a really confusing metaphor. - Is a hotdog a sandwich? - We should make an entire episode all about that, and if you wanted to find out more about not only sandwiches, hotdogs, and tech news, make sure to subscribe to This Is so you'll be always kept up-to-date with Matt's weirdest ideas that we decide to shoot in the early morning hours. Thank you very much for watching, and until next time, don't forget...",

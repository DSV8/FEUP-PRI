    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to \"This Is.\" Austin, the year is 2025. Video games are at an all time high. They are at their peal performance. Who's ever heard of PS5 at this point? - PS what? That's that old thing that grandpa used to play, right? - Yes, because, the Xbox, will also be a console, that no one's heard about. - (laughs) Wait, that's how you do the intro, Matt? - I do the intros, I do 'em how I want. - Okay, here's the deal, right? We have seen a ton of hype around the Xbox and the PlayStation, just like every generation, right? Nothing special. You remember the lines, from when people were around the block trying to get their hands on a Wii? I mean, this is what always happens. But I think the situation when things shake out now, versus in 2025 is gonna be very different. Of course, this week, the really big news is that Microsoft have completed their acquisition of Bethesda. So Bethesda is now officially a Microsoft Studio. - Yes, $7.5 billion deal. - It's a lot of money. - It's not, I mean, whatever. - No, it's a lot. - It's pocket change. - Do you know how many zeros are in that? - I mean, I carry around that on a daily basis. - So there's a lot included in Bethesda, right? So before we go into the 2025 grand plan, I mean, think about games such as \"Fallout.\" Games such as the PS5 exclusive \"Death Loop\" is now a Microsoft-owned studio. - [Matt] I mean, \"Elder Scrolls.\" - [Austin] Yeah. - Probably the, I think that one is the biggest one. Whenever \"Elder Scrolls VI\" comes out, we have, I mean, there's been nothing. We've been waiting for that for years, but \"Skyrim\" keep being an incredibly popular game. - I mean, \"Skyrim\" does run on a toaster at this point, so - [Matt] Yes, yeah. We're like we have that toaster with a screen on it. I'm pretty sure \"Skyrim\" runs on that. - But the thing is, this is all part of a plan that the Microsoft and specifically the Xbox team have been putting together for years, right? There are multiple pillars to it. But this is what I think we're gonna be looking at in the year 2025, when it comes to the Xbox. Feel free to quote me on this, and pull up this clip and a video in 2025 where I am wildly wrong. But here's my thought, right? First of all, Microsoft has spent the last couple of years buying up a lot of studios. When you look at the Xbox One generation, the Xbox did not have exclusives. It just did not have exclusive. You had \"Forza,\" you had \"Halo.\" There was not a lot else. There were some indie titles. There were a few games that were around, but there weren't a lot. Whereas the PS4 had exclusive for days. And that was really the main reason to purchase the console. - We talked about it in a few videos ago, where console exclusives are kind of going away. - Yeah. - And now it's more, ecosystem exclusives where PC and Xbox are sharing console exclusives with the PC space. - PC wins, everything else loses. Thank you very much for watching. Make sure to subscribe and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling bell on \"This Is\" for other insightful commentary, such as, PC good, console bad. - I mean, people love the console people came out and got mad that we said the piece he was winning. - Yo, imagine if we just like end the video right now by just saying like, \"Xbox 2025, it's a PC. Thank you very much for watching.\" (laughs) - Funny you say that. Because now I'm gonna get back on my soap box when I often to, when we talk about what consoles are gonna come in the future generations. I'm gonna use Stadia. You guys are gonna say I I'm talking about Stadia. I'm just gonna use the controller. 2025-- - We're beating Xbox to death wit that? - We'll have like the Xbox Series X, X - Mark Two. The triple X. - The triple X. - Also introduced by The Rock. - The Xbox Series X Red Light Edition 'cause it's triple X, released in Amsterdam. I think what we'll get is a, like a Series S like mid grade, where it's, diskless version of the Series X with, - Okay. - Well, I think that's what we'll see first. I don't know if it makes a lot of, I mean, like the price difference is huge with the Series X and the Series S. But we've seen such a massive performance, like fall off on the S. I don't know if it makes sense to have the two of 'em right now. - So okay, so if we're gonna talk, there's a lot of things to talk about in the video. But let's talk about hardware first, right? 'Cause I will agree, in 2025, we will have new Xbox hardware. At that point, we will likely see, I'm gonna assume, as another version of an S and an X, right? Maybe the next version of the S is a little closer to the standard X in performance. And the X is another step up, right? I do think this as a precedent has been set that there are upgrades on the hardware front, there are mid cycle refreshes. You know, you'll have a game that is supporting Series S, Series X, maybe Series S + One. Like, these will be a thing. - So in 2025, the Series S is not gonna be the console that you know it. But instead, that's where they're gonna introduce the streaming console is on the S. So you'll get the performance of an X, but you'll have to deal with the latency, the video streaming. And then we'll get a more powerful X for a cheaper amount, because they'll have perfected the manufacturing cost of it. - So, am I gonna take you seriously with the tinfoil hat? Also, there is no reason why something like X Cloud will not be expanded beyond just Xbox, devices, right? - Yes. - I mean, it can be integrated into a TV, right? I believe LG OLEDs this year-- - [Matt] We're gonna have to have-- - [Austin] Have Stadia and GeForce Now built in, right? There's no reason why - Yeah, and Xbox has said that they are working on ma, on getting that app set up, integrating that. - It's going to be in Windows, right? I actually don't think consoles in the future are going to be cheaper, right? Now, yes, when there are sort of slim versions, it might be slightly cheaper. - You're right, I wanna revise what I said. It would be relatively cheaper because it's more powerful for the same price. That's what, I wanna revise my-- - Yeah, because essentially, there's actually a point that the Xbox team, in a discussion with them. They were kinda talking about how, the idea of this generation, why they went with the Series S at $300, which is a really aggressive price point, is that they foresee future sort of chip manufacturing to be more expensive, right? Once they sort of shrink it and shrink it, it is just going to be more expensive. And so I would not be surprised that the Series S at $300 is the cheapest Xbox we see for the sort of foreseeable future. They may have other versions, like a slim version of the X that might come a little closer to that. But I think we're gonna generally see prices increase not increase. So that is one of the things that will change. But what really is gonna matter here, beyond just the streaming, beyond just the hardware, are the games that you will be able to play on these consoles. You have so many titles that are, or so many studios, that are owned by Microsoft at this point, and certainly will be going forward into the future, right? I can see this being an arms race, where Microsoft are buying studios, and really using them, sure to sell games, but also to have these games come out on Windows devices and Xboxes and steering them away from the PlayStation. There is no doubt in my mind that a year from now, when the Xbox and the PlayStation 5 are readily available at every store and you can just walk in and pick it up just like you could with the Xbox One and the PS4. That the PS5 will have a lead, right? More people are interested in the PS5 than the Xbox right now. But think about how that momentum may change over the next three, four, five years, as more and more games that used to be cross-platform, start to come a little bit closer to the Xbox side, right? - And so recently, like this week, Phil Spencer was interviewed. He asked like, \"What's the, what is the plan?\" And he kinda waffled on, he's like, \"There's gonna be some exclusives, they're gon.\" But he was very vague on it. - [Austin] Which he should be 'cause why would you tell anyone at that time, your evil master plan to take over PlayStation? - I think that plan, I think that Microsoft doesn't know yet. Not in a, \"Oh, we have, we're just winging it.\" But I think they have a very calculated plan, that's gonna depend on the sales gap of, PS5 versus Xbox. We know that PS5 is probably way ahead. We don't have sales figures to confirm it, but like, we know. - The hype, - Yeah, the hype-- - Behind PlayStation is so much higher than Xbox. - So, you're right. If they have something like Bethesda exclusives, which are massive selling franchises, that could steer a lot of people towards Xbox. Yes, let's make those Xbox exclusive. But if the gap is tens of millions of units, I don't think it makes sense to try and be like, \"Okay, you know what? We're gonna take this one franchise, and we're gonna make an Xbox exclusive.\" Because that's not gonna bring tens of millions of people. It will close the gap a little bit. But if they may, if they say, \"Okay, well, we're still gonna release \"Skyrim\" or, you know, whatever \"Elder Scrolls VI\" is on everything,\" all those tens of millions of PS5 people, potentially are gonna buy a Microsoft owned software. - Yeah, which they'll make money on. - Yeah. - My thought is, they're probably gonna not go quite so like, hard-fisted, like, \"We're knocking out the PlayStation\" and instead approach more of a \"Call Of Duty\" angle, right? So you remember in the Xbox 360 generation. Stuff generally, first of all, ran better on the 360. But also a lot of the DLC came out for 360 first. In the PS4 generation they flipped. And then if you wanted to play the new maps or like certain new content would come to the PS4 first. You could still play the game on Xbox. And if you were patient, it was fine. I would be surprised if, the next \"Elder Scrolls\" game comes out on Xbox three months earlier, or has additional content, like, a lot of this is really driven by the perception of the game and the console. If I perceive that Xbox would be more powerful. If I perceive that Xbox to have the games coming sooner to it or the games are higher quality, that goes a long way. - Which right now, no one perceives the Xbox as more powerful. It is, but no one perceives it that way. - It is, but our friends over at Digital Foundry have found that while the Xbox Series X has more performance, right? The straight raw teraflops, the CPU performance, the lack of throttling, a lot of games it's actually delivering similar, if not slightly lower performance to PS5. - [Matt] Yes, right. - I will talk that up to early sort of builds. And maybe the PlayStation side of the house is a little bit more well-rounded on the actual development side at the moment. - Well, 'cause again, part of that is, first party development. That's what makes it so much easier to do that. We talk about this with Apple all the time of when your first party is developing the hardware, it's easier to have that synergy. I don't think it makes a ton of sense for Xbox to, to just be like, \"No, we're only,\" take all these besides the games, and all these other studios that they are buying up and say, \"We're only gonna do 'em on Xbox.\" I don't think it makes a ton of sense. - Maybe new IPs, right? Kevin Kenson on Twitter had a very good point how, it would be a cool idea if brand new IPs are Xbox exclusive. But the stuff that like, if you played an \"Elder Scrolls\" game in the past, you probably gonna wanna play in the future. Did you bring it out a PS5 or whatnot? But they bring it out again, I think. The PS5 version is worse or slower to come out than the Xbox version, just to give that Xbox a little bit extra shine. Like, that's me, that's absolutely what I would. - And they already have that little extra shine with Game Pass. - True, oh that's a good point. - All of, Microsoft's first party, soft, games, they come out on Game Pass day one, included in your $15 a month. - And we've gotta assume that Bethesda games are gonna be the exact same going forward. - Yes, and which we-- - We don't know that, we don't know. This is a speculation. - [Matt] Yeah, they - But it would makes sense. - [Matt] They mentioned that, yes. And, but then they were vague on like, which ones. So like, you know, like when \"Halo\" comes out when in 2025. - That's mean, but I can't argue with it. - No, it just keeps getting pushed back. That right there to me, it's extra shine. If I know I can get, \"Elder Scrolls VI\" day one on a service I'm already paying for it because if you are on Xbox, there's very little reason why you should not be on Game Pass. - Yeah. - Like only if you play like, one or two games a year. But if you play any more than that, you should just be on Game Pass. - Like me. - Yeah. - (laughs) Well, okay so, I think if you come back to the original premise of this video, with our clickbait title and thumbnail, the conclusion that I would draw in my predictions, right? For what 2025 will hold, is that I do think we're going to see a shift, right? I don't think it's gonna happen this year and it's not gonna happen next year. But the wheels are in motion for Xbox to get their mojo back. I think Xbox is going to start retaking some of the lead because they have a very strong value proposition, between the Series S, the Series X, the streaming side and Game Pass. These are all good ingredients, right? I think the main thing they're waiting for, were large part of the exclusives, which this is starting to put the thing together for. Obviously, as we discussed recently, the PS5 still has a lead there, but, the wheels are in motion, the studios are purchased. And then you think about how the perception of things changes. It takes a long time for people's ideas about things to shift, right? I mean, think about the Xbox One and PS4 generation. The Xbox One X was the most powerful console that you could purchase for several years, right? But people didn't really perceive it like that. It took a little while for their-- - 'Cause they're still remembering the terrible launch of just the Xbox One. - And plus, if you look at games that are coming out today on Xbox One, they look like butt, right? I mean, they just were severely, like-- - [Matt] \"Cyberpunk\" on the original-- - [Austin] \"Red Dead\" on Xbox one is not a good looking game, right? But I do think it's important to consider that the ingredients for the Xbox revival are very much all in place now, right? It's just a matter of waiting for the time to pass. And also, let's not forget, they're not gonna just sit on their hands and do nothing over the next five years. What's the next major studio they purchased, right? What's the next big move that they do in this space to further the Xbox 2025 master plan that is certainly in Phil Spencer's office. It's underneath his piles of old Xboxes. But if you open it up, it's on page 13. I'm just reading from it right now. - We are, we already know what's coming from Xbox because it's hidden on his bookshelf. - So we're very curious to know. What do you think the future of the Xbox will hold. Not short term, but longterm. 2025, what do you think the gaming space looks like? I'm very curious to know what you think in the comments below. But again, please make sure to ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling bell, subscribe to \"This Is\" for some sweet hot takes like this. And until next time, Matthew. - I'm still saying the Series S is gonna be, a streaming platform. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. This is Lenovo's Legion Y730. This is their mid-tier gaming laptop. I did a video on a product of theirs 2 or 3 months ago, called the Y530 that is kind of like their entry-level, this is an improved version of the Y530. So, a lot of the things I didn't love about the Y530, this thing has fixed. It's a little bit more expensive, it's $1100 or $1200 and... Well, let's get right into it. The design aesthetic to this thing is very similar to the Y530. It's a very clean look, doesn't have any red gamer accents or anything like that. I feel like Lenovo's moved beyond that whole \"red gamer\" stuff. It's just a very muted and more professional-looking gaming laptop. Now, this device is aluminum. The top panel is aluminum, The keyboard deck is aluminum, the main chassis is aluminum. It's a much more well-built version of their entry-level gaming device. Now, there are some plastic components still like the back part of the hinge is still plastic and the bottom panel is also a kind of polycarbonate material. It looks like real aluminum, but it is plastic. I've also noticed that this bottom panel is a lot easier to remove than the Y530 and I think it's because like the plastic clips that hold it into place, they clip into the metal chassis so it just feels more secure, you don't feel like you're snapping anything when you're opening it up And... yeah, when you're inside, You have access to the Wi-Fi card, the 2.5 inch SATA drive, the NVMe, and you also have access to the RAM slots Corsair has partnered with Lenovo so you can get RAM that's running up to 3200MHz The battery is also slightly bigger, not by a lot, it's still only a 57Wh battery And I'm only getting around 4 hours of battery life on this device. So again, like the Y530, you do need to bring your charger with you if you want to go full-day. Now, the ports are on the back again, which I like. You just kinda keep the ports, and extra cables and peripherals out of the way. And this time round, you also get a Thunderbolt 3 port which is something that I feel was lacking from the Y530. It may not be important to a lot of people, but if you want to upgrade this thing to have like external GPU capability or just future connectivity, I feel like that Thunderbolt 3 port is really useful. I feel like it just gives this thing extended life down the road. The rest of the device hasn't changed much though, right? So it has great performance with the 6-core i7 and the GTX 1050 Ti Pushes out excellent framerates in games You get a thin-bezeled screen and I think it's one of the best features of this device. That cleaner design aesthetic. It still has a webcam on the bottom of the laptop, but in terms of the specs, I think you can actually get a really good value with the Y-series, both with the Y530 and the Y730. The keyboard has actually changed a little bit as well, not that the Y530 had a bad keyboard, but the layout is a little bit different. There's macro keys on the Y730 and there's no number pad on the Y730. The number pad is something that I rarely use on laptops but I know that some of you guys are quite fond of it. There's a couple of other things. The trackpad buttons on this machine, They're much quieter and have a better feel to the click compared to the Y530. And the speakers. They're also improved. They're still laptop speakers, but they sound noticeably better to me. And there's also RGB lighting on this laptop that the Y530 didn't have and I will say, that this thing surprise me. Not the fact that it had RGB lighting, but I think it has the industry's best in lighting. So before this device, I would say that the Razer Blade or just any of the Razer laptops have the best lighting in the \"RGB\" keyboard space and RGB lighting on laptops and stuff. These guys do it better, so this is why. The software that they're using for this is done by Corsair Or this is done in partnership with Corsair. Corsair knows a thing or two about RGB lighting. It's bright LEDs, individually lit, and they've done it in a way that it's really user-friendly. The software is quite intuitive, and they also have under-glow lighting or like side lighting, and there's a single RGB light region in the logo that you can change and I think that is something that Lenovo did really well. I mean, they could've gone ham and lit this up like crazy, but it feels subtle enough that if you wanted to, you can kind of mute all the lights and just bring this thing to work as a regular laptop. I will say though, that as cool as this stuff looks and as much praise as I'm giving their lighting system, keep in mind that it is just RGB lights, right? You'll get bored of it over time. I think most people just kind of use it for a while, set it to things that kind of entertain them for a while, but it loses its novelty over time, so don't make that the only reason why you purchased this device. The gaming performance is really strong. It's not any different from the Y530, at least not that I could tell, and the thermals are also quite good The fans don't get crazy loud or anything. It's a good overall product, especially for the price. I guess the million-dollar question is, is this worth it? Or like, is this product a better pickup or a better purchase over the Y530? And, I think that, I mean if you're on a really tight budget and you only have $900 or $800 to spend, then you can't even get this, the Y530 is a way to go between the two. But, I feel like this is a product that will last longer, like, it's just built better, it has better quality materials and the RGB lighting does look pretty cool. I feel like with gaming laptops, there's usually two kind of main categories, you have cheaper plastic devices and you have more expensive aluminum devices. This product, kind of, crosses that barrier. It's not a super expensive gaming laptop, yet it's built really well. It's built better than you would expect considering its price point. So if that's what you're looking for, something that's kind of mid-tier that has a bigger focus on build quality instead of just raw performance at that price, you should check this out because it's pretty money. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! See you guys next time!",

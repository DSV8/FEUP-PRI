    "transcript": "- Look at that. - Oh my god. - Wow. - That's pretty good, right? - Hi. - Yeah dude, let's go! (laughter) - Today we are looking at the Sony Xperia 1 Mark 4. Not to be confused with the Sony Xperia Pro I or Xperia Pro, or, Xperia 5 series. I, I understand that Sony's naming isn't super confusing when you can look at like a chart that shows all of them. But, for the average person, you might think that all of these phones are kind of the same, but they're not. We have, a pretty thin, Johno, is there just a phone in this box? This is a pre-production unit. It does actually say in our notes that it'll come with a 30 watt charger. So I don't know if just for early samples they just didn't bother to include that, which not a huge deal. I have a full disclosure opened to this phone already but there's the unboxing experience from our side for you. So the last time we did a video on this series phone, the one mark three was about 10 months ago. Linus did that video. Physically speaking, this phone is not super different from its predecessor the one three, and that's not a bad thing. I actually really liked the design of the one three and the Pro I that I checked out recently. These taller displays with a skinnier footprint in the hand makes a lot of difference for a long term use. 'Cause I had the Pro I for like a couple weeks the last time it was here and I never once felt like my hand was straining when using it for a long period of time. And that is the same here. Physically speaking, (tapping) the phone feels as you'd expect a premium phone these days to feel. On the top we have a headphone jack, love to see it. On the left we've got nothing but a very smooth metal finish. On the right we have a fingerprint sensor, volume rocker and a dedicated shutter button which I presume also opens the photography pro app. There you go. On the bottom of the phone, we have a standard type C and a tool-less SIM, oh! A tool-less SIM and micro SD expansion. Now this phone does come in a 256 or 512 by default. And of course you can expand it up to about one terabyte. I know that those micro SD cards do exist, which is sort of insane these days. Under the hood they've added a beefier battery, going from 4500 milliampere hours to 5000 milliampere hours. And the processor is now the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. The display is 4k 120 Hertz, just like the predecessor, but it is 50% brighter. Let's see how bright that is. Andy is this too bright for you? - [Andy] Oh, too bright! - Dang. And this still is a 120 Hertz OLED display. So probably one of the best displays you can get on a phone right now. I'm actually just gonna open a game and you guys can see what it is like. While I'm at it, I'll, I can test the speakers a little bit in this game. (tires squealing) - Oh god. Oh! It looks really good. Like the graphics on this game are not amazing, but the experience of the 120 Hertz display, even like in a game like this, I'm pretty impressed. Now I wanna take a look at HDR video 'cause this isn't HDR display. I'm like I'm super impressed with the way that a tent, the tent looks in this shot, 'cause usually this would be a super blown out and obviously it was shot well enough that it wasn't blown up. But then visually looking at it in this setting, it looks really good. So Johno just asked me if it makes sense to have 4k on a smartphone display. It really depends on who you are. But I think in general for most people, no because it's going to eat more battery life. Visually speaking, you're not really gonna be able to benefit from those extra pixels on the phone's display, even though it is a much higher resolution. Why don't we see how it sounds with good old crab rave. (upbeat tropical music) All right, I have an iPhone here to compare. Let's see how this sounds. I went back about 10 seconds. (upbeat tropical music) (tropical music continues) What do you guys think? - [Andy] iPhone sounds better. - It does sound fuller, doesn't it? - [Andy] Yeah, so here's- - The Sony doesn't sound bad. Like that's the thing. I'm not a hundred percent sure. I'm not an audio expert by any means, but, it does feel like the Sony is like, has a mid-range point where it actually sounds like a little bit nicer than the iPhone. The iPhone's louder. It's always hard to tell a speaker performance in a video, but I do think the iPhone wins overall. However, Sony hasn't done a bad job. These sound pretty good. Especially compared to most smartphones that you will get these days. Now Sony's using a three camera system. The top camera is a 16 millimeter F 2.4. The middle camera is the 24 millimeter F 1.7. So the fastest of the three and the last camera, probably the most interesting of the three is an 85 millimeter to 125 millimeter F 2.3 to 2.8 with optical zoom. Now you might be thinking the same way that I was. Optical zoom in this tiny, little camera bump. Let's take a look in the camera app. Sony did mention to us that this is a pre-production unit. One of the zoom ranges on this phone. I think it's 5.1. Let's go to 5.1. Can't actually grab focus very easily, in this mode. Though it seems to be working right now. So this is at the longest end of the lens. 125 mil. Here's a second photo at 4.7 at a wider. And then this third guy, 3.5 zoom. I am impressed every time I use this camera app. It just feels so robust even though, oh, I'm getting an overheating warning. This is again a pre-production unit. They, I might not end up actually. You might not end up getting a warning like that, but in the top left corner of the camera app right now you can see that there's an overheating warning and the phone is getting warm to the touch. Well it's probably 'cause I'm screen recording and trying to use the camera app. I'm just gonna take a quick photo with the standard camera. Oh there's Johno. It grabbed Johno's, wow. It grab, Johno, it grabbed your face immediately. Like I put the camera right here on the table to take a photo of these toys and it's just tracking you. They've improved the eye tracking in all three of these cameras and now each camera has real time IAF. They've also improved the selfie camera. It is a larger sensor and it's 4k. This is the improved selfie camera on the Xperia 1 4. And it is actually shooting in HDR right now. I don't know what that means from a file type perspective on this phone, but let's see what it looks like versus the standard definition. So that was HDR. I look a lot paler. And, there's Johno. My favorite feature that Sony has added to this phone though is probably the fact that every single camera except for the selfie camera on this phone can do 4k 120 FPS video. It can do it in every mode, including the cinema pro mode which I am a very big fan of. Because as I talked about in the pro I video, you have full control of your ISO shutter angle. It's just, it's like using a Sony camera, but on a phone. Okay, I have, what are these Johno? Are these airsoft, I have airsoft bullets. (beads rattling) And a jar with John Snow in it. Fill 'em up Johno. (beads clinking) We'll take a look at those 120 FPS clips in a second, but first I wanna try an accessory that I didn't get to try on the last Xperia phone. And that is, the vlog monitor kit. This thing is really cool. It basically allows you to add a full fledged camera monitor to your phone. So it is three components in the first box, the display which also has a quarter 20 point. So you could use this for other things. I don't know how many other things you could use this for, but you at least have versatility. You have a very strong feeling metal phone mount. This is probably the best phone mount I've ever felt. And it has a cold shoe plate. Very nice and then type C cable for connection. But the coolest part guys, the coolest part. When I first tried this thing, I was like, wow, I can't believe. (magnet clinks) Look at that. That is fricking awesome. Let's put this in and see what it's like. Okay, ooh, it kind of slides. It can actually slide to adjust depending on which phone you're using. 'Cause they're all not quite the exact same size. And then we also have Sony's Bluetooth control grip. This is an optional accessory that you don't have to have 'cause this is just a quarter 20 port. You could put anything on it, but it is nice that you'll be able to hit record from the actual remote. And I know other things like this exist so just use whatever you'd want. This is probably as light a vlog setup as you could possibly have because it's literally just a phone and a display and a relatively light grip. Okay. I want a couple people's opinions around the office. If they would start vlogging if they had this set up, let's go. So before I actually go around the office and ask people how this camera performs and what they think of it, I have to tell you about today's sponsor, Manscaped. Manscaped's performance package 4.0 kit is designed to contain everything you need to make grooming below the waist easy. It includes the updated lawnmower 4.0 with its wireless charging weed whacker nose trimmer for the tricky areas. Plus some other goodies like the crop preserver and the crop reviver sprays for deodorizing and toning. Get 20% off and free international shipping in the link in the video description. Okay. Now I'm gonna go bug some people. - Oh. - What do you think of this setup? - I think it looks great. - Look at that. - Oh my god. - Here, hold this. - That's actually sick. - So Arthur's our social media guy. He's does all the new shorts and things on YouTube, but would you use this vlogging setup? - Oh 100%. This thing's sick. It's super smooth. Super stable. - Right, like look at that. That's one approved. Let's see who else we can bug. - What's up? What's going on, what are we doing? We're doing a, a short circuit, but what do you think of this vlogging setup? - I mean it's kind of dope. What am I even looking at right now? - This is a Sony Xperia 1 4. And then there's a magnetic display phone mount thing. - I mean that's actually kinda sick. - And then you can control your record from here and you can take photos. - And you don't have to use the crap front camera? - And you can use zoom. - Okay, yeah dude, let's go! (laughter) - What do you think of this? - Oh, that looks pretty neat. - Look at this. It's a phone, monitor. - That's the phone? - Yeah. - Camera? - Yeah. - That looks pretty dang good. - Would this make you start, like would you take up vlogging with this setup? - No. 'Cause I hate vlogging. (laughter) - So I've never really vlogged before, but this setup makes it surprisingly easy because it's so light and very stable. 'Cause the stabilization on this phone is pretty good and the white balance and the auto focus are also pretty good. Okay, so I'm impressed with this accessory. The vlog video looks really good for vlog video on a phone because it's using the rear facing camera. Let's take a look at some of the stuff we've actually shot on this thing and see how it looks on a computer. Not zoomed in at all at the 125 mill. This looks like it was taken on a mirror-less camera because it's such a long lens. First impressions, which is what this video is. It's not a review. This is a first impressions video. This is impressively sharp. Detail is excellent. There's a giant light. There's a soft, like a, there's a soft light right behind the subject of this little toy here and nothing around Johno in the monitor you can see is blown out. So this is the 16 mill. Man. Not as good. Interesting. I mean, I, I guess not as relative. It might actually be slightly out of focus on the toy's face here, but even from the, the wide shot you got a decent amount of detail in the bottom of the statue here. So here are also a couple extra photos that we just took outside to show you guys performance in just everyday situations. And you guys can be the judge, what you think of the color, its dynamic range and the sharpness. I'm overall pretty impressed. The 4k 20 on the 16 mill is sort of potato quality, overall. So this is the main shooter. I'm expecting this to be slightly better. So detail wise, it is better. It's possible because I was using this at 500 ISO even with a lot of light in this scene. It's a little bit on the noisy side for a smartphone 'cause 500 ISO on a smartphone is not that low. It looks better though. Like you can clearly see a lot more detail in John Snow. Here's the tele photo, definitely noisy. The zoom's a little bit cludgy as well, but very shallowed depth of field. You lowered the ISO, did some denoising, you have a 120 FPS 4k shot. I wanna stress to you guys that this video is only a first impression. This is not a review. This is a pre-production model of the phone. If you want more info on this phone, if you want a review on one of our channels, maybe leave a comment down below and we'll consider it. But overall first impressions, the 120 FPS is okay. I mean it's a good feeling phone, it's fast. 120 Hertz display, 4k HDR. What more could you ask for? The part that kind of is rough, is it is $1,600 USD. So it's cheaper than the pro I. The add-on of the vlog kit, this little screen is about $200 USD. And then this little handle is $138 USD. If I was a vlogger looking for a travel just like vacation kit and I wanted something super light. I don't think you could really beat this. So let me know what you guys think of this phone in the comments down below. And if there's another phone that you want us to check out, leave a comment as well. Thanks for watching.",

    "transcript": "what's up guys, Lew here back with another video and today I'm gonna tell you about the top five reasons to choose over-ear headphones like these ins..... the top five reasons to choose over ear headphones when compared to those little dinky in-ear earbuds or otherwise. Now for this demonstration I'm going to be using the brand new HiFiMAN HE350. Little bit about these headphones: open back design, premium materials, huge fifty millimeter drivers and available exclusively at Massdrop. And temporarily this is a collaboration, a relaunch of a classic these things are a huge drop off of the retail cost. They are available for about a hundred bucks and to be quite honest it's going to be difficult to find headphones of this caliber at that price point. So if you want to get in on the action: link in the description. Go check it out! So why over-ear headphones? Number one: the driver! These have giant fifty millimeter drivers and no matter what you do in an in-ear-style headphone you simply will not have as big of a speaker on your head. What does this mean for you? Generally speaking a better listening experience, bigger driver, more sound. This is a acoustics 101. You can have a big driver that's terrible, you have a small driver that's incredible. But in general, general terms, these guys gonna have bigger drivers, which do a better job, most of the time, at reproducing a wider frequency range all the way down to those low frequencies that we all love. Number two: longer listening sessions. So with this set of headphones I've got you. This is a pretty lightweight over-ear and it's adjustable, so chances are it's gonna be comfortable for you to wear for very long periods of time where the inside of your ear, generally speaking, is going to be more susceptible to fatigue. so you can throw a pair of these on and three hours can float by as you listen to your pink floyd or whatever it is that you choose. Plus the adjustability means that they're gonna fit better for more people Number three: sound stage. This is terminology that gets thrown around in the audio world in with an open back design the experience you have is a lot more similar to what it's like to be in a live venue where it kind of, it kind of feels like sound is coming from a further distance away like you are in an environment of sound. It's very difficult to have this very wide soundstage. It comes with an open back in in-ear design. Number four: at home listening. Generally speaking when you've got a set up, you got a record player, you might have one of these guys right down here: I've actually got a dark voice tube amplifier like this one. Generally speaking you're gonna want to give them something that's easy to put on, easy to share, you're not gonna have those kind of hygiene issues with in ear headphones. So for those kinds of social listening environments, maybe in the living room or in your bedroom or so on, these are just gonna be a little bit easier to pass around. The fifth reason why you should choose over ear headphones when compared to get here is for gaming. Or movies anything that's mixed in a kind of potentially surround environment. When you're in a game and you hear gunshots coming from a particular direction that larger driver on the outside your ears is gonna do a really good job of helping you identify the exact location of that sound. These things are going to do a fantastic job of delivering that. So there you have it! That's five reasons. The most important reasons to me to choose over ear headphones when compared to in-ear style. If you want to jump on the mass drop for the HE350, become one of the few people on the planet that actually have these headphones at this price, click the link in the description and also stay tuned, because coming up in the next video tomorrow it's gonna be the top five reasons to pick in-ear headphones compared to over-ear.",

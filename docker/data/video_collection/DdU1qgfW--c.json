    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] There we go, look at that, vertical video, you got nothing on this. And it's actually really cool seeing like my modern 4K Blackmagic footage converted into little postage stamp movies. I've never seen this before. It just quit on me. Well thank you Premiere. All right we're just gonna have to do a reboot. Yes, yes, yes, I know. I didn't shut it down properly because it froze. All right. Guys it's time to make a movie. Finally. Oh I appreciate your patience. (beeping) (electronic music) Hey guys, how you all doin'? Really? That's just great. You know I'm doing really great today too because I'm keeping my promise. I'm back today with the Adobe Premiere 1.0 follow-up video where I'm going to attempt to edit a video in Adobe Premiere 1.0 on a 68K Macintosh. Oh my gosh this is gonna be amazing. Or very painful, or both. I have some things I want to share with you but first let's get this thing booted up. Again it's being kind of weird like I have to plug it in and it kind of just turns on by itself. The IIci I think is having some capacitor issues. So let's get it all started up. Yeah it just kind of turns on by itself. When you plug it in. Disc, CD300. All right in terms of our setup we have a Macintosh IIci with eight megabytes of RAM. We have an Apple CD300, which transfers data over SCSI. And we have a four gigabyte external hard disk drive again over SCSI. There is no floppy drive, CD-ROM drive, or even hard drive inside this computer so we're going all external. And as for the video out, we're converting to VGA and using this Samsung display which has been my trusty display to use with this computer since I think 2009 when I did the first demo of it. Yeah it's been around for a while so, it looks like it's not picking up on our disc right now. Sometimes it is a little bitchy trying to pick up on the SCSI external disc so let's just jiggle it a bit. Okay, I feel really dumb. I feel really dumb. I don't have the DB25 cable plugged in. Wow, it's just one of those days right? Okay, we're gonna have to shut this down 'cause we should not be hot plugging this stuff. Yeah now the Macintosh IIci is not wanting to turn on. This has happened before. Sometimes it just needs to be plugged in for a few minutes. The clock battery is probably on its last legs and the capacitors on the board are also probably not doing so well. So we're gonna give it some time to juice up. And then we'll do some video editing. So while it's juicing up I'll kind of talk about what's up here. So I do a show called Vintage Apple Vault where I explore the history and the stories behind vintage Apple products and their collectors. It's a lot of fun. So what I did was I took a few clips from episode two and I converted them to Apple Video format and I also made some custom title slides because we can't generate titles in Adobe Premiere 1.0. And I converted those to PICT files and I burned them to a CD. So I'll throw these in here and we'll import them and edit with those. So basically we're gonna make a very miniature Vintage Apple Vault episode with the contents on this CD. Now the last episode I was doing this stuff on with the iBook did very well. It has over 100,000 views already. Brad Olsen, who made the Off The Tracks documentary actually saw it which made my day. And he said he forwarded it to Randy Ubillos and that's pretty flattering. That's very flattering. So that was great, huge success there. I want to follow up now and do the editing on the IIci, a real 68K machine. As soon as it gets powered up. Come on baby. And what'd I tell ya? It just turns on by itself. So now that that is working, let's do a reboot. There we go. That is what I wanted to see. And while that's loading up, let's put the assets into the disc drive. Which yes it's really cool that it says caddy loaded when you insert the disc. Like the actual physical flap changes. A couple viewers pointed that out to me. It's just those nice little touches that Apple puts in their hardware that I really like. Les voila, we're at the desktop. That's great. All right. Let's make a new folder. We'll call this VAV for Vintage Apple Vault. Open that up. Got the CD. So let's start with importing our assets into the SCSI disk. Drag those over there. Oh this might be a 2.5 gig disc. I think I said four earlier. It might be two and a half or something. We have about 2,400 megabytes available though. So that's plenty. If I sort this by name, you'll see. I just have everything in order as for how it's going to appear. So our PICT files are the title graphics and these files are Apple Video documents. For compatibility with QuickTime 2.5. Okay so let's go to our applications. And we're ready to go. Let's launch Premiere. Adobe Premiere Macintosh version 1.0 written by Randy Ubillos. Okay here it is. This is Adobe Premiere 1.0 as you saw probably on the G3 video. If you haven't seen that, feel free to check it out. But now we're running it on 68K. We have the preview window, the info window, the project window where we import our files, the construction window which is now known as a timeline. And our special effects with our fun little previews. And let's import our assets. So command I, the shortcut we still use today on the Mac for Premiere. We're gonna import. I don't think you can import more than one at a time so we're just gonna have to do one at a time. Let's open that. This is gonna be a test of patience by the way. Oh great my mouse cursor disappeared. That's not a good sign. Oh great. I'm getting no response from this for the mouse cursor. Let's see, Command-Option-Escape. Yeah force quit is also not showing up. Restart. My restart shortcut on the keyboard is also not responding. Not sure if that's normal though. All right, we're just gonna have to do a reboot. Use the reboot button on the computer. All right, restart. Shit. Dang it is this not gonna work? I hope it does. All right so hopefully this reboot helps. Yes yes yes I know. I didn't shut it down properly because it froze. Okay well here we are. Let's hide the Finder windows and let's try importing a file. Let's see if the preview works. Creating preview. Okay, looks like it stopped but I still have a mouse cursor. All right, at least we have the force quit panel this time. That's weird. I don't know. Those picture files were working in Adobe Premiere on my iBook. And I did the conversion to an actual PICT file. They were originally JPEGs but I did a conversion to PICT with Adobe Premiere 1.0. There's my thumbnail, I can see me. It's loading that. Okay well that's a good sign. Well let's start with that. Let's try opening an Apple Video file. That worked, that worked just fine, perfect. It's right there. Okay let's import another one. File number five. Boom, bon appetital. File number six. Okay so let's save this. We'll just save it to the folder where all the assets are. We'll just call it VAV, Vintage Apple Vault. Save. Okay so the video files imported just fine. And it's actually really cool seeing like my modern 4K black magic footage converted into little postage stamp movies. Yeah we're at 160 by 120. We're gonna be working in, I think these video files are 15, oh shoot, nope, didn't mean to do that. I meant to go here. Yeah we're gonna be working at 15 frames per second. That's what the video files are in the Apple Video files are 15. So we'll preview in 15 and we'll output when we actually render the movie in 15 as well using Apple Video. Looks like we have Cinepak in here too. Yes that would make sense. Let's try importing those pictures again. Yeah, it's not. It's not liking that. Okay, maybe there's something wrong with the picture file. Let's open this in simple text. The simple text should be able to read pictures. Mmm. (mouse clicking) That's not normal. Yeah this locked up the software. I think this picture file is corrupted. I have no title graphics. That's a shame because I spent a whole four seconds making those. But there is hope because I think we have Photoshop on here so we can just like hand paint our own, or we could go really MacGyvery and take a screenshot of like a war document with a title on it. Oh actually we could do that 'cause we could just crop it. Okay so this'll be Vintage Apple Vault Road Pizza edition because of the old video format. And we'll make that Chicago. And we'll make that nice and big. And we'll just take a screenshot. Right here I believe this is what we just did. There it is, all right. So we'll take that and we'll just call this our title. And we'll dump this into here. Good, this will be our backup solution 'cause apparently these picture files do not want to work. Don't know why but it's not just Premiere that can't read them. Even simple text can't read them so I think they got corrupted during the conversion process. Oops, but we have a somewhat decent alternative. So let's go to our recent apps. Go to, Premiere's not showing up in there. Okay. Just have to go here. Actually why am I going through the finder. We have an Apple menu. We have a menu with things in it. We can go through it like this and click. Boom. And let's import our lovely title creation. And this is actually great because now we have an excuse to make like a garbage- Oh you bastard. Okay now we're gonna, now I guess we have to get Photoshop involved. Oh my gosh, we're just like using everything. Oh it might be 1280 wide. Really? Is that what it is right now or is it just guessing? I don't know. Let's just do yeah, 50%. Let's just guess. I don't even, I really don't know what I'm doing with this. Let's just try it. Oh. That's weird. There a oh. I know what it's doing. That's why that icon disappeared. It took a picture of the second display. There's no second display hooked up. But there's a video card hooked up. There's two video cards I believe inside this computer and I didn't really pay attention to that earlier. I'm a take this. Oh right there. Look at that. Oh Photoshop, you beautiful piece of software. That's literally all I needed. Let's save that out. All right, let's import. Title cropped. Oh boy, it's not showing up as a file. Maybe it'll work, oh it did, yay. Oh my gosh we're saved. All right. Guys it's time to make a movie. Finally. Oh I appreciate your patience. Let's start with our title at the beginning. We'll just kind of like lay this out and then we'll do some transitions and that cool stuff. Let's zoom out the timeline a little bit. Extend our play range. So we have our title and now let's import our clips. So we have clip number four where I'm talking and then I'm gonna cut away to this B roll shot, which I guess I could put in the B track but I already trimmed it up so it really could just go right here on the A track. And then we have number six here so let's see, let's zoom in here. 'Cause previewing this isn't as easy as it is nowadays. It takes a while so if you wanna measure stuff out, measure it with the time ruler first. Let's move this down, move this down. Move this down, we'll extend this a little bit. So now that's three seconds long. I'm just using the info window because again, you gotta kind of measure this stuff out before you just preview it because previewing isn't just immediate and easy like it is now. Okay we're gonna add a mat for the end so we're just gonna fade to black here. I'm just gonna call that black. Put that at the end there. And again we don't do the transitions and stuff yet, we'll get to that later. And we'll trim our I don't know if they call it a playback area there. Work area, that's right. So we have a title, some A roll, and then a couple B roll clips that I'm just putting in the A roll track essentially. 160 by 120. Sometimes we'll get better playback if I shrink the preview window down but right now I'm just gonna resize it to the native size of the project. We'll just kind of rearrange a few things here. All right so our preview options, yep, 15 fps, that should be accurate. Now the playback is probably gonna lag like crazy. When we actually export the movie, it should play back better inside of the movie player. But inside Premiere, we're probably not gonna get near that performance. But let's try. Return. There's our title. There's our A-roll. Picking up the display. Cutting to a B-roll shot of the display and then cutting to a B-roll shot of the cube. Me pressing the power button. And then cut to black. As you can see the sequence worked really well there. Definitely not the highest frame rate but that's okay. We can export it and watch it in a smoother playback later at 15 fps. Effects. Okay let's do, what effects shall we do for our title? Now the title is being, it's kinda stretchy. I don't remember how to adjust that. Oh, I just learned something new, okay. And I can't undo that. When you hold down the control key you get a little blade tool. Well that's cool. I had no idea. Well let's get rid of that and just extend that back out. But yeah I don't know how to, oh let's see maintain aspect ratio. There we go. So now that's probably just gonna be letter boxed like that I would imagine. There we go. I wonder if I put white in the background if the white will fill this black. I somehow doubt that but we're gonna try it. What if I do this. Oh yeah now the white just fills it. So obviously no. Okay so B must still be in the background. I bet if I moved this out you'll see the title. Yep there it is. All right well I guess it's just gonna be letter boxed. I can't get the transparency settings to not be grayed out. I don't know why. Super. Now I get transparency settings. And I have no idea what I just did there. I don't know why my cursor turned to a glove and put those dots there. Oh wait hang on that's key frames. These are key frames. Oh. Oh, something happened there. Okay I don't know, maybe it's superimpose. I don't know. Because now it's showing up with the white and the key framing going over it. With the dissolve there. So we kind of discovered something. All right, so I'm just gonna go with the letter box of that. You know hang on a second. I desire more in life. I have an idea. Gonna hide that. We're gonna go back to Photoshop quick. Paste that in there. There we go, let's import that picture. Drag that in. Re-time it about three seconds. Bump all this stuff over. Expand the work area. Preview that. There you go, Road Pizza edition. All right let's do some effects. What effects should we use to go from the title to my beautiful face? How about some barn doors? The cross dissolve has some leggy issues I've noticed. Okay so to be honest, I don't know how the alignment for this works. I've never fully figured it out. So let's just experiment or experiment. Apparently I pronounce it wrong. Yeah yeah, that's definitely not how that's supposed to happen. Let's see what it's like over here. Hmm, forward reverse, probably anti-aliasing quality. Flip, that's what I'm guessing those buttons do. Okay so now it's going in. Oh man, okay. I think I see what's going on here. Let's command period that. Stop that playback. Move this over. So now it should go in from black to the title with this wipe. Oh yeah, isn't that, that's Hollywood dude. Let's do a page turn. Let's watch this not work. Yeah it's going to black and then it, oh you know what? I think I know why. Yeah I got this. I figured you out Randy. I know what you're doin'. You want this down here. That's what you want. But I'm thinking like A is bridged by the effects track to the B track. There we go. That's what I wanted. We figured it out. Randy we did it. So essentially then, I'll have to move this down here. But not necessarily. I can have that up here still. But I would need this down here so we can fade to black. Or we could do an iris. Do like an iris effect. All right so let's take a look at this with our footage, titles, and transitions. So we have the barn door at the beginning with our awesome Road Pizza Edition. And then we page turn to the A roll shot of me talking. Cut to the B roll shot. Cut to another shot. Oh shit, I forgot to adjust my work area. And iris wipe. There we go. Ladies and gentlemen, we just made a mini movie of Vintage Apple Vault on a Macintosh IIci in Adobe Premiere 1.0. 160 by 120 resolution at 15 frames per second. And here is the timeline. Let's save those changes. Cool. I mean I feel like I'm kind of like exploring and treasure hunting you know? Getting those feelings of like oh man, I got this working. I like that. This must be kind of like when Alexander Graham Bell heard the first ring on his phone. That must've been a really cool feeling. That was probably way cooler than this. But still this is kind of like that. Just figuring out how to make it work and then having it work. It's a cool feeling and I'm happy to share it with y'all. Let's make the movie now. So this is where we're actually gonna render the movie in Apple Video format into a QuickTime. Actually I don't know if they actually called them QuickTime movies back then, I don't know. Because the movie player wasn't called QuickTime Player. It was just called movie player. QuickTime was the, I guess the API? Or the extension? I don't know. What exactly it was called. Let's output this masterpiece to the desktop. Call it Vintage Apple Vault Premiere Test. I'll put options. Let's just make sure everything's good. We don't have sound. I couldn't get sound conversion to work. I didn't really experiment with that too much but this computer can't output sound anyway. I think the sound card is toast. So we could use Animation Cinepak, Apple Video, 15 fps, 160 by 120. Do the entire movie. Boom, and boom. We are now gonna start rendering. Here we go. Compiling movie. One moment please. And we're done. So let's close out of Premiere. Let's open up the Movie Player. Let's just check our version. QuickTime 2, but then here it says 2.5. Okay well can't trust anybody anymore. I think it's 2.5 but whatever. Go to the desktop. Let's open our movie and have some fun. Here's our masterpiece. (humming) Vintage Apple Vault Road Pizza Edition. Page turn. Yeah this plays back way smoother. Oh look we added a little flash there. Crap. Gotta fix it in post now. Yeah I think I lined up the frames wrong or something because the transitions have like a brief flicker of the footage when it shouldn't be doing that. But still, it worked. That's it like it worked. That is pretty cool. Present movie. I think we can get full screen out of this. Oh yeah it is picking up two displays. 'Cause I do have two cards in here I just don't have two monitors hooked up. Cool, I should hook up two monitors to this thing one time. This might lag. Oh yeah, this is terrible performance now. That's still pretty cool though. Oh look at all the dithering and the macro blocking and the, painting and tearing and just all the artifacts. I absolutely love it. 'Cause that's how it used to be. But yeah it does play a lot better. It even kind of scrubs halfway decently. Look at that. That's pretty cool. The bigger you make the window, the laggier it's probably gonna be. Yeah but if you shrink it down, play it. Oh yeah you can even do this. There we go, look at that. Vertical video. You got nothing on this. This is real vertical video. This is the good shit. Oh it just, I've never seen this before. It just quit on me. Well thank you Premiere. Error type one. Look up the Google machine. Yeah I have a feeling something effed up 'cause, can't even open the menu now. Can't do anything. Reboot time. But yeah I was just about to wrap the tech video log and I wanted to open Premiere one more time to get one more bit documented and yeah, now it's like F you. Ladies and gentlemen, we made a movie. That was a lot of fun. Well let me know what other vintage software you want to see, I have the Macintosh IIci and the Macintosh TV as my old Mac software and hardware petri dishes. So if you have suggestions, let me know. I'd be happy to try some of your ideas. Thank you so much for watching. Catch the crazy and pass it on.",

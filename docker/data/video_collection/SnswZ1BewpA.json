    "transcript": "The Flipper Zero has a whole bunch of functionality. In this example I've got a cupboard that's locked it actually uses tags to unlock the cupboard so as an example there the cupboard is unlocked. What I can do on he Flipper Zero and I've just got it connected to this cable so that you can see what I see but I think for most people the interesting part is to go to NFC and then read the tag so there you go I've read the tag and then what I can do is emulate the tag so now it's unlocked. I personally don't think it's such a great idea to use tags such as these with a cupboard because you know what happens if the battery dies or something but notice there you go I could use a tag to unlock the cupboard or I could use the Flipper Zero to unlock the cupboard.",

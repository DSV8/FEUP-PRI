    "transcript": "i like to play minecraft okay i'm not ashamed of it my wife makes fun of me but it's a fun game and in this video we're going to experiment a bit so i am interested to see just how far i can push my 5950x and i don't even remember what card this is thing is rtx 3070 how the specs in the description want to check out exactly what my personal rig is running this by the way is the same system that i used to edit with uh to stream with like i'm doing now and play games so i am in a mega planes biome and i've set it up to look like a super flat world at the surface but we're actually standing on y63 so you need to go all the way down to bedrock kind of how you would a traditional minecraft generated world uh so in that sense our tnt is going to be able to interact beautifully with the terrain and that's the point we're going to be detonating tnt in varying amounts to see how those figures to the left of the screen there um yeah fluctuate so we're getting 5950x we've got 16 cores all listed out we've got system ram at the bottom along with the frame rate we've got the gpu usage at the very top and rtx 3070 and then we have a gpu memory just under that i will be mapping frame rates using fraps and they'll be checking frame time uh fluctuations while the tnt is being detonated so we should see a pretty huge spike in frame times when we detonate the tnt and then once we finish up with the detonation then the frame rate should uh should increase or the frame time should decrease remember they are inversely proportional there so there you go one tnt being detonated but uh we're going to be detonating a lot more than that i think you'll enjoy this fun little experiment stay with me be sure to check out team group t-force extreme argb modules for your next pc build they look fan freaking tastic and boast excellent frequencies and timings my favorite is this white kit which when lit oh my gosh and while you're at it consider joining team group's back to school giveaway we'll have a chance to win ram internal and external ssds click the links below for more details hey there i feel like a minecraft youtuber now anyway for our first experiment we're gonna run a three by three block detonation pattern here and i'm just gonna manually fill this in i know i could run a fill command but uh probably just if we could do it this way and i think what we're going to be doing and we want to stand back far enough to make sure that we get the entire explosion in the shot and whatever tnt goes flying left or right who knows time set noon there we go sometimes like i brain for when it comes to minecraft stuff okay here we go um yeah detonating now oh yeah right so if you were watching the bottom left you can see that frame rate dip pretty hard now i wasn't logging frame times at that point we're just running a little test here just to show you what to expect and you can see we are not in a super flat world obviously this world has a depth you could dig all the way down to y1 or y0 whichever one they call it for bedrock and uh yeah that was the point right so the tnt can interact a bit more to be a bit more representative of uh what you might run into in your minecraft world so with that we're gonna begin logging now keep in mind i'm gonna be streaming this entire thing i'm not gonna be live streaming it but i am encoding while i'm doing all of this so there is a bit of uh cpu being leveraged in that case i'm using the x264 encoder because it's a 5950x why not i could be using the new invic encoder but i'd like to keep the gpu unsaturated just in case it's needed for some of these animations and minecraft is it's a bit finicky the game really doesn't like utilizing more than a few cores and threads and that's been the case for quite a long time i'm using the java edition by the way not the bedrock edition so that might change depending on the version you are using uh but same goes for the graphics card it's very difficult to fully saturate any modern graphics card in minecraft unless you're running something like a gt710 i'm sure you could probably bottle like that but something like an rtx 37 you wouldn't expect vanilla minecraft to really bottleneck and what it really comes down to in today's optimization the game just doesn't know how to fully utilize hardware like this at its disposal again just to demonstrate one more time watch gpu usage at the top left no change okay so even a lot of the animations in minecraft i mean the graphics card is not going to be stressed to that extent now maybe if we put a 10 by 10 by 10 cube of tnt alright i'm sure at that point we'd start seeing the gpu usage uh start to spike but even even then i don't expect it to hit 100 if it does i mean that's that's going to be a big change from what i was used to back in 2017-2018 when i was uh last running this so we're gonna start with a three by three cube and i'm going to log with fraps i could be logging with msi after burner i have to have after burner up anyway so you can see the uh the stats here on the left side of the screen so i'm not really sure why i'm using fraps but anyway we're going to run some redstone over here we don't want to get too far back and i'm going to hit ctrl alt b so fraps is now logging whoops all right here we go so that was interesting so i actually noticed the gpu usage went down if you watch in slow motion here on the top left um yeah usage went down just before the explosion and then while the explosion was happening it didn't really go back up not until the animations were pretty much finished with and that's not something you would normally expect to see uh in a game that's as popular as minecraft in 2021. now this here is a site to behold we are standing on a by five by five cube of tnt and it is is it wait is that five it's five by four what am i doing i am an idiot and at this point i should be using fill commands because it's taking quite a while but anyway there there we go okay five by five by five and we're gonna pretty much do the exact same thing we just did i don't think we need to stand too far back to see the uh the explosion for the most part obviously a few tnt blocks are gonna be like getting launched way off to the left and right but we'll be able to see most of the action from about here we're going to hit ctrl alt b and we're going to run the simulation here we go well that is something this here is 27 blocks of tnt detonated and this here is what five times five times five that's uh one 125 blocks of tnt detonated it's a pretty pretty big difference now it's time to kick things up a step further okay i think i typed this in correctly yes all right now we're talking so this here folks is a 10 by 10 by 10 massive cube of tnt so time for i probably shouldn't know this is close to that craters i did you know what whatever screw it we're gonna run the redstone probably have to get a bit further back for this one so i think i'm gonna use a repeater and uh we will yep bring it maybe back to here okay now we're gonna hit ctrl alt b that's just the default keybind i use for recording frame times by the way and we're gonna flip the weather the leather lever little lever here we go oh my that frame rate was abysmal but if you noticed again top left corner gpu usage was yeah pretty much stuck at around 20 to 30 percent so for quick reference again this is a single block of tnt here being detonated this over here is a three by three by three cube of tnt being detonated this right here kind of blended into the next explosion but this is 125 blocks of tnt being detonated all at once and this mega cluster here is 1 000 blocks of tnt being detonated wow but you know what we're not stopping there it's time for the piece that resistance i think we can do sorry my french viewers i know it's probably crunchy we're going to do 50 by 50 by 50 blocks of tnt i think that is doable i think it is let's see i'm going to try the fill command again we are at 339 give me a second here oh yes okay so this isn't quite 50 blocks but it is a 30 by 30 by 30 cube of them and i yeah i think this is a big step up from the 10 by 10 by 10 i thought that was big but this is freaking colossal and uh yeah we're just going to set up the redstone same way we did before probably have to pull a bit further back for this one and i imagine this explosion as a whole is gonna take much longer to play out okay something like that should work i think we're far back enough to at least get um well most of the picture oh the crater's gonna be enormous though and uh drop the lever we're gonna get our yeah we're gonna get our frame time counter going let's pull the lever oh this isn't gonna be good yeah okay we we might be here a while 2 000 years later how you guys doing um we're gonna start measuring this in seconds per frame because right now our fps is literally one probably gonna go to zero this is this is definitely zero um we might yeah i don't know if i should just let this play out or not i guess i should but right now in my camera angle everything's being all shifted because i've been hit by tnt i said i just stood too close to it um i'm not sure if this is going to be a fair representation of a 30 by 30 by 30 with respect to the other cubes that we've exploded but um i mean it's pretty trash i think it's safe to say we we broke the game this is this is interesting we're getting explosions all around us but we can't see the tnt which i think is helping our performance overall um things are definitely still exploding yep yep so we can't see the tnt but stuff's exploding so that's that's interesting i wonder how much longer this is going to go on i'm going to go ahead and stop the frame time counter i mean at this point we've pretty much gone through the bulk of the explosion anyway we saw the frame rate dipped to zero that was pretty much what i wanted to get across here 30 by 30 by 30 is definitely a hard limit and this crater just keeps getting larger oh i think we're i think we're done now i think okay all right yeah um this this is a this is an enormous creator at this point i'm gonna compile all the data i need to set things up so that the the graphs are presentable they're palatable for uh for my audience and you're not going to be interested in seeing just a bunch of frame times essentially in milliseconds in a large list so i'm going to compile all those kind of uh put together like a line chart so to speak so we can see frame time change over time and remember in this case frame time is the inverse of frames per second so it's one over second for fps but then seconds over frames is a frame time so the higher the frame time value the worse performance you'll get overall and all right here we are we've got the frame time in milliseconds remember there's a thousand milliseconds in every second so if you wanted to do the inverse of 57.151 for example which was the max frame time uh during the first run which was just with a single block of tnt give me a second let me get my calculator going to be 1 divided by one five .057151 i think my decimal place is in the correct spot so there you go 17.5 ish frames per second that was the lowest fps we measured when we detonated a single block of tnt right so that that's basically the inverse of this and you calculate it just by taking the inverse of 1 divided by the frame time just make sure you get your decimal place right because it has to be in seconds because we measure fps of course in seconds that's what fps stands for now for the 27 block detonation i really didn't see this one coming ready for it check that out 47.088 milliseconds that was the peak frame time we measured during that detonation which involved mind you 26 more tnt blocks than the previous one you can see though that our minimum frame rate was actually much much higher uh really if we calculated this it's a 10 millisecond difference there let me get my trusty calculator comes out to 21.24 ish frames per second so that's about four fps higher than the single tnt block detonation that's right we're talking about minimum fps here so um yeah interesting now notice that the frame time spike dragged out a bit more here right so this lasted quite a bit longer that's because you have the other tnt blocks to detonate not just a single one we detonated the first time i still didn't expect this frame time to be lower than the single tnt detonation all right now we're moving on to the 1 000 block scenario this is what we've got so far and this is what we're working with now now i kept the y axis the same just so you could get a sense of sheer scale here but if we adjust the y-axis you can see that our peak frame time was roughly 100 milliseconds 1 divided by 0.0991666 and yeah that's a whopping 10 fps you can see it dragged out quite a long time by the way uh you've got so many so many more tnt blocks to detonate essentially which is why this never really returned to that uh pretty stable low frame time that the first two scenarios encountered and now we've got the enchilada folks remember the 27 000 tnt block detonation scenario it did not play out too well in real time and this here is the new graph inserted without an adjusted y-axis so i mean you can see it goes it goes way up here way off the chart but how much higher well you're going to want to strap in for this one way up here 12 785 86 milliseconds um we could measure that in seconds folks so actually if you move that decimal place three places to the left that'll give you seconds and it took almost 13 seconds to render the slowest frame yeah remember when i said we can measure in seconds per frame instead of frames per second well there you go it took 13 seconds or thereabouts to render a single frame so it's spf instead of fps i mean the sheer difference here is just baffling i mean you can't even see peaks you this looks all flat down here these other three scenarios look like totally straight flat lines along the x-axis and then you've got this just enormous enormous jump that's just that's just insane let's go ahead and calculate what this would actually be though in fps that's going to be 1 divided by let's see 12 12.785731 even though these small decimal places don't really matter and they give us a whopping .078 frames per second after an entire second of waiting on this frame to render we weren't even a tenth of the way through it being rendered that's how heavy of a hit minecraft took on our 5950x rig that is just awful but at the same time it's pretty freaking cool i mean look how much damage we did like there's just there's nothing left here we must have dropped down let's see how far we dropped down here we are literally about 25 blocks down just from detonating that tnt on the surface it's freaking nuts and so as the sun sets on a day of experimenting i think um it's a job well done i think we satisfied our morbid curiosity it is thundering outside what the heck and hopefully you had a bit of fun in this one i i like being able to like integrate games into some of our testing methodology just being able to see in real time what's happening with cpu and gpu usage and what's happening ultimately with frame rate as well which is one of the uh most coveted metrics among us gamers so if you enjoyed this little video you should let me know give this one a thumbs up i would appreciate that i'm just kidding i'm not gonna do it i'm not gonna do an outro like this i'm not i'm not a minecraft youtuber although that would be pretty cool real though if you enjoyed the video be sure to let me know that feedback is super valuable and look i'm just kind of they're just throwing stuff at the wall trying to see what sticks at this point it's difficult to really get enthusiastic about a pc build uh seeing as though graphics card prices are still disastrous and prices don't seem to be getting all that much better in fact they probably will get worse soon based on some of the news i've been i've been hearing so that's um that that's that's not good and i'm trying to tie you guys over try to keep you entertained as best i can of course our cleaning series and our fix series are are still healthy they're still doing well we're going to keep those up but you know when you want to experiment a bit try other things um it's always important to get feedback from yard and so that's why i'm asking you for uh for that in the comments section i would appreciate if you watched this far on the video that alone is a huge help so with all that if you haven't subscribed already and get subscribed join our public discord server check out our amazon links in the video description and i will catch you in the next one wow it is getting very very stormy outside my name is greg thanks for blowing stuff up with me",

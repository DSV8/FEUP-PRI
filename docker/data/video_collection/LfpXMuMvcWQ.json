    "transcript": "(SPEAKER_00) This PC is the same price as a PlayStation 5 (SPEAKER_00) and competes, or in some cases, even wins (SPEAKER_00) in just about every game we tested, (SPEAKER_00) including some Sony first-party titles. (SPEAKER_00) But how is that even possible? (SPEAKER_00) I mean, gaming consoles dominate computers (SPEAKER_00) in price to performance, don't they? (SPEAKER_00) Well, sometimes. (SPEAKER_00) It's no secret that Sony and Microsoft (SPEAKER_00) are willing to sell their hardware at a loss (SPEAKER_00) in order to lock you into their ecosystem (SPEAKER_00) of accessories, subscription services, and software, (SPEAKER_00) all of which are sold for a profit. (SPEAKER_00) Over time, then, this chips away at your initial savings, (SPEAKER_00) but even with that in mind, (SPEAKER_00) I totally get why people go for it. (SPEAKER_00) When this thing launched, (SPEAKER_00) $500 barely got you a decent GPU, (SPEAKER_00) let alone a complete gaming box. (SPEAKER_00) Of course, there's (SPEAKER_00) no denying the power of the Sony exclusive machine. No PC could ever hope to compete with that model, (SPEAKER_00) at least not for the first couple of years, but technology marches ever onward and with (SPEAKER_00) competition and the used market heating up again, it is finally possible to match (SPEAKER_00) the price and performance and budget of a PlayStation 5 with (SPEAKER_00) a gaming PC. And ours is going to be powered by Seasonic, who sponsored this video, even though (SPEAKER_00) this is a second-hand power supply. That'll make sense later. First, we have to answer some (SPEAKER_00) big questions. If our goal is to match the PlayStation 5's spec, we need a Ryzen 7 3700X (SPEAKER_00) with eight Zen 2 cores and a 6600 XT RDNA 2 GPU. But guys, we don't want to (SPEAKER_00) match it. Look at the title! We want to beat it! (SPEAKER_00) That means making smart choices in the name of real-world performance, even if they might come with some compromises, like this one. (SPEAKER_00) We've gone with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, and it's got two fewer cores than the PlayStation 5. (SPEAKER_00) However, it's Zen 3 architecture makes it the budget king when it comes to gaming right now. (SPEAKER_00) And it's only 65 watts, meaning that the stock heatsink that's included with it (SPEAKER_00) ... (SPEAKER_00) should be fine to keep it cool. (SPEAKER_00) That right there, that's savings. (SPEAKER_00) And it means we don't need an OP power supply (SPEAKER_00) in order to drive this thing. (SPEAKER_00) Boom! (SPEAKER_00) More savings. (SPEAKER_00) Now, it's worth noting that for a few bucks more, (SPEAKER_00) you could jump up to a 57 or a 5800X, (SPEAKER_00) but we are on a pretty tight budget. (SPEAKER_00) Making our $500 target even more challenging (SPEAKER_00) is the fact that we wanted this to be a build (SPEAKER_00) that you could replicate at home. (SPEAKER_00) This isn't scrapyard wars, this is a guide. (SPEAKER_00) So we targeted prices that you will probably be able (SPEAKER_00) to find in about a week, whether it's on eBay or elsewhere. (SPEAKER_00) If you're patient and have a little luck on your side, (SPEAKER_00) there are better deals to be had out there. (SPEAKER_00) David found this puppy for just over 70 US dollars. (SPEAKER_00) Just remember to follow our guidelines for marketplace bargain hunting, (SPEAKER_00) if you want to avoid getting scammed. We're going to have that video linked down below. (SPEAKER_00) The nice thing about going for AMD's AM4 socket is that there are three whole generations of (SPEAKER_00) motherboards that you get to pick from. But we noticed a few things you're going (SPEAKER_00) to want to watch out for. First, older generation boards turned out to cost (SPEAKER_00) almost the same as the newer ones, but had a much higher risk of incompatibility with newer chips. (SPEAKER_00) So make sure you double check the manufacturer's website. (SPEAKER_00) Second, for the difference in price, (SPEAKER_00) A series chipsets are a no-no. (SPEAKER_00) You're gonna wanna go B series (SPEAKER_00) in order to retain important features (SPEAKER_00) and get what is typically higher build quality, (SPEAKER_00) even if it costs a few more dollars. (SPEAKER_00) So B550 and B450 ended up being the sweet spot (SPEAKER_00) where we found multiple candidates for around $40, (SPEAKER_00) including our ASRock B450M Pro4. (SPEAKER_00) It's got four DDR4 DIMM slots for our 16 gigs of G.Skill Trident Z 3600 mega transfer per second RAM (SPEAKER_00) and it's even got respectable I/O including USB Type-C. (SPEAKER_00) Now it's not all roses, B450 is limited to PCI Express Gen 3 rather than Gen 4. (SPEAKER_00) That means that our system could struggle to get maximum performance out of future GPUs (SPEAKER_00) and even today, this is a compromise next to one of the PS5's most advertised features. (SPEAKER_00) It's rockin' fast SSD. (SPEAKER_00) Our 1TB Samsung 970 EVO+ runs at only about 3/5ths of the speed of the PlayStation 5's storage. (SPEAKER_00) But, it's a reputable name-brand drive and, with most PC games being optimized for SATA SSDs (SPEAKER_00) or even hard drives, there will be next to no impact in our gaming performance. (SPEAKER_00) At least for now. (SPEAKER_00) So smart compromise or dumb cut? (SPEAKER_00) Let us know what you think in the comments below. (SPEAKER_00) Speaking of cuts, we ended up saving some of our money (SPEAKER_00) by using the kind of case (SPEAKER_00) that might have some ragged edges on it, (SPEAKER_00) but can be found for free or for just a few bucks (SPEAKER_00) on a local marketplace. (SPEAKER_00) David, this thing is huge. (SPEAKER_00) Hell yeah. (SPEAKER_00) Definitely Advantage PS5, (SPEAKER_00) which with dbrand dark plates, (SPEAKER_00) comfortably fits in an LTT backpack, lttstore.com. (SPEAKER_00) Your mileage may vary here. (SPEAKER_00) We got lucky-ish, (SPEAKER_00) and this was a pretty sick case before the trauma, (SPEAKER_00) but your goal is to pretty much find someone (SPEAKER_00) who's dumping old office PCs or gaming skeletons like this (SPEAKER_00) for next to, if not zero. (SPEAKER_00) If you're patient, (SPEAKER_00) you can often find ones with some cooling fans already installed in them to save a few more bucks. (SPEAKER_00) The only big thing to watch out for is ATX compatibility and clearance for any longer (SPEAKER_00) components. A Dremel can often solve compatibility issues, but you might not have one on hand. (SPEAKER_00) Fortunately, we won't need any of that for our X650 Gold power supply from today's sponsor, (SPEAKER_00) Seasonic. This particular unit came out almost the (SPEAKER_00) 15 years ago, but is still going strong. (SPEAKER_00) And what's really cool is that even if you are buying (SPEAKER_00) secondhand, Seasonic stands behind their products hard. (SPEAKER_00) They actually have a transferable warranty, (SPEAKER_00) being that all you need to do is ask the seller (SPEAKER_00) for the original sales invoice, (SPEAKER_00) and you're covered for the entire original length. (SPEAKER_00) Not only that, but they recently upped their warranty (SPEAKER_00) on newer units from 10 years to 12 years. (SPEAKER_00) Absolutely. (SPEAKER_00) Chads. (SPEAKER_00) Now, let's talk GPU. (SPEAKER_00) This one, it's gonna be a little spicy. (SPEAKER_00) But hey, spice is the spice of life, right? (SPEAKER_00) We've gone with the Intel Arc A770. (SPEAKER_00) I know, I know guys. (SPEAKER_00) But compatibility has improved a lot (SPEAKER_00) and it's got 16 gigs of GDDR6 memory all to itself (SPEAKER_00) instead of having to share with the CPU. (SPEAKER_00) Now, people are starting to catch on to this thing (SPEAKER_00) and by the time this video comes out, (SPEAKER_00) prices may have gone up a bit, (SPEAKER_00) but we had an opportunity, so we seized it. (SPEAKER_00) Also, we kind of wanted an excuse to see (SPEAKER_00) how far Intel has come for ourselves (SPEAKER_00) after a couple of years of driver updates. (SPEAKER_00) It is worth acknowledging at this stage (SPEAKER_00) that we could have gone with a 6700 XT (SPEAKER_00) or a 3060 Ti at this price, but... (SPEAKER_00) Let's game. (SPEAKER_00) We're gonna assume you have some kind of peripherals to use, (SPEAKER_00) so we didn't factor those into our budget. (SPEAKER_00) But otherwise, what you're looking at (SPEAKER_00) is an apples to apples comparison (SPEAKER_00) between our PS5 and our PS5 killer. (SPEAKER_00) We hope. (SPEAKER_00) These fans don't work. (SPEAKER_00) To kick things off, we're gonna be playing \"DOOM Eternal,\" (SPEAKER_00) a game that runs at 120 FPS on the PlayStation 5, albeit. (SPEAKER_00) at a lower resolution scale. (SPEAKER_00) So, we've set our PC to run at 4K, (SPEAKER_00) but 68% resolution scale. (SPEAKER_00) And I gotta tell you, this is not looking good. (SPEAKER_00) Not right. (SPEAKER_00) Dude, this is basically unplayable. (SPEAKER_00) What kind of frame rate are you... (SPEAKER_00) Oh, wow. I'm hitting 120, baby. (SPEAKER_00) Something is wrong. (SPEAKER_00) Ah, there's your problem right there. (SPEAKER_00) On the PC side... (SPEAKER_00) you might have to do a little bit of configuration (SPEAKER_00) with the most important one being (SPEAKER_00) enabling above 4G decoding and resizable bar support. (SPEAKER_00) Particularly Intel Arc does not perform its best (SPEAKER_00) without rebar enabled. (SPEAKER_00) Oh yeah, that is more like it. (SPEAKER_00) Oh yeah. (SPEAKER_00) 1% lows of 110, 115 FPS. (SPEAKER_00) It is amazing what a difference. (SPEAKER_00) Just making sure everything is configure-molated properly can make. (SPEAKER_00) Dude, was this really 500 bucks though? Yeah. (SPEAKER_00) Man, Intel Arc, not so bad after all, huh? (SPEAKER_00) It's hard to do an apples to apples comparison here because the image quality and the settings (SPEAKER_00) menus are not necessarily directly comparable. But what David and I can do is we can skip this (SPEAKER_00) cut scene. - (SPEAKER_00) And just, oh, I mean, that's interesting. (SPEAKER_00) My field of view is so much wider than yours. (SPEAKER_00) Oh, I can change that. - Ah. (SPEAKER_00) Ooh, I don't have HDR on though. (SPEAKER_00) Oh. Let's turn that on. (SPEAKER_00) Okay, my screen's not pretty, but what about my PlayStation? (SPEAKER_00) Pretty frickin' nice. Do you like my PlayStation? (SPEAKER_00) I'm the wrong person to ask, I like this case. (SPEAKER_00) Okay, hold on, we're gonna figure this out, one second. (SPEAKER_00) I can't think of anything more Windows (SPEAKER_00) than having HDR issues. (SPEAKER_00) So a huge advantage of playing on my PlayStation, (SPEAKER_00) if I plug in an HDR display, it's like, (SPEAKER_00) \"Hey, let's calibrate, you're done.\" (SPEAKER_00) I once had a computer that had such a bad HDR issue (SPEAKER_00) that it was easier to reinstall Windows (SPEAKER_00) than to figure out the issue. (SPEAKER_00) I'd call you a liar, but I believe you 100%. (SPEAKER_00) I promise it's true. (SPEAKER_00) The next thing we discovered is that HDR support (SPEAKER_00) on Intel Arc is a little bit spotty. (SPEAKER_00) It turns out AMD and Nvidia have proprietary implementations (SPEAKER_00) for how the game calls for HDR to be enabled, (SPEAKER_00) and Intel, well. (SPEAKER_00) It doesn't support them. (SPEAKER_00) It uses the standard DirectX implementation. (SPEAKER_00) So there's no denying that HDR is gonna look better (SPEAKER_00) than SDR in any game that supports it. (SPEAKER_00) That really pops. (SPEAKER_00) However, now that we've got rebar enabled, (SPEAKER_00) performance is looking pretty darn good. (SPEAKER_00) And I'd say, who's got the edge (SPEAKER_00) when it comes to image quality? (SPEAKER_00) It's pretty close. (SPEAKER_00) It's really close. (SPEAKER_00) That when I look at this cluster of rocks, (SPEAKER_00) the geometry and the detail and the textures (SPEAKER_00) are looking, I think the textures (SPEAKER_00) are a little bit better on this, (SPEAKER_00) but the geometry detail is about the same. (SPEAKER_00) Okay, how's it feel though? (SPEAKER_00) Here we go. (SPEAKER_00) The fact that I'm using an HDR display right now (SPEAKER_00) and not getting an HDR image is a bit of a downer, (SPEAKER_00) but most people do not have HDR displays. (SPEAKER_00) I'm getting anywhere from 115 to 120 FPS. (SPEAKER_00) I don't have frame view open. (SPEAKER_00) I should open that. (SPEAKER_00) I had frame view open one of the previous times (SPEAKER_00) before we were diagnosing the HDR thing. (SPEAKER_00) And I'm getting 1% lows. (SPEAKER_00) It's in the neighborhood of around 110, 115 FPS. (SPEAKER_00) It's really respectable. (SPEAKER_00) Here's something, (SPEAKER_00) you've definitely got the edge in loading times. (SPEAKER_00) Yeah. (SPEAKER_00) But with that said, (SPEAKER_00) this is a lot of PC for the money. (SPEAKER_00) It's pretty impressive. (SPEAKER_00) I would not be surprised (SPEAKER_00) if we managed to put together something like this (SPEAKER_00) as a one-off. (SPEAKER_00) You know, we negotiated everyone into the ground, (SPEAKER_00) but the fact that we were able to find (SPEAKER_00) with pretty good consistency, (SPEAKER_00) parts like this available for this price, (SPEAKER_00) it's PC gaming back. (SPEAKER_00) Oh, a hundred percent. (SPEAKER_00) Is the render scale at 100%? (SPEAKER_00) Yep. (SPEAKER_00) So this is actually better image quality than a PS5 (SPEAKER_00) because the PS5 will be 1800p. (SPEAKER_00) Upscale to 4K. (SPEAKER_00) And we're hitting 60. (SPEAKER_00) I mean. (SPEAKER_00) Pretty respectable. (SPEAKER_00) Once again, I couldn't help noticing (SPEAKER_00) this game looks a lot better in HDR though. (SPEAKER_00) Yeah, those colors look a lot more vibrant. (SPEAKER_00) This is freaking smooth. (SPEAKER_00) One of the big things that Intel has struggled with (SPEAKER_00) with Arc is while their average frame rate might be good, (SPEAKER_00) the 1% lows are 1% very low. (SPEAKER_00) Here, I'm not getting that kind of stutter. (SPEAKER_00) This is a very, very smooth experience. (SPEAKER_00) And what does that game run at in performance mode, 60? (SPEAKER_00) 60. (SPEAKER_00) Yeah, okay. (SPEAKER_00) It's not a perfect 60. (SPEAKER_00) It'll drop from that frame rate once in a while, (SPEAKER_00) but it's a little more steady than this PC one. (SPEAKER_00) But with VRR, I think I would choose that extra sharpness. (SPEAKER_00) I was kind of surprised every time I tried upscaling, (SPEAKER_00) it lowered the performance. (SPEAKER_00) So, let's go quality. That's 1440p, I think. (SPEAKER_00) Yeah. (SPEAKER_00) My 1% lows are still the same. (SPEAKER_00) Given that, I probably wouldn't bother, (SPEAKER_00) but this is my first experience with Intel XCSS (SPEAKER_00) in quite a long time, and it looks really good. (SPEAKER_00) Yeah. Does it look better than FSR? (SPEAKER_00) Hard to say, I'd have to look at it side by side, (SPEAKER_00) but it's, I don't see anything obvious (SPEAKER_00) that's jumping off the screen at me, (SPEAKER_00) like, oh yeah, they're upscaling, it looks ugly. (SPEAKER_00) Even distant text, super sharp. (SPEAKER_00) Come on, PC, let's go! (SPEAKER_00) Oh, oh, oh my gosh, your video did load first. (SPEAKER_00) Oh! (SPEAKER_00) Let's see who makes it in-game first. (SPEAKER_00) What? (SPEAKER_00) Oh, probably whoever developed the port. (SPEAKER_00) Oh. (SPEAKER_00) Wow, okay, that's not fair. (SPEAKER_00) That's not fair, though. (SPEAKER_00) That's true. (SPEAKER_00) Oh, wow. (SPEAKER_00) What happened? (SPEAKER_00) Device driver humped. (SPEAKER_00) What driver? (SPEAKER_00) Dude, I literally installed it today. (SPEAKER_00) All right, 20-- (SPEAKER_00) Frames per second. (SPEAKER_00) That's lower than it was before. (SPEAKER_00) I also set it to 4K native. (SPEAKER_00) Oh yeah, don't do that. (SPEAKER_00) Okay, but HDR is working in this game. (SPEAKER_00) Hey, there we go. (SPEAKER_00) I hope this is a 30 FPS game on PlayStation. (SPEAKER_00) Hmm. (SPEAKER_00) Oh, no. (SPEAKER_00) Okay. (SPEAKER_01) Why is it crashing so much? (SPEAKER_00) No, no, it's got this. (SPEAKER_00) It's got this, I believe. (SPEAKER_00) I believe it has the power of PC. (SPEAKER_00) The power of PC compels you. (SPEAKER_00) Next game. (SPEAKER_00) For God of War runs at 1440p on the PS5, (SPEAKER_00) so we're doing some upscaling here, (SPEAKER_00) but what we can't figure out is (SPEAKER_00) what the heck is going on with HDR? (SPEAKER_00) It's not in display, it's not in graphics. (SPEAKER_00) Oh, wait. (SPEAKER_00) Screen calibration, really, you guys? (SPEAKER_00) I think this might be the first game. (SPEAKER_00) That does look good. (SPEAKER_00) New game? (SPEAKER_00) Yeah. (SPEAKER_00) I read that the HDR on the PC version of God of War (SPEAKER_00) is supposed to look a little better, (SPEAKER_00) in spite of this being a generation older TV than this one. (SPEAKER_00) It does. (SPEAKER_00) I think it does actually look a little better. (SPEAKER_00) How's the details and everything? (SPEAKER_00) It's pretty similar. (SPEAKER_00) I think it's a little less on PC. (SPEAKER_00) Oh. (SPEAKER_00) This upscaling looks a little better (SPEAKER_00) in the fine hairs of Kratos's beard. (SPEAKER_00) Yep, it's a little softer there. (SPEAKER_00) I gotta be looking for it, though. (SPEAKER_00) At TV distance, I wouldn't notice. (SPEAKER_00) It looks so similar, (SPEAKER_00) other than that this one's a little more pop. (SPEAKER_00) What's your FPS? (SPEAKER_00) 60. (SPEAKER_00) Me too. (SPEAKER_00) Let's go. (SPEAKER_00) Okay. (SPEAKER_00) Go. (SPEAKER_01) Yeah. (SPEAKER_00) And go. (SPEAKER_01) Yeah, this is so satisfying. (SPEAKER_01) And go. (SPEAKER_01) Yeah, get it, Kratos? (SPEAKER_00) And go. (SPEAKER_00) Crap, no, I messed up. (SPEAKER_00) The last, most important one. (SPEAKER_00) We're gonna have links, by the way, (SPEAKER_00) to everything that we use down below. (SPEAKER_00) And on that note, if you're buying on eBay, congratulations. (SPEAKER_00) You've got great buyer protection. (SPEAKER_00) So make sure that you use it (SPEAKER_00) by testing everything that you buy before the. (SPEAKER_00) Turn windows up, run some stress tests, you know, (SPEAKER_00) mem test for RAM and CPU memory controller, (SPEAKER_00) prime 95 for CPU compute, (SPEAKER_00) firm art for your GPU, (SPEAKER_00) and for extra credit, (SPEAKER_00) push all the components at once, (SPEAKER_00) which will help stress test your power supply. (SPEAKER_00) On a related note, by the way, (SPEAKER_00) marketplaces can have better pricing (SPEAKER_00) because they don't charge the same seller fees, (SPEAKER_00) but they don't have any buyer protection. (SPEAKER_00) And unless people happen to be bros. (SPEAKER_00) You are not getting your money back for faulty hardware. (SPEAKER_00) That means that you always want to test the parts (SPEAKER_00) before buying them. (SPEAKER_00) And if the seller is being weird (SPEAKER_00) about showing you the parts working, skip them. (SPEAKER_00) Just save yourself that die roll. (SPEAKER_00) There's plenty of fish in the sea. (SPEAKER_00) Also, always visually inspect the commonly damaged areas (SPEAKER_00) like the pins on a CPU or on a motherboard. (SPEAKER_00) There's no denying the results though, David. (SPEAKER_00) This is a little less sharp, (SPEAKER_00) but I also think I have a little bit more headroom. (SPEAKER_00) It's hard to compare 'cause this one's locked at 60. (SPEAKER_01) I'd be curious to see if we unlocked it, (SPEAKER_00) what kind of numbers we would hit. (SPEAKER_00) But that's console, baby. (SPEAKER_00) You get what you get. (SPEAKER_00) This actually seems like a good time to bring up (SPEAKER_00) that we casually didn't include a controller, (SPEAKER_00) whereas for that $500 price point, (SPEAKER_00) or even lower if you don't bother (SPEAKER_00) with the disc version of the PlayStation 5, (SPEAKER_00) you get one of the best controllers on the market, (SPEAKER_00) arguably one of the best controllers like ever. (SPEAKER_00) Am I gonna get another one that has HDR working? (SPEAKER_00) Looks like it. (SPEAKER_00) You know what? (SPEAKER_00) That's smoother though. (SPEAKER_00) That's, I was about to say. (SPEAKER_00) Yeah. (SPEAKER_00) I'm pretty sure you're in 30 FPS mode here (SPEAKER_00) 'cause that looks a little, (SPEAKER_00) that looks a little sharper though. (SPEAKER_00) Yeah. (SPEAKER_00) I can really see it in the stray hairs here. (SPEAKER_00) Oh yeah. (SPEAKER_00) To be clear, this is very playable. (SPEAKER_00) This is not bad, but this is definitely a little sharper. (SPEAKER_00) Let me see what I can do to fix that up a bit over here. (SPEAKER_00) In terms of settings, I'm running pretty much at ultra. (SPEAKER_00) But what I haven't maxed out is my render scale, so I'm going to try rendering at 80%. (SPEAKER_00) Rather than 70% of 4K. (SPEAKER_00) The Last of Us is the kind of game that 30 FPS is pretty acceptable to me. (SPEAKER_00) Are there any crucifixes nearby? (SPEAKER_00) Because I think we're going to need one. (SPEAKER_00) It's a cinematic game. (SPEAKER_00) As long as I'm over 24, I'm fine. (SPEAKER_00) Look, Ocarina of Time, 20 frames a second. (SPEAKER_00) Greatest game of all time. (SPEAKER_00) What can I say? (SPEAKER_00) You've got the edge for image quality, I think. (SPEAKER_00) These fine stray hairs are not quite looking as good. (SPEAKER_00) I also wonder, you're set on ultra settings. (SPEAKER_00) If maybe there's some shadow things we could bring down in some kind of optimization that would help boost you back over the edge. (SPEAKER_00) After some more playing around, we ended up needing 70% render scale in order to get 30 FPS consistently in Last of Us Part 1. (SPEAKER_00) It should be noted, we could absolutely hit higher frame rates if we were willing to compromise on visual fidelity. (SPEAKER_00) But that wasn't the point of this exercise. (SPEAKER_00) The point of this exercise was to get an as-good or, in some cases, (SPEAKER_00) maybe even better experience with the same budget. (SPEAKER_00) And what did we spend overall? (SPEAKER_00) We spent $475. (SPEAKER_00) We got $25 of wiggle room. (SPEAKER_00) Right. (SPEAKER_00) But we also conjured peripherals. (SPEAKER_00) We didn't pay for a controller. (SPEAKER_00) And realistically, we don't have a warranty on pretty much any of our parts. (SPEAKER_00) We also had to put in the time to source all this stuff and put it together, (SPEAKER_00) including the risk of running into broken hardware, incompatibilities. (SPEAKER_00) We had some games. (SPEAKER_00) We had some games that, because of our choice of an Intel Arc GPU, didn't run as well, (SPEAKER_00) whether that's crashing or limited support for HDR. (SPEAKER_00) So full credit to Sony and Microsoft for that matter. (SPEAKER_00) This generation of consoles, I would say, has retained its better value than a PC status for far longer than I anticipated. (SPEAKER_00) And it may be another year, even two years, before we can beat them with a brand new machine. (SPEAKER_00) But I also think that credit to David, by the way, (SPEAKER_00) for the adventurous, we've shown that it can. (SPEAKER_00) And be done today. (SPEAKER_00) If you're willing to get a little creative. (SPEAKER_00) Just like we're creatively telling you about our sponsor. (SPEAKER_00) Actually, we already did, but whatever. (SPEAKER_00) Seasonic, they deserve even more shout outs (SPEAKER_00) just for being kind of awesome. (SPEAKER_00) This ancient power supply guys was a champion (SPEAKER_00) running this modern hardware. (SPEAKER_00) And the way that Seasonic stands behind their products (SPEAKER_00) with long transferable warranties is admirable. (SPEAKER_00) Check out their new Vertex lineup (SPEAKER_00) featuring Cybernetics performance certification, (SPEAKER_00) quiet, efficient operation, (SPEAKER_00) and a whopping 12 year warranty at the link down below.

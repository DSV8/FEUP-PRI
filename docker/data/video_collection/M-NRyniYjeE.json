    "description": "Dave2D compares the Apple iMac Pro against the Alienware Area 51 Threadripper and other powerful desktops. iMac Pro -   2018. Apple releases their most expensive computer ever made with some of the best hardware on the market. The new iMac Pro comes loaded with the most powerful graphics and processors ever in a Mac. Everything looks great with the crisp 5K Retina display. Buyers get to choose to have 8, 10, 14 or even 18 cores with turbo boost speeds up to 4.5GHz. With 4 channels of memory that can support 128GB 2666MHz of DDR4 ECC RAM, rendering is super fast.

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. So this is a video on the new iMac Pro and this is going to be a good two-part video. I'm going to do a comparative performance review between the iMac Pro and 3 other powerful desktops that I've been using over the past a little bit. And then, for the second part of this video, I want to talk about the idea of this product as a whole. So for the comparison, we have 4 desktops. So first is this iMac Pro. It's the 10-core model, 64 gigs of RAM with the Vega 64 GPU. And then we have a Threadripper, Alienware Area-51. So this thing has 16 cores, 64 gigs of RAM, and a pair of GTX 1080 Ti's and SLI. And then we have a Ryzen 1700x build. This is an 8-core CPU, 64 gigs of RAM, a single GTX 1080, and then lastly, we have the 10-core \"trash can\" Mac Pro. Now, this thing is a little bit dated as 4 years old at this point but before the iMac Pro came out recently, this thing was literally the most powerful Apple computer that you could get for multi-core applications. Performance on the 10-core iMac Pro is very good. Like if you ignore the price of this thing, and you only look at the performance benchmarks, you can see that it's better than the 8-core Ryzen by quite a bit, and it's a noticeable step-up from the 2013 Mac Pro. But as expected, it's not as good as the 16-core Threadripper. So these benchmarks obviously don't assure us everything, because this thing's running a Xeon processor with ECC memory, but it does give you a general idea of how they perform relative to each other. Now, I'm an Adobe user, particularly Adobe Premiere, so I'm going to focus my performance review of these devices, for Premiere. So these are the render times for my workflow, which is 5K footage from a SCARLET-W camera, and we're seeing the same kind of trend here. Performance on the 10-core, iMac Pro is very good. Not as fast as the Alienware Threadripper system, but it's still very impressive. The thermal performance is also really good, because cooling a 10-core CPU in a form factor like this is not easy, and then doing it quietly is even more difficult. And we're looking at very comfortable temperatures on idle or load. Fan noise is also surprisingly quiet. It doesn't come on very often, but when it does, it's very tolerable. So yeah, there's a lot of good things about the iMac Pro. I mean, it looks really good. The space gray is awesome. Space gray keyboard is really cool, and the black Lightning cable, which for some people is really important. The 5K screen looks amazing with an improved webcam. And the I/O is pretty good as well, you're getting way more ports than the average Apple computer. And as you saw earlier, the thermal management is quite good, but the thing that makes this computer special to me, is the form factor. They're able to sake so much great hardware into a relatively small all-in-one package. And it's a very nice-looking package, in my opinion. But the reason why I made this video and the thing that, kind of, bugs me up this product is the price tag. So this is an Apple product. Apple products tend to be a little bit more expensive, and it's a professional Apple product, so you're going to pay a little bit more over premium than normal. But, you often see this argument being thrown around about how this thing is \"not overpriced\", because if you try to build this thing from scratch, like through your own parts, the price tag would be not too different from what Apple charges. But I don't entirely agree with them, because I think most people, they're building systems with Xeon processors and ECC memory wouldn't be pairing it up with a 5K screen. So Xeon processors are used for applications where it's just constant, heavy use of the CPU. So if you're a stock trader, or, just doing any kind of application where you're doing complex calculations all day, every day. You're running scenarios of something like that Xeon makes sense. If your renders take, like, 18 hours to run, then yeah. Xeon makes sense. And same with the RAM if your applications require huge amounts of data to be transferred around in memory, and you just cannot have any room for error, then sure, ECC RAM is great for you. For most people, for most professionals, they just, they don't want this stuff. They want really powerful computers and in 2018, we have the ability to buy really powerful computers that are not Xeon processors and do not require ECC memory. And, it bugs me that Apple is putting this type of equipment as the only option for those professionals. So, most people, most professionals, they want high core count. They want, like eight, ten, maybe twelve cores, and for Windows users, there's plenty of inexpensive options right now. We can get, like Ryzen CPUs, i7, i9, even Threadripper's cheaper than this stuff. With Xeon, you're paying a huge premium for the processor with the architecture, and you're forced to buy, just expensive components across the board to make that stuff work. And with Apple, you're locked into that ecosystem just because to get high core count. So for certain content creators that work with Apple applications, this, kind of, make sense because it's really your only option, but for people that work with applications that have multi-platform abilities, like you can do it in Windows or you can do it on Apple, like the Adobe application, this product is, just, it feels so overpriced. I really enjoy the OS X or macOS (they call it that one). I enjoy macOS, but this product just feels way too expensive to justify its purchase. At least for someone like me, like uh, kind of mid-tier content creator. So, that's what we have, a very overpriced, I'm going to use that term, overpriced product from Apple this year, that fits the needs for very few number of people but I think for most people, it should be a pass. Okay, hope you guys enjoy this video. Thumbs if you've liked it, subs if you've loved it. See you guys, next time.",

    "transcript": "- We'll just be unkind to it here. Right? Stop. I'm trying to screw with you. Stop. - Screw with you. - As I get older, there's one thing that I want my 3D printers to do, work. And you, you think that's pretty easy but it really is not an apparently AnchorMake has made one that uses the power of AI to prevent spaghetti. Let's test it out and huge thanks to anchor make for sponsoring this video. Oh I've been using 3D printers for the better part of 10 years. And for about five of those, I didn't use 3D printers because they're so good at being just terrible. For a long while there, I only liked using laser cutters because then at least if it fails, you only waste an hour or two instead of a day. When you're working on videos like this, you can't waste a day. Oh In the last couple of years though, 3D printers have gotten to the point where, well I enjoy using them again. They work well. They give me my parts and I just arrive the next day. And it's sitting there. It's fantastic. It's hopefully this one can do that and even better Apparently faster too. Although their 70% claims are kind of eh. Oh, fancy! Look at this. Apparently this thing only takes 15 minutes to put together. I guess we're gonna find out soon. I'm running out of table. I like the packaging. It seems like the whole thing arrived in intact. Despite you know, UPS's best efforts. This plate rate here looks really expensive. This is all aluminum. I don't know if it's hallow or not. Can we take it apart? Let's take it apart. We're supposed to be putting it together, but you know, sometimes things just start going the wrong way. Have an included tool kit. Very nice. Oh weird. Look at this. It's a changeable Allen key. - We'll see how difficult it is. Okay, bottom's plastic. That's good. I don't know the price yet. So I'm mostly just looking at this and hoping it's not too bad. Normally you don't compliment people on using plastic. But if this whole thing was aluminum I would've been pretty concerned about the pricing. It's just injection mold of plastic. The top though is a piece of aluminum. Wonder what the chances are. Heck yeah. Did we do it? Feels like there's a sneaky screw somewhere. Do you know how many units there are in existence right now Jono? - [Jono] No probably very little. - Yeah, very few. I know that this is all beta build stuff. So how many exist right now? We don't know, but it can't be very many. So we probably shouldn't break it. Found the last screw required to get this open. It requires a 16th inch hex. This right here does not reach all the way down. - [David] They knew what they were doing. - Yeah. They probably don't want us in here which look, fair enough. We're gonna be right beside AC. Ha ha! Damn afraid Jono this is gonna be expensive. There's no way this is cheap. That's a very nice and very expensive block of aluminum right there. One and a half, one and a half. Would've had to come out of like a three inch thick piece of aluminum. This has to be a beta version thing. This would either have to be cast or plastic in the final one. There's no way they're doing something this expensive or it's gonna be like a $5,000 machine. $429. Okay, yeah. There's no way that this right here is a part on the final version. If the early bird prices and that's what like a bit off. So that means the final is gonna come around 800 ish. - Okay. Yeah. There's no way this part's on there. This is a really nice part. Our Pantheon printer has a very similar like build plate that they put everything against. It's $8,000. If the product is this and it comes in at $429 you should just buy it and take the aluminum. All right, now we can have a look at what's in here. We have a nice little power supply here. 24 volts. Oh Jono, looks like we can change the output voltage. Should we try and over clog this thing? - That, that wouldn't work. Don't do that. You also have our nice little controller. I find it really interesting if they use type C. All right. We just got confirm from Anchor. This aluminum bit here is going to be cast in the final product, but it will be all aluminum which is sweet. Do we read the instructions, Jono? Or do we just go for it? - Yeah, this seems very yoloable. There's probably a good way to do this. This one has a bent pin. No, I didn't bend the pin. It came with a bent pin. Oops. Now it's more bent. Is there like a way you're supposed to do this? - How? I was definitely supposed to plug in those motors after it was through which would've made this way easier read the instructions. Don't be like me. - Yeah. Actually don't read the instructions. Make sure the first thing you do with every product you own is void the warranty. Yeah. I know people that kept the warranty on their things. They're all dead now. Oh yeah that make it way easier. Yeah, if you look at it, yeah, it would just hold it kind of like I have it right now. Actually, we can still do that. Okay Jono, can you put the foam under it? You, you had it right the first time I think. - No, I think it was this way. There you go. - Yep. Okay that's easy. What are these four bolts for? It's for the filament hold Oh, that's a filament holder. This makes so much sense. I was so confused what this thing was. Yeah. So it goes here or here. I found a pre-production thing Jono. - The screw don't go through. - I think it's safe to say you won't have to do this step. Okay. Maybe safety classes are a good idea Jono. Alright we did it. Alright now we can attach this. I love pre-production things they're always so much more fun. Back to the filament holder though. This little one that they gave us, clearly no problem. Now we have our regular sized role here and that fits pretty much perfectly. Although if you're going for the mega roll It, yeah not so much. I don't really expect it to be able to hold something like this. It weighs about as much as the printer. If you want a big roll, you're gonna have to buy one of the $20 Amazon roll holder things. Hey Jono, can you ask 'em how they do their leveling? They have 49 points of auto leveling, which is awesome. It makes your prints just work so much more of the time. Cause you know, if your bed isn't quite correct then maybe on one side, your first layer doesn't stick. And then it doesn't really work. First layer is kind of all that matters once you get that everything else is good. There's two ways to do auto leveling though. You can either have like a capacitive touch probe which is pretty good, but now a lot of them are using strain gauges, which is even better. Think we're about ready to boot this up though. Is it on? It is. Okay. Let's have a little look at the control that we have here. So if I hit home, where does it go? There I guess. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about having the controller on the Z axis. It is going to be moving but it shouldn't be moving very much while it prints. Level before printing. Turn that on. Oh, nice. So it is using the actual extruder. I'm not quite sure how they're doing it. Okay, we're doing the auto leveling now. I guess just had to heat up first. It takes a little while to do it but I would still just leave it on for every single time that I run a print. It's just cheap insurance. That means it'll work more of the time. Okay, let's see. Cut the end of the filament on a 45 degree angle. Now we're just gonna put it in here, and hopefully and hopefully I was kind of hoping that we could get a print started using what's here and oh, I got it through. Yeah, that's just kind of not great. I had a little bit of try trouble getting the filament to go down to the extruder. All I needed to fix, it was take off this little clip. You can pull this tube out and then look down in and feed the filament down. - Hey. All right? So what am doing is just connecting the 3D printer (Ankermake) with the app. What should we call this? Poopsmouth. - Sure. I was gonna say Printy boy number five. - Oh I like that, that's better. All right, PrettyBoy 5. Cool. We just want to make sure that this has all the latest firmware. That's cool, you can actually have files on your... Smartphone! And we can upload it from there. - You're taking too long. I already have G code on here. - Okay fine. You can control it. - I love that they have their speed as five times even though it's just 250 millimeters per second which by the way, 250 millimeters per second. Very fast. That is awesome. I just find it silly how they did it. So let's, I wonder what this is. Let's just go see what happens. Oh, one thing. Oh yeah. - [Jono] Oooooooo. Satisfying. You have to Auto-Level again? - You don't have to, but I turn on auto leveling every time just cause it makes your prints more consistent. If this just works, I'm gonna be pretty impressed. I have done literally none of the things that you should probably do with 3D printer. Like not even an alcohol wipe, we definitely should have done that, but whatever. If this just goes then fantastic. What do you guys think this is? We're just putting mystery G code into this which I do not recommend, but it's from anchor. So I'm sure it's fine. Okay. Do they do a little extrude thing at the start? Nope. That's really fast for first layer. I'd probably turn it down a bit but I guess it's what it's doing. First layer's almost done, but I am impressed with the speed especially for just outta the box. This is looking promising. Let's come back in about an hour or something. All right. It's the next day, and I have to say, I'm very impressed. This print took two hours and 24 minutes tells you right there. And this is, oh, comes off very easy. I was afraid that would be a bit of a challenge, but it wasn't. This is like, look at this. There's barely any stringing between these guys. There's like a tiny bit but there's just a bunch of super challenging things in here. So like a ramp that just goes up to a 15 degree angle. It gets a little bit weird here but if you ever used a 3D printer before you know that this is not easy to do we've got a bunch of weird little overhangs in here and a whole bunch of little dimensions. So let's check it out. Something like this ramp is challenging because we aren't using support. So that means that it kind of just has to print it and keep on going and have all the layers stick properly so it can do this overhang because it is just going up and up and up. So there's nothing supporting it under, underneath here. Same with these little spires are very difficult because of the filament. You know, it's very easy for even when it stops for a little bit to just keep on coming out. And then when it goes between them you get those little bits of filament in between it. So like if this printer wasn't working very well it would get a whole bunch of stringing in between these. And it would just kind, gonna look like a nest as opposed to a whole bunch of little spires. I think that what this is is it's a cylinder and a hole of different sizes. So this is 0.5. That must is that half a millimeter. You can see it's a cylinder that comes out of the hole. - Yeah. And so this one's 0.3, that one comes out. Okay. For whatever reason, 0.4 comes after 0.3 but sure that one comes out too. They need to figure out how they're doing it. But 0.2 of a millimeter that one's not coming out. Okay. It looks like each of these are 10 millimeter increments. The way that it's printed it's kind of hard to tell exactly how accurate it is. Like I can show it as 10 on here but it might be a little bit off 24.9. I'm sure that was supposed to be 25. Very good. It's off by this much in a lot of cases. - But that's, that's barely off Jono. If you want your stuff off to be within a thousandth of a thousandth of an inch, then - Yeah. Pay 10 times more. There's a number of other cool things that we have here. Jono, do you wanna bring over the app? We have a video feed of your print. Hello myself over the internet. Okay. I guess. Oh, balls. Yep. I broke it. I broke it. Start this one again. Print. - (Jono) Oh, cool. - And it starts. Speed. Boom. Six times. Sure. Save. - 300 millimeters per second. That's to the point where you're going to run into extruder issues, unless you have things really dialed in, like just how fast you can move the plastic out and stop the plastic becomes a problem when you're going that fast. Now there are a lot of things that we don't know about this printer. The biggest big question mark is the slicer. AnkerMake are going to have their own slicer. And it's probably fine. It probably has a great profile for this printer but how good it actually is and how powerful it is, we don't know yet. A slicer is what takes your 3D model, Like say, we had a 3D model of this. It converts it into the 0.4 millimeter or whatever layers going all the way up and turns into the code that the machine runs - It doesn't make coffee unfortunately. You could definitely write G code to make you coffee. I don't know if you could do it in a slicer and the main test I want to do here, once it's done doing a it's auto leveling, is just try and screw with it a bit and see if it can ping Jono's phone when it screws up. Actually we try and screw with it. I'm gonna take a spire and just put it in here. Maybe it'll run it over. Ah, no, it's not good of the way. Darn. We'll just be unkind to it here. Oh, Stop. I'm trying to screw with you. Stop - Okay. Okay I, I know what we can do here. Stop working. - Oh, I could just clip it. I'm sorry Mr. Printer. Will it realize? Yeah, it seems like it still is printing. It's supposed to stop. I wonder if it stops if it detected in here. - Okay. That makes a lot more sense. - Yeah. It does make sense that they would have the filament detection over here. Cause then you would still have plenty of time to, you know, take it out, swap the spool put it back in and not have to worry about your print. Getting all screwed up overall though especially for the price. I'm quite impressed. Right now there's a Kickstarter on where this is 43% off. So that's $430. For that price I think it's a very easy buy at the usual price of $760 still very great. Like this was incredibly easy to set up. It seems to print well, it has lots of features that allow you to easily print from just your phone and stuff. I'm actually impressed. And thank you, AnkerMake for sponsoring this video and also for making a good product 'cause then it's not awkward that you sponsored it. We like honesty here. So hit like get subscribed and if you want more maker type videos, let us know. See you later. Bye.",

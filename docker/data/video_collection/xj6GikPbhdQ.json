    "transcript": "- $10,000 of plastic chips. Ow. Not to mention the $2,500 special box to look at them in. 20 grand worth of mannequins. Looking good, brah. Everyone here seems to want a Mac. Literally thousands of dollars of neodymium magnets. (yells) $9,000 in network gear. A small apartment for some reason? Expensive edition pillow, anyone? (creepy instrumental music) You've undoubtedly heard me mention lttstore.com, but what you might not know is that we've got a dedicated facility with over a dozen staff who work here, which means that this place is an absolute freaking cash sink, which is why I'm extremely grateful to sponsors like Roborock for sending over their S7 MaxV Ultra. This bad boy does dirt, it does mopping, it automatically switches between them and even docks itself. The Ultra model that is, anyway. Empties out its dirty water, empties out its solid waste, refills its water tank. It's freaking amazing. And you know who cleans up every other mess around here? Let's start in customer care. You've got Adam there and I'm filling in for Nolan. These guys care so much about answer your support tickets as fast as possible that they've got 300 hertz displays. Why do you guys need gaming laptops? - [Adam] Uh, reasons. - Of course, you guys didn't tune in to see the stuff we already made. Let's leak some stuff we're working on. An obvious one is socks and sandals. So what you're looking at here is basically every prototype LTT sock that we've ever brought in. The problem is that while many of these are pretty good and some are really good, none of them are as good as my daily drivers from Darn Tough. So until we can match this level of quality, we just aren't going to do it. As for the sandals, the cost of doing the plastic molds for all the different sizes is going to be astronomical so it's a project we keep kind of kicking down the road. Here's why this hoodie was delayed for about a year. See the gradient here? From up close, it looks like absolute dog (beep). By comparison, here's what the final one ended up looking like, it's a much smoother gradient. Ooh, this is cool. I'll be able to give more details later, but in a nutshell, this is a modular acoustic panel system that promises to offer a balance between the cost of DIY and the convenience of like a pre-done commercial kit. Supposed to just kind of snap together and there's going to be all different shapes. But first, fashion. Unfortunately, Bridget, our senior designer, is not in today, but that's okay. Matthew's here, he's actually working on some baseball cap concepts. A lot of what you're gonna see in this corner of the office is gonna be at very, very early stages of development. Ooh, a reversible bomber jacket. Why reversible, you might ask? Because who wouldn't wanna wear an interlocked LTT logo bomber jacket? See, it says LTT over it. That was a Matthew innovation. (zipper zips) There's lots more going on here, too. We've got the super comfy pajama pants. The retro-inspired polar fleece. We've got the tech pants. We've got the 3D down printed jacket thing. This thing is so freaking warm. Swim trunks. Lots more colors of our plaid flannel that have gotten such amazing reviews. And my personal favorite that Matthew is working on right now. Where is it? Ah ha, this one. Oh, yeah! We're doing a track suit. (laughs) This, we've leaked before but we've got a second round of samples of what will be the WAG hoodie. They're not going to be cheap because they're actually built to the same standard as the regular WAN hoodie. But they'll apparently be stylish. We don't have air conditioning in this building yet. They quoted me 100 grand to do this place. It's only 4,000 square feet. So I go back to them, I'm like, \"Hey, why are you quoting ducted AC? \"Why don't you put mini splits?\" And they come back and it's like a quarter. It's madness. What are you working on? Oh, I don't think we're talking about this, right? No, we don't talk about that. Wait, we have a full size run of WAG hoodie? - [Woman] Yeah. - I didn't know we were that close on this. (laughs) - [Matthew] You can put a baby in that. - And finally, we're restocking our classic colors of the LTT underwear. We have ended up switching suppliers for these I think four or five times. Whether it's come down to print quality, factory conditions, supply lead time, I don't know what all the different reasons have been. But it's been really frustrating and we are finally ready to go again with something that meets our standards. So yay. And here is the archive. This is where you'll find one of pretty much everything. So if we ever had to dig up an old garment, some of the samples that we've bought from other companies, just for inspiration and or for competitive testing. For example, this is one of all of our original run of our colored tees. That way we have something to compare against if we get a subsequent order and the color, or the materials, or whatever else is way off. Obviously with such treasures as the last remaining brand new Lambo edition beanies in here, security's a big priority, so massive shout out Ubiquiti. Unparalleled in its quality, the app's amazing, they're all POE so you just have to run a network cable to wherever you go. They have AI detection for people and events, which (snaps fingers) actually ties perfectly into our sponsor. Roborock also uses machine learning for their reactive AI 2.0 obstacle avoidance. They've got cameras throughout and front and they can recognize and avoid up to 27 types of obstacles, so there's no need to pick up hazards off your floor, which is good because our floor is full of lots of hazards, like all of these 40 ounce water bottles and this giant TV. It's got five different suction modes, including up to 5,100 pascal suction so it'll pick up just about anything you throw at it. And their VibraRise mopping system scrubs your floor rather than just vacuuming. This place has a whopping three bathrooms. This bathroom has a toilet right here behind the door. And then, you've got a door out to Engineering on this side. Sup, Engineering. - Welcome, nice haircut. - Thanks, it's a Liao original. - The 90s called, they want their haircut back. - You've got a lot of smart comments for someone who hasn't launched a product in the 18 months he's worked here. - Two years. - (gasps) Here they are. The first, we thought they were golden samples but then we actually found one last problem that is now fixed. (soft instrumental music) Because of community feedback, we will be launching it in both silver and black shaft variants, by the way. And it will be available in orange black and black black color waves. So a little something like that. The reality is, when you wanna not just match but beat respected, experienced tool manufacturers like these guys, it's just an unreal task. We've got the back force. (clicking) Oh, so good, so light. We've got the sound. (clicking) Great. But getting that tactile click on the selector, that's taken some doing. It's the little details that matter, okay? What's he got in here? 3D printed early handle designs. There's gonna be a whole video about this whole thing. Last Taiwan ratchet 'cause we had that whole thing where our supplier for the ratchets got bought by-- - Don't put that in please. - To all the people who think that we supposedly just silk screened our logo onto a Megapro driver, here's a Megapro driver, here's ours. Does that look like the same driver? No, I didn't think so. There's a big difference between licensing someone's patent and putting your logo on their product. Ooh, the network closet. Man, one of the coolest projects we did for the build out here was their air fiber internet connection. They are connected to the main office, which is about 50 paces that way, by a dish that comes into this switch set up right here, also from Ubiquiti, and then it's distributed to the entire building. Have you guys had so much as a hiccup in your internet connectivity? - [Tynan] Yes. - [Kyle] Do you really want me to answer that? One of the SFP connections from the server. - Oh, I mean, other than that one, other than that one. - No, but like, every time those decide to flip an update, we lose internet for five minutes. - Oh, really? - It happens in the middle of the freaking day. - Have you told Jake? I'm sure that can be-- - Yeah. - Oh, yes. (laughs) - If you didn't get software updates, you'd be crying there's no software updates. - Not in the middle of the workday. - I mean, he says he's working, but have they shipped a product yet? - [Kyle] I mean do you want your screwdriver? - (laughs) Not where you wanna put it right now probably. - You hid all your stuff. - [Tynan] Yeah, it's all over there. - Potentially a super open gaming mouse? This is kind of an early concept for what the ergonomics might be like. You can see it's 3D printed. Our intention would be to release all the schematics so you could actually 3D print your own enclosure for it if you really wanted. But with high-end hardware, and we mean high-end, 1,000 hertz polling? - [Man] We'll get there. - We're at like 700 now, right? - We're at 700 over Bluetooth ish and 1,000 over USB. - Still some work to do, but we also wanna make it so that you can easily swap out the switches. It should basically be the last mouse. We can't call it-- - Don't put that in. - Oh, my God. There's been so many revisions of the acoustic panels. - Oh yeah, just a couple. - Good gravy. (clanging) Hexagons. I think that we're pretty settled on this snap together mechanism that you came up with. - Yeah, so it'll clip together and clip apart. You don't need any tools to build it. - Oh, and this is another Tynan project, which is a lot more difficult than you might think, okay? This is so close to launch. Only one small problem. If you wanna launch a children's product, there's all these certifications and stuff that you have to go through. Basically, there's this small parts cylinder test fixture thing, and you have to make sure that nothing fits in there, because that determines whether it's a choking hazard. And then, there's the like the paints and varnishes that you use. But it'll be a while before it sees the light of day. It's not just Kyle. The whole Engineering department actually hasn't launched a product yet. What do you got, Jacob? We do believe this man spent weeks of his life learning the optimal way to position magnets for maximum grab force? - I actually have the simulation up on my computer right now. - Do you really? - Yeah. The geometry is basically rotationally symmetric. You can distill 3-dimensional physics down to 2-dimensional stuff. So here I've got a cross section of the magnet and you can imagine that if we were to take the... (playful instrumental music) - Really was a ton of work that he put into this whole make them as strong as possible thing, but I think it paid off. I mean, not yet 'cause they haven't shipped the product yet but... Do you have anything else going on right now? - We have the joystick lock. - Can you give me an old (beep) prototype that doesn't work very well? - Just about anything. (all laugh) - Basically, we identified a problem, and the problem is that joysticks, like, die. If you're transporting them, they're very likely to end up kind of mashed against something in your bag or whatever else the case may be. So we set out to solve the aforementioned problem with some kind of support mechanism for the joystick to keep it from getting bumped and jostled when it's being moved around. More work stations for when we hire more engineers, which we might do once we (claps) ship some screwdrivers. This is a cool one. I'm really not gonna tell you what this is. No, I'm not gonna tell them what this is. Oh, where's the shoe dryer? - It's in a place in my docket called silicon hell right now. Shout out to any PCB designer that has to redesign their board seven times to release a product because as soon as you design something, it sells out. - Well, it's a battery powered fan that will basically like dry your shoes or dry out your gym bag, and it's just 'cause I wanted one and also because a lot of the engineering work to build it would be applicable to other projects, like RGB doormat or whatever. - Who'd pay someone to build that? - Only an idiot. - Yeah. With a haircut. (all laugh) - Hello, Linus. You need to come upstairs. - Yeah, I'd love to. I just gotta run to the washroom first. Well, don't follow me in here, weirdo. Aside from video calling, the app includes a 3D mapping feature that you can even decorate the furniture like your space, not that (clears throat) this particular space is particularly furnished. - [Sarah] Hello. - Hi, Sarah. What are you working on? - You know, just some secret things. - Can you talk about this yet? - I mean... - Future water bottle design, capacitor-inspired. Oh, and this is a new desk pad. What's the inspiration for this one? - All of these graphs represent some sort of statistics based on our channel. - [Linus] This would be our male to female viewership, right? - (laughs) You know it. And the coolest feature is that the QR code that we have included will take you to our latest uploaded LTT video. - We should definitely have that go to \"Never Gonna Give You Up.\" (laughs) Oh, limited edition golden controller plushie. Is this the one we settled on? - Yes. - Yes. Sarah does all of our sticker pack designs. - Yes. - And this is our new eco-friendly packaging for the 2022 pack, right? - Yep. - And this is 2021. What else you got going on, Sarah? - All our postcards. - Oh, fun. Are these all the ones that have arrived so far? - Yes, we're gonna make a wall of them. So if you get an LTTStore GPU wasteland coloring card, you can send it back to us and then we can add it our wall in the future. - Yeah, you guys should totally do it. We've gotten some, wow, some of these are amazing. - They're so cute. - Look at this one. How fun is that? - It warms my heart every day that I receive them. - I love it. This is Nick and Natalie's office. They are both out of office today. Nick's got a prototype desk pad though. This one will never see the light of day 'cause I didn't like the pixelated LTT logo, but it's kinda cool, right? I don't even fully understand what this room is. I see packaging mock-ups. Hey, Sarah, do you have that super cool shoelaces package? Here's our packaging for our shoelaces. Wait, what's this called again? The (snaps fingers) nep, color nep. (laughs) Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have a gray version of this T-shirt that's also got the little color flecks in it and the drawstrings. We're gonna have matching shoelaces and they're gonna come in a little power supply box. How cute is that? And then, they'll stick out like this. What else is going on in here? Our attempts at coffee mugs. Eh, never found anything. Whoa, bananas for scale. Various versions of a potential WAN toque or beanie. The ill-fated coasters. Yeah, these were super cool. Too bad they all broke in shipping. (coaster shatters) A GPU pillow with RGB. Ooh, this is fun. These won't be launched by the time this video comes out, but they'll be very close. That's right, 64 ounce versions of our circuit board water bottles. Now we get to the really weird part of the tour. The people that we bought this unit from managed to get the permit for the caretaker suite, so they were actually living upstairs. The layout was super weird. We had to go all the way around Engineering, all the way back up through Fashion, and all the way up to get to that side. So we decided to open it up and this is now the employee lunch room. We've got a washer and a dryer, which it wouldn't surprise me to find things inside. Yep. This is our color block hoodie. And one of the big challenges that we ran into with this one was that the bold colors were bleeding onto the light colors in the wash. So this is a new sample that's treated in a way that will not allow that to happen. And as you can see, see any color bleed? Yeah, you don't. One nice thing that the previous owners did, there's like 60 Ethernet jacks in this 4,000 square foot place. There should be plenty of network connectivity. Look at the size of this room. Okay, this is a Linus for scale. How could I possibly hope to cram four people in here, unless I start stacking them? Lloyd, you moved your desk. I went over there and I was like, \"Lloyd still works here, right?\" Sarah's like, \"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\" (laughs) What's the deal? - It was too hot. - All right, well, I'll just move to where the air conditioning is. Okay, that makes sense. - Well, no one's using it. - Well, what do you-- - [Adam] He says, wearing a sweater. - What is happening? (laughs) What are you working on right now, Lloyd? What can we leak to the people? - Like, just like trying things out. - Okay. Anything else to show the people? Come on, it's the people. - Uh... - Yeah, we're thinking of doing like a laser cut wooden bookmark. These ones are a little on the thick side still and we unfortunately cut them out going the wrong way with the grain. (wood snaps) So they like snap in half, which is not a desirable quality, but we're working on it. It's early stages. This is gonna be a little light, it's like a soft silicone kind of a lamp. So it's gonna look kind of like that, and then it will be opaque all around it and the screen will glow whatever color you want. And it's probably not watching you. (laughs) - Yeah, no camera, no camera. - Here's the front stairs, which you haven't even seen yet. These are a real time saver. This one's not particularly fancy. This is from like two or three years ago and it's got detachable arms, just in case you're into that sort of thing. But we have some custom models coming that are like five grand a pop, and why? - Basically it's custom size, so it can fit to our standard medium size. - So it's our like nerdy, techie medium size. - Yeah, plus we can't really put pants on it too well. - Well, we tried. - Yeah, we had to take off the entire base. - We put a solid effort into putting... - [Man On Left] Yeah. - I gotta say, the pajama pants, which is what we have on here, kind of flattering actually. - He a thicc boi. - As for the color viewing room, I wasn't kidding about the cost. $10,000 for these plastic chips. I already talked about that. This is (groans) has five different lighting modes. So you've got daylight, store light, because that's where people make a purchasing decision when they're not shopping online like, you know, modern people. Home light and UV light. 2,500 bucks for that. Oh, and it gets even better. This group of booklets, so these are cotton chips. How much were these? - [Man] 2,700 for all three books. - Ow. We don't actually know how much these bros books cost because we got them from a supplier. And you also need the paper ones. The best part of these ones is you're supposed to replace them I think every 18 months? And they're like a few hundred bucks every single time. Why do we have so many of these? Oh, they're all different. Fashion home plus, formula guy, solid coated. I mean, for real though, it matters. If I show this to you, you would say what color is it? - Black. - Okay. If I show this to you, what color is it? - [Man] Black. - Okay, hmm. Are these the same color? - [Man] No. - No. (yells) I'm sorry, what is this thing? I just glossed over this. - So this, put your fabric here and it'll cut this exact diameter of a circle. - Yeah. - And then, you would weigh that onto the scales, then you convert to-- - Right. - Grams per square meter, and that's how we determine the weight of our fabrics. - And it's really important that we validate this stuff ourselves because we've had suppliers lie to us about everything from the weight of the fabric, to the colors that they use, to the treatment that they apply, to even the composition of the fabric. - And then, we also have like some instances where the screen printer had like burn issues. So then, we had to double-check the composition to make sure it was poly-cotton and not something else mixed in there. - Speaking of burning fabric, we've got a behind-the-scenes over on Floatplane where I accidentally set our props on fire not once, but twice. I've been informed that this bathroom has some special equipment in it. Oh, I see. A fancy steamer. - [Man] Commercial grade. - Now, really, this is a commercial grade steamer? What did this cost you? - [Man] That's what the website said. 275. - Oh, well that's pretty cheap, especially when you compare it to all the like lab tests that we do. Every time we notice something could be a problem or we have a manufacturer make a marketing claim to us, like for example, the 3D down jacket, the manufacturer was making some pretty bold claims about the waterproof-ness of the materials. So we went, \"Oh, I mean, \"we could take your word for it, but...\" I am so excited for this one. We're targeting fall, right? - [Man] It's a jacket, so hopefully. - Yeah, you say that, but... It's not going to be cheap but it's like really nice. Here's the shoelaces I was talking about earlier. This is part of our RGB line so that's why it has an RGB thing inside where the tags attach. I don't know what this part's called. Does this have a name? Neck binding, thanks. That's a less cool name than I was hoping for. Oh, right, right. I was gonna show you the shoelace. You could have matching shoelaces and drawstring, if you wanna look, what is it, on fleek? Do the kids say \"on fleek\" still? I'm hearing a lot of no. And I'm hearing a lot of opportunity to bring things back around to Roborock, our sponsor. These puppies have been saving us from ourselves. One of our staffers was snacking on the, like chips and these have been doing a great job of patrolling these halls and making sure to pick up all those little bits, whether it's solids, whether it's liquids, whether it's somewhere in between, the S7 MaxV Ultra, of course with the dock that automatically empties and refills the liquids and all that (whirring) has been doing a fantastic job for us. And you can pick up yours at the link down below. Use our code, LTTS7MAXV to get 4% off from July 12th to 18th, 2022, in addition to any other discounts that Roborock is offering. If you guys enjoyed this video, maybe you'll enjoy the tour of the other new space that is soon to be the LTT Lab.",

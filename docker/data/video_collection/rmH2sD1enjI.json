    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and I'm here with Ro. - Hello! - Today we are going to do a blindfold wreath decorating. We have done some blindfolded things in the past and one of my favorite videos 'til today is we decorated a Christmas tree. - Yes! (Rosanne laughs) - All right, I'm gonna put this around the tree. - Okay. - Justine, you got me! (Rosanne laughs) Justine, wait! (Rosanne laughs) This is not the Christmas tree-- - Not that one. - We decorated. This is a new one, but that one was pretty epic. We decorated it blindfolded. - She was wrapped up in lights, stuck in a tree. But I'll tell you what? I thought, okay, let's do something like that but maybe on a smaller scale. I've never decorated a wreath before, have you? - Same, no never. - Cool! - Never. - We have some mystery items. So I don't know what is in the mystery bag-- - Oh no! - for us to decorate. - Oh no! - And we also are gonna decorate again blindfolded. - No! Really? - Yes! So before, like I knew all the stuff that we had and we saw it ahead of time. This time we don't even know what it is. - I've never decorated a wreath before. I just bought 'em as a wreath. - Me too. - But I've decorated a three before, so I kinda had some understanding of what to do. I don't know what to do with thing. - I don't know either. - You just attach stuff to it, huh? - I'm assuming, depending upon the stuff that we have. - Is there a top or a bottom? Or is it just all solid, you can just hang it from wherever? - I think you can just hang it from wherever. - Yeah, it looks like that, okay-- - You just kinda like put it on the wall-- - There's not like a top of the Christmas tree. So I can't really mess something up in that regard. - We're gonna find out. (Rosanne sighs) So I guess, let's put out blindfolds on. And, Mike, would you be so kind as to brin in our items? - [Mike] Oh, I got some-- - Mike! What did you get for us? - Michael! Did you go to Michaels? I hear somethings being sat down. - [Mike] I'll just kind dump it out here. - Okay. Mike, Mike-- - Oh my gosh! - Cool, well it's piled up here. Let me-- - Do you think we're gonna need scissors? - Mike, I'm feel-- - You might need a lot of stuff. - I'm feeling a bag here and I don't know how to open it. - We gotta figure it out, I guess. Oh my gosh, there's so-- - All right, well good luck! - Okay thanks. Is this timed, or do we just go? - I think we just go until we feel like we're sick of doing it. (Justine laughs) - Okay, I'm gonna open this bag. - Okay. (Rosanne gasps) - Ooh! - So be very careful. - Justine, come here, gimme your hand. I think these are fuzzy pipe cleaners. Feel 'em. - Oh! Oh, we're definitely gettin'. Oh, there's a lot of them. Okay, let me take a few out, since you're holding the bag. - This is nice! They're a little pokey at the end, 'cause of like the wire. (Justine cheers) - What in the world is this? - What are you holding , let me feel it? - Feel, it's big! It feels like a Christmas ornament. But like, why is it so freaking big? - This has holes. - Okay I'm gonna put this on my tree. - Whoa! - What's happening over there? - I don't know, I'm trying to feel what this is. I think it's like, feel, there's holes in that. - Where's your hand? - I'm over here. - Okay, wait. - What is this? (soft holiday music) - Oh, that's-- - What is it? - I don't know. It feels like a hamster ball. - Ooh a what? Ow! (Justine laughs) I got pine coned, it just poked me. - Oh yeah, be careful, I keep getting poked with things. - [Justine And Rosanne] So what else do we have? - Oh, this is like a bow. And there's-- - Oh I-- - This empty. - I think I know what this is. - This is a ball. - Some sort of Christmas lights, because I feel the pack. - [Rosanne] We're just gonna stick this in-- - Oh no-- - here. - Is this on or off? Is it a light? - What do you have? - It's gotta be a light. - What! Oh of course you found the techy thing. - Yes! - What, you got the lights? - I wonder if there's-- - Is this a light? - I don't know, but-- - There's no on switch. I don't feel an on switch. - Switch, flip it over. - Oh, I feel one in the back. - But I don't know which is on or off. - If you hold it up really close to. Can you-- - It's not making a sound. - No, it doesn't make any music. (soft holiday music) - Oh okay! (Justine laughs) I saw some light. - Is it on? - I don't know now. - Oh shoot, let me try it again. - Okay. (device clicks) (soft holiday music) Wait-- - That's on. I didn't touch it now. - Okay wait, it's blinking. - It's blinking? - Yeah. - Oh, you know what, there must me multiple setting. What the heck is this? - Well, I think this might be like a big light bulb. Because it all seems like it's one thing. - Oh my gosh, this is really, wait. - Was this a bad idea? - What is this, a cane? Why would, what is, and it feels glittery. I think it's a candy cane. It's like, but it's jumbo. - I wanna feel it, but I'm doing something right now. And if I move my fingers, I may lose-- - Maybe I can tack it on here. - Okay, pipe cleaners, its honestly amazing that you found those. - Okay, I'm gonna attach these. - It's the only way I can get stuff to stick on here. - Okay, I can do this, I can do this. This reminds me of middle school crafting time. - Oh my goodness, I was always really bad at it. - Okay, gotta feel my wreath here. - How much stuff's here? - What is it hitting? Because I'm going for-- - what is that? - That's me! Justine! (Justine laughs) That's my head. - It felt so soft. - You 'ca put me in your wreath. - It was so soft, I was like what's this? Is it something I can put in here? - Yeah, you 'ca put me in there. - I've never decorated a wreath before. So I'm not really sure what the dedicate is. - You know what, I was really hoping to take a wreath decorating class. - You're taking one now! - Maybe this is a little advanced. - Yeah this, why is my wreath so heavy now? What is this? - Oh, soft! You jam it. (Rosanne hammers) (Justine gasps) - Are these more lights? (Justine gasps) - How come you keep finding all the lights? I don't have any lights. - Feel! - Maybe I wanna be lit. (Justine and Rosanne laugh) Oh! - They feel like lights. - I'm taking one. - Okay. - I'm taking one, and I'm gonna wrap it around here. - I'm gonna take one as well. - Are you gonna trip out if we open our eyes and we've created the best looking wreathes anyone's ever seen? - I have very low hopes. (Rosanne laughs) See, I like to set my expectations super-low. So right now, it's really low. So maybe we'll be surprised. What is this? (Rosanne laughs) What is this? - Justine, I'm gonna make a masterpiece. So you just be ready! - Ow! - Oh my gosh, my leg is stuck. I'm so sorry. - I don't like that! - Okay, I'm tryna get-- - Itchy! - some leverage, tryna get-- - Oh! - I've got a couple a long. I'm stinging them together like Rapunzel hair or somethin'. - I keep getting pinched. - Holiday decorations are very pokey. Like Christmas trees, and ornaments, and everything. Pine cones, they're all pokey. Why do people make 'em pokey? They should all be soft. - So I can t see, but I think that this may be the blindfold that I was missing earlier. - Wait, really? - Yeah, here, touch it. - Let me see, let me see. - That's definitely the blindfold. - Ugh! - This is definitely a bow. - This is not long enough. Oh that's a bow. - That's a bow. - That's a humongous bow. That's like a bow that you stick on a new car. And you're like, \"Surprise!\" And it has the big, big, big bow on it. - Maybe I'll put this on my Cybertruck. - I am so excited for your Cybertruck! Like-- - It's just crazy you have to wait so long for it. - Out of my, how long do you have to wait? - Like 2021! - 20? - Yeah. - Oh wow, that is a while. - No no one's gonna want it. - Yeah, I might have Rivian before that. - The Rivian is so nice! Like honestly, I don't even think the Cybertruck looks that good. - Yeah, so people are saying, they're being big haters on the Cybertruck. A little stupid, but I'm like, \"It's really awesome you guys.\" - It's definitely something. I keep getting pinched. - I don't know what it's gonna look like-- - What are the chances we're bleeding? (Justine and Rosanne laugh) - Probably 100%. - Mike, is there any blood? Do you see any blood anywhere? - [Mike] I don't see any blood yet. - Okay, we're doing great then. 'Cause I feel really pinched up. - Okay, I'm gonna, I'm tryna weave this through. I think I'm a little bit, my wreath's caught on your wreath a little bit, but... - What did you find? - Wait, what's in my lap? What's happening? Oh my gosh, what is this? - Did we use everything? - I thought I stuck it, feel this. I thought I stuck this in my wreath, but apparently not. Where'd I start? - What is that? Feels like a magnet or something. - Found it! - Oh, it stinks, do not eat that! - Okay, this is the decoration one. I'm gonna make a great holiday wreath, and I'm gonna hang it from my-- - Chimney with care? - Your door! No that's not right. - What are you supposed to hang from your chimney with care? - That's not the poem, that's not the poem. Where do you put your wreath? On your door, right? - I don't think it has a song. - Windows, I'd put 'em on the windows on the inside of the house too. If you need a pipe cleaner, I've got a ton of 'em over here. - I'm pretty satisfied with my amount. - What do yah got? - Oh, I think that's already attached. - You got any presents for me? - Yeah, you can have this wreath. - Okay, this entire video is me stringing pipe cleaners together, and looping them around my wreath. Okay, now what do I do? Now I've got a candy cane, some lights. I've got some lights on here. - I think that I'm done, because I-- - I think I did, oh gosh. Oh gosh, wait, wait, is that it? I don't know what it is dangling in them middle of my wreath. (Justina taps) - How do you feel? Do you think yours is done? - I think I've gotten everything. - Okay, ready? - I'm scared, 'cause I'm sentimental, and I might actually like hang up what we made. (Justine and Rosanne laugh) - Three, two, one! (soft holiday music) - Oh my! - I have so much stuff on my freaking wreath. (Rosanne laughs) - Holiday craft, just a whole spew of it. This is not even, where's the wreath? I'm just seeing a... We have to hang, we have to show these. - Oh, oh my gosh! So wait, this looks like, I have squirrels in my backyard and they nest. And this looks like a squirrel nest. They just find everything that they can. - Oh, it's a bell! - Oh, it is. But it's like an ornament. - It's a bell! - Mines an ornament too! - So what, I don't even know how that got in there. Oh wow! Oh, ours are connected. - Oh, and those-- - I thought you were giving me my own lights. - Those aren't even lights. (Rosanne laughs) - Okay well this definitely was. Oh those were pine cones, I thought these were big like light bulbs. - What! - What in the heck is this! - What do they do? - There's little like disco balls. - You have disco balls. You have like some-- - Oh my gosh, okay. - Some cool ribbon. - I need to hold this up. - Wow! - Because these are all of the things that-- - Okay, so our wreaths are connected. I thought these were lights, and I thought I had my own lights. Wait, did you actually have lights, though? I felt a battery pack. - Wait, there are more lights. (Rosanne gasps) - Oh my gosh, look, this is so cute! I miss it. Look, it's a donut! - Yeah, do you know why? Because I think that I set all of my wreath on top of all of the items. - I'm gonna put this in here. This is so cute, are you kidding me? They would go really well on like a double door, yeah. - There's antlers. What else is on here? I feel like I just had everything, and I stuck it on my wreath. - This is happy, sweet. We have the donut, we have the candy cane. So mine wreath is happy sweet jingle balls Christmas. This ribbon is everything though! Oh my God, there are little snowmen on here. - This is really ridiculous. - That was crazy! - Do you wanna hang this up? - That yeah, I will, I will hang that up. Don't even tease me, I will do it. - It'll look so great! - We can hang 'em right back here! Check this out. - Happy holiday! - Happy holidays everybody! (soft holiday music) - Oh boy! - Oh wow! Oh wow! - So that's something we did? - Part four, part four! (Rosanne laughs) Oh my gosh, what's your theme? - A freaking squirrel nest. (Justine and Rosanne laugh) This is like a hoarder's holiday. - Well, let me give you these. It's a bag of pine cones. These fell on the ground, so we didn't even see these. - I feel those-- - Well I guess feel these. We didn't feel these. - Oh, I felt them. - Oh, you did? - They were pinching me. - You tossed them. - Oh they have a smell! (Rosanne gasps) - There's lights over there? - Smell. (soft holiday music) - They smell like cinnamon yummy. - I'm feeling super-festive now. And I just don't even know how to contain my holiday excitement. (Justine laughs) - You can keep these here with me. - Okay. Well, we also made a video on Ro's channel where we decorated a massive gingerbread house. Like this is a mansion. - It's a Frankenstein gingerbread creation. I wanted to combine all the gingerbread houses I could find into one, and we did it. - We did, so go check that out I'll put a link in the description and an annotation. So make sure you guys go check it out. Be sure to go say, \"Hi,\" to Ro, and subscribe to her channel. I think that's it. - Wow! - Wow! - Do you like a cozy squirrel's next vibe, or a a sweet jingle bells vibe? - Let us know in the comments. - Let us know! - We'll see later! - Bye! - Bye!

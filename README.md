# PRI - Project 1

## Instructions

The `makefile` available on the project's folder has everything you need to run solr, as well as evaluating retrieval for system 1 and 2.

### Starting the Container

Within the project's folder, create/start the container by doing:

```bash
make up
```

### System 1 

To run system 1, all you have to do is populate the schema:

```bash
make populate
```

### System 2

To update the default Solr configuration files (such as synonyms, and stop words), run:

```bash
make update_configs
```

If you run it after creating the core, call this command to reload it:

```bash
make reload_core
```

To run system 2, upload the schema:

```bash
make schema
```

And populate the database:

```bash
make populate
```

### System 2 With Hybrid Search

### Copying the files to the container

To update the default Solr configuration files (such as synonyms, and stop words), run:

```bash
make update_configs
```
To add semantic search vectors to the db, do:

```bash
make get_embeddings
```

If you run it after creating the core, call this command to reload it:

```bash
make reload_core
```

To run system 2, upload the schema:

```bash
make schema
```

And populate the database **WITH** the semantic search vectors:

```bash
make populate_semantic
```

### Evaluating the system

Firstly, install trec_eval, if you haven't already done so, with:

```bash
make trec_eval
```

Then, run the evaluation pipeline for the desired configuration with:

```bash
make sys1
```

or

```bash
make sys2
```

or, to include the hybrid search:

```bash
make sys2_semantic
```

### Stopping the container

To stop the container, just run:

```bash
make down
```

## Comments
With system one, its intended a basic configuration, meaning no query configuration (with field boosts e.t.c), and using
Solr's default schema, for the collection. Therefore, jump running `make schema` straight to `make populate`.
